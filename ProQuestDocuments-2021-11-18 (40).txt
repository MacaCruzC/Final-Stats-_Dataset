Texto completo: A Texas judge ruled that Alex Jones must pay $100,000 to Neil Heslin, the parent of a 6-year-old who was murdered during the Sandy Hook school shooting in 2012.
Travis County District Court Judge Scott Jenkins ordered Jones, 45, to pay Heslin $65,825 in "contempt of court" fees because Jenkins said the InfoWars founder purposely delayed an October court mandate to present witnesses and documents to Heslin. Jenkins also instructed Jones to pay $34,323 in Heslin's legal fees.
“In disobeying court orders, Mr. Jones has shown how desperate he is to ensure nobody finds out how Infowars really operates, or the lengths the company went to carry out its five-year campaign of malicious harassment against these parents,” wrote Heslin's lawyer in an email to the New York Times.
Six families who lost children during the attack sued Jones for defamation in 2018. The complaint accused Jones of "substantially benefiting" from claiming that the parents of children who died in the attack were actors.
Jones, a noted conspiracy theorist who built his Austin-based show into a syndicated program airing on terrestrial radio stations across the country, peddled falsehoods in the wake of the massacre that killed 20 children and six staff members at the school in Newtown, Connecticut.
During a court-ordered deposition in March 2019, Jones claimed he experienced "psychosis" when he made the remarks.

Texto completo: After months of legal wrangling over the use of handwriting experts to determine who wrote an anonymous December 2000 note to police alerting them to a body inside a Benedict Canyon home, an attorney for millionaire New York real estate scion Robert Durst now admits his client wrote the message.
Durst, 76, is accused of killing his friend and confidante Susan Berman, 55, inside her Benedict Canyon home, allegedly because she was prepared to speak to New York investigators about the never-solved disappearance of Durst’s wife in 1982.
A key piece of evidence in the case is a so-called “cadaver note” that was mailed to Beverly Hills police and postmarked a day before Berman’s body was discovered. The note simply contained the word “cadaver” and Berman’s address.
In a court document filed Dec. 24 and first obtained by the New York Times, a defense attorney concedes that Durst wrote the letter, writing that “the defense has made a strategic decision to stipulate to this evidence.”
Despite acknowledging that Durst wrote the letter, his attorney continued to insist that his client did not kill Berman and does not know who did.
“The filing speaks for itself,” Durst attorney Dick DeGuerin told the New York Daily News Tuesday. “There are stipulations we’ve arrived at to simplify the trial.”
DeGuerin insisted that he had never publicly admitted or denied that Durst wrote the note.
Durst’s defense team filed a motion earlier this year seeking to exclude handwriting and handprinting evidence aimed at determining who penned the note. Prosecutors then filed a motion arguing that such evidence be admitted at trial.
Durst has been behind bars since March 14, 2015. He was taken into custody in a New Orleans hotel room hours before the airing of the final episode of HBO’s documentary series “The Jinx: The Life and Deaths of Robert Durst,” which examined the 1982 disappearance of his first wife, Kathie, along with the killings of Berman and his Texas neighbor Morris Black.
Durst went on trial for Black’s death and dismemberment after a nationwide manhunt in which he was located in Pennsylvania, but a jury acquitted him of murder after agreeing with Durst’s contention that he had killed his neighbor in self-defense.
In the finale of HBO’s “The Jinx,” Durst is caught on microphone muttering to himself, “Killed them all, of course,” and “There it is, you’re caught.”
Deputy District Attorney John Lewin argued last year that Durst was “responsible” for his wife’s death in 1982 and got Berman to help him cover his tracks — in part by having her pretend to be his wife in a telephone call to the dean of the New York medical school his wife was attending at the time of her disappearance. The prosecutor contends Durst killed Berman because he was “afraid she was going to talk.”
Durst has been long estranged from his real estate-rich family, which is known for ownership of a series of New York City skyscrapers — including an investment in the World Trade Center. He split with the family when his younger brother was placed in charge of the family business, leading to a drawn-out legal battle.
According to various media reports, Durst ultimately reached a settlement under which the family paid him $60 million to $65 million.

Texto completo: On the night Corey Ballentine was drafted by the Giants, his college teammate and buddy was killed in a shooting. But Ballentine, who was wounded in the incident, has persevered.
The New York Times Sports department is revisiting the subjects of some compelling articles from the last year or so. Here is our June report on a deadly incident that followed the N.F.L. draft .
When the difficult moments come, and there have been a number of them over the past eight months, Corey Ballentine often finds inspiration in remembering his best friend, Dwane Simmons.
The two were defensive backs and inseparable teammates at Washburn University in Topeka, Kan., until the April night when Simmons was cut down in a hail of gunfire. The shooting happened only hours after Ballentine was drafted by the New York Giants, and it was as if Ballentine had lost a twin brother.
During their four years in college, Simmons had always been there for Ballentine. He had an infectious sense of humor that popped up everywhere -- on the playing field, in the apartment they shared -- and he would put the joking aside to encourage Ballentine to persevere through tough practices and classes.
Then came the shooting. A few months later, Ballentine was in class again, but this time at the Giants' training facility in New Jersey as he tried to figure out how to hold his own as a rookie in the N.F.L.
And even if Ballentine could no longer call his friend to talk it through, as they had done so often in college, Simmons's photo was right there on Ballentine's smartphone as the wallpaper every time he turned it on.
"I think about things he would say to me when we went through tough times," Ballentine said in a recent telephone interview. "Certain things remind me of him, and I'm like, wow, he really did have a positive influence on my life and made me happy. It gives me inspiration to keep moving forward."
Ballentine was wounded in the April 28 shooting, which occurred just a few blocks from Washburn's campus. He and Simmons, who were 23 at the time, had been out with other teammates celebrating Ballentine's selection by the Giants in the sixth round of the N.F.L. draft. They had just left a school party with athletes from other teams when a group of men rolled up in a car.
The police and witness accounts said the athletes told the men to move on. The car lurched forward, then stopped, and dozens of shots rang out, apparently from someone inside the car.
Ballentine was struck in the backside, and after surgery and weeks of rehabilitation, he recovered in time to make the Giants' roster -- a notable accomplishment for a draft pick from a Division II college. Simmons was struck in the head and died.
For weeks no arrests were made, but it turned out the Topeka police had a suspect in custody. Francisco Alejandro Mendez, 18, had been arrested on May 1, three days after the shooting, accused of committing a series of aggravated robberies. Weeks later, Mendez was charged with the first-degree murder of Simmons and the attempted murder of Ballentine. He is awaiting trial in February.
In September, Ballentine was called to testify at a preliminary hearing in the case a day after he played in his first regular-season game, at Dallas. He returned two kicks and participated in nine defensive snaps that day, then flew to Topeka, accompanied by David Tyree, a former Giants wide receiver who is now the team's director of player development.
The hearing jolted Ballentine. Simmons's family was in the courtroom, as was Mendez.
"It was very difficult," Ballentine said of seeing the man accused of the shooting and "all the photos that I had to identify." He continued: "It was really hard, man. And seeing Dwane's family; the pain and sorrow I felt for them. There's nothing I could do to make it better."
Shaken, but determined to fulfill the dream that both he and Simmons shared, Ballentine returned to New York to resume the start of his career. As the season progressed, he showed enough talent and resolve to go from a special-teams player to a regular fifth defensive back, covering slot receivers, one of the most difficult jobs on the field. By Week 9, in a second engagement with the Cowboys, Ballentine was given regular defensive assignments.
From that point forward, he has played in at least two-thirds of the Giants' defensive snaps in all but one game in which he has participated. Ballentine said the transition from Division II to the N.F.L. has required a significant leap on his part, but his coaches have noticed that he rarely makes the same mistake twice.
Even when Ballentine struggled for a stretch, the Giants retained their faith in him, as did Craig Schurig, Ballentine's coach at Washburn. Schurig watched as many of Ballentine's Giants games as he could this season. But he was also busy with his team and with efforts to increase safety and awareness in Topeka after the shooting.
"In the wake of what happened, the city of Topeka has really rallied around us," Schurig said. "It has really kick-started an effort in the community to get some things cleaned up. It got some movement in the right direction."
School administrators have also established a Dwane Simmons scholarship that will provide tuition assistance for up to 10 future students. And on Dec. 14, Navarro Simmons and Chaquilla Williams, Dwane's parents, accepted his diploma at Washburn's winter commencement ceremony.
"It was a good day," Schurig said, "and the good days are hard to come by."
During the season, several Washburn players who were close with Simmons and Ballentine honored Simmons by wearing his No. 17 jersey in games. But no one wore it on seniors day, and Simmons's locker has remained untouched, serving as a memorial.
Schurig said that Simmons worked hard on the football field and in class and that the example he set would endure at the school. As it will for his best friend.
"I'm carrying him with me in spirit," Ballentine said. "I know he's always with me."

Texto completo: Op-ed columnists are supposed to stake out provocative points of view to stimulate discussion among readers about the issues of the day.
By that measure, Bret Stephens of the New York Times has been doing just great.
The Pulitzer Prize-winning opinion writer has embroiled himself in a series of controversies that have burned like wildfire on social media, including one this weekend over a column lauding 'Jewish brilliance.'
There was, for example, the 'bedbugs' flap in August, wherein Stephens challenged a college professor's joke about him on Twitter. The professor then posted the angry letter Stephens wrote to his boss, leading to an explosion of news coverage about Stephens's thin-skinned reaction. There was also Stephens's first column for the Times in 2017, which questioned some of the science behind climate change. That one went over so well that Times publisher Arthur Sulzberger Jr. wrote a personal appeal to readers who canceled their subscriptions.
The latest Stephens storm involves a column the Times published Friday in which he lauded a long tradition of Jewish contributions to the arts, sciences and ideas. Citing Albert Einstein, Benjamin Disraeli and Franz Kafka, among others, Stephens asked, 'How is it that a people who never amounted even to one-third of 1-percent of the world's population contributed so seminally to so many of its most pathbreaking ideas and innovations?'
The column might have been little more than a nice Hanukkah gift except for one thing: To bolster his argument about 'the secrets of Jewish genius' (as the headline put it), Stephens, who is Jewish, cited and linked to a 2005 study that argued in favor of a genetic hypothesis for the allegedly superior intelligence of Ashkenazi Jews (those who settled in central and Eastern Europe). The study was co-authored by Henry Harpending, a far-right ideologue and advocate of discredited ideas about racial superiority. Harpending has been labeled a white nationalist by the Southern Poverty Law Center.
An overwhelmingly negative reaction to the column built on social media over the weekend, prompting the Times to affix an editor's note to it Sunday.
'After publication Mr. Stephens and his editors learned that one of the paper's authors, who died in 2016, promoted racist views,' the note read. 'Mr. Stephens was not endorsing the study or its authors' views, but it was a mistake to cite it uncritically. The effect was to leave an impression with many readers that Mr. Stephens was arguing that Jews are genetically superior. That was not his intent. . . . We have removed reference to the study from the column.'
Adding such extensive notes in post-publication editing is rare, especially in opinion columns.
Stephens did not respond to a request for comment. Nor did Times editorial-page editor James Bennet.
Stephens joined the Times in 2017 from the Wall Street Journal, where he won the Pulitzer for commentary in 2013 'for his incisive columns on American foreign policy and domestic politics, often enlivened by a contrarian twist,' as his Pulitzer citation put it.
He is a conservative writer, but he has often criticized President Trump and feuded with his supporters, including Fox News host Sean Hannity, whom Stephens criticized as a conspiracy-monger in a 2017 column. Hannity, in turn, went after Stephens for quitting Twitter after the columnist received an avalanche of criticism from Trump supporters over the 'bedbugs' episode earlier this year.
Dave Karpf, the George Washington University media and public affairs professor who drew Stephens's ire for comparing Stephens to bedbugs, said Stephens's latest column was 'lazy' on several levels. The notion that Jews have special intelligence was itself 'saccharine' and could be easily misinterpreted in dangerous ways, he said. But Karpf said Stephens's research appears to have consisted of little more than a Google search that turned up a document co-authored by a white supremacist, a fact that neither Stephens nor his editors were aware of.
'I have to imagine anyone else would get fired for this,' Karpf said, adding, 'If they fired Bret Stephens, it might open a slot for a conservative who would do a better job and try harder than he does.'

The 235 days that rattled China and shook the world op-ed

Texto completo: They were 235 days that shook the world, rattled China's regime and refuted the most pernicious wishful thinking since the appeasement of dictators collapsed eight decades ago. Nothing more momentous happened in 2019 than Hong Kong's heroic insurrection.
It began with the April 3 introduction by Beijing's Hong Kong satraps of an extradition bill that would have facilitated the sweeping of inconvenient people into the mainland's suppression machinery that is both Kafkaesque and Orwellian. The convulsions culminated in, but did not end with, Nov. 24's cymbal-crash elections in which the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), which had counted on the island city's majority to rebuke the demonstrators, learned the limits of its sterile program of purchasing subservience by promising prosperity.
Elsewhere on China's periphery, Taiwan has a presidential election in less than two weeks. China's President Xi Jinping began 2019 with a Jan. 2 speech identifying Taiwan as the focus of his campaign to make China great again. If - when, probably - on Jan. 11, 2020, Taiwan reelects President Tsai Ing-wen, the Taiwanese will have joined Hong Kongers in disdaining the "one country, two systems" fudge as a formula for the incremental suffocation of freedom.
Thirty autumns ago, as the Berlin Wall crumbled and the Soviet Union teetered, approximately 1.5 billion people lived under communist regimes. Today, approximately 1.5 billion people still do. The 1989 figure was 29 percent of the world's population compared with 20 percent in 2019, but 89 percent of today's 20 percent are caught in the tightening vise of China's Leninism, whose inviolable tenet is that nothing shall challenge the party's supremacy.
With this year's revelations about the million, or perhaps millions, swept into the gulag archipelago in northwestern China, it is possible to hope that in 2020 we will hear less from American businessmen who are as obtuse as they are cocksure. Just 51 days before The New York Times published more than 400 pages of documents on China's concentration camps, presidential aspirant Michael Bloomberg said the CCP's leaders "listen to the public," and "Xi Jinping is not a dictator."
Not content to just "listen to" the public, the CCP, using ever-more-sophisticated technology, surveils almost everything done by almost everyone. Perhaps 2019 foreshadowed the day when today's Bloombergs will be remembered as Charles Lindbergh and others are remembered because they thought dictators in the 1930s were "the wave of the future."
Would that America's serial grovelers had the gumption of the creators of "South Park." When China, a supposedly great power that was actually discombobulated by this animated TV series, banned it, the creators said: "We welcome the Chinese censors into our homes and into our hearts. ... Xi doesn't look just like Winnie the Pooh at all. ... Long live the Great Communist Party of China! May this autumn's sorghum harvest be bountiful! We good now China?"
"We have to stand with Hong Kong, but I'm also standing with President Xi," said America's president, who also said of Xi: "He's a friend of mine." Xi should reciprocate friendly feelings because Donald Trump's biggest blunder, made three days after his inauguration, was jettisoning the Trans-Pacific Partnership, thereby unraveling a 12-nation fabric of commercial cooperation that excluded China.
Two other Trump chums are Russia's Vladimir Putin and Turkey's Recep Tayyip Erdogan. The former continued his incremental dismemberment of Europe's geographically largest nation, Ukraine, and the latter took Trump's warning against attacking the Kurds as seriously as Trump meant it.
North Korea's Kim Jong Un does not have to settle for mere friendship - in 2018 Trump said "we fell in love" - but in 2019 the romance seemed unreciprocated. Kim ended a 522-day self-imposed moratorium on ballistic missile tests, but Trump minimized their importance because the missiles could not reach the continental United States - just South Korea, Japan and the 80,000 U.S. forces in both places. However, North Korea has given Trump until right now - the end of this calendar year - to make additional U.S. concessions, beyond the scaling back of joint U.S.-South Korean military exercises, to avoid "shocking punishment." Fresh concessions are North Korea's price for resumption of negotiations that will lead, if the future is like the last 25 years, to other concessions.
However, because nuclear weapons are at issue, you must remember this: In 1945, having witnessed the New Mexico birth of something used on Japan three weeks later, the Manhattan Project's leaders would have been have been pleasantly surprised had they known that 2019 would be the 73rd year without the use of what they had created. Sometimes what does not happen is itself momentous.

Texto completo: Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo Sunday called the assault by a knife-wielding man in a rabbi's house north of New York City an "act of domestic terrorism" as political and religious leaders urged solidarity against hate and looked for ways to stop the string of anti-Semitic attacks in the region.
The man charged with the stabbings, identified by police Sunday as Grafton E. Thomas, 37, is accused of storming into the home in an Orthodox Jewish community in the town of Monsey and stabbing five Hanukkah celebrants Saturday night.
One person was very seriously wounded, the governor said, and remained in critical condition. The rabbi's son was also injured, Cuomo said, but his status and that of the other victims was not clear.
Thomas, who lives with his mother in Greenwood Lake, about 20 miles from where the stabbings occurred, was in custody Sunday at Ramapo police headquarters and faces five counts of attempted murder and one count of burglary, Chief Brad Weidel said.
The ambush, the governor said, was fueled by intolerance and a "cancer" of growing hatred in America.
President Donald Trump condemned the "horrific" attack, saying in a tweet Sunday that "We must all come together to fight, confront, and eradicate the evil scourge of anti-Semitism."
But Thomas' family's pastor, the Rev. Wendy Paige, said he has been suffering from mental illness and that his family believes that condition led to the stabbings - not hatred toward Jewish people. She said his family is sorry for the pain he has caused.
The Saturday night stabbings on the seventh night of Hanukkah come on the heels of a string of attacks targeting Jews in the New York metropolitan region, including a massacre at a kosher grocery store in New Jersey earlier this month. Monsey, not far from the New Jersey state line, is among several Hudson Valley communities that have seen an influx of Hasidic Jews in recent years. The Rockland County town is about 35 miles north of New York City.
Police said the stabbings happened at around 10 p.m. inside a home on Forshay Road.
"The guy came in wielding a big knife, sword, machete - I don't know what it was," said Josef Gluck, who hit the assailant with a coffee table during the attack. "He took it out of his holder, started swinging." 
The New York Times reported that four of the the five victims of Saturday's attack were taken to the hospital, treated and released. One remained there Sunday with a skull fracture, the Times reported.
Mayor Bill de Blasio had announced on Friday that the NYPD was stepping up patrols where anti-Semitic problems have occurred- Williamsburg, Borough Park and Crown Heights. He said Sunday the NYPD will also add light towers and security cameras to those areas.
De Blasio, in a news conference at the Brooklyn library with other officials, said the city will also create neighborhood safety coalitions to build grassroots leadership to identify problems and intervene before violence occurs. In a news release, de Blasio also said the city will launch a social media and advertising campaign to encourage diversity and mutual respect and distribute "resources" in city schools to promote "acceptance, inclusion and the diversity of their communities."
He said young people don't understand the power of hate crimes or their history. "They don't understand that hatred breeds hatred," he said.
According to public records, the home where the attack took place belongs to Rabbi Chaim Rottenberg, who leads the adjacent synagogue. Several state and local officials had described the location of the stabbings as a synagogue.
U.S. Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-New York) said in a statement that that federal law enforcement is continuing along with local officials to search for a motive in the attacks.
"I will remain in constant contact with the FBI, along with community leaders, and believe it's of paramount importance to shine a critical light on how - or where - individuals are being motivated or specifically inspired to commit these heinous acts of violence that terrorize communities and incite hate," Schumer said.
Since the Dec. 10 massacre at a kosher grocery store in New Jersey there have been 19 anti-Semitic incidents in the U.S., including 16 in New York and New Jersey, according to the ADL's Tracker of Anti-Semitic Incidents. The tracker is a compilation of recent cases of anti-Jewish vandalism, harassment and assault reported to or detected by the group.
Ten of those incidents have occurred in New York since Dec. 23 and involved assaults or threatened violence. The ADL defines assaults as incidents where people's bodies are targeted with violence accompanied by evidence of anti-Semitic animus or in a manner that attacks Jews for their religious affiliation.
The New York Police Department recorded 19 hate-crime felony assault complaints in the first three quarters of 2019.
Thomas was arraigned Sunday and pleaded not guilty to five counts of attempted murder and one count of burglary. Bail was set at $5 million. A judge ordered him back to court Jan. 3. His criminal history includes an arrest for assaulting a police horse, according to an official briefed on the investigation. A lawyer representing Thomas at the arraignment said he had no convictions.
The FBI is seeking a warrant to obtain his online accounts and were scouring digital evidence, the official said. They are also looking into whether he has a history of mental illness. The official was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity. According to the official briefed on the investigation, authorities do not believe Thomas is connected to recent anti-Semitic incidents in New York City.
In a statement Sunday morning, Nassau County Executive Laura Curran and Police Commissioner Patrick Ryder offered condolences to the victims and said there were no reported threats made against members of Nassau County's Jewish community after the attacks, adding that stepped-up patrols will continue "in areas of concern."
Suffolk County Executive Steve Bellone tweeted Sunday that police officers in the county will be patrolling near synagogues and Jewish community centers.
The suspect's arrest came after a witness saw him fleeing in a car and alerted police to the license plate number, police said. That allowed police to find the suspect's vehicle as he entered New York City, where NYPD officers apprehended him.
Thomas had blood all over his clothing and smelled of bleach when officers stopped him, prosecutors said.
Security camera footage the NYPD made public Sunday night showed two officers approaching Thomas' sedan with guns drawn before the suspect placed his hands on the roof of the car and he was put in handcuffs.
NYPD Commissioner Dermot Shea praised officers David Radziwon and Russell Mattera from the 32nd Precinct in Harlem who took Thomas into custody. He said the officers got the suspect without using their weapons or force. 
In a tweet, Shea said: The NYPD stands with members of the Jewish community. We will continue our increased patrols and the deployment of @NYPDCT officers at key locations to ensure that everyone is safe during this holiday season, and into the new year. There is no place for hate in NYC, or anywhere."
The attack drew condemnation from state and federal officials, including state Attorney General Letitia James. 
Rep. Lee Zeldin (R-Shirley) wrote in a tweet that Hanukkah 2019 in New York will be remembered for several anti-Semitic attacks.
"From colleges to Congress to Hanukkah parties & Synagogues, anti-Semitism is on the rise & on display in many ugly forms," tweeted Zeldin, who is Jewish. "This hate must be confronted head on & crushed!"
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi tweeted that she was "deeply disturbed" by the stabbings and the recent anti-Semitic attacks in the New York City area. "We must condemn and confront anti-Semitism and all forms of bigotry and hate wherever & whenever we see them," Pelosi said.
Cuomo directed the New York State Police hate crimes task force to investigate.
Jewish communities in the metropolitan area have been left shaken following a deadly Dec. 10 shooting rampage at a Jersey City kosher market. Six people - three people who had been inside the store, a police officer and the two killers - died in the gunbattle and standoff that New Jersey Attorney General Gurbir Grewal has said was "fueled" by hatred of Jews and law enforc

Texto completo: America in the 2010s saw significant cultural and political shifts that pushed us forward.
America is always in a state of flux. The country is an eternal experiment, aiming at evolution, betting on its own betterment.
It has its dark sides -- racism, sexism, xenophobia, homophobia -- but it clings to the idea, the fairy tale, that change and progress are not only possible, but they are intrinsic to the dream that is this nation.
And, every so often, a period arises in which some of that dream manifests and change is clear and indisputable, a leap forward for a people.
The 2010s were just such a decade.
To be sure, there were some sobering and surprising developments.
Occupy Wall Street, Black Lives Matter, the #MeToo movement, the Women's March, March For Our Lives and climate activists illustrated an awakening and rebirth of protest movements in this country, against the intransigence of governments hopelessly linked to powerful industries and the gross imbalances of power between races and gender, and gross abuses of power by the state.
Left and right political ideological fundamentalism found their footholds. The right pushed to an extreme of white nationalist insularity fed by a consuming fear of white displacement and religious diminution. The left fought against the placating, middle of the road, quasi-liberalism that flirted too frequently with big business and big money, that spoke more frequently about the middle class than the poor, that rivaled the right in its zeal to be tough on crime at the expense of minority citizens.
Mass shootings have become part of the American motif. Republicans and the gun lobby have resisted efforts to address the epidemic of gun violence in this country, so the carnage has become an ambient terror in our society. The mass shootings have not only increased in frequency, they have become more deadly.
In September, The Los Angeles Times analyzed more than 50 years of mass shootings and found:
"Twenty percent of the 164 cases in our database occurred in the last five years. More than half of the shootings have occurred since 2000 and 33 percent since 2010. The deadliest years yet were 2017 and 2018, and this year is shaping up to rival them, with at least 60 killed in mass shootings, 38 of them in the last five weeks."
Social media took a central position in daily life, connecting people, inspiring activism and gathering consensus on social issues. But, it also has begun to pose a very real threat to our democracy, as the Russian interference in the 2016 election revealed. The tech companies were too easily used as vessels for disinformation and they had too few safeguards to prevent it.
But perhaps no subjects inspired a more dramatic change in the way Americans considered basic human behaviors as the huge swings on the acceptance of L.G.B.T.Q. people and our country's relationship to drugs.
In 2010, for the first time, Americans' acceptance of "gay relations" crossed the 50 percent mark. Now that number is well into the 70s. Over the same period, acceptance of same-sex marriage went from the 40s to the 60s. Acceptance of gay adoption went from below 50 percent to above 70 percent.
Being gay became mainstream. And, this reaches further than just gays and lesbians. There is a new visibility for trans people, drag and fluidity. A YouGov poll asked Americans to place themselves on the Kinsey scale, "where 0 is completely heterosexual and 6 is completely homosexual." While only 5 percent rated themselves as completely gay, 20 percent rated themselves somewhere between completely gay and completely straight.
That is not to say that homophobia disappeared, or that there isn't a tremendous amount of work still to be done around the issues of bullying, discrimination, safety and sexual health. But it is to say that the American society took a quantum leap forward in just a few years on these issues.
The other issue is our view of drug usage.
This one is very much driven by racial considerations. When drug addiction was primarily seen as an inner-city problem plaguing black and brown communities, policymakers and the public at large rushed to impose harmful penalties. Now that white people in the suburbs and rural areas are disproportionately affected, the language and policies have shifted from pathological criminality to sympathetic victimization.
Drug overdoses involving heroin skyrocketed, with white people outpacing all others. This in part led to a sharp increase in mortality among white, less educated Americans. As CBS put it, "In 1999, the mortality rate for this demographic was about 30 percent lower than those of African-Americans. But by 2015, their mortality rate had eclipsed that of blacks by 30 percent."
Furthermore, the legalization of marijuana has seen a surge in support. In October 2010, 46 percent of Americans believed that the drug should be legal, according to the Pew Research Center. Now that number is 67 percent. A number of states have legalized recreational usage, and it has become a big business. Even John Boehner, the former speaker of the House, has become a lobbyist for the cannabis industry.
On these two major issues, this is the decade that America changed its mind.

More Socialism or Capitalism?

Texto completo: Readers discuss David Brooks's rejection of his early socialist ideas, how to get Americans to love capitalism and Finland's success.
To the Editor:
Re "I Was Once a Socialist. That Changed" (column, Dec. 6):
I've never been a socialist, but I think David Brooks omitted important examples of worthwhile socialist programs we've adopted such as Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and more.
Too bad Bernie Sanders has attached the label to some of his pet projects. And sadder yet that we all rely so much on labels for our opinions. Americans polled a few years ago showed more support for the Affordable Care Act than for Obamacare. And, undoubtedly, if it were nicknamed Trumpcare, one highly placed official would be a most enthusiastic supporter.
If only we could adopt and adapt the best social programs for our nation without relying on where they originated or what they're called.
Joel H. Cohen
Staten Island
To the Editor:
After Marx's death in 1883, the socialist movement took two paths: one of Leninist central state planning, the other of the European welfare state.
American socialists dream not of the underperforming Soviet command economy, which impoverished millions while regulating every feature of economic life; they imagine instead the Swedish or German models, with powerful green economies, where states use taxes to free people of needless fears: of getting sick, of becoming a burden for their families when they are old and infirm, of whether they can send their children to college.
American socialists aspire to a society where people can live lives of dignity.
John Connelly
Kensington, Calif.
The writer is a professor of history at the University of California, Berkeley.
To the Editor:
Please pass on my thanks to David Brooks for his cleareyed assessment of the virtues and failings of capitalism and how to keep our economy vibrant while reducing inequality. As a left-leaning person on economic issues and a further left leaner on most social issues, I found little to disagree with in his conservative-leaning assessment. It gave me some hope that the sensible center can hold this country together after all.
Andrew Mozina
Kalamazoo, Mich.
To the Editor:
Kudos to David Brooks for recognizing that we need some moderating elements to capitalism. But he negates his message by saying that capitalism is not broken and we need more of it. The problems he cites are signs that our capitalism is indeed broken, perhaps not irreparably, but seriously.
The "enormous wealth" that he praises is not the be-all and end-all of human endeavor. And the moderating elements he endorses are typically part of socialism. Our economy is a blend of systems, and his own examples suggest that right now we need more socialism, not more capitalism.
Bruce Burger
Seattle
To the Editor:
David Brooks writes a very compelling argument why socialism is unworkable, but I can provide an answer in a single word. One of my 2-year-old grandson's first words was "Mine!" And he really means it.
Henry Pinkney
Farmington Hills, Mich.
To the Editor:
I was impressed with David Brooks's description of what capitalism is good at: "creating a learning process to help people figure stuff out." Unfortunately, it also shows how ill suited profit-driven capitalism is for providing universal health care.
If I want to buy a new TV, I have so many choices: I can review Consumers Report, look online and in stores, compare prices and features, wait until they go on sale or decide not to buy one at all.
If I break my arm, get the flu or cancer, I have none of those choices. I can't get quality or price comparisons. I am limited in choices by what is available in my community and what my insurance will pay for. I can't wait until casts or antibiotics or radiation go on sale. And worst, I can't decide not to "buy" care (although, sadly, many people have to do just that, as our mortality statistics reflect). The insurance company plan to make a profit is to provide as little care as possible at the highest cost.
Yes, capitalism is a great system for businesses to succeed and make a profit; it is an inhumane and cruel system for providing health care.
Susan Sullivan
Petaluma, Calif.
To the Editor:
Re "How to Get Americans to Love Capitalism Again," by Henry M. Paulson Jr. and Erskine B. Bowles" (Op-Ed, nytimes.com, Dec. 11):
As secretary of the Treasury, Henry M. Paulson Jr. oversaw the worst collapse to our nation's economy since the Great Depression. His initial reaction was to direct the expenditure of the country's money to the biggest banks and insurance companies.
Erskine B. Bowles in 2010 was the co-chairman of the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform, which proposed massive spending cuts to domestic programs and basically failed to come up with any workable national solutions.
A decade later, here they are again dismissing attempts to create national health care for all Americans and impose a legitimate wealth tax on the wealthiest Americans.
Is it any wonder that the concept of capitalism in America is on a continued downward trajectory with the record that Mr. Paulson and Mr. Bowles bring to the table?
James C. Sturdevant
San Rafael, Calif.
To the Editor:
Not a single word about military spending.
Not a single mention of the Wall Street bailout or the Fed's lending of trillions of dollars to banks at near-zero interest.
Not a single word about fossil fuel subsidies.
Not a single word about money in politics.
And they complain about a rising "commitment to entitlements"?
Good lord. That was a doozy.
Jacqueline Maguire
Chicago
To the Editor:
I have some advice for Henry M. Paulson Jr. and Erskine B. Bowles. If you want to dispel the notion that the ultrarich sit on a mountaintop and conspire to rig the capitalist system for themselves, maybe you shouldn't call your group the Aspen Economic Strategy Group. The name itself makes it clear that the rich literally sit on a mountain known for luxury resorts and conspire against the right of every American to universal health care and a more just tax system.
Daniel Lefcourt

To the Editor:
Re "Finland Is Our Capitalist Paradise," by Anu Partanen (Sunday Review, Dec. 8):
As a frequent business and tourist visitor to Finland over the last 25 years, I applaud your article on the Finnish model. It's based on the idea that happy, healthy, well-educated people are good employees and good entrepreneurs, and participate as consumers in ways that keep a capitalist economy healthy.
This has led to Finland dominating the industry I work for, the forestry sector, on a worldwide basis. It has managed much better in this industry than my home country of Canada, even though Canada has a far richer forest resource and more than six times the population. This is something capitalists in the United States might be interested in understanding.
Seems to me that Henry Ford understood that his employees had to make enough money to afford a Model T if he was to do well ...
Tom Browne
Montreal
To the Editor:
For me, it's difficult to see how the Finnish system could work here. Finland has a population of 5.53 million, less than that of New York City, versus the United States population of 329 million. All of the Nordic countries that writers admire for their quality of life have small populations, which makes it easier to adopt policies that benefit their citizens.

Texto completo: Put down your phone and take in the wonders around you.
Richard F. Shepard, as keen and joyful a chronicler of New York as ever graced the pages of The Times, had simple advice for anyone out and about on the city streets. Look up, he said. Look especially at second-floor windows above storefronts. That, he liked to say, is where a lot of absorbing action takes place. Why would a perambulating soul wish to miss any of it?
One can imagine Mr. Shepard shaking his head at many of today's New Yorkers. He died in 1998, so he never held an iPhone or, I'm willing to bet, any of its forerunners. But there's little question that he would have found something hollow about this smartphone age, when so many people routinely violate the Shepard rule, New Yorkers being no exception. At any given moment, thousands of them are so focused on their little screens that they fail to look up. Truly, they don't know what they're missing.
Plenty has been written about the perils of modern electronic devices, real or feared: They're rewiring brains. They're shortening attention spans. They're killing dinner-table conversation. They're disrupting sleep patterns. They're addictive. A somewhat ungainly word came into being a decade ago: nomophobia -- short for no mobile phone phobia -- meaning a fear of being without one's phone, or at least without juice or network coverage.
But there's a more basic failing that is apparent every day in a great walking city, be it London, Paris, Rome, San Francisco, Boston or, for our purposes, New York. The frailty is inattentiveness. What's the point of navigating the metropolis if you ignore the very sights that give urban life its verve?
The photos that you see here offer but a sampling of New York's glories, from the Chrysler Building to the Brooklyn Bridge, from Grand Central Terminal to the Staten Island Ferry, from Times Square to Coney Island. It is, of course, an incomplete collection, and some of you may now be muttering that the selections veer toward cliché. But things become clichés because they tend to be real and true.
If you don't look up, you won't see the splendor that is the top of the Woolworth Building. Or sense the small-town flavor of City Island in the Bronx. Or admire the Patience and Fortitude of the New York Public Library. Or take glee in a child's exploring the Brooklyn Botanic Garden. Or appreciate the easy elegance of the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge, or of the Unisphere in Flushing Meadows Corona Park in Queens, or of the High Line, or of the entrance to the Astor Place subway station. Or, or, or.
You will surely be heedless of ghosts of an older New York that haunt the sides of some brick buildings -- faded advertising signs for long-gone toothpaste brands, furniture makers and (gasp) corsets.
In all likelihood, you will sail blindly past the improbable wedge that is the Flatiron Building, by Madison Square Park. Fran Leadon, an architect who in 2018 published a history of Broadway -- the street, not the theater district -- describes the Flatiron in its early years at the start of the 20th century. It created patterns of strong winds that sent hats flying and blew women's dresses upward in a most unseemly way. Buildings erected later in that neighborhood moderated the wind gusts, now "rarely strong enough to lift a skirt," Mr. Leadon writes. Then again, he adds knowingly, "And with everyone's eyes glued on digital devices, no one would notice anyway."
Americans who have reached what is sometimes cloyingly referred to as a certain age may remember the old "Adventures of Superman" television series, with its signature opening, "Look, up in the sky!" Nowadays, would anyone look up?
Terrestrially, many New Yorkers keep heads down as they pass street performers. Below ground, with buds in their ears, they ignore subway balladeers. It's an understandable defense mechanism. But the potential for surprise shrinks, as it did for some riders when a guitarist boarded a No. 1 train one evening a few days after the November 2016 election. Wrapped up in their own music, they ignored him as he strummed his latest work: "I didn't vote for him, but somehow he got in." Attention should have been paid.
And hazards can lurk in this compulsive staring at screens. Take New York's more hideous structures, the miles of scaffolding called sidewalk sheds. Some time ago, I saw a young man so fixated on his phone that he smacked his head on the pole of a shed in Midtown. Rough but poetic justice, some would say.
That fellow had certainly never heard Dick Shepard's admonition to look up. But perhaps he was familiar with wisdom once offered by the philosopher Lawrence Peter Berra, a transplant from St. Louis who became a New York legend. It could shape a splendid resolution as New Year's Day draws near. "You can observe a lot just by watching," said the man better known as Yogi.

Texto completo: The judge said the state's move to cancel the voter registration status of inactive voters did not violate the United States Constitution.
A federal judge on Friday backed Georgia's removal of nearly 100,000 names from the state's voter rolls.
The decision comes as state officials face accusations of voter suppression, particularly against black and low-income voters. Scrutiny of voting rights in Georgia has been heightened since the governor's race in 2018 brought long lines at polling sites and criticism of outdated voting machines.
In the ruling, the judge, Steve C. Jones, said the lead plaintiff, Fair Fight Action, a voting rights advocacy organization, did not prove that the Georgia secretary of state's decision to cancel the voter registration status of inactive voters violated the United States Constitution.
The judge, an appointee of former President Obama, also ordered the secretary of state to make "diligent and reasonable efforts" through its website and news releases to inform residents about registration, especially residents that have until Monday to re-register to vote ahead of a special election in January for a seat in the state's House of Representatives.
In October, Georgia officials announced plans to remove more than 300,000 names from its lists of voters. About 100,000 had moved to a different county or state and about 80,000 had mail that was classified as undeliverable.
Fair Fight Action argued against the removal of about 120,000 voters from the state's rolls and the state restored about 22,000 names to the voting rolls.
According to court documents, Fair Fight Action argued that the state was disenfranchising voters after a name was purged because of the state's "use it or lose it" rule, which bumps from the rolls voters who had not voted in the past several elections.
In 2019, Gov. Brian Kemp signed a bill into law requiring the secretary of state to wait five years before removing inactive voters. Previously, the state was allowed to remove names from rolls if there was no contact with a voter for three years.
"Our efforts to protect Georgia voters have already resulted in approximately 26,500 voters remaining on the rolls who would have otherwise been purged, and the state is now required to take additional steps to notify purged voters as a result of our litigation," Lauren Groh-Wargo, Fair Fight Action's chief executive, said in a statement.
Brad Raffensperger, Georgia's secretary of state, said in a statement that the ruling "upheld Georgia's decision to continue to maintain clean voter rolls."
"Despite activists efforts and lawsuits that only waste taxpayer dollars, Georgia is continuing to ensure every eligible voter can vote and voter lists remain accurate," he said.
Fair Fight Action was founded by Stacey Abrams, the Democrat who narrowly lost the race for governor in 2018 to Mr. Kemp, Georgia's former secretary of state. In March, the House Oversight and Reform Committee began an investigation into voter suppression in the state.
The ruling in Georgia comes amid voter restrictions and purges elsewhere in the country.
A legal notice filed on Thursday showed that a federal judge in North Carolina planned to block a new voter identification law that critics had said would deter black and Latino residents from voting. The state N.A.A.C.P. had sued and sought an injunction against the law.
The judge, Loretta C. Biggs, who was also an Obama administration appointee, noted that the state Board of Elections said it planned a large statewide mailing to educate voters about the law on Tuesday. She said she would grant the plaintiffs' request for an injunction and would formally block the requirement, which was scheduled to begin in 2020.
Unless the preliminary injunction is successfully appealed, the requirement will be halted until the lawsuit is resolved.
And this month, a Wisconsin judge ruled that 200,000 names should be removed from the voter rolls. Wisconsin has become a battleground state ahead of the 2020 presidential election.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — They were 235 days that shook the world, rattled China’s regime and refuted the most pernicious wishful thinking since the appeasement of dictators collapsed eight decades ago.
Nothing more momentous happened in 2019 than Hong Kong’s heroic insurrection.
It began with the April 3 introduction by Beijing’s Hong Kong satraps of an extradition bill that would have facilitated the sweeping of inconvenient people into the mainland’s suppression machinery that is both Kafkaesque and Orwellian. The convulsions culminated in, but did not end with, Nov. 24’s cymbal-crash elections in which the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), which had counted on the island city’s majority to rebuke the demonstrators, learned the limits of its sterile program of purchasing subservience by promising prosperity.
Elsewhere on China’s periphery, Taiwan has a presidential election in less than two weeks. China’s President Xi Jinping began 2019 with a Jan. 2 speech identifying Taiwan as the focus of his campaign to make China great again. If — when, probably — on Jan. 11, 2020, Taiwan reelects President Tsai Ing-wen, the Taiwanese will have joined Hong Kongers in disdaining the “one country, two systems” fudge as a formula for the incremental suffocation of freedom.
Thirty autumns ago, as the Berlin Wall crumbled and the Soviet Union teetered, approximately 1.5 billion people lived under communist regimes. Today, approximately 1.5 billion people still do.
The 1989 figure was 29% of the world’s population compared with 20% in 2019, but 89% of today’s 20% are caught in the tightening vise of China’s Leninism, whose inviolable tenet is that nothing shall challenge the party’s supremacy.
With this year’s revelations about the million, or perhaps millions, swept into the gulag archipelago in northwestern China, it is possible to hope that in 2020 we will hear less from American businessmen who are as obtuse as they are cocksure. Just 51 days before The New York Times published more than 400 pages of documents on China’s concentration camps, presidential aspirant Michael Bloomberg said the CCP’s leaders “listen to the public,” and “Xi Jinping is not a dictator.”
Not content to just “listen to” the public, the CCP, using ever-more-sophisticated technology, surveils almost everything done by almost everyone. Perhaps 2019 foreshadowed the day when today’s Bloombergs will be remembered as Charles Lindbergh and others are remembered because they thought dictators in the 1930s were “the wave of the future.”
Would that America’s serial grovelers had the gumption of the creators of “South Park.” When China, a supposedly great power that was actually discombobulated by this animated TV series, banned it, the creators said: “We welcome the Chinese censors into our homes and into our hearts. ... Xi doesn’t look just like Winnie the Pooh at all. ... Long live the Great Communist Party of China! May this autumn’s sorghum harvest be bountiful! We good now China?”
“We have to stand with Hong Kong, but I’m also standing with President Xi,” said America’s president, who also said of Xi: “He’s a friend of mine.” Xi should reciprocate friendly feelings because Donald Trump’s biggest blunder, made three days after his inauguration, was jettisoning the Trans-Pacific Partnership, thereby unraveling a 12-nation fabric of commercial cooperation that excluded China.
Two other Trump chums are Russia’s Vladimir Putin and Turkey’s Recep Tayyip Erdogan. The former continued his incremental dismemberment of Europe’s geographically largest nation, Ukraine, and the latter took Trump’s warning against attacking the Kurds as seriously as Trump meant it.
North Korea’s Kim Jong Un does not have to settle for mere friendship -- in 2018 Trump said “we fell in love” — but in 2019 the romance seemed unreciprocated. Kim ended a 522-day self-imposed moratorium on ballistic missile tests, but Trump minimized their importance because the missiles could not reach the continental United States — just South Korea, Japan and the 80,000 U.S. forces in both places. However, North Korea has given Trump until right now — the end of this calendar year -- to make additional U.S. concessions, beyond the scaling back of joint U.S.-South Korean military exercises, to avoid “shocking punishment.” Fresh concessions are North Korea’s price for resumption of negotiations that will lead, if the future is like the last 25 years, to other concessions.
However, because nuclear weapons are at issue, you must remember this: In 1945, having witnessed the New Mexico birth of something used on Japan three weeks later, the Manhattan Project’s leaders would have been have been pleasantly surprised had they known that 2019 would be the 73rd year without the use of what they had created. Sometimes what does not happen is itself momentous.

¿Quién reemplazó a los inmigrantes en las plantas de pollo donde hubo redadas en Mississippi?

Texto completo: Las plantas de procesamiento de pollo donde hubo redadas en Mississippi el pasado agosto han recuperado una parte de fuerza laboral.
Un informe del New York Times revela que miembros de la comunidad negra en la región han tomado las plazas de trabajos en plantas como Koch Foods. El reporte indica que muchos fueron contratados en los días posteriores a las redadas en las que 680 inmigrantes hispanos fueron detenidos.
Los trabajadores negros volvieron a la industria en la que laboraron entre finales de la década de los 60 y mediados de los 80, antes de que las plantas decidieran ir por trabajadores migrantes a México para bajar costos operativos, motivados por la oportunidad de ganar más de $11 dólares por hora. Esos sueldos no se pueden ganar en tiendas minoristas o restaurantes de comida rápida, donde el pago es el mínimo del estado ($7.25).
Un gerente de un restaurante Sonic Drive-In dijo al diario neoyorquino que perdió 10 empleados a los pocos días de las redadas.
El reportaje de Richard Fausset también hace un recuento del dilema ético para los trabajadores negros ya que muchos lamentan la separación de familias hispanas y la persecución a los inmigrantes. Muchos son solidarios porque recuerdan los tiempos de la esclavitud.
Finalmente, el texto deja claro que el trabajo en las plantas de procesamiento de pollo es calificado como “duro” por los trabajadores. Esto lleva a pensar que la contratación actual podría estancarse, y las empresas podrían enfrentar a una escasez de trabajadores en el futuro.

Mike Tinius , un feligrés que estaba en la iglesia, declaró a The New York Times que uno de los fallecidos es un guardia de seguridad del templo que respondió al autor de los disparos, quien también falleció.
“Estaba tratando de hacer lo que tenía que hacer para protegernos al resto de nosotros”, declaró el hombre, quien prefirió no identificar a la víctima.
Las autoridades desconocen hasta el momento las motivaciones del autor del ataque, que tampoco ha sido identificado.
Macara Trusty, portavoz del MedStar Mobile Healthcare , señaló que una persona sufrió un paro respiratorio mientras era traslada a un hospital, pero lograron revivirla antes de ser llevada a cirugía.
En un comunicado, el gobernador Greg Abbott calificó el hecho como un “diabólico acto de violencia”.
“Los lugares de culto están destinados a ser sagrados, y estoy agradecido por los miembros de la iglesia que actuaron rápidamente para abatir al tirador y ayudar a prevenir una mayor pérdida de vidas”, agregó.
El tiroteo ocurre casi doce horas después de que un hombre fuera detenido en Nueva York tras apuñalar a cinco personas en la residencia de un rabino al norte de la ciudad el sábado, en lo que las autoridades han descrito hoy como “terrorismo doméstico”.

Texto completo: Staring at the blank page can be intimidated. This could be the start of any creative project — from writing the next great American novel to crafting a new investment deck for your startup.
Maybe your blank page is less grandiose, but still daunting such as organizing your thoughts for a sales pitch or drafting an email to your boss. As thoughts and fears swirl in our heads, it's easy to freeze up like a deer in the headlights.
How will I structure the message? What word choice is best? Should I start with a story or a surprising stat? How long should the finished product be? Is it a good idea to use humor to make a point, or should the tone be more somber? As questions like these fire through our minds, we can quickly devolve into a tailspin of inaction.
Here's a simple technique to break the deadlock: IdeaSpewing.
Just as it sounds, this tactic involves the unorganized dumping of thoughts onto a page. Don't worry about structure, grammar, word-choice, rhythm or anything other than vomiting raw ideas onto the page. We're talking a nonlinear geyser of incomplete thoughts, dumped in a pile without any regard for organization. You'll figure out how to build upon and assemble them later.
IdeaSpewing is the equivalent of going to the market and picking up a bunch of ingredients before deciding on a dinner recipe. Each raw and unfinished item enters your shopping cart in no particular order. You may grab several things that never end up in the final dish. This gathering phrase allows you the creative freedom to explore and imagine the possibilities, before measuring, chopping, and preparing.
I've experienced the power of spewing personally, while creating many types of creative content. The trick is pulling apart the process into two distinct steps: 1) dumping out all your thoughts and ideas, unencumbered by any structural concerns; and then 2) arranging, assembling and fine-tuning the creative elements into your finished work. Most of us combine these two steps into an edit-while-you-create pitfall that ends up making the process painful and the output less than ideal.
With increasing pressure on high-quality creative outputs in nearly every profession, IdeaSpewing may be your path to greater success in the new year.
As the bubbly erupts at the strike of the new decade, let is serve as a symbol of the free flow of ideas needed to enjoy sustainable success in the years to come. In 2020, give yourself permission to get your bold, weird and unexpected ideas out on the table without restriction before choosing how to assemble them into your own work of art.
Here's to a swanky New Year's Eve, and a Happy Spew Year.

Other man claims killing

Texto completo: Lawyers for James Dailey, who could face execution as soon as next month, have made a new plea for a court to reconsider his case by claiming that another man is prepared to take sole blame for the crime.

In a court paper filed Friday, Daileys defense says his co-defendant, Jack Pearcy, has signed a new declaration claiming responsibility for the 1985 murder of 14-year-old Shelly Boggio.

James Dailey had nothing to do with the murder of Shelly Boggio, the document reads. I committed the crime alone. James Dailey was back at the house when I drove Shelly Boggio to the place where I ultimately killed her.

The document bears Pearcys signature and the date of Dec. 18, 2019. It is similar to a previous affidavit filed in the case. But when called to testify in court about that document in 2018, Pearcy said the statements it contained were not true and invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.

The court paper filed Friday says attorney Joshua Dubin visited Pearcy in prison Dec. 18. After signing the affidavit, Pearcy expressed a willingness to testify at a new hearing. He also requested that his family members not attend the hearing, the document states.

Dailey and Pearcy were convicted of Boggios murder in separate trials. Her body was found one morning in May 1985 in the Intracoastal Waterway, near the Wals

ingham Road Bridge in Indian Rocks Beach. She had been beaten, choked, stabbed 31 times and held underwater until she drowned.

Pearcy and Dailey were seen with Boggio the night before she was found dead. The men lived together with Pearcys girlfriend. When investigators questioned Pearcy, he implicated Dailey. But there was no physical evidence or eyewitness testimony linking Dailey to the crime.

Pearcy was tried first and found guilty. Prosecutors sought the death penalty, but a jury recommended a life sentence.

In Daileys case, the state relied on the testimony of three jailhouse informants, all of whom came forward shortly before the trial with claims that he had made incriminating statements. Defense lawyers have questioned the reliability of at least one of those informants, Paul Skalnik, whose prolific history as a jailhouse snitch was the subject of an investigative report published this month by ProPublica and the New York Times Magazine.

Dailey, 73, has been on death row since 1987.

Gov. Ron DeSantis signed Daileys death warrant in September. Dailey was 15 days away from execution in November when U.S. District Judge William Jung granted him a temporary stay of execution. The judge did so to give Daileys federal attorneys more time to research and present their claims.

Since then, all of Daileys appeals have been turned down.

In one of several orders in the federal case, Jung called the suggestion that Pearcy is a credible witness a stretch. He also wrote that Pearcys account of what occurred the night of the murder has changed numerous times through the years.

Coincidentally, the day Pearcy is said to have signed the new affidavit, Dec. 18, was one week after the Tampa Bay Times received a reply to questions it had messaged to Pearcy in prison.

But the reply to the Times on Dec. 11 contradicted the affidavit: The answer to both your questions is Dailey killed Shelly by himself.

In 2018, when Pearcy recanted the earlier affidavit clearing Dailey, he told the court that he had spoken with his family and prosecutors after signing that affidavit, Daileys attorneys note in their filing Friday.

I spoke with all my family, Pearcy told the court at the time. And they told me I needed to do what I thought was right and that I needed to not make a rash decision since my parole just got denied for seven years and think about what I was doing.

Daileys stay of execution will expire Monday.

A model for migrant services Longtime director of Hartford immigrant resource center receives national I Love My Librarian award

Texto completo: Hartford - A Hartford librarian has been honored again for her outreach to immigrants and refugees, which she began 20 years ago and has grown into a national model for raising a community's literacy and civic engagement.
Homa Naficy is one of 10 winners of 2019's I Love My Librarian Award, a national initiative of the American Library Association that received more than 1,950 nominees this year. Naficy won a $5,000 cash award, sponsored by the Carnegie Corporation of New York, New York Public Library and The New York Times, as recognition of her leadership of The American Place, the Hartford Public Library department that draws foreign-born residents into the community with language and computer classes, civic engagement and legal services, workforce training and other programs.
Naficy's work has gained national attention before, starting with receiving the Connecticut immigrant of the Year Award in 2001, the year after she joined Hartford Public Library to design and direct The American Place. She secured two major grants in 2010 that expanded The American Place's ability to serve hard-to-reach populations.
And in 2013, President Barack Obama named her a Champion of Change for libraries and museums. The same year, the library became the first in the country with staff certified by the Bureau of Immigrant Appeals, allowing library employees to help immigrants with some citizenship paperwork, such as Green Card applications and renewals.
After her latest honor, Naficy said she was fortunate to work under leaders that value immigration outreach and with colleagues who give their hearts to serving that community.
"The people that work with me in this department, they're really there because they care," she said. "Even just in public libraries, public service, you have to have that in you if you want it to be successful."
Naficy recalled starting out with just one part-timer in 2000, when the program started out with a five-year grant from the Hartford Foundation for Public Giving.
Nearly two decades later, there are four full-timers and several part-time staff focused on immigration and civic engagement. Still others in the Main Street branch run an ever-growing roster of cultural events celebrating those who came from the Caribbean islands and South and Central America, China and India, the Balkans and the Middle East.
"When you serve immigrants, you're building your community," Naficy said. "It's the future, really. And when you bring them out, you're making your community more diverse and that's what shapes your community, is the diversity."
The work is always evolving.
Three years ago, The American Place started offering vocational English lessons that link immigrants to job opportunities in the food and health care industries. The training programs develop students' literacy and employability skills in two of the area's highest-demand occupations, mixing English lessons with job training in food industry management, food handling and bartending, or work as a patient care attendant.
For the food industry piece, the library partners with Hartford Public Schools to give students on-the-job experience in school kitchens. The district has hired a number of those participants to part-time jobs, Naficy says.
Students also gain vital knowledge about exercising their legal rights in the food and health care industries, where immigrants can fall victim to exploitation and abuses, she added.
Other work hasn't changed, but it's become more important in light of the country's shifting politics. Under the Trump administration, immigration policies have undergone a number of proposed and implemented changes on everything from the detention of undocumented immigrants and asylum seekers to refugee resettlement.
Immigrations and Customs Enforcement has also ramped-up deportation activity, including rounding up hundreds of workers in a massive raid of Mississippi food processing plants, leaving communities on edge across the country.
Connecticut experienced a sharp drop in the number of refugees settling here, from 897 in 2016 to just 149 last year, as a result of new restrictions put in place by the Trump administration.
Naficy says she's noticed heightened fear and stress in the people she and her coworkers serve, as well as a greater sense of urgency to gain permanent legal status.
"When the economy isn't good, people always look for scapegoats and immigrants are the scapegoats," she said. "People are afraid, and so all the more reason we need to do stronger outreach. People who are qualified to be U.S. citizens should just move forward, and don't wait, because we don't know what's gonna happen."
In the past, visitors to The American Place weren't in as much of a rush to take the library's free citizenship classes or to apply for naturalization, Naficy said. She can relate - born in Paris and a native of Iran, Naficy was qualified to become a citizen about 15 years before she applied and became naturalized in 2000.
People just didn't take it as seriously, she said. Now, The American Place is working to meet an unprecedented demand for citizenship classes and legal help as it works as hard as ever to bring more immigrants out of hiding and into the Hartford community.
"They're realizing how important it is," she said.

Texto completo: The jittery energy backstage at a Broadway theater 30 minutes before showtime, or in the seconds before the curtain rises at the Metropolitan Opera. Björk and Erykah Badu in all their regalia, and the happily-ever-after Swiss life of Tina Turner in retirement, but hardly retiring. Two lions in winter, Robert De Niro and Al Pacino, remembering when they were cubs.
These were some of the pictures that stayed with us as we looked back at our favorite arts photography published this year by The New York Times.
In a world obsessed with image, there is an industry devoted to feeding pictures of stars and wannabe stars -- as they would like to be seen -- to hungry Instagram feeds and celebrity publications. The photographers The Times sent out to capture the rich world of culture this year were aiming for something different: striking pictures that revealed deeper truths about art and the people who make it, and how we experience it.
They took us behind the scenes. Their portraits showed us the power and grace of the dancer Herman Cornejo, Amy Schumer subverting the whole nude pregnant celebrity genre, Adam Driver and Keri Russell in a suitably moody chiaroscuro. And they bore witness, bringing us amazing moments -- from a Jamaican dancehall queen to a girl and her slime. Have a look.
"I returned the following afternoon to find her transformed: wig styled, lips painted red, eyes sparkling. 'That was Anna Mae yesterday,' she told me. 'Here's Tina."'
-- Amanda Hess on Tina Turner
"The studio turned into the corner of a sooty bar, where a pair of notorious gangsters plotted their next move."
-- Philip Montgomery on photographing Robert De Niro and Al Pacino
"While backstage waiting for the show to start, I saw this. A perfect reminder of just how hard Hollywood works to bring us the glitz and glamour."
-- Michelle Groskopf on photographing behind the scenes at the Emmys
Herman Cornejo
Björk and Erykah Badu
"I wanted to get as close as I could without losing my hearing."
-- Devin Yalkin on photographing "Hadestown" band members warming up before the Broadway show
Charlize Theron
"She welcomed me like it was an extension of the performance -- wrestling and destroying her celebratory roses, rolling around on the floor, making faces."
-- Caroline Tompkins on photographing Alia Shawkat backstage, just after finishing the 24-hour performance of "The Second Woman"
Barry Manilow
When Joaquin spotted my skateboard, he took off on it across the parking lot. I chased him on a bike, shooting three cameras. When he got to the next location, he smiled, stoked I could catch up with him.
-- Magdalena Wosinska on photographing Joaquin Phoenix
"Looking up at the choir ascending the hill, with the sun shining bright, was almost like staring at a painting."
-- Rozette Rago on photographing Kanye West's Sunday Service performance at Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival
"Human beings like shiny things."
-- Reeve Peterson, a gem dealer, on hunting for crystals at Gem-O-Rama
The artist Simone Leigh's "Brick House," a 16-foot-tall bronze bust displayed on the High Line in Manhattan.
Jennifer Aniston and Phoebe Waller-Bridge
"As I was shooting I kept saying, 'This is great, you look amazing.' And he follows with, 'You look beautiful as well."'
-- Mark Elzey on photographing the artist Duane Michals
"When Tom walked in, he started dancing to my bossa nova playlist."
-- Daniel Dorsa on photographing Tom Hanks
Storm King
"Slime is a star of the visual internet, and it is often depicted as a glossy, exotic substance molded into soothing shapes by well-manicured experts. In the hands of a couple of girls, it becomes a site of unbridled creative mess."
-- Amanda Hess on the phenomenon of slime
"There was all the expected emotive grace and stillness, but it sounded like a basketball practice."
-- Daniel Arnold on photographing Mikhail Baryshnikov at New York City Ballet
The cast of "The L Word: Generation Q"
"The beauty of this shoot was that essentially nothing was planned."
-- Heather Sten on photographing a pregnant Amy Schumer
Origami and "Slave Play"
"This opera was three and a half hours long. I happily shot it twice."
-- Sara Krulwich on photographing the Metropolitan Opera's production of "Akhnaten"
"I wanted to make an image that represents what passes through all of our minds when we think of a full-body wax."
-- Victor Llorente on photographing Anthony Roth Costanzo preparing for his title role in "Akhnaten"
Keri Russell and Adam Driver
Parsons Dance
"The environment was lit by dragonfly stained glass lamps and softened with pillows embroidered with messages like 'Friends Are the Best Present' and 'One Can Never Have Too Many Cats.' Collins has three."
-- Amanda Hess on Judy Collins
Flea and Maggie Rogers
"You can feel her presence take space in the room. It gave me goose bumps."
-- Micaiah Carter on photographing Tilda Swinton
Joe Hill
"It was crazy to see how many people there are behind an opera -- a single mistake would mess it all up."
-- Victor Llorente on photographing backstage at the Metropolitan Opera's "Madama Butterfly"
"It was probably the most fun party I have been to in my life."
-- Rose Marie Cromwell on photographing the Jamaican dancehall music scene
"It really felt like I was in Manhattan until I looked up and saw the palm trees blowing in the wind."
-- Brian Guido on photographing preparations for Frieze Los Angeles
"I had two objectives: first, to make memorable work and second, to not get run over."
-- Devin Yalkin on photographing an Arab Drag show in Brooklyn
"This reminded me of those in-between moments of skateboarding -- lurking with your friends atop the sun drenched concrete."
-- George Etheredge on photographing skateboarders at the "Live at Olympic Stadium" event
"I fell backward moments after taking this. DaBaby caught me mid-song, midair without missing a beat."
-- Jessica Lehrman on photographing DaBaby
"Dragon Spring Phoenix Rise" and Jokers at Comic Con
"We got on so well she stayed a bit longer to have a cup of tea."
-- Magdalena Wosinska on photographing Helen Mirren
David Cale and Twyla Tharp
"It made me want what they had -- the sense of community and returning to the same places with the same music again and again."
-- Benjamin Rasmussen on photographing a Chuck Wagon Jamboree
Christine Goerke
"Her place is like the house from Hansel and Gretel."
-- Jeenah Moon on photographing the performance artist and choreographer Ann Liv Young

Texto completo: A former Navy SEAL accused of war crimes by his colleagues denounced videos on Friday depicting their confessions painting him as “evil” and out of control.
The New York Times published video segments of Naval Criminal Investigative Service interviews with Special Operators 1st Class Craig Miller, Joshua Vriens, and Corey Scott on Friday, wherein they alleged Gallagher shot at civilians and killed an injured ISIS fighter. Gallagher and his lawyer, Tim Parlatore, told the Washington Examiner the videos have been taken out of context and are an attempt to relitigate Gallagher’s case in the court of public opinion.
“My first reaction to seeing the videos was surprise and disgust that they would make up blatant lies about me, but I quickly realized that they were scared that the truth would come out of how cowardly they acted on deployment,” Gallagher said in a statement. “I felt sorry for them that they thought it necessary to smear my name, but they never realized what the consequences of their lies would be.”
The interviews, recorded in 2018, led to the Navy charging Gallagher with war crimes. He was acquitted at trial in July of all but one of the charges, taking a picture with the corpse of a teenage ISIS fighter he was accused of murdering.
“As upset as I was, the videos also gave me confidence because I knew that their lies would never hold up under real questioning and the jury would see through it,” Gallagher said. “Their lies and NCIS’s refusal to ask hard questions or corroborate their stories strengthened my resolve to go to trial and clear my name.”
Gallagher said he did not see the videos until after he had been charged and claimed one of his accusers came to visit him to “apologize for what they did but that they had to stick with the fake stories or be charged with making false statements.”

Gallagher's accusers painted him as a bloodthirsty warrior who was out of control in Iraq in 2017.
“The guy is freaking evil,” Miller told the investigators.
Vriens described Gallagher as “toxic,” while Scott said, “You could tell he was perfectly OK with killing anybody that was moving.”
Three of Gallagher’s teammates recalled him conducting a reenlistment ceremony over the corpse of the fighter.
“I was listening to it, and I was just thinking, like, this is the most disgraceful thing I’ve ever seen in my life,” Miller said.
Parlatore did not deny the authenticity of the videos but told the Washington Examiner they didn’t tell the whole story.
“They cherry-picked small sentences over many, many hours of interviews and presented them without the context of the cross-examination that they faced later on,” Parlatore said.
There may be a political element to the attention, given President Trump’s involvement in the case, Parlatore said. Trump intervened in March to free Gallagher from the Navy brig before his trial and prevented the Navy from pulling his SEAL Trident in November, a chain of events that led to the firing of former Secretary of the Navy Richard Spencer.
“Attention from the White House is kind of a double-edged sword in the world,” Parlatore said.
Gallagher’s team expects more scrutiny in the future, which Parlatore said will require his client to continue to tell his side of the story.

Alissa Quart: What billionaires don’t understand about college debt

Texto completo: In May, the billionaire Robert Smith was widely lauded when he announced he would pay the student debt of Morehouse College’s graduating class to the tune of $34 million. So were Michael Bloomberg, the former New York mayor and presidential candidate, who gave $1.8 billion to his alma mater, Johns Hopkins University, in 2018, and Steve Tisch, who earmarked $10 million for middle-class students at U.C.L.A. in October. Ken Langone, a founder of The Home Depot, appeared on a TV show last year to celebrate his surprise gift of $100 million to help pay the tuition of medical students at New York University.
Welcome to the world of those I call shock benefactors. While these 1-percenters deserve praise for their generosity, the reality is these donations are also symptoms of an economic system out of whack; this kind of giving does little to alleviate structural problems afflicting millions of others who are not being helped by a theatrical act of philanthropy. Such sudden altruism will likely inspire copycats but, without structural change, the system will continue to indenture college graduates, whose debt burden totals $1.6 trillion. These givers just palliate a small part of it.
In addition, the lucky students are hardly saved from an economic system that remains hostile to them. As Daniel Edwards, a junior at Morehouse, told me, “It’s a Band-Aid fix.” He’s happy for his “brothers who got economic freedom,” but also noted that “in every classroom you sit in, odds are one of the students to the left or right of you is still in financial struggle.” That’s because only a few colleges are affordable for families earning under $70,000 a year. In other words, the issue is inequality.
It’s likely that the billionaires would have had a much bigger impact had they put at least some of that money toward reforming either the astronomically expensive college system, or the tax regulatory one which has allowed them to hoard money, depriving us of tax revenues that would pay for better schools, better health care, better everything.
It’s obvious why shock benefactors appeal to us, with their sudden joyous and viral acts of generosity. They satisfy our narrative needs, resembling the long-lost relatives in Victorian novels that bequeath their fortunes to our heroes and heroines, making their lives bearable. But as Anand Giridharadas, the author of “Winners Take All,” put it: “While a gift like that gives the giver a moral glow, that glow is undeserved” because, as he told me, “The Morehouse gift helped one class of students at one college while not alleviating the debt burden in any other school or in any other year or any other college.”
Sara Goldrick-Rab, a professor of higher education policy and sociology at Temple University, noted the tremendous media attention these gifts receive, in contrast to Washington State’s less visible move to make tuition free or reduce its cost for every admitted low-income student at its state schools. This disparity in attention is probably because it was neither exciting nor elite. This points to yet another problem with the shock benefactors’ gifts: They are often given to the most heralded universities rather than to far needier community and state colleges.
Many critics also cite the tax benefits that philanthropists may receive, allowing them to take advantage of dubious tax loopholes like carried interest. So what should philanthropists who want to avoid these pitfalls do instead?
They might question the loopholes that have made many of these billionaires too wealthy in the first place (again: depriving working people of income that has gone to the 1 percent, and depriving the government of revenues to provide services we need). They could buy the debt of students from a range of social class backgrounds, as the Debt Collective has done.
Caitlin Zaloom, the author of “Indebted” and an associate professor at New York University, said, “It would be better if philanthropists can work together to make all or most colleges affordable and sustainable for students, whether they are middle class or lower income.” College benefactors could also band together and donate to community and other public colleges each year.
Finally, they could donate to local, state and national candidates who are supporting student debt relief or who propose to make college free or highly subsidized. Supporting these candidates isn’t going to provide structural transformation in and of itself. But if the candidates win, their policies could bring about these changes. The truth is, real change may not require shocking amounts of private money, but rather brave public policy.

Texto completo: Un giro inesperado para muchos se dio ayer cuando, luego de ser buscado activamente por 10 días, el tercer niño sospechoso en la muerte de la estudiante Tessa Majors (18) en Morningside Park fue liberado apenas unas horas después de ser capturado.
La policía está buscando más evidencia de la muerte por apuñalamiento de la estudiante de Barnard College, después de que el niño no identificado de 14 años fue liberado.
El tercer sospechoso había sido localizado el jueves en un apartamento en El Bronx . Fue llevado a la comisaría 26 en Harlem , donde le tomaron las huellas digitales y muestras de ADN, reportó Fox News.
“Éste fue un avance significativo en el proceso de investigación”, dijo el jefe de detectives de NYPD, Rodney Harrison, en Twitter. “Aunque desde entonces ha sido puesto en libertad bajo la custodia de sus abogados, la investigación sigue siendo muy activa. Nuestros detectives son los mejores en lo que hacen y están comprometidos a encontrar justicia para todas las partes involucradas”.
La policía cree que la familia del adolescente lo estaba escondiendo mientras se curaba una herida en su mano, consistente con un mordisco , informó The New York Times.
Éste niño de 14 años es uno de los tres adolescentes que se cree están involucrado en el horrible asesinato del 11 de diciembre.
La policía ya había arrestado a Zyairr Davis, de 13 años, acusándolo de asesinato grave y hurto, después de que supuestamente admitió haber participado en el robo, pero negó haber apuñalado a la alumna de Barnard College, nativa de Charlottesville (Virginia).
Otro sospechoso de 14 años también fue detenido, pero igualmente liberado luego de varias horas de interrogatorio por falta de evidencia el 13 de diciembre, dijeron fuentes policiales.
Supuestamente Davis, el único que permanece detenido, identificó como “el asesino de Majors” al joven liberado ayer , y dijo que los tres habían ido al parque a robar, cuando se toparon con la joven alumna nativa de Charlottesville (Virginia).
El caso sigue abierto. Quien posea información debe llamar a 1-800-577-TIPS (8477) y en español 1-888-57-PISTA (74782). También a través de la página crimestoppers.nypdonline.org o por mensaje de texto a 274637 (CRIMES), seguido por TIP577. Todas las comunicaciones son estrictamente confidenciales.
* Alerta: los delincuentes de Nueva York son cada vez más jóvenes
Although he has since been released to the custody of his attorneys, the investigation remains very active.

Texto completo: RIO RANCHO, N.M. — Tara Westover’s memoir “Educated” (2018) was published nearly two years ago and has been a New York Times, Boston Globe and Wall Street Journal bestseller, as well as a finalist for several prestigious awards, including the PEN/Jean Stein Book Award.
The accolades are well-deserved. “Educated” is a compelling read.
In the book, Westover chronicles her journey from being the youngest of seven children raised by Mormon survivalist parents in rural Idaho to receiving a doctorate in history from Cambridge University. She characterizes her family, in particular her father, as devout yet fanatic.
Convinced the end of the world is near, her father stockpiles ammunition, food and fuel. Her mother, a skilled herbalist and midwife, treats all the family’s medical problems, including third-degree burns and head trauma.
A horrific car accident leaves Westover’s mother incapacitated for several months and with “raccoon eyes,” suggestive of neurological damage, yet she never sees a doctor.
Westover and her siblings are ostensibly home-schooled, but in reality they are responsible for their own education. And that’s not an easy undertaking, given that their father dissuades them from studying and will frequently demand they help out in his scrapping business.
Her older brother, Tyler, disregards their father’s wishes and spends days reading in a cubbyhole in the basement, preparing for the ACT. He becomes the first in the family to attend college, and he encourages Westover to do the same, which she does.
At 17, she leaves home to attend Brigham Young University.
It is here that Westover’s upbringing directly confronts the outside world.
From not knowing of the Holocaust to dressing differently and not washing her hands after using the bathroom, Westover feels very much the outsider.
Yet, she perseveres. She attends Cambridge University on a full scholarship, receives a doctorate in history and becomes a senior research fellow at Harvard Kennedy School Shorenstein Center.
By all accounts, Westover is a success. She is educated, lauded for her accomplishments; however, her success has come at an emotional cost.
She is estranged from all but two members of her family, her brothers Tyler and Richard. Her parents have characterized her as being possessed by Satan.
She is no longer a part of the culture that raised her, yet that culture will be with her always, for it has educated her just as much as the schools she attended.
As a former writing instructor at New Mexico State University-Grants, “Educated” reminded me of my own students who had come from such similar backgrounds, who’d been home-schooled, who lived off the grid without electricity or water, and for whom college was such a new, strange and not necessarily friendly culture. I marveled then at my students’ ability to navigate that culture and claim their education, just as I now marvel at Westover’s ability to do so.
I recommend this book without reservation.

Texto completo: Our guide to the city's best classical music and opera happening this weekend and in the week ahead.
ARTEK at the Church of St. Mary the Virgin (Dec. 28, 8 p.m.). Gwendolyn Toth will direct this highly rated period instrument ensemble in a program built around the Monteverdi Mass "In Illo Tempore," which was published as a companion to the much more famous "Vespers." The performers, instrumentalists and singers alike, will weave in other pieces by Monteverdi, as well as music by Gabrieli.

NEW YORK STRING ORCHESTRA at Carnegie Hall (Dec. 28, 8 p.m.). The young players of this annually refreshed ensemble return for their second concert of the holiday season, led by Jaime Laredo. On the bill are Mendelssohn's early Sinfonia No. 10, Brahms's portentous Symphony No. 1 and Tchaikovsky's evergreen Violin Concerto. Shannon Lee is the soloist.

SEMPLICE PLAYERS at Bargemusic (Dec. 31, 7 p.m.; Jan. 1, 3 p.m.). For the Met, the Philharmonic and other New York institutions, New Year's Eve and New Year's Day are gala season. Spare a thought for Bargemusic, though: Its artistic director and stalwart violinist, Mark Peskanov, joins the Semplice Players to celebrate with Vivaldi's Concerto for Four Violins in B minor, Bach's Concerto for Two Violins in D minor and Mendelssohn's Octet.

TENET VOCAL ARTISTS at St. Jean Baptiste Church (Jan. 2-3, 7 p.m.). The Green Mountain Project reaches its final performance of Monteverdi's "Vespers" of 1610, the last in a series that has been ongoing since 2010, when the project gave what was thought to be the first performance of the work for its 400th anniversary. Performers will include the soprano and artistic director Jolle Greenleaf, and the cornets and sackbuts of the Dark Horse Consort.

'WOZZECK' at the Metropolitan Opera (Dec. 27, 8 p.m.; Jan. 2, 8 p.m.; through Jan. 22). The artist William Kentridge follows up his pioneering productions of "Lulu" and "The Nose" with Berg's first opera, a take that my colleague Zachary Woolfe called extraordinary on its debut at the Salzburg Festival in 2017. The Met's music director, Yannick Nézet-Séguin, wields the baton for this run, with Peter Mattei as Wozzeck, Elza van den Heever as Marie, Christopher Ventris as the Drum Major, Gerhard Siegel as the Captain, Andrew Staples as Andres and Tamara Mumford as Margret. Also at the Met are "Der Rosenkavalier" on Saturday and Wednesday evening and the family-friendly "Magic Flute" on Saturday and Thursday afternoon.

Texto completo: Afghan official says Taliban abducted 26 peace activists
KABUL, Afghanistan -- The Taliban ambushed a peace convoy in western Afghanistan and abducted 26 activists who are members of a peace movement, a police spokesman said Wednesday.
The insurgents staged the ambush in the district of Bala Buluk in Farah province on Tuesday. The Taliban forced the six-vehicle convoy to a halt, then got into the cars and drove them and the activists to an unknown location, said provincial police spokesman Mohibullah Mohib.
According to Mohib, a police operation is underway to locate and free the activists whose convoy was going village-to-village to rally for peace.
Bismillah Watandost of the People's Peace Movement of Afghanistan, to which the activists belong, said that 27 of their members were abducted by the Taliban in the Farah assault. The different figures could not immediately be reconciled.
The Taliban, who have been active in Farah, have not claimed responsibility for the abductions. However, Watandost also said that tribal elders in the province launched an effort to negotiate with the Taliban to release the abducted activists. He added that phone lines were down in the region, making communication and getting information from the area difficult.
The latest rallies by the activists from the People's Peace Movement of Afghanistan started on Friday, first in southern Helmand province, a Taliban stronghold.
At a similar series of peace rallies in October, the Taliban abducted six activists from the movement in eastern Logar province but released them the same day.

Time and cost of relocation of US base in Okinawa to double
TOKYO -- The relocation of a U.S. Marine Corps base to a less-crowded area of the southern Japanese island of Okinawa will take more than twice as much money and time as previously estimated because of the need to stabilize the reclaimed land it will be built on, Japan's government said Wednesday.
The Defense Ministry said the relocation of U.S. Marine Corps Air Station Futenma from densely populated Ginowan to Henoko on Okinawa's eastern coast will cost $8.5 billion and take 12 years, pushing its completion into the 2030s. That adds more than a decade to the plan already delayed by more than 20 years because of local opposition.
Under an earlier plan agreed to by Tokyo and Washington in 2013, construction was to cost about $3.2 billion and take five years, with completion expected in about 2022.

Michigan AG asserts Nassar probe not suspended after all
LANSING, Mich. -- Michigan's attorney general on Wednesday said her communications director's statement declaring the suspension of a nearly two-year criminal investigation into Michigan State University's handling of complaints against sexual abuser Larry Nassar was "inadvertently misleading."
Attorney General Dana Nessel said in a written statement that the investigation is ongoing.
The probe, which began under Nessel's predecessor, has resulted in charges against three former school officials. One was convicted. Two others, including former President Lou Anna Simon, were ordered to trial.
"For the record, I remain deeply committed to finding the truth about who knew what about Larry Nassar at MSU, " Nessel said.

Songwriter Allee Willis, who penned 'Friends' theme, dies
LOS ANGELES -- Allee Willis, a songwriter whose work included the Broadway musical "The Color Purple" as well as the theme song from the TV show "Friends" and Earth, Wind & Fire's "September," has died. She was 72.
The cause of death Tuesday was a cardiac event, The New York Times reported, but did not specify where she died, though she had been living in Los Angeles.
Willis was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2018 -- more than 30 years after she won a Grammy for co-writing Patti LaBelle's "Stir It Up" for the "Beverly Hills Cop" soundtrack.
She was also nominated for an Emmy for the "Friends" theme song, "I'll Be There for You" performed by the Rembrandts but lost to the theme of "Star Trek: Voyager."

Burning Man organizers sue over US permit fees
RENO, Nev. -- Burning Man organizers sued the U.S. Bureau of Land Management to recover millions of dollars they say the government has overcharged them in fees over the past seven years at the counterculture celebration.
Black Rock City LLC, the nonprofit that produces the annual Burning Man event, filed the lawsuit Dec. 13 in U.S. District Court in Washington.
Organizers told the Reno Gazette Journal they're tired of waiting over the past four years for the bureau to provide justification for the nearly $3 million it charges annually for a permit to hold the 80,000-person event in the Black Rock Desert about 100 miles north of Reno.
In recent years, Black Rock City has been required to reimburse the BLM, which provides law enforcement and oversight at the event, for its services and expenses.

Relief group: 216,000 have fled homes in NW Syria
BEIRUT -- More than 200,000 men, women and children fled their homes in northwest Syria in buses, trucks and cars in recent weeks, amid intense air and ground bombardment by government forces, a Syrian relief group said Wednesday.
Government forces have been bombarding southern and eastern Idlib province, the last rebel stronghold in the country, since late November. A ground offensive that began last week has displaced more people and government forces have captured more than 40 villages and hamlets, according to the Syrian army and opposition activists.
The Syrian Response Coordination Group, a relief organization, said 216,632 people have fled their homes, many of them with no specific place to go. Many have been heading toward the Turkish border for safety.

In Chile: Helicopters on Wednesday dropped water on the outskirts of the Chilean port city of Valparaiso to extinguish a fire that destroyed about 150 homes.
Dozens of people living in the city's Rocuant and San Roque hills sifted through the ruins of their homes after the fire, fanned by strong winds, swept through their neighborhoods on Tuesday. Residents had been evacuated and there were no reports of casualties.
Interior Minister Gonzalo Blumel said authorities believe arson caused the blaze and urged people to report any suspicious activity.
The fire was doused in urban areas but remains "active" in the woods, said Ricardo Toro, head of the national emergency office.

Texto completo: People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals
With acrimonious partisan rhetoric at a fever pitch, one might wonder if there is anything both sides of the aisle can agree on. It turns out there is: protecting animals. The Preventing Animal Cruelty and Torture Act, a bipartisan bill that makes it a felony to torture and kill animals for fetish videos, passed both the House and the Senate unanimously before being signed into law by President Donald Trump.
The New York Times called PACT’s passage “a rare display of political unity,” but what’s not rare is the growing realization by people in red, blue and purple states that animals are thinking, feeling individuals who deserve respect and protection. It’s a sea change that is being felt all over the world. PACT is the latest in a series of groundbreaking laws protecting animals, including New York City’s ban on foie gras, California’s ban on selling fur, Florida’s ban on dog racing, Canada’s ban on whale and dolphin captivity, Norway’s ban on fur farming and the United Arab Emirate’s ban on abandoning animals. These laws didn’t pass in a vacuum. They are a sign of people’s changing attitudes toward animals.
People aren’t just asking if the tanks at SeaWorld are too small — they’re recognizing that it’s wrong to confine and display intelligent, social, sensitive orcas at all. Companies are seeing the writing on the wall — and they’re responding by changing their business models.
Airbnb, TripAdvisor and other travel companies have stopped promoting SeaWorld and other venues that imprison animals for “entertainment.” One of the biggest of the big-box stores, Walmart, has stopped selling live fish. Longtime PETA targets Chanel, Coach, Gucci, Michael Kors, Prada and Versace have all gone fur-free. Restaurant chains are rolling out more vegan options every day, including Panera Bread, Uno Pizzeria & Grill, Subway (which began testing a new Beyond meatball sub), Del Taco and Dunkin’ Donuts (full disclosure: I had one of their delicious vegan sausage sandwiches for breakfast before writing this). And institutions ranging from the Environmental Protection Agency and the National Institutes of Health to cereal giant Kellogg’s are embracing superior, non-animal testing methods.
As PETA’s mission statement reads, “Animals are not ours to experiment on, eat, wear, use for entertainment, or abuse in any other way,” which means that those “others” who happen not to have been born human have the right to live out their own lives and pursue their own interests and don’t exist simply for humans to do with as we please, even robbing them of their very lives just for a sandwich or a pair of shoes.
In our new book, Animalkind, Gene Stone and I discuss aspects of animals’ rich emotional lives — from crow funerals and mouse love songs to sentinel geese and war-hero pigeons — and point out how similar humans and other animals are in all the ways that matter. We quote Dr. Thom van Dooren, an Australian anthropologist who argues that “human exceptionalism” — the belief that humans are superior to all other beings — has harmed our understanding of other animals. I believe it has also harmed our understanding of ourselves and our place in the world. Animals aren’t like us — they are us. Discriminating against animals simply because they are covered with fur, feathers or scales is as offensive as any other form of discrimination and just as unjustified.
If we shrug off speciesism, we show ourselves to be not superior to other animals but, rather, inferior to them, such as the kind, sensitive rat I mention in my book who opted to starve rather than subject another rat to an electrical shock, or the goose who tried to comfort his dying mate in her final moments.
To reject discrimination, exploitation and violence based merely on species, we must take a hard look at our personal choices and change those that harm animals. We can go vegan to combat climate change or to clean out our clogged arteries, or we can do it because it is simply wrong to exploit, hurt and kill other living beings on a whim. Whether the victim is tortured for a sexual fetish or for a birthday celebration at a fancy restaurant, what matters is the suffering that went into that online video or that surf-and-turf special and the recognition that we can and must do something to stop it.

Giving the Gift of Surveillance

Texto completo: As 2019 comes to a close, millions of new spying devices are headed for American homes.
The grass-roots surveillance network in the United States is poised for yet another major expansion this Christmas season. Think of each new Ring video doorbell, discount DNA test, WiFi-equipped clothes dryer, smart speaker and mobile phone as a new node on the world's most advanced and pervasive effort at human monitoring. All that data is collected by someone, somewhere.
It was hard not to cast a slightly jaded eye at the packages under my own tree after working for months on the Times Opinion Privacy Project's investigation into the location tracking industry. That investigation, based on a dataset provided by sources alarmed by the unchecked power of the tracking industry, offered a look at more than 50 billion location pings from the phones of more than 12 million Americans across several major cities. We were able to easily identify Americans who work for the Secret Service and the local high school, their lives and movements an open book simply because they downloaded an app on their smartphone and enabled -- wittingly or unwittingly -- location services.
It is easy to read through the series and conclude that all is lost, that privacy is dead or at least archaic and that there's simply no reforming the data-dependent culture that Americans have unintentionally embraced. After all, anyone who uses devices like smartphones, smart speakers and smart televisions has only the illusion of control when it comes to protecting personal privacy, because the government hasn't seen fit to ban even the most intrusive data collection practices.
Some day, my child will look back aghast and ask: Wait, Dad, that was all legal?
So, what to make of all the new data-gobbling devices given by the millions? I'd say cast them into the sea, but there's far too much plastic there as it is.
I reached out to some of the dozens of technology experts, government officials, lawyers, privacy professionals and several others who have served as a sort of informal brain trust since the Privacy Project started in April. Several pointed to a list of some of the best and worst gifts for privacy, compiled by Mozilla. Scroll down the list and a helpful emoji guide gets more and more freaked out by how creepy the devices are.
Trevor Hughes, president of the International Association of Privacy Professionals, said that a good first question to answer is this: How does this new device affect the privacy of other people? For instance, he said: "Does your drone create a privacy issue for your neighbors? How about your Ring doorbell -- are you connecting to some of the neighborhood watch programs? And what about that DNA test? You will be unlocking information that could expose family secrets or indiscretions that have long been buried."
A federal law enforcement official told me: "Last year, my husband gave me a DNA test for Christmas. I thanked him and threw it in the trash." DNA tests can show where your ancestors may have come from, but it can also compromise the privacy of your descendants for generations to come. The Pentagon this week warned members of the military not to use consumer DNA kits because they pose a security risk. Some stocking stuffer.
One expert warned the recipients of smart devices to change the user names and passwords without the gift giver present, noting the often irresistible temptation humans have to spy on their loved ones.
Woodrow Hartzog, a professor at Northeastern University Law School, offered a more optimistic framing of the WiFi-connected devices -- the so-called internet of things -- that now populate our homes: "If it's an internet of things gift that has a 'dumb switch' that allows me simply to disable the connectivity while still using the product (imagine an IoT coffee maker), I happily accept the gift and thank them for giving me something with such versatility. I think it's a positive thing to emphasize products that will allow me to use them even if I don't want to hook them up to the internet."
Another privacy thinker advised to buy only smart technology that you would bring into your own home. Think Alexa is too creepy for your kitchen? No fair giving it to Aunt Mary. Privacy, after all, is a collective problem. One thing to keep in mind is that the price of a gadget is often discounted because of the value of all the data the user will provide the gadget maker over the life of the product.
Senator Ron Wyden, a Democrat from Oregon who has been sounding the alarm about privacy-eviscerating technology for years, was at once resigned to the infiltration of these gadgets into American life and hopeful for a safer future. "Realistically, pretty much anyone who uses a device that connects to the internet is going to be swept up into a shady data broker's trove of information," he said. "So I'd tell my friends and family the same thing I tell my constituents: The best thing to do is push for new laws, with teeth, to stop wireless companies and app developers and other corporations from abusing your personal data."
That's a New Year's resolution I can endorse.

Texto completo: Correction: Harvey Weinstein: In the Dec. 26 California section, an article about Harvey Weinstein described Deputy Dist. Atty. Paul Thompson as head of the sex crimes unit at the L.A. County district attorney's office. He is not head of the unit.
More than two years after the Los Angeles and Beverly Hills police departments launched sexual assault investigations into Harvey Weinstein, the Los Angeles County district attorney's office has escalated its review into the disgraced filmmaker and is considering filing criminal charges against him, law enforcement sources said.
In all, eight cases are under review by the district attorney's office, a spokesperson for the agency said. Four of the cases are from the Los Angeles Police Department and four are from the Beverly Hills Police Department, sources said.
The office could act in the new year, before Manhattan prosecutors complete their criminal trial of the once high-flying movie producer, set to begin in January, said people familiar with the investigation who were not authorized to comment.

Sources have confirmed to The Times that the district attorney's sex crimes division has intensified contact with at least two accusers and has broadened its review to include several other women across the country who have accused Weinstein of sexual misconduct.
This stepped-up investigation could open up a second plank of prosecution for the embattled mogul, who faces four criminal sex crimes charges involving three women in New York.
A spokesperson for Weinstein declined to comment. The former film producer has pleaded not guilty to the charges. He has denied all allegations of nonconsensual sex.
A spokesman for the Los Angeles district attorney's office declined to comment.
Two of the key cases prosecutors are weighing involved separate alleged sexual assaults that occurred at two hotels during the same week in February 2013.
In October 2017, Los Angeles Police Capt. Billy Hayes confirmed that the department had opened an investigation into Weinstein after an Italian model-actress filed a report, alleging that Weinstein raped her at the Mr. C Beverly Hills hotel in 2013.
This was the first case related to Weinstein to be reported in Southern California.
The actress said she met and briefly spoke with the producer during the Los Angeles Italia Film, Fashion and Art Fest that year, after which he "bullied" his way into her hotel room.
The actress described the alleged incident in an earlier interview with The Times. "Once inside, he asked me questions about myself, but soon became very aggressive and demanding and kept asking to see me naked." She said that she showed him pictures of her children as she cried and begged him to go away.
"He grabbed me by the hair and forced me to do something I did not want to do," she said, saying that Weinstein forced her to perform oral sex on him. "He then dragged me to the bathroom and forcibly raped me."
According to law enforcement sources, the actress did not immediately report the alleged incident. But she did tell three people what happened to her, including her priest.
Investigators traveled to Italy, where she lived at the time of the alleged assault, and independently verified their accounts.
Since the allegation surfaced, Weinstein's attorneys have vigorously denied that he was at Mr. C Beverly Hills that night. He has also denied ever being alone with the accuser.
"My client is fully cooperating with law enforcement and the D.A.'s office," said David Ring, the attorney for the Italian actress. "She will appear and tell the jury how Weinstein raped her in a Beverly Hills hotel room in 2013. ... It will be difficult and stressful for her, but she knows it must occur in order to convict Weinstein, who continues to buy time with delaying tactics."
A second woman who alleges that Weinstein assaulted her on Feb. 19, 2013 -- several hours before the Italian actress alleged she was raped, also in Beverly Hills -- may testify in the New York trial as a witness to his prior behavior.
According to a source familiar with the investigation, this second victim, who is described in New York court documents, contacted the New York Police Department about a separate incident of sexual assault involving Weinstein at a Beverly Hills hotel.
The NYPD referred the case to Beverly Hills police for investigation, according to the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity in order to discuss the matter candidly.
Beverly Hills police have declined to make public any details of their investigations into Weinstein.
The L.A. County district attorney's sex crimes unit has ramped up its inquiry into allegations of sexual assault allegations in other jurisdictions against Weinstein in recent months, sources told The Times.
Aaron Filler, the attorney representing actress Paz de la Huerta in a civil suit against Weinstein for sexual battery, said that he received a telephone call from Deputy Dist. Atty. Paul Thompson, head of the sex crimes unit, about a month ago, requesting an interview with his client.
De la Huerta alleges that Weinstein raped her twice in her New York apartment in December 2010.
Filler said that Thompson told him that L.A. was starting its own prosecution of Weinstein.
"My impression was that they are commencing a wide-ranging criminal investigation and at this point are reaching out to every victim they can identify and try and do telephone interviews around the country," Thompson said. "They have more leeway to reach out to more victims in more jurisdictions and bring them into a courtroom than in New York."
Unlike New York, California law allows for "me too" evidence of sexual harassment and discrimination described by other employees to be presented at trial. In other words, prosecutors here could have multiple accusers who are not plaintiffs testify against Weinstein.
In addition to the New York criminal case, there is a class-action suit and at least 18 women with individual suits against Weinstein, alleging sexual misconduct, assault or harassment.
According to Filler, De la Huerta, who lives in New York, had a brief telephone conversation with Thompson but would prefer to meet with him in person. To date, they have not scheduled a meeting.
An attorney representing an accuser in her suit against Weinstein, alleging that the producer raped her, said that he also received a request from Thompson to talk with his client within the last month.
Although his client declined to speak with Thompson, saying the civil suit has "put her through the wringer," the attorney characterized his conversation with the assistant district attorney by saying, "It sounded like they are moving forward."
In the two years since the New York Times and the New Yorker first detailed decades of sexual misconduct allegations against Weinstein, criminal investigations have opened in Los Angeles, London and New York. However, only the New York district attorney's office has pursued criminal charges against the fallen movie mogul.
Two years ago, L.A. County Dist. Atty. Jackie Lacey formed a special task force dedicated to investigating allegations of sexual assault roiling Hollywood. She assigned a group of veteran sex crimes prosecutors to "ensure a uniformed approach to the legal review and possible prosecution of any case that meets both the legal and factual standards for criminal prosecution."
To date, the task force has yet to charge any of the more than two dozen men subject to investigations by law enforcement. Many of those allegations were too old to prosecute and in other cases there was insufficient evidence; they include allegations involving actors Steven Seagal and Kevin Spacey.
Lacey, who is running for a third term as district attorney, faces a slew of challengers and renewed pressure for declining to prosecute several high-profile sex abuse cases.
Meanwhile, Weinstein's legal woes continue to mount. A former teen model, Kaja Sokola, filed a lawsuit last week against the producer under the Child Victims Act, alleging the former filmmaker sexually assaulted her at his New York City apartment in 2002 when she was 16.
Sokola was initially part of a federal class-action suit filed in December 2017 against the filmmaker. Weinstein and his former film studio's board have reached a controversial $47-million settlement with several women who have accused him of sexual misconduct, according to attorneys involved in the negotiations.
About $25 million will be allocated to the accusers, $7.3 million to unsecured creditors and former Weinstein Co. employees, and about $12.2 million will be earmarked to pay legal fees of the studio's directors and officers, according to a copy of the settlement term sheet obtained by The Times. Weinstein Co. filed for bankruptcy protection in March 2018.
Weinstein, the producer behind such Oscar-winning hits as "Shakespeare in Love," "Chicago" and "The King's Speech," was fired from his company in October 2017 after dozens of women accused him of sexual misconduct.
Last week, Weinstein was widely criticized for calling himself "the forgotten man" in an interview with the New York Post and citing how many women he helped during his career. The comments triggered a swift backlash, including a formal statement signed by 23 of his accusers.

Texto completo: The soapy serial-killer series "You" returns on Netflix. And Céline Sciamma's "Girlhood" is streaming on Criterion Channel.
What's Streaming
YOU Stream on Netflix. "Love has taken me to dark places," the charming serial killer Joe Goldberg (Penn Badgley) says early in the new season of this series. "But Los Angeles has got to be as dark as it gets." Originally a Lifetime series, "You" picked up steam near the beginning of the year after its first season became available on Netflix. That season played something like "Dexter" crossed with a soap opera: It followed Joe, a killer, as he pursued a romantic obsession in New York City (the relationship didn't pan out). The new, second season moves the action to the West Coast. It gives Joe a job at a gourmet market and a fresh fixation: a co-worker played by Victoria Pedretti. "The new location allows the showrunner, Sera Gamble, and her staff to add Southern California stereotypes to the generational and class formulas that draw Joe's scorn," Mike Hale wrote in his review of the second season for The New York Times, "and to throw the Hollywood melodrama into the genre blender along with the rom-com." He called the show "one of television's more addictive treats."
FRANCES HA (2013) Stream on Netflix; rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes and YouTube. Both the star (Greta Gerwig) and the director (Noah Baumbach) of "Frances Ha" have new movies out right now: Gerwig just released an adaptation of Louisa May Alcott's "Little Women," and Baumbach came out with the divorce tale "Marriage Story." The two wrote the screenplay of this drama, in which Gerwig plays the title character, an aspiring dancer who spends her late 20s learning tough life lessons in a New York City filmed in soft black and white. (The cinematographer is Sam Levy.) The cast also includes Adam Driver, who's now in theaters in both "Marriage Story" and "Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker" -- a movie that's about as far as you can get from "Frances Ha."
GIRLHOOD (2014) Stream on Criterion Channel; rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. The outskirts of Paris provide the stage of this feature from the French filmmaker Céline Sciamma ("Portrait of a Lady on Fire"). The story centers on Marieme (Karidja Touré), who comes out of her shell -- and gets into some profoundly difficult situations -- after falling in with a posse of young women. It's a coming-of-age story that "honors the genre, and its main character, with exemplary sensitivity and sympathy," A.O. Scott wrote in his review for The Times. Sciamma, he added, "revels in the risky, reckless exuberance of adolescence and in the sheer joy of filming it."
What's on TV
MINIONS (2015) 6 p.m. on FX. Expect the little yellow creatures from this animated family movie to infest toy stores next holiday season, after a sequel is released over the summer. For now, families at home for the holidays can tune in to the original, a "Despicable Me" spinoff whose celebrity voice cast includes Sandra Bullock, Jon Hamm, Michael Keaton and Allison Janney.

Couple adopts seven in one year

Texto completo: A t the beginning of this year, James and Whitney Meserve were childless.
They had foster children to love and care for, but no kids to call their own.
That's all history now.
On Feb. 26, the Pellville-area couple adopted Norah, 12, and Sebastian, 11. And last week, they added Aubrey, 11; Jayda, 10; Preslee, 9; Ry'Lynne, 8; and Addison, 4.
In less than a year, the Meserve family has mushroomed from two to nine.
"It's a Christmas miracle," Jayda said.
Last week's adoption ceremony captured the nation's heart. The Meserve family was featured on Good Morning America, ABC News and the New York Times.
On Tuesday, an unexpected box from the New York Yankees showed up on the family's front porch. It was filled with Yankees hoodies, rings and other items.
"We would have never thought it would be this big," Whitney Meserve said of all the attention.
Odd beginnings
When James and Whitney Meserve met in 2010, he was sporting a mohawk.
He and his best friend bet against each other on the Super Bowl game each year. That year, they agreed the loser would get a mohawk haircut.
see family/page a2
Pretty quickly, Whitney Meserve scratched him off her list of eligible bachelors. He didn't seem to be her type.
A few months later, however, she was on OKCupid.com, a dating website. Guess who popped up: James Meserve.
She gave him a second look and messaged him. About a week later, he called.
"It was love at first date," he said.
On Oct. 13, 2012, they married at St. Williams Catholic Church in Knottsville.
Before tying the knot, they talked about having kids. She wanted one or two. He was fine with as many as nine.
Living on faith
For years, the Meserves tried to have children, but Whitney Meserve had multiple medical problems that kept that dream from becoming reality.
They looked into private adoption and in vitro fertilization. Both were too costly.
Then, someone mentioned foster care and all the children across Kentucky who need good homes.
On faith, the Meserves earlier had purchased a six-bedroom, three-bath home. "We knew one day we would have a family," James Meserve said.
In September 2015, the couple started fostering. Since then, they've provided homes to 14 children, and they have adopted half of them.
"Our life is complete," Whitney Meserve said. "Right now, we have our forever family."
God builds a family
About 9 p.m. on Feb. 5, 2016, foster care officials contacted the Meserves. The officials were trying to place a sibling set of five girls.
The youngest, Addison, was 7 months old at the time.
Foster care officials asked the Meserves how many they would take. Two? Three?
Without hesitation, the Meserves said they wanted all of them.
Then, in July 2018, Norah and Sebastian came to live with the Meserves. Before their adoption earlier this year, the pair of siblings had spent 1,792 days in foster care homes, group homes and other places.
"We were their forever home placement," James Meserve said. " ... When you're a foster parent, your journey starts on Day 1. You just don't know where the journey ends."
James Meserve is a 36-year-old senior supply chain analyst at Aleris. His wife works as an assistant at Pellville Early Learning Preschool.
She also works full time at South Hancock Elementary School as an intervention aid through the AmeriCorps program.
In her spare time, Whitney Meserve is enrolled in Western Governors University. She plans to earn a bachelor's degree in education.
Passing along hope
Aubrey loves to write.
She has written devotionals that she hopes to publish and share with foster children someday.
Like her sister, Aubrey believes her recent adoption is a Christmas miracle.
"We have waited so long for this," she said.
The past few years have been a roller coaster of emotions for everyone involved, but the Meserves never lost faith that God would fill their six-bedroom home with the love and laughter of children.
"Adoptions do happen," James Meserve said. "We hope someone hears about us and is inspired to do the same."
What's next?
The Meserve house is full. The Meserves' hearts are full.
Evidently not too full, though.
Their home remains open for foster children. Also, when their brood grows up and leaves home, the Meserves plan to foster hard-to-place teens.
"It's all for God's glory," Whitney Meserve said. " ... We have prayed for this to happen. God answers prayers."

Texto completo: He reported on Castro's rise and the Bay of Pigs invasion and, as an opinion writer, criticized, in retrospect, a Times reporter's Stalin-era dispatches.
Karl E. Meyer, a third-generation journalist who fortified his reporting as a foreign correspondent and editorial writer for The Washington Post and The New York Times with a scholar's grasp of historical context, died on Sunday in Manhattan. He was 91.
The cause was prostate cancer, his wife, Shareen Blair Brysac, said.
As one of the most adventurous reporters of his generation, Mr. Meyer covered Fidel Castro's revolution in Cuba, the disastrous Bay of Pigs invasion there, the Soviet Union's invasion of Czechoslovakia, the plundering of the world's cultural patrimony and much more.
As a columnist and editorialist with a doctorate in politics, he shaped and supported his opinions through firsthand reporting, defying what he once called the patron of his "unruly calling," St. Simeon Stylites, who pontificated for 30 years from atop a stone pillar (or column) in fifth-century Syria without abandoning his perch.
In 1962, Mr. Meyer, mining his sources for The Post, and Tad Szulc, a correspondent for The Times, jointly detailed the Bay of Pigs episode in the book "The Cuban Invasion: The Chronicle of a Disaster."
Mr. Szulc had broken the news early in 1961 that a rebel army was being covertly trained to topple Castro. The publisher of The Times agreed, in the interests of national security, not to report that the invasion was imminent and that the plot was being financed and directed by the Central Intelligence Agency.
President John F. Kennedy had been publicly furious about disclosures about the preparations for the raid. But he later confided to The Times's managing editor at the time, Turner Catledge, "If you had printed more about the operation, you would have saved us from a colossal mistake."
Mr. Meyer had also been among the first journalists to report on the failed coup.
It was not Mr. Meyer's first encounter with Castro; in the late 1950s he interrupted a vacation to arrange a secret rendezvous with him in Castro's mountain retreat. In a deliberately cryptic cable to Robert H. Estabrook, The Post's editorial page editor, from Santiago de Cuba, on the island's southeast coast, Mr. Meyer wrote: "Business good in our calling. Need more time to interview brothers. Unless I hear from you, I will be off."
When Mr. Meyer did not hear back, he took off by horseback. He returned to Santiago de Cuba to find a return telegram from his editor. "Take all the time you need," it said. He had already gathered enough information to produce a five-part series on Castro's revolutionary agenda.
In 1968, Mr. Meyer scored a hard-to-get visa to Czechoslovakia after lunching with Joseph Alsop, the influential Post columnist. Mr. Alsop, he recalled, referred him to a photograph showing the Czech leader Alexander Dubcek with Soviet leaders and observed: "Of course the Russians will invade. You can tell by their expressions. They want to eat him alive."
Mr. Meyer arrived in Prague in time to cover the invasion.
He later said his diplomatic coverage had been guided by the advice of Flora Lewis, whom he succeeded as The Post's London bureau chief when she became The Times's foreign affairs columnist. He quoted her as saying: "Remember, Karl, it's not the ambassadors you want to cultivate but the No. 2 person in the embassy. They have better information and can afford to be indiscreet."
In 1990, as an editorial writer for The Times, Mr. Meyer was assigned the delicate task of responding to a new biography by S.J. Taylor, "Stalin's Apologist," which elaborated on serious reporting lapses by Walter Duranty, the Moscow bureau chief of The Times in the 1920s and early '30s.
In a signed editorial, Mr. Meyer concluded that Mr. Duranty had been guilty of "some of the worst reporting to appear in this newspaper" -- including his indifference to the 1930-31 famine in which millions perished in Ukraine, a result of Stalin's policy of forced collectivization of farms. Mr. Duranty had dismissed the reports of famine as "mostly bunk."
"Having bet his reputation on Stalin, he strove to preserve it by ignoring or excusing Stalin's crimes," Mr. Meyer wrote. "He saw what he wanted to see."
Mr. Duranty won a Pulitzer Prize for his coverage. In 2003, despite continued controversy over the award, the Pulitzer board decided that it did not have enough grounds to revoke the prize.
Mr. Meyer's opinion bore more fruit in another case, when ancient monuments were about to be lost to flooding with the construction of the Aswan Dam in Egypt in the 1960s.
He proposed in an editorial that one of the major artifacts be preserved and presented as a gift to the United States, which was providing major financial support for the dam project. The Egyptians selected the gift: the Temple of Dendur. The first lady, Jacqueline Kennedy, suggested the recipient: the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. The reconstructed temple remains a showpiece of the museum.
Karl Ernest Meyer was born on May 22, 1928, in Madison, Wis., a grandson of Georg Meyer, the editor of Die Germania, a German-language newspaper in Milwaukee in the early 1900s. Karl's father, Ernest L. Meyer, was a columnist for The Capital Times in Madison and moved to New York in 1935 to write a column for The New York Post. His mother, Dorothy (Narefsky) Meyer, was a teacher.
After graduating from the Elisabeth Irwin School in Greenwich Village, Mr. Meyer earned a bachelor's degree in history from the University of Wisconsin in 1951. He received a master's degree in public affairs from the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs at Princeton University and a doctorate in politics from Princeton.
He was hired by The Times as a reporter in 1952 and left four years later for The Post, where he was an editorial writer for eight years, London bureau chief for five and New York bureau chief for two. He was the American correspondent for the British magazine New Statesman from 1961 to 1965.
A visit to Peru in 1959 sparked an enduring fascination with archaeology, leading to Mr. Meyer's book "The Plundered Past" (1973). It was serialized in The New Yorker and became the basis of a 1974 ABC television documentary, "The Culture Thieves," which helped inspire a cultural heritage restitution movement.
Mr. Meyer had been a contributing editor and television columnist for the magazine Saturday Review for four years when he joined the Times editorial board as a senior writer on foreign affairs in 1979. He retired in 1998.
He edited World Policy Journal, the flagship publication of the World Policy Institute, from 2000 to 2008. In an interview with The Times while in that post in 2002, he warned about "the emergence of a politically powerful Christian right."
"It worries me, as I worry about the rise of militant Islam or Hindu nationalism," he said. "These are all variations of the same problem. They seek a theological sanction for secular foreign policy choices."
After he retired from The Times, Mr. Meyer and his wife, Ms. Brysac, who is also a journalist, wrote the first of five books on which they collaborated, "Tournament of Shadows: The Race for Empire in Central Asia" (1999), inspired by their trip through the Khyber Pass.
His first two marriages, to Iris Hill and Sarah Peck, ended in divorce. In addition to Ms. Brysac, whom he married in 1989, he is survived by three children from his second marriage, Ernest, Heather and Jonathan Meyer; three granddaughters; and his sister, Susan Meyer.
In 1990, Mr. Meyer edited an anthology, "Pundits, Poets and Wits: An Omnibus of American Newspaper Columns" (1990), in which he quoted an essayist's prediction in 1866 that with "the rise of neutral, fact-based reporting," editorials would soon be obsolete.
"The opposite happened," Mr. Meyer wrote. "Opinion journalism acquired fresh life, as readers, swamped by fact, turned to editorials for selection and judgment, salted by adjectives not sanctioned in news departments."
"They have been energetic advocates," he added, "exerting influence through the quality of their arguments and their independence from an electorate that has learned to put up with them."

California businesses at the breaking point due to minimum wage hikes

Texto completo: California’s minimum wage rises to $13 an hour on Jan. 1, and a number of its localities now have wage rates above $15 an hour.
Labor groups promised that $15 would be an economic boon for the state, while then-Gov. Jerry Brown worried that “economically, the minimum wage may not make sense.” The state’s experience with rapidly rising wage rates show the former governor was right to be concerned.
Consider the impact on the state’s full-service restaurant industry, which faces a double-whammy when the wage floor rises. California is one of a handful of states that doesn’t count tips towards an employee’s income; even if a server earns $300 on a Friday night, an effective wage rate of $60 an hour, his employer can’t count one cent of it towards the minimum wage requirement.
Restaurant owners are forced to give a raise to top-earning employees who take home far more than the minimum, with few options to offset the cost.
Paul Fraga, who announced he’s closing Sacramento diner Original Perry’s after more than 50 years in business, explained the dynamic. “For every dollar that [minimum wage] goes up, it costs me around $40,000…I can’t raise menu prices fast enough to compensate [for] that.” He added: “If they could sign a waiver, 99 percent of my servers would be against a minimum wage increase…”
Fraga isn’t alone in feeling the pinch from a rising minimum wage. Another affordably-priced option in town, the beloved Greek restaurant Opa! Opa!, announced that after 14 years in business it would be shuttering its doors. The owner said that since he first opened, prices have increased over 50 percent as a result of burdensome mandates placed on him by the state. Now, fourteen employees are left jobless right before the holidays.
These aren’t just anecdotes. Census Bureau data suggests the state’s restaurant owners have reacted to scaled-up wage costs by scaling back on hiring. In Los Angeles County, for instance, year-over-year full-service employment growth topped seven percent as recently as 2012; it’s fallen every year since then, and dipped below one percent in 2018. In Orange County, growth last year was near-zero.
A similar trend is seen statewide, with sub-one percent growth replacing five percent growth from as recently as 2013. In San Francisco County, stagnant growth turned negative last year, with the city losing nearly 1,000 restaurant jobs. A study published by Harvard University Business School and Mathematica examined the impacts of wage increases in the San Francisco Bay Area. The results were startling. The research found that each one dollar increase to the minimum wage resulted in a 14 percent increase in the likelihood that a 3.5 star (the median rating) restaurant would be forced to close.
Another study, recently released by my organization, found that in states like California with a high minimum wage for tipped employees, full-service restaurants hired 18 percent fewer tipped workers as a share of the workforce. In practice, that means full-service restaurants embrace self-service alternatives where the customer provides much of the service themselves. (The New York Times chronicled a trend in San Francisco of fine-dining restaurants adopting elements of fast-food style service models.)
Will California legislators wise up? Don’t hold your breath.
The state’s Future of Work Commission, which was assembled by the governor to examine future workplace challenges for employers and employees, is stacked with some of the very parties responsible for those challenges. SEIU president Mary Kay Henry, who co-chairs the governor’s commission, has overseen more than $100 million in spending on the Fight for $15, a policy that has forced countless employers to replace human employees with automated alternatives. Another commission member, labor activist Saru Jayaraman, has encouraged other states to follow California’s failed payment model for tipped employees. She’s been opposed in that goal by thousand of tipped servers, who understand the consequences for their own bottom line should their states make California’s mistake.
Gov. Newsom boasts that California is setting an example for the rest of the country to follow. He’s right; the state is showing the rest of the country why a $15 minimum wage is a bad idea.

An Immigrant's Gift on Christmas Eve

Texto completo: We could have been turned away at the border. But a law enforcement officer granted my family a few days of freedom.
On the night that we first came to the United States -- Christmas Eve, 1979 -- my mother, my brother and I were what President Trump would probably call illegal aliens. Like most of the immigrants at America's borders today, we were fleeing violence and instability in our native home.
In our case, the home we left behind was Iran, then in the grip of the Islamic Revolution. My parents and grandparents had watched, from the windows of the house we shared, as Tehran University was overrun by protesters. Rumors swirled that anyone who had a connection to Israel -- where both my parents had gone to college -- could be charged with Zionism, apparently a crime. As Jews, my parents and grandparents became afraid to go to work and even to leave the house. One day our next-door neighbors disappeared.
In February 1979, when the Ayatollah Khomeini returned to Iran from exile, intent on establishing an Islamic theocracy, my parents decided it was too dangerous to stay any longer. By that time, it was not possible to buy a plane ticket out of the country, but El Al, the Israeli national airline, still had some flights going in and out. My parents heard that Jews could board the planes before they flew back to Israel, and they decided that my mother would take my brother and me, 1 and 3 years old, while my father would join us later, after arranging my grandparents' affairs. Then we would travel to the United States.
My father took us to the airport, kissed us goodbye and promised to see us in a few days. But our flight turned out to be one of the last planes El Al flew out of Tehran. It was months before my father managed to get to Turkey and then reunite with us in Israel.
In Israel, my parents decided that my father should head to America first, to find work and housing. He entered the United States with a tourist visa and got a job in Maryland as a dishwasher. He made his way to New York City and secured work as a hydraulic engineer, his field in Iran, and eventually, an apartment for us in Rego Park, Queens. A few months later, my mother followed -- a 26-year-old woman with two children and a suitcase stuffed with pots and pans, a few items of clothing for each season, photo albums and a couple of toys.
The three of us arrived at J.F.K. Airport on Dec. 24, 1979. The tourist visas that we had in our Iranian passports were almost certainly fake; my mother had bought them at an exorbitant price from a travel agency that sold them to us in combination with our one-way tickets. And even if they had been real, we didn't look like tourists. How many tourists take their rice cooker on vacation?
When it was our turn for inspection, the Immigration and Naturalization Service officer -- very reasonably -- challenged my mother's claim that we had come for a short visit. My mother didn't say that what she really wanted was asylum, that we had a well-founded fear of persecution in our country of origin. My mother didn't know that those words had the power to keep us in America, that anyone on American soil had a right to be heard on that claim. Maybe because she had grown up in a country with no such protections, she couldn't imagine such a thing.
We could have been turned away. But that nameless I.N.S. officer -- about whom I know nothing other than how he conducted himself in that moment -- made a different decision. Before him stood a young mother traveling alone with her babies, visibly in need of refuge. She told him that the children wanted to see their father, that they had spent months apart. And he granted us "deferred inspection" -- meaning that we had permission but not authorization to enter the country -- and told us to come back to the airport right after the holiday for deportation.
I have thought a lot about that night in the years since. As a child, I attributed my freedom in this country to a small miracle -- the accident of having arrived on Dec. 24, a holy day for a vast majority of my new countrymen and women. Maybe that was why the officer exercised the law with mercy and compassion.
But as an adult, and over years as a law enforcement official, I came to understand better the true nature of my life's course -- a life and career made possible because the law was not enforced against me.
For those who support maximalist law enforcement -- and "sealed" borders -- my presence in the United States might look like a failure. But blind enforcement is not what it means to live in a society of laws. In a democracy, anyone who has the power to enforce the law also has the power -- and the duty -- to enforce it with discretion. Not every crime should lead to punishment. Not every punishment should be meted out at the maximum. Law enforcement requires us to exercise our humanity and sense of justice, always mindful of the demands of safety, in individual cases. Discretion in law enforcement can be abused, of course, but the alternative -- the letter of the law without the spirit of the law -- is worse.
I was lucky to stand before a law enforcement officer who understood this, and who granted my family a few days of freedom when we needed them most. Thanks to him, we were reunited with our father in Queens.
From there, my mother was able to call one of the only Americans she knew, a rabbi who told her about the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, a nonprofit devoted to helping refugees. The day after Christmas, we walked into the society's offices in downtown Manhattan and my parents learned how to apply for asylum.
The Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society continued to represent us, pro bono, for nearly a decade while my parents made their asylum case. Life during that time was not always easy. I remember coming home from school one afternoon to find my mother, who had found work as a schoolteacher, crying in the kitchen after a colleague had threatened to have her deported. I remember long days spent at the I.N.S. building in Newark, periodic reminders that even as our life in America took root, our situation was precarious.
Our uncertainty ended in 1986, when President Ronald Reagan signed a law making any immigrant who entered the country before 1982 eligible for amnesty. There has not been an amnesty program in this country since.
President Trump has radically changed both the letter and the spirit of the laws that govern immigration and asylum. His administration has issued more than 60 serious changes to the policies and rules that determine who may come to the United States and how. Taken together, these changes have curtailed the possibilities for countless children with cases like mine.
When I arrived in the United States, I was not separated from my parents. My parents were not arrested for an illegal border crossing. They were not turned away before they could explain why we sought asylum. We were not detained in cells. We did not have to rush through an expedited proceeding, forced to prepare our case in a matter of days or weeks. Instead, we were able to plead for refuge while living here in safety, with access to lawyers who helped us navigate the complexities of immigration law.
As a child, I was shown that the law could be enforced with goodness and humanity. For my family's first Christmas, America gave us safety, kept us together and offered us a chance at a new life. I wish the parents and children at our borders could expect the same gifts today.

Texto completo: John Kerry's windsurfing outings. John Edwards's $400 haircut, along with footage showing him primping in front of a mirror. Now, Pete Buttigieg is the latest Democratic presidential hopeful to face the "elitist" charge.
The South Bend, Indiana, mayor, 37, Thursday got pummeled by rival 2020 Democrats over a recent Napa Valley fundraiser with wealthy donors. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren led the charge, accusing Buttigieg of hobnobbing with millionaires in an ultra-exclusive "wine cave" in Northern California.
"The mayor just recently had a fundraiser that was held in a wine cave, full of crystals, and served $900-a-bottle wine," said Warren. "He had promised that every fundraiser he would do would be open-door, but this one was closed-door. We made the decision many years ago that rich people in smoke-filled rooms would not pick the next president of the United States. Billionaires in wine caves should pick the next president of the United States."
The jab capped weeks of sniping between the pair over their relationships with wealthy donors. Warren, 70, noted many of his fundraisers included bottles of wine costing nearly as much as an average American's weekly paycheck.
Fair or not, Buttigieg joined a long line of Democratic presidential candidates who faced blistering attacks about being out of touch with average voters, including Al Gore, John Kerry, John Edwards, Barack Obama, and Hillary Clinton.
In most cases, the charges have stuck. Obama was the exception, incurring minimal political harm in August 2007, after asking a group of Iowa farmers, “Anybody gone into Whole Foods lately and see what they charge for arugula? I mean, they’re charging a lot of money for this stuff.”
Also, during the 2008 Democratic primary cycle, Obama's campaign spread opposition research about primary Edwards's $400 haircuts, a stark departure from the North Carolina senator's "two Americas" populist message. The haircut revelations proved particularly damaging because it came shortly after a YouTube video of Edwards emerged fawning over himself in the mirror set to the West Side Story song I Feel Pretty.
"We did much less of this [opposition research] than other campaigns did," Obama campaign manager David Plouffe wrote in 2009. "But there were times we indulged — it was our researchers who found John Edwards's infamous $400 hair cut expenditures."
For Buttigieg, seeking the 2020 Democratic nomination, elitist charges are particularly sensitive. Being a Harvard College graduate, Rhodes Scholar, and former McKinsey and Co. consultant makes him appealing to a certain set of professional-class Democrats, but also a more remote figure to the majority of primary voters living paycheck-to-paycheck.
For many of Buttigieg's supporters, who are disproportionately wealthy compared to those backing Warren, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, and former Vice President Joe Biden, his background is exactly the antidote to the populist, elite-disdain dominating the Republican Party under President Trump.
But history shows embracing elite hobbies is often a liability of Democrats.
The phrase "limousine liberal" was first used by New York City Democratic mayoral hopeful Mario Procaccino in 1969 against incumbent Democrat John Lindsay, who came from a wealthy background and relied on funding from wealthy Manhattanites.
In the modern political era, the "elitist" epithet has become more and more of a common refrain against Democrats. Clinton lamented in 2008 that Gore's and Kerry's defeats the prior two cycles were due to them seeming "out of touch" with the public.
“You don’t have to think back too far to remember that good men running for president were viewed as being elitist and out of touch with the values and lives of millions of Americans,” she said.
During the 2004 presidential election, President George W. Bush's reelection committee, led by chief strategist Karl Rove, hammered Kerry for his ritzy hobbies like skiing and windsurfing. A month before that year's election, a New York Times article, "John Kerry: the wealthy Democrat," profiled his family's former estate in France.
A GOP ad that election ridiculed Kerry's largess.

“Massachusetts Sen. John Kerry. Hairstyle by Christophe’s: $75. Designer shirts: $250. Forty-two-foot luxury yacht: $1 million. Four lavish mansions and beachfront estate: Over $30 million," the script went.
Obama himself remained sensitive to questions about his appearance or personal grooming habits. After the Chicago Sun-Times endorsed Obama for the 2008 Democratic primary, his campaign called the newspaper to issue a complaint regarding their questions "about his pedicures."
And despite Clinton's criticisms of Gore and Kerry, her own presidential ambitions were hampered eight years later by her perceived resentment of working-class whites, culminating in the infamous "basket of deplorables" comment that continues as a rallying cry for Trump's supporters.

'Christmas With Renaissance Voices' a holiday must-hear

Texto completo: Renaissance Voices, the fine chamber choir conducted by Harold Stover, presents only a couple of programs a year - one at Christmas, one in the spring - and they are both relatively brief, running just over an hour. But among the attractions of these concerts is that Stover has an uncanny ability to ferret out little-known but thoroughly worthy repertory, from medieval through modern times. That's a refreshing approach at any time, but it especially elevates his annual Christmas concerts to must-hear status.
Stover and his 22 singers opened their "Christmas With Renaissance Voices" program at St. Luke's Cathedral on Saturday evening with "Surge, Illuminare, Jerusalem," a sweetly harmonized, setting of a passage from Isaiah by the early 16th century composer Francesco Corteccia. You don't hear a lot of Corteccia, nowadays, and you don't typically see his name listed among the great composers of his time. But works like this, in performances as richly blended as this choir's, suggest that further research might usefully add to our notion of the era.
From there, Stover forged ahead through musical history, following the Corteccia with "The Lute-Book Lullaby," by the early 17th century composer William Ballet, and then into the 20th century for Charles F. Waters' "I Sing of a Maiden." Both contemplative works that celebrate Mary, but which, along with the Corteccia, offer a gentle overview of how harmonic practice evolved over four centuries.
That evolution would have seemed less gentle and more stark if Stover had chosen a less conservative composer than Waters to represent the 20th century, but the shift would have been more jarring. And after all, the most recent generation of composers has avoided the competing stylistic dogmas of the late 20th century, arguing instead that all of musical history's myriad styles are theirs to work with as they see fit.
Stover included a work by one composer who takes that view. Tamsin Jones, born in 1972, applied a fluid, rhythmically vital style to "Noel: Verbum Caro Factum Est," a work with a text that combines an anonymous medieval poem with a passage from the Gospel of John. Jones kept largely within the late-Renaissance, early Baroque spirit, but the work's rhythmic character had a Medieval quality that Stover pointed out by preceding it with an early 14th century work, "Alle Psallite Cum Luya" - basically, an Alleluia with phrases interpolated between the second and third syllable.
Other pairings were similarly connected. A setting of Gregorio Turini's late 16th century setting of "Hodie Christus Natus Est" was preceded by the plainsong chant on which it is based; another, more exuberant setting of the same text, by the early Baroque composer Jan Pieterszoon Sweelinck, closed the programs. And Clara Schumann's gracefully melodic and richly harmonized "Abendfeier in Venedig," with its text (by Emmanuel Geibel) expanding poetically on the traditional "Ave Maria," was preceded by an anonymous Viennese "Ave Maria" setting.
One of Stover's recent fascinations is the music of the mid- to late-19th century composer Josef Rheinberger, whose works have been centerpieces of several recent Renaissance Voices programs. Here, the choir presented three of Rheinberger's Advent motets, all exquisite, late-Romantic settings. This was, however, the one group that gave the choir any trouble: "Rorate Coeli Desuper" and "Universi" were beautifully and solidly sung, but there were a couple of rough patches in "Ave Maria," which came between them.
Between several of the groups, singers from the choir read short, seasonally apt poems, with entries by Longfellow, Anne Ritter and Ted Hughes. And the ensemble gave a thoroughly polished account of Bach's "O Jesulein SÃ¼ss" as an encore. For the Bach, Stover gave the downbeat and then stepped aside, leaving the choir to sing the work on its own.

Texto completo: After working nights and weekends in an attempt to throw President Trump out of office before the voters can re-elect him, House Democrats declined to send their two articles of impeachment over to the Senate. Instead, they recessed for the holidays and left town.
It looks like everybody got something out of it. Nancy Pelosi got a growling rebuke of the president to satisfy her far-left squad and calm the terrified incumbents who live in fear of a primary challenge from a squad wannabe in their own districts. Adam Schiff got the cover of Los Angeles magazine. And President Trump received a most unlikely Christmas present, Republican unity. He’ll also unwrap fundraising totals for the fourth quarter that will be higher than Trump Tower.
The week featured a lot of thundering about history, and a lot of wailing over what some people think is the unprecedented polarization in our country.
It’s not unprecedented. Drop by the Richard Nixon Library in Yorba Linda and walk through exhibits that bring to life the bitter divisions during the Vietnam War. There you can see a real impeachment inquiry, in a National Archives curated gallery that chronicles the events known as Watergate.
On display is a photograph of a page in an address book. It was the first hint of what would come from the 1972 break-in at the Democratic National Committee headquarters at the Watergate complex in Washington.
The address book belonged to one of the Watergate burglars. On the page marked “H” was the phone number of E. Howard Hunt’s White House office. But why?
The answer would eventually lead to a House Judiciary Committee vote to recommend three articles of impeachment, and to Nixon’s resignation. It’s often said that the cover-up was worse than the crime. You should see what Nixon was covering up.
In May 1971, the White House planned a “dirty tricks” operation. With Nixon’s knowledge, aides hired Donald Segretti to recruit operatives to disrupt Democratic rallies, forge letters on Democratic campaign stationery, and infiltrate rival campaigns with spies. In December 1971, Nixon authorized a phony “write-in” campaign for Sen. Ted Kennedy in the New Hampshire primary, to try to pull votes away from then-frontrunner Sen. Ed Muskie.
These operations were already underway when a former Pentagon analyst named Daniel Ellsberg, who had come to oppose the Vietnam War, leaked a classified study of America’s involvement in Vietnam. The Pentagon Papers were published in the New York Times in June 1971.
Nixon believed he was facing a conspiracy by holdovers from the previous administration who were trying to sabotage his Vietnam policy. He ordered a top aide to have the Internal Revenue Service launch special audits of “political enemies” on a list. The IRS Commissioner and the Treasury Secretary refused to launch the audits, but the attempt was later cited by the House Judiciary Committee.
The House also noted Nixon’s July 1971 order for an investigation into civil servants at the Bureau of Labor Statistics, when he thought they were intentionally misrepresenting monthly unemployment figures and demanded to know how many Jews worked in the unit. That was in the articles of impeachment, too.
In August 1971, the White House asked the FBI to find dirt on CBS News correspondent Daniel Schorr, but the bureau mistakenly thought the president wanted to appoint Schorr to a federal job and conducted a background-check interview. When Schorr complained, the White House put him on the list for IRS harassment, and the House later put that in the second article of impeachment.
In September 1971, the White House “Plumbers” (plumbers stop leaks) broke into the office of Daniel Ellsberg’s former psychiatrist to try to find the confidential notes he had refused to give the FBI.
In early 1972, G. Gordon Liddy and E. Howard Hunt pitched a plan to Attorney General John Mitchell for a $1 million program of counterdemonstrations, bugging and break-ins at the headquarters of the eventual Democratic nominee for president, the convention hotel in Miami, and the DNC headquarters at the Watergate in Washington, D.C. Mitchell told the finance chair of the Nixon re-election campaign to give them $250,000.
The Watergate burglars were caught in June 1972. When the FBI began to trace the money found in the burglars’ hotel rooms, President Nixon ordered the CIA to mislead the FBI into thinking the Watergate break-in was a CIA operation. Hush money was paid to the burglars from the White House’s secret $350,000 political fund.
In November 1972, Nixon won re-election in a landslide, carrying 49 states and 60.7% of the popular vote. But slowly the cover-up was unraveling. Judge John J. Sirica was overseeing a grand jury investigation, the CIA decided to tell the FBI that the burglary wasn’t their operation, Washington Post reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein reported doggedly on the story, and by early 1973, some of the conspirators were cooperating with prosecutors.
There were guilty pleas and convictions in the first trial, and the Senate voted unanimously to form a Select Committee on Watergate. Nixon passed up a chance to end the cover-up and decided that finding a million dollars in hush money for E. Howard Hunt was the better choice.
White House firings, resignations and denials followed. In May 1973, Watergate Special Prosecutor Archibald Cox was hired, and in October, Nixon ordered his firing. The attorney general and deputy attorney general resigned.
In March 1974, Judge Sirica handed over the grand jury materials to the House of Representatives, and in July the Judiciary Committee voted to recommend three articles of impeachment. In August, the public got the first look at transcripts of Oval Office tapes that Nixon had tried to keep secret. The nation learned that Nixon had ordered the CIA to obstruct the FBI’s investigation. Support for the president collapsed. He resigned on August 9, 1974.
A walk through the Watergate gallery at the Nixon Library shows the hazards of abusing the powers of the CIA, FBI and IRS to go after political enemies. But it’s not Trump who did that.
After a number of investigations, we have learned that during the Obama administration, the IRS targeted conservative groups and the FBI misled the FISA court to get authorization to wiretap a Trump adviser. The CIA’s actions are currently under investigation by special prosecutor John Durham.
One day, history will judge the House of Representatives’ vote to impeach President Trump. Maybe we’ll find out that the House’s aim was off by one president.

Butler's odometer sets up a conflict in '21 Club walks a tightrope as they wait to pair him with a second star NBA Insider

Texto completo: MIAMI - As speculation increases on the way to the Feb. 6 NBA trading deadline, there is an assumption about Pat Riley and the Miami Heat that deserves additional scrutiny.
In almost all conjecture about the next potential blockbuster gambit is the ostensible given that Riley and the Heat will do nothing to impact what could stand as a motherload of cap cash in the 2021 offseason.
That is the summer when Giannis Antetokounmpo, Kawhi Leonard and other leading men could be on the free-agency market.
It certainly is the approach Riley and his cap crunchers took in advance of the 2010 offseason, when LeBron James and Chris Bosh were brought aboard alongside Dwyane Wade, a preceding period when the Heat, for one of the rare times during the Riley decades, operated beyond living in the moment.
The difference is that in 2010, Wade was 28, not long on NBA mileage after only a pair of extended playoff runs.
But now, as the Heat weigh the moment and the future, they are dealing with a 30-year-old leading man in Jimmy Butler who, by the 2021-22 season could be down to the final year on his contract, if he walks in his option year.
That means waiting to pair a high-mileage Butler (with those minutes again on the uptick lately) at age 32 with a second star.
To some, that star already is in development, in Bam Adebayo. But even now, the currently minted Eastern Conference Player of the Week hardly sets up as a scorer who consistently will land in the mid-20s. That's just not his game. Nor should it be expected.
Which brings us to rumor speculation seemingly both raised and rebutted this week, when the New York Times' Marc Stein indicated that New Orleans Pelicans guard Jrue Holiday could be had for the right price, and then when Pelicans Vice President David Griffin said there was no validity to the speculation.
Holiday is intriguing, a two-way presence who plays at an All-Star level at 29 and seemingly embodies Heat culture.
Of course, he also has a contract that runs into 2021-22, with a $27 million player option for that season.
And, so, is that where you draw the line?
Or does having such an elite running mate alongside Butler for this season, as well as next season trump the hopes of July 2021, especially when a potential super-max extension for Adebayo could eliminate that 2021 space, anyway?
Granted, the Heat may well stand pat, remain a project in development, one still capable of homecourt in the first round of the playoffs. And it could be that the 2021 vision is one of what comes next, after a two-year run with the current mix alongside Butler.
But if there is to be consideration of putting Justise Winslow, Tyler Herro, Derrick Jones Jr. or Kendrick Nunn into play, should it merely be for a two-year rental in mind, in the stratum of a DeMar DeRozan, LaMarcus Aldridge, Steven Adams?
Or should it be getting Jimmy Butler the best possible sidekick before he turns 32, while this all is new and fresh and full of possibilities?
That Griffin said there is no Holiday deal to be made is what you say until there is a deal made, similar to what he got for Anthony Davis from the Los Angeles Lakers.
Based on recent games, the Heat's greatest need would appear to be a defensive-minded, rebounding bulky big man.
But what has made Erik Spoelstra unique over his enduring tenure is the ability to find the best way to make talent work, just as it has been Pat Riley's job to maximize that talent.
The Heat did all they could to try to entice Kevin Durant in 2016 and Gordon Hayward in 2017; the two still signed elsewhere.
That doesn't mean the touch is gone. If anything, what the Heat did with Butler, getting him for less than he could have gotten elsewhere, showed that the Arison-Riley-Spoelstra triad touch is still there.
But the Heat also got Butler without an iota of cap space, while others, with oodles, were shut out.
For the right player (no, not Kevin Love), at the right price, with ample assets in hand, there is something to be said about living in the moment.
Living in Jimmy Butler's moment.
IN THE LANE
YOUNG, AND FOOLISH?:Ever since Trae Young said the Atlanta Hawks' game was over in Miami, with his team up six with a minute to go in regulation, in what turned into a Heat overtime victory, he's been hearing plenty. "I've taken a lot of heat," he said in a podcast with ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski. "That's just a funny moment. I mean, it's a crazy moment. I mean you're up six with a minute left. Momentum was just all in our favor at that time. It looked good. But as soon as I said it's over, I think they went on a 22-0 run. It's just a crazy time. I mean, obviously, it sucks losing. Especially losing in that fashion. But it's something I'll be able to look back at 20 years from now and still remember that." Young said there was no bad blood about the Heat's Jimmy Butler immediately going at him on social media. "I mean, Jimmy had a right to do it," he said. "I said it's over, and then he retaliated after the game and that's something that he felt he should have done. That was funny. I laughed at it. But it's all good."
LINGERING MEMORIES:It certainly is a good thing that Kevin Garnett isn't bitter or anything. Imagine then how he would recast his Celtics being pushed aside by the Big Three Heat? So there was Garnett on Bill Simmons' podcast, explaining how LeBron James hid from the Celtics' dominance by leaving the Cleveland Cavaliers in 2010 to join with Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh on the Heat. "We broke LeBron," Garnett said of his Celtics eliminating James and the Cavaliers in the 2010 playoffs. No debating that point. But there also is that pesky reality of James and the Heat eliminating Garnett and the Celtics in the 2011 East semifinals, the 2012 East finals, and then Garnett and his Brooklyn Nets in the 2014 first round. Of James' Heat success against the Celtics, Garnett said, "The league knew that they had an agenda in which we wasn't part of the agenda. You understand? Right." Um, OK, right. Just as the league wanted the Big Three Heat to lose in the 2011 Finals to the Dallas Mavericks to get even for the 2006 Finals?
HASSAN PLAYING LIKE HORSE?: Not going to lie, the headline from NBCSports Portland made me read further: "Every team needs a 'horse' like Hassan Whiteside." Turns out, the one thing the Heat and Portland Trail Blazers agree on is that Whiteside's rebounding is elite. Whiteside said it is all about going "horse out there," such as his 23 rebounds against the Warriors. "I always tell my teammates I got a horse out, got a horse out there," Whiteside said. Said Blazers guard Damian Lillard, "I think his ability to rebound is one of the best I've seen."
FITTING IN:Yes, that is former Heat two-way player Derrick Walton Jr. finding a niche with the Los Angeles Clippers, actually getting meaningful playing time under Doc Rivers. "He's been in big games in his life," Rivers told The Los Angeles Times. "What I like about him is he can make shots." Already, there is the Paul George seal of approval, "Every time he's been out there, he's made an impact, he's had big opportunities, big moments for his confidence. When his number is called, he's ready and available and he's been consistent."
NUMBER
1. Teams in NBA history, according to Elias Sports Bureau, to snap multiple season-opening home winning streaks of nine or more games in the same season, with the Heat now having done it in ending the Raptors' 9-0 run and then, on Wednesday night, the 76ers' 14-0 start at Wells Fargo Center.

Texto completo: One thing Rajon Lynch is unable to escape? His ties to Harry Houdini.
Not that he'd want to.
The 23-year-old magician who in recent years performed around the Appleton area, including at the History Museum at the Castle and Houdini's Escape Gastropub, has found a new job in a new city. He's now the director of the Houdini Museum of New York.
His ties to Appleton — the onetime home of Houdini, history's most famous magician — didn't land him the job. But it certainly didn't hurt.
"I think it definitely piqued his interest," Lynch said of the museum's owner, Roger Dreyer, who hired him in September. "Being from Appleton, when I started getting in the papers and stuff, the main thing was Houdini was old and Appleton might be looking to revive magic. Because I started writing about that stuff, I felt like I had a good grasp in terms of what people want from magic."
Houdini famously claimed to be a native of Appleton, though he came here as a child from Budapest, Hungary and left well before finding fame. Lynch, who performs as RJ the Magician, is a native of Racine who came to this area for college — he earned a communications degree from University of Wisconsin-Oshkosh in the spring — and often performed in Appleton while in school.
In 2017, he launched a dinner-show program called Now Serving Magic, which was hosted at times by Houdini's Escape, the History Museum and Oshkosh's Time Community Theater.
He spent the summer after graduation teaching magic in China. That's where he was when he was first contacted about the opening at the Houdini Museum, which is found in the same city Houdini now rests. The great illusionist is buried in a cemetery in Queens.
Opened in 2012, the museum itself is a small, a one-room showcase on the fourth floor of a Midtown Manhattan building, but it houses more than $3 million in memorabilia. With cuffs, posters, keys, a coffin and a trunk from the famous "Metamorphasis" stunt, it's the largest public collection of Houdini items.
One of the goals of the Houdini Museum, according to the official website, is to "inspire all age groups to realize once you focus and set your mind on something, you can accomplish anything you desire." It's fitting, then, that shortly before Now Serving Magic was starting in Wisconsin, Lynch told The Post-Crescent his plans after college were simple: "I want to be in New York," he said.
The operation also includes the Fantasma Magic Shop, which Lynch now oversees. He said they often sell magic kits to kids, and he joked he sometimes feels like "black Santa."
"You don't see magic shops around anymore," said Lynch, who owned a Fantasma kit as a child. "When my parents were younger, like every neighborhood (in New York) had a magic shop where you could go and learn some tricks. Now it's all converted to online."
Besides peddling magic wares, the duties he took on in September include giving tours, producing magic shows, performing and chatting up the guests.
He also helps market the museum, something he's already getting the hang of. In his few short months he's been covered by New York's ABC, NBC and Fox affiliates, AM New York and the New York Times. (And now, of course, The Post-Crescent.)
As a young, black magician with a background linked with Houdini, he knows he has a story hook.
"I was able to learn that I kind of had a knack for writing, especially about magic," he said. "And that's probably why I got this job, because I love magic, I love people and I love making connections like that."
RJ the Magician returns Rajon Lynch, aka RJ the Magician, will be back in northeast Wisconsin for a performance with two other magicians. The event is at 7:30 p.m. Jan. 24 at Tim Community Theater, 445 N. Main St., Oshkosh. RJ will perform with Caleb Hyatt and Noah Sonie. Hyatt is based in Milwaukee and Sonie is from Minnesota. Tickets start at $15 and are available at eventbrite.com.

The Supreme Court's Loyalty Test

Texto completo: How the justices rule on three cases involving Trump's financial records will tell us all we need to know about the court.
When the first two of President Trump's appeals seeking to shield his financial records from disclosure reached the Supreme Court last month, I predicted that the justices would take their institutional interests into account and turn the cases down.
I was wrong.
And on reflection, now that the court has agreed to hear those two appeals plus a third, I'm glad I was wrong. Here's why: The eventual decisions, to come in the months after the as-yet unscheduled arguments in late March or early April, will give the country much-needed clarity about the Supreme Court. With the court in the full glare of an election-year spotlight, we will learn beyond any doubt what kind of Supreme Court we have -- and whether its evolution into partnership with a president who acts as if he owns it is now complete.
Those of us who have been warning about this evolution are well aware that it's a contested claim, subject to ready dismissal as overstatement or ideologically driven fearmongering. So I want to make the case here that for the justices to do anything other than affirm the three decisions at issue by two Courts of Appeals would be to vindicate both the warnings and the president's disturbing assumption.
The fact is that these cases are not what the president's lawyers have dressed them up to be. This is not Congress or the federal courts putting the president in the dock. No, that was United States v. Nixon, the Watergate tapes case, in which the court under a conservative chief justice, Warren Burger, who had been named to the court by Mr. Nixon, unanimously rejected the president's claim of privilege against releasing records of intimate Oval Office conversations for use by a special prosecutor in a criminal trial.
Nor is this a sitting president being distracted and demeaned by having to testify in person as a defendant in a lawsuit about his personal behavior. No, that was Clinton v. Jones, in which the court under another conservative chief justice, William Rehnquist, unanimously rejected President Bill Clinton's claim of privilege.
In none of the three cases now before the court would the president, if he lost, have to lift a finger. He is a plaintiff, not a defendant. In his capacity as a private citizen, he brought the three lawsuits to quash subpoenas issued by three House of Representative committees and the Manhattan district attorney, not to him but to two banks and an accounting firm, for his personal and corporate financial records.
In fact, in one of the two New York cases, Trump v. Deutsche Bank, Judge Jon O. Newman of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, noting that the complaint filed by the president's lawyers stated that "President Trump brings this suit solely in his capacity as a private citizen," referred throughout his 106-page opinion to the "Lead Plaintiff" rather than President Trump.
"Although the challenged subpoenas seek financial records of the person who is the president," Judge Newman wrote, "no documents are sought reflecting any actions taken by Donald J. Trump acting in his official capacity as president."
Judge David Tatel, writing for the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in Trump v. Mazars USA, in which the House Oversight Committee is seeking records from an accounting firm, noted that for six of the eight years covered by the subpoena, President Trump was "merely Mr. Trump or candidate Trump."
"It is far from obvious that President Trump, proceeding in his individual capacity, carries the mantle of the Office of the President in this case," Judge Tatel wrote. He added that the House committee's request "implicates no material subject to a recognized legal privilege or an asserted property interest."
Indeed, while asserting what his lawyers call "temporary absolute president immunity," President Trump is not raising a claim of executive privilege in any of the cases. That's not to say his argument is not a far-reaching one. The "question presented" in Trump v. Vance, the case in which he is seeking to quash the Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance's subpoena to the Mazars accounting firm, shows how the president is reaching for the moon in a case that Chief Judge Robert Katzmann of the Second Circuit anchored solidly to the ground, as explained below.
As Supreme Court practitioners know, the "question presented," which appears by itself on the first page of any Supreme Court petition, is perhaps the most important part of the petition. It sets the tone, frames the argument and contains the first words the justices and their law clerks will read.
This is the "question presented" offered by the president's lawyers in their petition in Trump v. Vance: "Whether this subpoena violates Article II and the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution." (The Constitution's Article II establishes the presidency, while the Supremacy Clause in Article VI gives federal law precedence over state law where the two conflict.)
By contrast -- a contrast as extreme as any I can recall -- this is how the district attorney presents the question in his brief opposing Supreme Court review: "Whether presidential immunity bars the enforcement of a state grand jury subpoena directing a third party to produce material which pertains to the president's unofficial and nonprivileged conduct."
That careful framing, rather than the president's, reflects what Chief Judge Katzmann actually wrote:
"We have no occasion to decide today the precise contours and limitations of presidential immunity from prosecution, and we express no opinion on the applicability of any such immunity under circumstances not presented here. Instead, after reviewing historical and legal precedent, we conclude only that presidential immunity does not bar the enforcement of a state grand jury subpoena directing a third party to produce nonprivileged material, even when the subject matter under investigation pertains to the president."
And this is the opinion that the president's Supreme Court petition calls "irreconcilable with our constitutional design."
I've quoted from each of the three opinions for a reason: As the weeks go by, the country will be subjected to gaslighting from the White House so intense that it won't be easy even for those who have actually read the full opinions to hold on to the knowledge of how carefully circumscribed they are. The president's petitions are just the opening salvo in a battle for the justices' votes, of course, but also for the public's understanding of both how little and how much is at stake. (A taste of things to come is this hyperbolic sentence from the president's petition in the D.C. Circuit's Mazars case: "At its core, this controversy is about whether -- and to what degree -- Congress can exercise dominion and control over the Office of the President.")
Needless to say, President Trump is not the author of the Supreme Court petitions filed by his team of private lawyers. But any doubt that he thinks of the court as his friend was erased by his tweet this month as the House moved toward impeachment. "Shouldn't even be allowed," he tweeted. "Can we go to Supreme Court to stop?"
Actually, no, "we" can't.
I'm writing this column from Jerusalem, where I participated in a conference at the Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities on the timely subject of "The Challenges of Liberal Democracy."
I was gripped by a talk by Moshe Halbertal, a distinguished Israeli philosopher, and professor at Hebrew University and New York University, who identified one of the pillars of democracy as the willingness of contending sides to accept political defeat without violence, verbal as well as physical. The end of the conference on Tuesday coincided with President Trump's unhinged letter to Speaker Nancy Pelosi, accusing the House of Representatives of engaging in a "charade," an "unconstitutional abuse of power," an "attempted coup."
The juxtaposition between what I heard from Professor Halbertal and what I read in the letter was eerie.
While I have been in Israel, students back home have been taking their fall-semester final exams. In their first semester, students at Yale Law School take their exams on a pass-fail basis. The Supreme Court, in these three cases due for decision in the waning months of Mr. Trump's presidential term, faces a crucial exam of its own. We can't afford for it to fail.

App developer alleges Apple suppressed competitors " until it got caught

Texto completo: An email app developer says it has uncovered new data that suggests Apple has long been suppressing the rankings of apps in the App Store that compete with Apple's own offerings, according to new court filings by the developer, which sued Apple in October alleging patent infringement and antitrust violations.
Blix, which developed the BlueMail app, said it made the discovery only when Apple's rankings suddenly changed in its favor. At the end of September, Blix unexpectedly jumped from 143rd in Apple's ranking for mail apps to 13th. Blix had for years been highly ranked in the competing Android app stores, run by companies such as Google, Samsung, Amazon and Huawei. But on Apple's iOS, where it competes with Apple's mail app, it had long been ranked very low.
Blix started looking at other apps that also compete with Apple's preinstalled apps. Several others, such as a mail app from Russian tech company Yandex, had also seen dramatic spikes in their rankings. Blix says it used the market research firm Sensor Tower to research the unexplained spike in BlueMail's ranking on the iOS store, which happened on Sept.-26. Using Sensor Tower's historical data, it was able to determine that BlueMail was not the only app that had experienced the spike.
'Multiple different types of Apple app competitors enjoyed a sudden, unexplained rise in search rankings,' according to Blix's latest court filing, which appeared Friday. The spike came roughly two weeks after a New York Times article examined how Apple ranked its own apps higher than competitors'.
Apple spokesman Fred Sainz declined to comment on the litigation. On its website, Apple says its App Store provides 'equal opportunities to developers to deliver their apps and services across iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple TV, and Apple Watch.'
The allegations come as Apple faces increased scrutiny for how it treats smaller competitors. The House Judiciary Committee and the Justice Department are investigating whether Apple has violated antitrust laws. Last month, the top Democrat in charge of the House investigation raised concerns that Apple was using privacy as a way to shield itself from antitrust scrutiny. The committee has requested information from Apple on how it uses the innovations of app developers on its platform in its own services, one of the key allegations in Blix's lawsuit.
The suit brought by Blix is unusual. Most app developers are careful about saying anything that might be construed as critical of Apple. That is because the only way to distribute software to Apple users is with express approval from the company. Apple also decides which apps are included in the lists of apps that it recommends, one of the most important methods of marketing to Apple customers. Taking the company to court is an almost unheard-of method of resolving a dispute with Apple.
Blix's founders, brothers Ben and Dan Volach, are longtime entrepreneurs who have a big dream: to unify email, calendars, contacts and messaging into one app. (They sold a previous mobile messaging company for $140-million in 2006.) Blix, whose 40-employees are based in New Jersey, Britain and Israel, competes against some of tech's biggest giants, including Microsoft and Slack.
But the Volaches, who are represented by the law firm Quinn Emanuel Urquhart - Sullivan, say Apple may be particularly threatened by mail applications such as Blix, according to its latest court filings. They say that is because Blix, unlike Microsoft's Outlook and Slack, appeals to everyday consumers looking for more feature-rich alternatives to Apple's bare-bones 'Mail' app, which comes preinstalled on iPhones.
And unlike Apple's Mail app, Blix works across platforms including Android, Windows and Mac desktops. 'Apple's dominance in the MacOS Email client market, as well as its Mac computer sales generally, are threatened by cross-platform messaging solutions, such as BlueMail,' the company says in its latest filing.
Blix has also been locked in a battle with Apple to get its corresponding BlueMail app accepted back into the Mac App Store, the desktop version of the App Store for iPhone, after Apple removed it in June.
In Friday's filing, Blix cited examples where Apple has allowed duplicate apps from the same developer. The encrypted-messaging service Telegram, for instance, has two desktop apps, Telegram and Telegram Desktop. The lawsuit alleges they are 'highly similar.'
Blix claims that Apple has put barriers in the way of users downloading the software directly onto their computers by discouraging them from installing any software that is not downloaded through Apple. Apple says the warnings, which it calls 'Gatekeeper,' are meant to prevent the spread of malware.
Blix says Apple uses Gatekeeper to give itself an unfair advantage, calling it an effort by Apple to consolidate power over its desktop software in the same way it controls its mobile ecosystem, essentially giving the company 'monopoly power over MacOS applications,' the complaint alleges.

Texto completo: Wednesday’s impeachment of Donald Trump was neither a surprise nor a turning point. We’ve known for weeks that the House would vote to impeach. We also know, as surely as we can know anything in politics, that a Republican-controlled Senate won’t convict Trump and remove him from office; it may not even pretend to consider the evidence. So it would be easy to be cynical about the whole thing.
But that’s not how it felt. For me, and no doubt for millions of my fellow citizens, Wednesday was a very emotional day — a day of both despair and hope.
The reasons for despair are obvious. We could so easily lose everything America is supposed to stand for. The birthplace of liberty may very well be just months away from abandoning all its ideals.
But there were also reasons for hope.
The enemies of freedom are, it turns out, as shameless and corrupt here as they are in nations, from Hungary to Turkey, in which democracy has effectively collapsed. But the defenders of American democracy seem more united and determined than their counterparts abroad. The big question is whether that difference — that true American exceptionalism — will be enough to save us.
Let’s back up and ask what we’ve learned about America over the past three years.
There was never any doubt that Trump would abuse his powers; he telegraphed his contempt for rule of law, his eagerness to exploit his office for personal gain, right from the start. For a while, however, it was possible to imagine that at least part of his party would stand up for democratic principles.
But it was not to be. What we saw Wednesday was a parade of sycophants comparing their leader to Jesus Christ while spouting discredited conspiracy theories straight from the Kremlin. And as they were doing so, the object of their adoration was giving an endless, rambling, third-world-dictator-style speech, full of lies, that veered between grandiosity and self-pity, interspersed with complaints about how many times he has to flush his toilet.
Republicans, in other words, are beyond redemption; they’ve become just another authoritarian party devoted to the leader principle. And like similar parties in other countries, the GOP is trying to rig future elections through gerrymandering and voter suppression, creating a permanent lock on power.
But if Trump’s supporters look just like their counterparts in failed democracies abroad, his opponents don’t.
One of the depressing aspects of the rise of authoritarian parties like Hungary’s Fidesz and Poland’s Law and Justice has been the fecklessness of their opposition — disunited, disorganized, unable to make an effective challenge even to unpopular autocrats as they consolidated their power.
Trumpism, however, faced determined, united, effective opposition from the beginning, which has been reflected both in mass marches and in Democratic electoral victories. In 2017 there were only 15 Democratic governors, compared with 35 Republicans; today the score is 24 to 26. And last year, of course, Democrats won a landslide victory in House elections, which is what made the impeachment hearing and vote possible.
Many of the new Democratic members of Congress are in Republican-leaning districts, and some observers expected a significant number to defect Wednesday. Instead, the party held together almost completely. True, so did its opponents; but while Republicans sounded, well, deranged in their defense of Trump, Democrats came across as sober and serious, determined to do their constitutional duty even if it involved political risks.
Now, none of this necessarily means that democracy will survive. Even as they have been losing elections, Republicans have been consolidating control over the courts and other national institutions. Democratic leaders in Congress have been unexpectedly, even shockingly impressive; the Democratic presidential field less so.
And the unity of purpose we saw Wednesday may not hold next November. If Democrats nominate a progressive like Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders, will wealthy Democrats decide that defending democracy is less important than keeping their taxes low? If the party nominates a moderate like Joe Biden, will some Sanders supporters express their frustration the same way they did in 2016, by staying home or voting for a third-party candidate? Given the stakes, I’d like to dismiss such concerns, but I can’t.
Add in the extent to which next year’s election will be rigged in Trump’s favor, both by voter suppression and by the skew introduced by the Electoral College — and the even greater skew created by a Senate map that gives small, mostly conservative states as much representation as liberal states with many times their population — and it’s all too possible that Trumpism will still triumph.
What we learned Wednesday, however, was that those who define America by its ideals, not the dominance of a particular ethnic group, won’t give up easily. The bad news is that our bad people are as bad as everyone else’s. The good news is that our good people seem unusually determined to do the right thing.

Texto completo: After 48 years with the celebrated Alvin Ailey Dance Theater, both as performer and choreographer, Masazumi Chaya is hanging up his dancing shoes.
The Japanese-American artist will start the new year by retiring as the modern dance company's artistic director.
But the man known as "The Keeper of the Flame" to some colleagues is working until his very last day with the renowned dance troupe, whose members will celebrate his legacy with a special evening of performances on Sunday at New York's City Center. He got his nickname for preserving the New York City-based company's repertoire and for training generations of dancers through the past three decades.
"I love these dancers and I want to be with them as much I can because when January comes in, they go off and then start the national tour," he told the Daily News this week. "I had to see them before they go. They're my kids, my brothers and sisters, so I enjoy being around."
Chaya started his classical ballet career in his native Fukuoka, Japan, and moved to New York in 1970, when he also began to train in modern dance at the Richard Englund Repertory Company.
His first audition for the Alvin Ailey company two years later came about by luck.
Chaya, who had just performed in a disco concert that earned him a positive review in The New York Times, showed up at tryouts to serve as a translator for another dancer who was auditioning.
When Ailey's general manager Ivy Clarke realized Chaya was the same dancer in The Times review she fortuitously had sitting on her desk, she asked him and his friend to return for a callback the next day.
"At the time, the company was performing at the Metropolitan Opera House for [Leonard] Bernstein's 'Mass' and Judith Jamison and all the other company members were dancing during the audition that day," he recalled. "Mr. Ailey was just looking at us and then took us the upstairs room and then said, 'Oh, we'd like to give you a contract.'"
Founded in New York City in 1958, the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater has performed for an estimated 25 million people in 71 countries on six continents - as well as millions more through TV broadcasts, films and digital platforms. It is recognized for promoting the African-American cultural experience and the preservation and enrichment of the American modern dance tradition.
Chaya performed as a dancer for Alvin Ailey for 15 years and in 1988, became the company's rehearsal director. Since 1991, he has served as the company's associate artistic director, working closely with Jamison, who became the face of the organization after Ailey died in 1989.
It was Chaya who played an integral part in bringing Jamison - Ailey's muse, who he discovered in 1964 - back after her departure in 1988 to start her own company, The Jamison Project.
Jamison retired from her post as artistic director in 2010 but remains close to Chaya. He says the dance icon, who he sometimes calls "mom," texts him regularly to see how the shows are going - and also makes a "mean strawberry daiquiri" when he visits her Upper West Side apartment.
His official last day as associate artistic director will come when Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater's five-week annual residency culminates Jan. 5 at City Center.
But he will oversee a licensing project that will assist in the restaging of Ailey's works - of which he has become a master.
Chaya said it willbe a digital hub with tools for other institutions who want to officially adapt Ailey's vast repertoire.
"I'd like to open up for anybody to approach us... because his work is so beautiful," said Chaya. "It's for the world to embrace."

Daniel Fish to Reinvent 'The Most Happy Fella'

Texto completo: The 1956 musical drama, with an acclaimed operatic score, will premiere this summer at Bard SummerScape in Annandale-on-Hudson.
Daniel Fish, the director behind the Tony Award-winning "Oklahoma!" revival, has a new midcentury musical reinvention project in the works: Frank Loesser's acclaimed, quasi-operatic "The Most Happy Fella."
The 1956 "music drama," as it was then coined in a New York Times review, is an unorthodox love story between a middle-aged vineyard owner and his mail-order waitress bride.
Fish's production will open this summer at the Bard SummerScape festival in Annandale-on-Hudson, N.Y. Details are still being discussed with Loesser's estate; his wife, Jo Sullivan Loesser -- whom he met after she starred as Rosabella in the original "Most Happy" production -- died in April.
If the first line of the casting announcement is any indication, Fish will be working in a similar vein to "Oklahoma!": "This will not be a conventional production of 'The Most Happy Fella."'
He is gathering a small ensemble of seven performers, according to the casting notice, who will not be divided into the show's traditional roles. The production is "strongly" encouraging performers who identify as transgender, nonbinary or queer to audition, the notice said.
Expect "a nontraditional treatment of the existing material," a SummerScape spokesman said, "with an emphasis on Loesser's exquisite score."
The "Oklahoma!" revival, which stresses the underlying darkness in what had been seen as a sunny American story, took shape at the same Bard festival in 2015, going on to Broadway earlier this year. One of the bigger changes came through in the stripped-down score, orchestrated by a music team that will also join "The Most Happy Fella."
Loesser wrote the music, book and lyrics for "The Most Happy Fella," which is based on Sidney Howard's 1924 play "They Knew What They Wanted." The show is more dramatic than some of Loesser's better-known comedic hits -- including "Guys and Dolls" and "How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying" -- but the music has long been cited as one of his most striking compositions.
The show was revived on Broadway in 1979 and 1992, and enjoyed a New York City Opera production in 2006.
Most recently, "The Most Happy Fella" ran briefly at City Center, as part of the 2014 Encores! musicals in concert season.
The "sweeping, seamless and intricately layered score" still held up, Ben Brantley wrote of the production in The Times. It was the music, he wrote, that put the show in "the pantheon of great midcentury American musicals."

ICE inks deals with four private prisons in Calif.
U. S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has entered into long-term contracts worth billions of dollars with for-profit prison companies to operate four private immigration detention centers in California. The move comes two weeks before a new state law is set to take effect phasing out the use of private, for-profit prisons and immigration detention centers.
The awarding of the contracts caps a contentious, two-month struggle between ICE and state leaders. California’s congressional delegation, lawmakers and immigration advocates have slammed the agency for potentially violating federal procurement law in an attempt to lock in long-term contracts for existing private detention centers in the state before AB 32 takes effect in January.
The contract announcements, posted on a federal website, only say the awards are for four detention centers in ICE’s Los Angeles, San Francisco and San Diego areas of responsibility. Read more:

PG&E Power shutoffs — worse than we thought?
An Associated Press review shows widespread problems with the four “public safety power shutoffs” the utility started rolling out in 2018, a year before massive blackouts paralyzed much of California in recent months. Interviews and documents obtained under public records requests reveal persistent failures and broken promises that in some cases compromised public safety.
Even as PG&E assured regulators it was fixing the problems, the utility kept making many of the same mistakes, further undermining trust after its outdated equipment and negligence had been blamed for fires that killed nearly 130 people during 2017 and 2018.
Among the findings: PG&E was slow to release maps showing who would lose power, making it harder for emergency responders to know where to go; it balked at providing the addresses of medically needy customers to local officials who planned to check on them in person; and its website crashed as thousands of people sought information at once.
I'll leave you with this throwback, a story that ran on this day seven years ago about an avalanche that killed three people in the Washington backcountry. One was a Bay Area native and the former marketing director of the adjacent ski resort.
Journalism's changed so much, it's easy to forget how revolutionary the interactive "Snow Fall: The Avalanche at Tunnel Creek" was when it came out. The story by New York Times' John Branch went on to win the 2013 Pulitzer Prize for Feature Writing. It's as riveting now as it was then.

Here's why some Trump-skeptical evangelicals are losing patience with the president

Texto completo: A Christian magazine has given up on President Trump, and he isn’t happy. The day after prominent evangelical magazine Christianity Today published an editorial titled, “Trump Should Be Removed from Office,” its target fumed on Twitter that it was a “far left magazine, or very ‘progressive,’ as some would call it, which has been doing poorly.”
Christianity Today, which “knows nothing” of Trump’s perfect phone call, he argued, would rather support “a Radical Left nonbeliever, who wants to take your religion & your guns.”
“No President has done more for the Evangelical community, and it’s not even close,” Trump continued. “You’ll not get anything from those Dems on stage. I won’t be reading ET again!”
That should have been CT, of course — not that he had been reading it in the first place.
As if this rant wasn't enough, Trump continued his tirade several hours later, posting on Friday afternoon: “I guess the magazine, ‘Christianity Today,’ is looking for Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, or those of the socialist/communist bent, to guard their religion. How about Sleepy Joe? The fact is, no President has ever done what I have done for Evangelicals, or religion itself!”
He then shared an article in which Franklin Graham, son of Christianity Today founder Billy Graham, said his father voted for Trump. See? Trump seemed to say. Of course you must support me. Look at how you've supported me in the past, and see what I’ve done for you.
Trump’s relationship with evangelicals has been highly discussed since 2016. Eighty-one percent of white, evangelical Christians voted for Trump that year, with just 16% supporting Hillary Clinton. Trump has close ties to Jerry Falwell Jr., president of the evangelical Liberty University, and Franklin Graham himself, who has frequently praised the president’s record in office.
Soon after the Christianity Today editorial was published, Graham was quoted in the New York Times saying, “My father would be embarrassed.”
“It is not going to change anybody’s mind about Trump,” he continued. “There’s a liberal element within the evangelical movement. Christianity Today represents that.”
Christianity Today, by its own admission, has long opted to support a diversity of political opinions among evangelical Christians, providing a basic spiritual framework through which to view the news. But in its editorial published this week, the magazine is playing the long game.
“If we don’t reverse course now, will anyone take anything we say about justice and righteousness with any seriousness for decades to come?” Editor-in-Chief Mark Galli asks readers. “Can we say with a straight face that abortion is a great evil that cannot be tolerated and, with the same straight face, say that the bent and broken character of our nation’s leader doesn’t really matter in the end?”
The editorial argues that Trump’s character makes him unfit for office, necessitating either a Senate removal or an ouster at the polls in 2020. It concludes, “To use an old cliché, it’s time to call a spade a spade, to say that no matter how many hands we win in this political poker game, we are playing with a stacked deck of gross immorality and ethical incompetence.”
Whether or not the argument is politically sound, Christianity Today has taken a bold stance by questioning the ease with which many evangelical leaders have aligned themselves with Trump and failed to call out his moral deficiencies.
But this battle isn’t really about impeachment, and at the end of the day, it’s not even about Trump.
The Christianity Today editorial comes at a time when a growing number of evangelicals are concerned by the actions of their peers. After Trump quipped that the late Rep. John Dingell was “looking up” from hell, he was quickly condemned by Christian singer Nichole Nordeman and evangelical blogger Erick Erickson.
Paula White, Trump’s spiritual adviser, instead tweeted just hours later, “Tonight we lift up our President, @realDonaldTrump in prayer against all wickedness & demonic schemes against him and his purpose in the name of Jesus.”
What about the wickedness on her side of the aisle?
Evangelicals at Christianity Today and elsewhere are growing tired of their associates praising the president for his policies while actively ignoring his immoral actions. They could separate the politics from the man. Instead — and this is the better option if you want White House invites — they praise both.
For Christianity Today, time’s up on this two-faced submissiveness. The magazine's message seems to echo the thoughts of many readers. There might have been a time to maintain both support for Trump the president and condemnation for Trump the man. But the hypocrisy of prominent evangelical leaders destroyed that opportunity for nuance long ago.

Texto completo: When George Lucas introduced "Star Wars" to the world 42 years ago, no one knew what a cultural force it would become. Now the epic space opera is coming to a close.
Or at least what's become known as "The Skywalker Saga" is coming to a close. Lucas is no longer the supreme leader of the galaxy far, far away. Disney is now in charge, and surely it will continue creating new "Star Wars" stories.
But the final film of the final trilogy is out in theaters. J.J. Abrams helms "The Rise of Skywalker," his second time in the director's chair for the franchise. (His first was "The Force Awakens" in 2015.) Critics aren't overly impressed with how Abrams brought the story to a close.
Katie Walsh of Tribune News Service writes, "Abrams hits the gas on this space race right away and never pauses to let a single emotion land because the characters are too busy scrambling around the galaxy looking for thingamajigs and each other. The pace and volume of the plot is punishing and numbing."
She also was frustrated by the fact that "Abrams has rendered death optional."
"It's not just characters who are reanimated like zombies, stripping all meaning from their deaths, but most ghoulishly actors. It's not the first time the 'Star Wars' team has digitally Frankensteined a deceased actor out of pixel dust and unused footage, but this time it feels like it's gone too far with the late Carrie Fisher re-created for a full supporting performance as Gen. Leia Organa," she wrote.
In his four-star review for the Seattle Times, Soren Andersen had a different take on the fact that the dead live on in the "Star Wars" universe.
"Throughout the saga, the memory of characters no longer among the living - Luke, Yoda, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Han Solo - live on in the surviving characters. They inspire. They instruct. They point the way to the future," he wrote.
"They offer hope," Andersen continued. "They're the reason 'Star Wars' resonates so strongly among millions of fans worldwide. It's that hope for the future."
In the New York Times, A.O. Scott made the argument that individually, none of the "Star Wars" films are that great, calling a ranking of all the films "a nine-way tie for fourth place."
" 'The Rise of Skywalker' - Episode IX, in case you've lost count - is one of the best. Also one of the worst. Perfectly middling. It all amounts to the same thing," he wrote.
Many critics complained about the overstuffed plot. Among them was Peter Travers of Rolling Stone, but he also thought the story was a lot of fun.
"The impossible job of being all things to all 'Star'-gazers leaves Abrams ... straining to cram in everything," Travers wrote. "The result is often chaos, but it's also a euphoric blast of pulse-quickening adventure laced with humor and heart. Sure, you'll nitpick the thing to death with your friends. But that's the point. When it comes to 'Stars Wars' fandom, the infighting is as crucial as the love."
Todd McCarthy of the Hollywood Reporter had similar feelings about the plot, comparing the storyline to a pinball machine. But he and others also lauded the filmmaking.
"It almost goes without saying that, from a physical production point of view, 'The Rise of Skywalker' is stupendous, enough reason by itself to see and even enjoy the film. Clearly no expense has been spared in making almost every scene spectacular," McCarthy wrote.

Texto completo: In a lawsuit filed under the Child Victims Act, a woman accuses the producer of forcing her to touch his genitals when she was a minor.
At 16, the model moved to New York, leaving her hometown in Poland and her parents behind to chase dreams of becoming a Hollywood actress.
At a modeling event in 2002, the teenager, Kaja Sokola, met the famous movie producer Harvey Weinstein. He found out she was interested in acting and invited her to lunch a few days later. Excited and eager, she thought the man behind "Pulp Fiction" and "Shakespeare in Love" could open doors for her career.
But instead of taking her to lunch, Ms. Sokola says, Mr. Weinstein brought her to his New York apartment, forcing her to massage his penis and blocking the door when she tried to escape.
On Thursday, Ms. Sokola filed a lawsuit accusing the movie mogul of sexually abusing her when she was a minor.
Ms. Sokola was able to sue Mr. Weinstein in New York under the Child Victims Act, a new state law that opened a one-year window allowing sexual abuse victims of any age -- including those whose cases had expired under the old statute of limitations -- to take legal action. The one-year window started in August.
Victims of sexual abuse in New York were previously required to file civil lawsuits by their 23rd birthdays. Ms. Sokola is now 33.
Because of the expanded statute of limitations under the new law, Ms. Sokola is one of the few Weinstein accusers who can seek to hold the Walt Disney Company liable for Mr. Weinstein's behavior. Disney bought Miramax Films, the production company co-founded by Mr. Weinstein and his brother, Bob, in 1993 and sold it in 2010.
Mr. Weinstein has faced lawsuits from dozens of women since 2017, when investigations by The New York Times and The New Yorker revealed decades of sexual harassment allegations against him. The disgraced producer is facing a criminal trial on sexual assault charges that begins on Jan. 6 in Manhattan.
Ms. Sokola's lawsuit, filed in Manhattan state court, accuses Miramax, Disney and Bob Weinstein of enabling Harvey Weinstein and ignoring sexual misconduct allegations against him. She is suing them, along with Harvey Weinstein, for an unspecified amount in damages.
Her allegation first appeared last year under the name "Jane Doe" as part of a class-action lawsuit brought by several women. Benjamin Brafman, Mr. Weinstein's lawyer at the time, called her accusation "completely uncorroborated" and "patently false."
Donna Rotunno, Mr. Weinstein's current lawyer, did not respond to a request for comment on the new lawsuit.
Lawyers for Bob Weinstein, Miramax and Disney also did not respond.
Ms. Sokola decided to file her own lawsuit after rejecting a $ 25 million tentative settlement agreement reached last week by Mr. Weinstein and dozens of his accusers.
More than $ 12 million -- a quarter of the overall settlement package -- would go toward legal costs for Mr. Weinstein, his brother and other former members of their studio's board. The board members would be insulated from future liability, and the accusers would drop their claims against Mr. Weinstein and other executives.
"I cannot accept the proposed 'global settlement' as fair or just," Ms. Sokola said in a statement. "There is no accountability for the perpetrators, insufficient compensation for all of the victims and millions of dollars going to people that I believe enabled Weinstein."
On their way to lunch in 2002, the new lawsuit says, Mr. Weinstein asked Ms. Sokola how old she was. She replied that she was 16. He was 50 at the time.
Mr. Weinstein's driver dropped them off at Mr. Weinstein's apartment in SoHo, the lawsuit said, instead of taking them to a restaurant for lunch. Mr. Weinstein told her that if she wanted to be an actress, she had to feel comfortable getting naked and doing whatever the director wanted. Mr. Weinstein said he had made the careers of Penélope Cruz and Gwyneth Paltrow.
Under his instructions, Ms. Sokola says, she took off her blouse and unzipped her jeans. Then, Mr. Weinstein touched her vagina and directed her to touch herself.
He took off his pants and forced her to massage his penis while he grabbed her breasts, the lawsuit said.
She fought back tears and tried to leave, screaming that she did not want to touch him. Mr. Weinstein blocked the door, she said. He yelled at her to calm down and said she should work on her stubbornness.
"Harvey Weinstein's demeanor became intense, as if he was hunting prey," the lawsuit said. "Sokola realized then he was determined to sexually satisfy himself with her in whatever way he wanted."
Ms. Weinstein eventually ejaculated on the floor, the lawsuit said.
Ms. Sokola said she worried that she had just destroyed her career by refusing to go along with Mr. Weinstein's demands. A few days after the incident, he repeatedly contacted her, saying he was the only person who could help her become an actress, she said.
She said the incident flooded her with guilt and shame, causing long-term depression and anorexia.
She now works as a clinical psychologist in Krakow, Poland.
The age of consent in New York State is 17, but Ms. Sokola's allegations are too old under the law to be the basis of a criminal charge. Her lawyer, Douglas H. Wigdor, said prosecutors had not interviewed her as part of any criminal case.

Texto completo: Our guide to cultural events in New York City for children and teenagers happening this weekend and in the week ahead.
'CARNIVAL OF THE ANIMALS' at the Miller Theater (Dec. 21, 1 and 4 p.m.). Camille Saint-Saëns and Ogden Nash were born in different centuries and countries, but their sensibilities combine in this production, which pairs the whimsical music of Saint-Saëns's "Carnival of the Animals" with the wry narration of Nash's lighthearted verse. The third essential element is the staging by Lake Simons, a theater artist and puppeteer who has constructed the menagerie of characters from everyday objects: Mops transform into a lion, feather dusters into cuckoos and an umbrella into an elephant's head. Recommended for children 6 and older, the show has become a seasonal tradition.

'A CHRISTMAS CAROL, OY! HANUKKAH, MERRY KWANZAA, HAPPY RAMADAN' at Theater for the New City (Dec. 19-20, 8 p.m.; Dec. 21-22, 3 and 8 p.m.; through Jan. 5). This may be the only holiday production you'll ever attend at which you can expect to hear both "Bah, Humbug" and Swahili. Vit Horejs, the founder of the Czechoslovak-American Marionette Theater, has been presenting variations of this piece of multicultural merriment since 2001, always using some three dozen wooden marionettes and rod puppets, many of them vintage examples. This version of the show, revised and updated for its debut at Theater for the New City, includes four Rockettes in Eastern European costumes, as well as a camel and the characters from Dickens's classic story. The plot follows the basic outlines of Scrooge's redemption, but incorporating songs, traditions and humor from a variety of countries.
212-254-1109, theaterforthenewcity.net
JUST KIDDING: SUZI SHELTON'S WINTER SOLSTICE CONCERT at Symphony Space (Dec. 21, 11 a.m.). Shelton may be honoring the solstice, but the themes she will explore -- tolerance and inclusiveness -- are worth celebrating at any time. A singer, songwriter and guitarist who specializes in upbeat pop music for children, Shelton will offer songs from her latest album, "Hand in Hand," which includes rousing tunes like "Can You Feel the Power?" and "We Shall Walk," which was written by Emma Mitri, her teenage daughter. (You'll hear holiday numbers, too.) Appearing with her band as part of the Just Kidding series, Shelton will be joined by guests who include her fellow recording artists Sonia de los Santos and Joanie Leeds. A wintry bonus: Arriving children can have their faces embellished with a glittering snowflake.

KLEZ FOR KIDS at the Museum at Eldridge Street (Dec. 25, noon and 2:30 p.m.). This year, one person's Christmas Day is another's Hanukkah night. But whatever holiday you celebrate, all are welcome at this festive concert, an annual tradition on the Lower East Side. The sound will be klezmer -- Jewish music that combines cantorial rhythms with Eastern European folk traditions -- but the fun will include more than listening. The clarinetist Greg Wall and his band, Klezmerfest!, will engage their young audience in singing, dancing and learning a little Yiddish. After each performance, the museum will celebrate the fourth night of Hanukkah with more songs and a menorah lighting. And if you'd like to beguile your eyes as well as your ears, investigate "Lighting the World: Menorahs Around the Globe," a show that features lamps from five centuries.
212-219-0302, eldridgestreet.org
'POKÉMON DETECTIVE PIKACHU' (Dec. 21, 11:30 a.m.; Dec. 22-23 and Dec. 26, noon; through Jan. 1) and 'CHRISTMAS EVE ON SESAME STREET' (Dec. 22, 2 p.m.) at the Museum of the Moving Image. Two fluffy, friendly and very yellow (in color, that is) characters will help children visiting this Queens museum enjoy the start of the public-school winter break. The first is Pikachu, the adorable rodentlike creature with electrical powers that is a star of the Pokémon franchise. In Rob Letterman's film "Pokémon Detective Pikachu," the little fellow (created here with computer-generated animation and Ryan Reynolds's voice) has gained three dimensions, a prodigious English vocabulary and a bit of an attitude, as well as crime-solving abilities. Although Pikachu's PG-rated adventure in the company of a human (Justice Smith), which is recommended for viewers 8 and older, didn't win over Ben Kenigsberg, the New York Times critic, it fared well at the box office and will be shown every day of the recess except Christmas Eve and Christmas Day. The other sunny hero to appear onscreen is Big Bird, the gentle giant of "Sesame Street." On Sunday little fans and nostalgic grown-ups can watch "Christmas Eve on Sesame Street," a 1978 television special in which Big Bird, who would have trouble fitting down a chimney himself, wonders how Santa does it. The show also features Muppet characters like Bert and Ernie, who have gift-giving issues to resolve, and Oscar the Grouch, for whom "Happy Holidays" is an oxymoron. But at the museum, they all may be upstaged by a human star: Sonia Manzano, who played Maria on the show for more than 40 years. She and other guests will attend the screening, which will also include clips from still more seasonal "Sesame Street" specials.

'THE VERY HUNGRY CATERPILLAR SHOW EXPERIENCE' at the Melville Gallery (Dec. 21-22 and 26, 10 and 11:30 a.m. and 1 p.m.; through Dec. 29). This little larva with the big appetite, one of the favorite creations of the children's author and illustrator Eric Carle, is back to chewing scenery as well as leaves and fruits. Jonathan Rockefeller, who first adapted the caterpillar's story and those of some other Carle characters in 2016, has returned with another iteration of this stage show, this time at the South Street Seaport. The version here uses the production's captivating puppets to dramatize "The Very Hungry Caterpillar" and one additional Carle work, either "10 Little Rubber Ducks" or "Brown Bear, Brown Bear, What Do You See?" (That book'stext is by Bill Martin Jr.) The second story you encounter depends on the performance you attend. Each hourlong presentation (some shows are sold out) includes audience participation and a chance to take a photograph with the very hungry hero.

Texto completo: It may seem a rather negative way to kick-off a New Year’s column, but let’s face it, big bad stuff happens:
A teen-age daughter develops Tourette’s
A toddler begins stuttering
A beloved relative passes away
A spouse cheats
A career ends in infamy
A home is lost in bankruptcy
Even smaller bad stuff happens:
Blowing a history test
Not making the team
Breaking a favorite knickknack
The dry cleaner losing your cashmere sweater
Putting a huge dent in your new car
How do we rebound? And what do we do with our feelings when the mad and the sad and the bad come along? What do we do when our emotions are out of control?
I know from experience the last thing we should do is turn our ugly, volatile feelings inward and wreak havoc on ourselves – nor dump those explosive emotions on those we love.
I was riding my bike one Sunday afternoon, listening to Terry Gross’s podcast “Fresh Air.” She was interviewing Marielle Heller, the director of the movie “A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood” – all about Mr. Fred Rogers.
She mentioned that before she started directing Tom Hanks (who plays Rogers) and the other actors, she visited the Buddhist Zen Center in Brooklyn. Heller learned it’s not about turning away from the pain, but embracing it fully – that is the goal of enlightenment. When we are able to feel all the pain, we are able to empathize with what others are going through. We become like a vessel to hold it. And when we are enlightened, we are at peace.
Mr. Rogers’ gift to his young audiences was telling kids the truth. And tackling tough subjects.
What do you do when nothing seems to be working our right?
Fred Rogers was a sick child – often isolated and frequently bullied. And in his own head a lot – left to his own devices. Many speculate that his childhood experiences may be one reason he spent the rest of life trying to be both super connected and a source of relentless kindness.
I learned more about Mr. Rogers from an article written by Jeanne Marie Laskas in the New York Times Magazine.
A few of Fred Rogers’ thoughts worth carrying forth into the New Year:
I think the greatest thing about things is that they remind you of people.
Even though Fred was sickly as a child with asthma and rheumatic fever, his grandfather told Fred: You’ve got to learn to do things for yourself.
He also told Fred: There’s only one person in the world like you and I happen to like you just the way you are.
Fred said that went right into his heart and it never budged.
Fred Rogers explored the emotional landscape of kids and realized along with his lifetime collaborator, Margaret McFarland, that anything human is mentionable and anything mentionable is manageable.
And that creativity fills the gap between what is and what might be.
May we all have a simple, manageable 2020 -buoyed by creativity and caring – and aimed at re-shaping a new and better world.
Adapting that mindset is the first thing - and maybe the only thing- on my 2020 New Year’s Resolution List
I hope it’s on yours too.
Keep Preserving Your Bloom,
Iris Ruth Pastor

Kelly Clarkson's cover of 'Shallow' at Resch makes New York Times list of 2019's best performances

Texto completo: Green Bay landed a spot on The New York Times' year-end list of the "Best of 2019 Culture" — yes, you read that right — and Kelly Clarkson is to thank.
The singer's cover of Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper's "Shallow" at the Resch Center on Feb. 15 is featured as one of the year's best performances under the headline "Who Stole the Show?"
Clarkson performed the Grammy and Oscar-winning smash from "A Star Is Born" for the first time during the Green Bay stop on her Meaning of Life Tour. It quickly went viral, with Rolling Stone, Billboard, Entertainment Weekly, People and Vogue posting Clarkson's video of the performance before a crowd of 7,000.
The New York Times story by critic-at-large Wesley Morris listed "Kelly Clarkson doing 'Shallow' live in Green Bay" among such memorable performances as the acting of Phoebe Waller-Bridge and Andrew Scott on Amazon comedy "Fleabag" and Gayle King's one-on-one interview with R. Kelly on "CBS This Morning."
Wesley wrote of Clarkson's performance: "In February, before she laid her soaring stank on Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper's mega hit, Clarkson apologized for any perceivable disservice. But this murder was premeditated: She was barefoot. Anybody who plans to put a hurtin' on a song does it shoelessly."
Clarkson performed the song during an extended version of her "A Minute and a Glass of Wine" webisode and shared the performance on Facebook Live.
"I hope I don't suck, and if I do, I hope she (Lady Gaga) doesn't see it," Clarkson told the Resch crowd before she sang it.
No joke: Scoopski Potatoes Tour coming to Resch Brace yourself for Murr, Sal, Q and Joe.
The notorious pranksters from truTV's "Impractical Jokers" will unleash their mischief on Green Bay with a show July 15 at the Resch Center for The Scoopski Potatoes Tour.
It's the first time The Tenderloins — the New York-based comedy troupe of James Murray, Sal Vulcano, Brian Quinn and Joe Gatto and also the real-life friends, creators, executive producers and stars of "Impractical Jokers" — are taking over the Resch. It's not, however, their first time in Green Bay, where their popularity continues to propel them to bigger venues. After selling out two shows at the Meyer Theatre in 2014, they did back-to-back shows at the Weidner Center in 2016.
Tickets start at $52.50 and are on sale at ticketstaronline.com, 800-895-0071 and the Resch Center box office.
If you've never laughed at an episode of "Impractical Jokers," the reality show follows the four guys as they dare each other to do embarrassing things in public while the hidden camera rolls on the unsuspecting public's reaction. If they fail, they face punishments. They've done everything from eat a stick of deodorant in front of people in a waiting room to gift wrapping items in the carts of unsuspecting grocery store shoppers to asking strangers on the beach to urinate on a jellyfish sting.
The live show is recommended for ages 16 and older.
The foursome also stars on "The Misery Index," the TBS game show that debuted this fall and has been renewed for a second season.

This Was the Year Women Got 'Horny'

Texto completo: Women reclaimed a word once the province of crass boys and men who are boys.
Coffee, "Star Wars," turtlenecks, grief: These four seemingly unrelated things are "horny" -- or induce horniness -- at least according to many young women online, who are openly asserting their desires with a term long thought of as crass and juvenile.
But now, like vape stores or a broken container of glitter, it's suddenly everywhere.
Take the last few months, when people called chicken parm, Ariana Grande's "Christmas and Chill" EP and the obsessions of right-wing conspiracy theorists "horny." While promoting "Hustlers," Jennifer Lopez told GQ, "A lot of things make me horny." It would seem as though people are horny for the word itself.
Phonetically speaking, "horny" is ugly. It lends itself to a nasal sound that's comically inelegant. "Horny" is the aural equivalent of those Chinese Crested dogs that are so ugly that it's actually funny -- endearing, even. "Horny" has benefited, in part, from that same so-bad-it's-good rationality.
"I used to hate the word," Sophia Benoit said. "I used to think it was so disgusting." Ms. Benoit writes a column for GQ about the sexiest things that men did during the month, called "Horny on Main," which on the internet means posting sexually charged content to your main social media account, as opposed to posting on a separate, and likely secret, account that was created for that purpose. (According to Know Your Meme, a website that investigates and documents online phenomena, the first appearance of "horny on main" was in June 2016.)
"But I love it now, because I think we, especially women, have reclaimed it and made it not gross," Ms. Benoit said.
And it's true that, before this renaissance, "horny" had been gross for quite a long time. For many, the word has been most closely associated with unbridled adolescent male arousal thanks to conventional teen sex comedies like "Porky's" or "American Pie."
It was mischievous, it was socially acceptable, but above all, it was decidedly masculine. It's a perception that was hundreds of years in the making.
This will probably come as a shock to absolutely no one, but the word "horny" stems from the description of an animal horn. Twenty-five years ago, William Safire wrote about "horny" for his etymology column in The New York Times Magazine, noting that a "horn is hard; it is shaft-shaped; since the 15th century, it has been used as a symbol for the male's erect sex organ."
But here we are, half a millennium later, and women are not just aroused, not just sexual beings, but are, indeed, horny, and reclaiming a word that never really applied to them to begin with.
"Horny" first went mainstream about halfway into 2018. That year, The Cut, a female-focused vertical from New York Magazine, dedicated all its content during one week to "summer horniness."
Broadly, a female-focused vertical from Vice Media (which I used to edit), published a year-end roundup of "the horniest things that happened." Teen Vogue explained what horny is and how to spot it to its young readership.
And of course, there was the "horny Beto tweet" that brought horny Twitter to many people's timelines: Leah McElrath, a middle-aged political analyst, compared the potential Democratic presidential candidates Richard Ojeda, Michael Avenatti and Beto O'Rourke in terms of graphic sexual analogies.
Around the same time, BuzzFeed started "Thirst Aid Kit," a podcast hosted by Bim Adewunmi and Nichole Perkins. ("Thirst" is a term that can take a few different meanings, including overt eagerness -- yes, sexually). The show was canceled, along with several other BuzzFeed podcasts, but was later picked up by Slate in September.
It's possible that after a solid year of #MeToo, in which women were using social media to publicly share sexual harassment and abuse allegations, asserting what they didn't want, maybe it felt good to pivot to communicating what they did want. Expressing one's horniness, as a woman, represents a significant shift from that of sexual object to sexual subject.
Allison P. Davis, a staff writer for New York magazine and The Cut, considers it a form of thwarting the patriarchy.
"It's being used as a sort of overcorrection to this idea that women can't be heard when they express their desires," Ms. Davis said. "It's a big, bold way of taking up space."
She would know. Ms. Davis is writing a book called "Horny," a combination of personal storytelling and cultural reporting on "one of the last great taboos: female horniness." It is due out next year from Avid Reader Press.
Ms. Benoit also thinks that the substantial contextual difference in this modern form of horniness is rooted in women's liberation. "I think what is so nice about the reclaiming of 'horny' for the people that are using it now is that it's from people whose horniness hasn't been harmful to others, historically."
However, she says that the recent popularization of "horny" predates the sexual harassment scandals of 2017 and 2018, first popping up on Twitter three or four years ago. "I think #MeToo came from women already knowing that they can have sex on their own terms, which is what horny is about," she said.
A People's History of Horny Culture
The idea that women could at once loathe sexual impropriety and desire dirty sex seems simple and obvious, yet it's been an agonizingly protracted journey for us to arrive here.
In the early 1980s, "the feminist sex wars" -- polarizing debates within the women's movement around issues like sexual activity and pornography -- heralded feminism's third wave, with sex-positive writers like Susie Bright, Camille Paglia and Annie Sprinkle discussing and advocating women's sexual desires, a topic that remained a subversive concept for decades to come.
In 1992, Madonna's artistic exploration of her own horniness was brought to the mainstream with the release of her coffee table book, "Sex," and her album "Erotica." Both efforts were, at the time, received with vitriol by critics who believed she had "gone too far," but are considered today as misunderstood masterpieces.
The market for vibrators is a fast and dirty way to grasp the glacial pace of progress in this matter. Good Vibrations, the pioneering, women-friendly sex-toy retailer, was founded in San Francisco in 1977.
Twenty years later, vibrator shopping was depicted as a healthy and normal element of female sexuality on an episode of "Sex and the City," and then another 20 years after that, vibrators became available for sale in Walmart. And yet, despite sex toys for women being stocked and sold in the largest retailer in America, there are still plenty of people who still just don't get it.
"The narrative, that women don't get as horny as men, is starting, very slowly, to crack," Ms. Benoit said. "I think it's going to take a long time because the bedrock of that belief is still there."
The age-old misperception that men get horny and women don't was sharply addressed and debunked in a 2017 episode of "Big Mouth," Netflix's animated series about a group of seventh graders navigating their way through puberty. The episode is called "Girls Are Horny Too," and the revelation promised by the title makes several (male) characters' heads explode.
Female adolescent sexuality was also explored in the first season of "Pen15," Hulu's comedy series about two 13-year-old girls -- played by adult women, Maya Erskine and Anna Konkle -- in "middle school as it really happened." In the episode "Ojichan," Ms. Erskine's character discovers masturbation and it quickly becomes an obsession that dominates her life.
The contemporary, healthy representations of puberty and horniness in these two shows are, in a way, retroactively healing the scars of shame we have brought with us into adulthood.
This hornier shift in pop-cultural depictions of women has certainly played an important part in both advancing horny's favor and evolving society's understanding of female sexuality. "Fleabag," Phoebe Waller-Bridge's critically acclaimed British dramedy, featured a young woman whose strongest character trait -- being horny -- was decidedly not male.
"Mrs. Fletcher," the HBO mini-series about a middle-aged woman's sexual reawakening, showcases a horny mom who can't stop masturbating to pornography.
These episodes of "Big Mouth" and "Pen15" episodes, and "Fleabag," were all written by women. Every episode, thus far, of "Mrs. Fletcher" has also been directed by a woman.
There's an unsubtle distinction in arousal: Erections are visible. Women's genitalia, for the most part, are hidden, helping to shroud female desire in mystery. Truly, the most reliable way to know if a woman is horny is if she says so. These days, women are doing just that.

Texto completo: To the Editor:
Re "Apprenticeship a Growing Alternative to College (and Debt)" (news article, Dec. 11):
There are reasons to applaud these new programs: a sure path to employment, financial security, a valued social role. But I fear that these programs can widen an already huge inequality gap, so that rich people will continue to go to college, and everyone else will move from high school straight into the labor force.
At the City College of New York, where I teach English, students who work also get chances to explore important questions. Studying the humanities and arts provides them with time to think about the world and what it values, and perhaps have a hand in reshaping those values.
Making college affordable offers more to students than apprenticeships can because a college education gives students a chance to change the world rather than consign them merely to a safe place inside it.

Texto completo: Headnote Check It Out
My cousin was in town from D.C. We had lunch. While waiting for our orders he told me he had a topic I might be interested in turning into a column. He called it: Progress doesn't leave people behind. As you can see, I liked it as a title in the form of a question, but it wasn't a philosophical inquiry for my cousin, it was a declarative statement.
He added, "Put your own spin on it, but you get the gist."
I'm better with big pictures than I am with gists. My mind immediately did a historical analysis surmising that the wheels of progress have crushed civilizations, kingdoms, empires, economies, institutions, and industries for centuries. That's the nature of the phenomenon. But my cousin's analysis was contemporary. It stemmed from driving through neighborhoods in the process of gentrification and his frustration with the inequities produced by capitalism.
Since I adhere to Voltaire's dictum: If you wish to converse with me, define your terms, I said, first, we need a working definition of progress.
My cousin replied, "Progress is a hard process to define."
This brief conversation illustrates the problem with contemporary political discourse. It's rooted in terms not clearly defined or used haphazardly. In a talk called: The dying art of disagreement, New York Times Columnist Bret Stephens stated the great debates throughout history were never based on a misunderstanding; they came to fruition through complete comprehension of the matter.
My understanding of progress came from the evidence compiled in the historical record, but my cousin examined the negative outcomes of contemporary activities, like poor people being displaced due to gentrification and took a moral stance. His statement, progress doesn't leave people behind, advanced the notion that any activity that leaves people behind is inhumane and cannot be called progress. (Fredrick Douglass said without struggle, there's no progress, my cousin's version would be there's no progress, if people are struggling.)
I understand the sentiment, but I didn't understand how he could make a moral judgment without a working definition of progress. Here are two definitions. 1). A forward movement to an objective. 2). Gradual betterment, especially the progressive development of humankind. Neither definition implies that people will not be left behind. I stated in the beginning, it's the nature of the phenomenon, but my cousin called progress a hard process.
So, is progress a phenomenon or process? Progress as a phenomenon is a situation that exists whose cause is unexplainable, and progress as a process is a series of actions taken in order to achieve a particular end.
The answer is both. The totality of the political, social, and economic processes creates a phenomenon that doesn't subject itself to simple explanations. There are literally thousands of variables that contribute to "progress" and "people being left behind."
The real question is if progress should be redefined by moral outcomes. I'm agnostic on that metric, but my cousin took a leap of faith, making his thought process on the issue more advanced and progressive than mine. In other words, he has left me behind.

Texto completo: A missing 16-year-old girl was found after a harrowing video appeared to show her being taken from a Bronx street Monday night, but there are now questions about her apparent abduction after media reports it was staged.
Authorities released video of the incident, which they say shows Karol Sanchez walking with her mother around 11:30 p. m. Monday before several men in a beige sedan forced her into the car and drove away.
An Amber Alert was issued Tuesday, and Karol was later found in the Bronx safe and unharmed, Rodney Harrison, chief of the NYPD detectives department, announced on Twitter.
But the incident took another turn Tuesday evening when multiple news organizations, including The New York Times, New York Post, New York Daily News and CBS New York, reported the 16-year-old admitted to staging the abduction, citing unnamed police sources.
The reports capped a confusing 24 hours in which Karol gained widespread sympathy and concern on social media, only to face questions regarding the validity of the incident.
"The investigation remains ongoing," Detective Denise Moroney, an NYPD spokesperson, said in a statement to USA TODAY on Wednesday morning.
The grainy, black-and-white footage from Monday shows a brief struggle as the girl's mother attempts to fight back before being pushed to the ground.
Four men were believed to have been involved in the apparent kidnapping, but two men stayed in the car, police say.
However, it took over 12 hours for an Amber Alert to be issued, The New York Times reported, which drew some criticism.
“Across our country and across the Bronx, across the city, black girls in particular are disappearing, and no one seems to care,” Jumaane Williams, the city’s public advocate, told reporters, according to the Times. “We do want to know why the Amber Alert took so long. ”
Brendan Lyons, superintendent of Arlington Central School District, said Karol is a sophomore at the high school.
“We are so relieved that she has been found safe and are ready to support her and her family when she returns to school,” Lyons said in the afternoon Tuesday.
The circumstances of Karol's return were unclear. The New York Post reported that the 16-year-old reappeared at the same intersection from which she had been last seen and approached two police officer's squad car.
Multiple video sources online Tuesday afternoon showed her leaving the NYPD’s 40th precinct with family before getting into a car. She did not acknowledge questions from reporters.
It was not immediately clear if there were any criminal charges stemming from the incident.

‘Empty faith led by a bogus prophet’: George Conway leads Never Trumpers denouncing president

Texto completo: A group of President Trump’s staunchest critics, including White House counselor Kellyanne Conway’s husband, is starting a super PAC in hopes of stopping his reelection.
The organization, dubbed the Lincoln Project, is led by a seven-person advisory council, including conservative lawyer George Conway, former John McCain adviser Steve Schmidt, former John Kasich adviser John Weaver, veteran Republican operative Rick Wilson, political strategist Reed Galen, former chairwoman of the New Hampshire Republican Party Jennifer Horn, and former political director of the California Republican Party Mike Madrid.
Their efforts launched Tuesday, and the group published an opinion piece in the New York Times describing their mission.
“Patriotism and the survival of our nation in the face of the crimes, corruption and corrosive nature of Donald Trump are a higher calling than mere politics. As Americans, we must stem the damage he and his followers are doing to the rule of law, the Constitution and the American character,” the authors wrote. "Mr. Trump and his enablers have abandoned conservatism and longstanding Republican principles and replaced it with Trumpism, an empty faith led by a bogus prophet."
“Over these next 11 months, our efforts will be dedicated to defeating President Trump and Trumpism at the ballot box and to elect those patriots who will hold the line,” the piece said.
The group has fundraising commitments exceeding $1 million and hopes to raise and spend millions more on an advertising campaign in 2020 battleground states in an effort to sway disaffected Republicans and independent voters to break from Trump and the senate candidates who support him, according to the Associated Press.
Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Arizona, and North Carolina will have the group’s focus in the presidential campaign, Weaver said. Their Senate efforts would likely include Arizona, Colorado, North Carolina, Maine, and possibly Kansas and Kentucky.
“I think the more the merrier,” Conway said of his hopes that the anonymous Trump administration official who wrote a book critical of the president would join their efforts.
“And I hope maybe he — he or she, I don’t know who Anonymous is — will come out someday and join the effort. Because everyone who believes as we do that Donald Trump is a cancer on the presidency and on the Constitution needs to help and join this effort,” he said.
Conway explained that he would serve as a “cheerleader” for the organization because of his limited political experience. His wife, Kellyanne Conway, was Trump’s campaign manager when he won the 2016 election.
“I’m not a fundraiser or political consultant, but if I could help in that way and learn how to do that — even to raise a nickel or two — I’ll do it because it’s important,” he said. “For this, I think I can make an exception.”
Day-to-day operations will be led by Galen and Horn.

Texto completo: Erica Tishman, arquitecto y vicepresidente de una compañía de gestión de proyectos, murió trágicamente esta mañana al caerle en la cabeza un escombro que se desprendió de un edificio en Midtown West.
La policía dijo que Tishman caminaba por la calle 49 y 7ma avenida , alrededor de las 10:45 a.m., cuando fue golpeada por un trozo de fachada del edificio. Fue declarada muerta en la escena, informó New York Post.
Los registros del edificio de la ciudad muestran que la propiedad, 729 7th Avenue, fue citada en abril por “no mantener la fachada exterior del edificio y los accesorios”.
Los inspectores de construcción observaron que “la terracota dañada en áreas por encima del piso 15 en varios lugares representa un peligro de caída para los peatones”.
Tishman, de 60 años, era vicepresidenta de Zubatkin Owner Representation LLC. Recibió una licenciatura en la Universidad de Princeton en 1981 y una maestría en arquitectura de la Escuela de Graduados de Diseño de la Universidad de Harvard, según su perfil en LinkedIn.
Nacida como Erica Lindenbaum, se casó con el analista financiero Steven Tishman el 20 de junio de 1982, según el anuncio de la boda de la pareja en The New York Times.
También era la nieta de Abraham Lindenbaum, ex presidente de Brooklyn Law School.
Los Tishman han sido miembros de la Sinagoga Central en Manhattan desde 1992, y Erica sirvió como síndica en el templo.

Texto completo: The former director of the FBI and the CIA assailed President Trump and Attorney General William Barr’s attacks on the bureau, calling it “dangerous and unwarranted.”
Last week, Trump suggested he lacked confidence in his own FBI director, Christopher Wray, and Barr said he disagreed with the finding of a report by the Justice Department watchdog, who concluded the FBI lawfully opened its Russia investigation.
“The aspersions cast upon them by the president and my longtime friend, Attorney General William P. Barr, are troubling in the extreme,” William Webster, 95, who was director of the FBI from 1978 to 1987 and the CIA from 1987 to 1991, wrote in a scathing opinion article for the New York Times.
“Calling FBI professionals ‘scum,’ as the president did, is a slur against people who risk their lives to keep us safe. Mr. Barr’s charges of bias within the FBI, made without providing any evidence and in direct dispute of the findings of the nonpartisan inspector general, risk inflicting enduring damage on this critically important institution,” he added, calling the attacks a "dire threat" the country.
Webster, a Republican, argued that Barr is doing a disservice to the country by disputing Inspector General Michael Horowitz’s conclusion and claiming that the FBI investigation was based on “a completely bogus narrative.”
“In fact, the report conclusively found that the evidence to initiate the Russia investigation was unassailable. There were more than 100 contacts between members of the Trump campaign and Russian agents during the 2016 campaign, and Russian efforts to undermine our democracy continue to this day,” he wrote.
Webster also accused Trump and Barr of interfering with the bureau’s independence and called for lawmakers of both parties to defend the rule of law.
“This difficult moment demands the restoration of the proper place of the Department of Justice and the F.B.I. as bulwarks of law and order in America. This is not about politics,” he said.
In his report, Horowitz said the FBI made serious errors and omissions in its applications for surveillance warrants on former Trump campaign aide Carter Page, but he said he could not find evidence that the decision to open an investigation was motivated by political bias.
Former FBI Director James Comey, who was fired by Trump, admitted Sunday he was “overconfident” in defending the bureau’s use of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act in the Russia investigation.

Texto completo: Annet Negesa, Uganda's 800-meter Olympic hopeful, says she was advised to undergo an irreversible surgery because of naturally elevated testosterone levels. Her career has never been the same.
Annet Negesa had just finished training in Kampala, Uganda, in June 2012 when she received a call from a doctor from track and field's world governing body. He told her that she would no longer be competing in the London Olympics because her testosterone levels were too high for competition.
"I went back into the house and started crying," she recalled.
Negesa was 20 at the time and one of the top athletes in her country, a promising middle-distance runner who had set a national record for 800 meters earlier in the year at a meet in Hengelo, the Netherlands. She was a three-time national champion and took home a gold medal at the 2011 All-Africa Games. The Uganda Athletics Federation named her athlete of the year.
World Athletics, formerly the International Association of Athletics Federations, or I.A.A.F., track and field's world governing body, did not catch Negesa using performance-enhancing drugs. Rather, she is an intersex athlete.
She identifies as female and was born with external female genitalia but also with internal male genitalia that produce levels of testosterone that men do. According to sports officials, that gave her an unfair advantage over most women in some events.
What makes Negesa different from so many other intersex athletes is that she tried to alter her body with surgery so she could continue to compete. Negesa claims that a doctor for World Athletics recommended the surgery. The federation denies this.
For seven years, Negesa, 27, refused to speak about what happened. But time did little to assuage her grievances.
"Now I see my body as different, very, very different," she said. "I don't know how to talk about it."
The years since the surgery have been a struggle. Negesa has battled persistent headaches and achy joints. Her postoperative care, she said, has not included the kind of hormone treatment that might have helped her body adjust to the change.
"What happened to Annet is dangerous, and happened because she wanted to compete," said Payoshni Mitra, a researcher and activist on gender and sports who has lectured on the topic of intersex athletes.
For the past decade, Mitra has stood alongside numerous intersex athletes, including Caster Semenya, the South African middle-distance champion, and Dutee Chand, the Indian sprinter. Negesa's case, however, was one of the most difficult ones for Mitra to reconcile because Negesa opted to have surgery.
For years, World Athletics has struggled to create rules that maintain a level playing field for the overwhelming majority of women with only female genitalia without impinging on the human rights of intersex people, who account for roughly one in every 2,000 births. A study this year found that female athletes with male testosterone levels are overrepresented in women's middle-distance races.
World Athletics, in a decade of research, found that nearly seven in every 1,000 elite female athletes are intersex athletes with levels of testosterone within the male range. Some endocrinologists have concluded it remains unclear whether high testosterone gives athletes a competitive edge, but many scientists believe it does.
After years of litigation, the Court of Arbitration for Sport in May upheld World Athletics' testosterone restrictions for female athletes in races with distances from 400 meters to the mile. The court ruled by a 2-to-1 vote that the restrictions were indeed discriminatory but also a "necessary, reasonable and proportionate" means of achieving the World Athletics goal of preserving a level playing field in women's track events.
Most women, including elite female athletes, have natural testosterone levels of 0.12 to 1.79 nanomoles per liter, World Athletics said, while the typical male range after puberty is much higher, at 7.7 to 29.4 nanomoles per liter.
Intersex athletes who want to participate in middle-distance women's track events must take hormone-suppressing drugs and reduce testosterone levels below five nanomoles per liter for six months before competing, then maintain those lowered levels.
But Negesa, the eldest of nine siblings raised in a village in Jinja, Uganda, southeast of the Nile, had a much more invasive intervention after she learned in 2012 that she could not compete.
She said a World Athletics physician, Dr. Stéphane Bermon, told her she needed to undergo medical treatment and was given surgery as her first option: a gonadectomy to remove her internal testes.
"I love my sport so much, that's why I decided to go for the surgery," she said in a recent video interview from Germany, where she now lives.
After Negesa appeared in a documentary on German television's ARD network in October, World Athletics issued a statement denying that it participated in or recommended a specific treatment to Negesa.
"Dr. Bermon has never met the athlete in question and was not at either the consultation in Nice nor the surgery she speaks of in Uganda," the statement said. Through a World Athletics spokesman, Dr. Bermon declined to comment.
Negesa said she traveled alone to Nice for medical tests soon after learning she could not compete. She recalled having her body measurements taken by two doctors who spoke in French. Negesa speaks Swahili and English.
"It was so weird," she recalled. "I was shy."
She returned to Kampala for treatment, and paid $ 900 for the procedure.
On the morning of her surgery in Kampala, she had little knowledge of what she was about to undergo. Doctors had told her that it was a simple surgery and that she would return to competition in a few weeks.
"I woke up in the morning feeling cuts on my body," she said. "I felt so scared. I didn't know that I was going to be cut open."
She hasn't returned to the sport and has suffered from depression and joint pain since the operation.
Negesa's medical records from the Women's Hospital International & Fertility Centre in Kampala were reviewed by The New York Times and confirm that World Athletics, then known as the I.A.A.F., recommended a thorough medical examination, citing the high levels of testosterone in her body. The report states that after her testing in Nice she had a gonadectomy in Kampala. The document states that her surgeon in Kampala, Dr. Edward Tamale Sali, did not start her on hormone therapy because he was awaiting further discussion with Dr. Bermon.
Dr. Tamale Sali declined to comment.
In 2013, Dr. Bermon, now director of the World Athletics' health and science department, published a report citing four unidentified athletes from developing countries who were referred to hospitals in France for naturally high testosterone levels.
"I think I was the first one," Negesa said of the four athletes cited in the study. She said Dr. Bermon was the World Athletics official who first called her in 2012.
After Negesa's appearance in the German documentary in September, 25 French athletes wrote to World Athletics, the International Olympic Committee and the minister of sports and health calling for an investigation.
The French minister of sports and minister of health opened a joint investigation in October.
In its statement, World Athletics said it does not advise athletes on preferred treatments and did not do so in this case. The global federation "has never forced any athlete affected by its regulations to undergo surgery, nor paid for any of their treatment."
In March, the United Nations Human Rights Council condemned World Athletics' attempt to regulate female athletes' testosterone levels. And in May the World Medical Association advised physicians around the world to abstain from implementing the new regulations.
"They are assigned female at birth and have grown up to have a female gender identity, so there's no question that they belong in that category," said Katrina Karkazis, a fellow at Yale University's Global Health Justice Partnership.
Negesa said that returning home, where L.G.B.T. individuals are openly condemned, would lead to imprisonment or death.
She filed for asylum in Berlin in September, and was granted it this month.
She runs every day, with the hope of one day returning to international competition. Her next step, though, is litigation. "I need to take them to court," she said of World Athletics, "for violating my human rights."

Texto completo: The flood of sexual harassment and assault allegations against him brought on the tide of the #MeToo movement.
But Harvey Weinstein is lamenting his accomplishments, which he says have been washed away by the more than 80 women who have made accusations against him.
“I feel like the forgotten man,’’ Weinstein told The New York Post in an interview Friday at New York-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center, where he had surgery the day before to remove bone plates compressing his vertebrae.
The disgraced movie mogul told The Post he should be remembered for doing more than anyone else to advance the careers of women, angering his many of accusers who responded in a blistering statement.
More: Reports: Harvey Weinstein close to $25M settlement with some accusers but won't have to pay
Why is Harvey Weinstein limping? Bad back pain, says his lawyer
“I made more movies directed by women and about women than any filmmaker, and I’m talking about 30 years ago. I’m not talking about now when it’s vogue," Weinstein said. "I did it first! I pioneered it!”
“It all got eviscerated because of what happened,’’ Weinstein added. “My work has been forgotten. ’’
During the interview, his first in more than a year, The Post said Weinstein refused to speak about the allegations against him and threatened to end the discussion at questions he didn’t like.
Weinstein is facing trial in New York Jan. 6 on five sex crime charges, including rape and sexual assault. His bail was raised last week from $1 million to $5 million after allegations he mishandled his electronic ankle monitor, which his lawyers blamed on "technical glitches. "
Weinstein has pleaded not guilty to the charges against him. He has been free on $1 million bail since his arrest in May 2018.
In response to Weinstein's interview, 23 women, including Ashley Judd, Rosanna Arquette and Rose McGowan, are sharing their thoughts in a joint statement sent to USA TODAY on Sunday.
“Harvey Weinstein is trying to gaslight society again. He says in a new interview he doesn’t want to be forgotten. Well, he won’t be. He will be remembered as a sexual predator and an unrepentant abuser who took everything and deserves nothing," the group, The Silence Breakers, stated. "He will be remembered by the collective will of countless women who stood up and said enough. We refuse to let this predator rewrite his legacy of abuse. ”
In a statement to USA TODAY Monday, lawyer Gloria Allred, who represents multiple accusers, also reacted to Weinstein's interview.
"Everything that Harvey Weinstein has done professionally for women is overshadowed by the serious allegations of sexual misconduct made by more than 60 women," Allred's statement read. "He states, 'I feel like the forgotten man. ' He is not forgotten. He is a defendant in a high-profile criminal case in which he is charged with serious crimes against women including rape, criminal sexual assault and allegations of predatory sexual assault. "
She continued, "Whatever he has done professionally for women in the film industry is not the focus of attention now. He states, ‘It all got eviscerated because of what happened. ’ He is right. The issues and charges in the criminal case should be the sole focus at this time. . . Whining at this point by Mr. Weinstein is revolting. He needs to ‘woman up,’ meaning that he should act appropriately and just respond in court to the charges against him. ”
Last week, The New York Times and Variety reported Weinstein was close to a $25 million settlement deal over civil suits with more than 30 of his accusers under terms in which he won't have to pay nor admit to wrongdoing.
During the interview, Weinstein talked about his charity work – “This was a company that took social issues and tackled them" – and his humble beginnings in Flushing, Queens.
“I want this city to recognize who I was instead of what I’ve become,” he said.

Texto completo: Felix Rohatyn, una importante figura de Wall Street a quien se adjudica haber salvado a Nueva York de la bancarrota murió el sábado a los 91 años de edad en su casa de Manhattan, anunció su hijo citado por The New York Times.
Este refugiado judío nacido en Austria y naturalizado estadounidense se hizo conocido en el campo de las finanzas acumulando éxitos en el sector de fusiones y adquisiciones y escalando lugares del prestigioso banco de inversión Lazard Frères (ahora Lazard).
Hábil negociador, se convirtió en un asesor escuchado por las élites políticas estadounidenses e innumerables hombres de negocios, construyendo una reputación como un hombre capaz de encontrar una solución aceptable para los problemas más difíciles. Lo llamaban “Felix, el reparador”.
Esta cualidad le valió la misión de salvar a Nueva York de la bancarrota en la década de 1970 , cuando la ciudad se estaba desmoronando. Una tarea que llevaría a cabo mucho más tiempo de lo inicialmente planeado, supervisando las finanzas de la ciudad durante 18 años.
“La vida extraordinaria de Felix Rohatyn es una historia emblemática de Nueva York”, dijo el alcalde de la ciudad, Bill de Blasio.

People
Hello, and welcome to this week's episode of "Who's Getting Arrested with Jane Fonda?"
Sally Field is the latest in Fonda's revolving door of guest stars to be taken away in zip ties as part of the "Grace and Frankie" actress' Fire Drill Fridays climate change protests. A lively crowd in Washington, D.C., cheered and applauded Field, who raised her cuffed fists in triumph Friday as an officer marched her down the steps of the Capitol building.
The Oscar winner joins Fonda's growing army of celebrities that has been arrested while urging the government to take action on climate change, including Ted Danson, Diane Lane, Piper Perabo, Catherine Keener, Rosanna Arquette, Sam Waterston and ringleader Fonda, who has racked up four Fire Drill Fridays arrests since the demonstrations began in October.
Simmons confronts Oprah over documentary
Music mogul Russell Simmons is challenging Oprah Winfrey for executive producing a documentary featuring a woman who has accused him of rape.
On Friday, Simmons took to Instagram to express his disappointment with Winfrey, whom he said he regarded fondly as a positive figure in his life before criticizing her decision to make a film exploring sexual assault allegations against him. The Apple TV+ project, set to debut at the Sundance Film Festival early next year, spotlights Drew Dixon, one of the first women to publicly accuse Simmons of rape.
"Dearest OPRAH, you have been a shining light to my family and my community. Contributing so much to my life that I couldn't list a fraction of it in this blog," Simmons captioned a photo of himself and Winfrey having a book talk. "This is why it's so troubling that you choose me to single out in your recent documentry (sic).
"I have already admitted to being a playboy more (appropriately titled today 'womanizer') sleeping with and putting myself in more compromising situations than almost any man I know ... So many that some could reinterpret or reimagine a different recollection of the same experiences."
Several women have accused the Def Jam Recordings co-founder of sexual assault spanning multiple decades. Simmons has denied the claims, including in a 2017 statement to the Los Angeles Times where he said they "range from the patently untrue to frivolous and hurtful."
The primary subject of Winfrey's documentary, directed by Kirby Dick and Amy Ziering, is Dixon, who worked as an executive at Def Jam under Simmons in the 1990s and alleged in a 2017 New York Times article that he raped her in his apartment. The film is billed as the journey of "a brilliant former music executive who grapples with whether to go public with her story of assault and abuse by a notable figure in the music industry."

Texto completo: Doug Marrone was a first-year NFL assistant coach, running the New York Jets offensive line in 2002 when they played at Oakland.

He took his position group into one of the end zones at Oakland-Alameda Coliseum to begin their pregame warmups. It was then that one solitary Raiders fan stood in the front row, overlooking the end zone, and began letting Marrone have it: insults, profanities, you name it.

"He was all over me," said the Jaguars coach. "I mean, all over me, to the point where the players were laughing. They're like, 'are you going to take that.' Now the players are trying to instigate me ... 'I'd go up in the stands if I was you.' They were like, 'do you know this guy?' I'm like, 'I don't know anyone out here.' That's just how it is."

No one has ever quite been able to explain Raiders fans.

Let Green Bay have their frozen tundra, Pittsburgh their cute little yellow towels and Dallas their self-imposed moniker as America's team.

Oakland fans had The Black Hole. The Autumn Wind. Pillaging just for fun.

They had Lyle Alzado, Ted "The Mad Stork" Hendricks, Jack Tatum and the rest of a defense that would likely get flagged for targeting on every play in the modern NFL.

The offense featured Kenny "Snake" Stabler, Fred Biletnikoff coated with Stickum from fingertips to elbows, Cliff Branch flying under Jim Plunkett bombs, George Blanda winning games well into his 40s either passing or kicking, and Marcus Allen, Pete Banaszak, Mark Van Eeghen and other fast, gritty and explosive running backs.

And all of that with a fan base cheering their team and trying to intimidate opponents that looked like an unhealthy mix of the cast of the movie "Mad Max" and the bar scene in "Star Wars," with a few bikers tossed in just for fun.

But the madness has only one more Sunday.

Raiders chasing Vegas glitz

The Raiders are moving to Las Vegas next season and will be playing in the $2 billion Allegiant Stadium with a dome, 8,000 club seats and 127 luxury boxes. They will leave behind the 53-year-old Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum that seats around 57,000, leaks water (and raw sewage at times) and was called "a bland, charmless concrete monstrosity ... perhaps America's most hated stadium," in a 2017 New York Times article.

To Raiders fans, it was their bland, charmless monstrosity.

Sunday is the final football game in Oakland (4:05 p.m., CBS) and it's a hard sell-out as Raiders fans are scrambling to be a part of history. Thrown into this potential maelstrom as the opponent will be the Jaguars (4-9), who are on a five-game losing streak.

It might get ugly in more ways than one.

The cheapest tickets on the secondary market as of Friday afternoon were $168. To sit in the infamous "Black Hole," section 105 in one of the end zones, the lair of the most outlandish and boisterous fans, required more than $11,000, according to one offering on Stub Hub.

By contrast, tickets for the Jaguars final home game against Indianapolis on Dec. 30 can be had for $17.

"I expect it to be in peak form this Sunday, given it's the last time," said wide receiver Chris Conley, who is one of four Jaguars players to have experienced Oakland either as an opponent or a member of the Raiders. "It's one of those environments that you never know what's going to happen and that might be amplified this Sunday."

Jags defensive end Calais Campbell said there will be no escaping the fan base.

"They get there early, in that black hole, spiked pads, painted faces," Campbell said. "They were more intense when Oakland had some of their good teams but I think it will be pretty intense this week."

Jaguars cornerback Marcus Gilchrist, who played in Oakland in 2018 and against the Raiders every year from 2011-14 as a member of the Chargers, said it's almost a given that it will be a rowdy day from start to finish.

"It's intense anyway," he said. "Now add the variables of it being the last game there. I think it's going to add some extra sauce to it. Like Halloween in December."

Marrone prepares his players

Marrone said he advised his players who have yet to play a game in Oakland that it will be a different experience, to say the least.

And it's also not only the fans. The visitors locker room in Oakland is notorious for being the smallest and dingiest in the NFL.

"The fan base, the locker room ... you want to get them a little [information] so they can become familiar with what's going on out there."

The visitors locker room has one main issue: it doesn't have 53 lockers, one for every player on a team. Most have to double up, and they're not that big anyway.

"If I was to design a locker room to give a visiting team the most discomfort, I'd design Oakland's," said former Jags kicker Josh Scobee. "Our visitors locker room is a five-star hotel by comparison."

Some Jaguars players profess to be unconcerned with what goes on in the stands and the number of player ticket requests for family is about normal for a West Coast trip.

"It'll be fun," said rookie quarterback Gardner Minshew II. "I'd be curious to see what it's like. Obviously it's a historic venue. They've got great fans over there, so it should be fun."

Minshew said his father, Flint, will be at the game. When asked if he would wear Jaguars clothing, he mentioned in a roundabout way that his father is a former college defensive tackle and could take care of himself.

"I'm sure he will," Minshew said of his father's choice of apparel for the game. "You've seen him, right?"

But Gardner ... has he seen them?

Hayden has a score to settle

Then there's the outright defiance of Jags defensive back D.J. Hayden, who played at Oakland from 2013-16 but was cut after he spent the last five weeks of the 2016 season on injured reserve.

"It's going to be sweet," he said. "I can't wait until Sunday to see the Black Hole and their last little hoo-rah. They didn't bring me back ... now I have to make them pay for it. It would be nice. Sweet. Just go in there and whip a----."

However crazy the atmosphere in the stands gets, the truth is the Raiders haven't been invincible at Oakland-Alameda since they returned from Los Angeles in 1995. Oakland's home record since then is 92-106 (.464), but they are 5-2 at home this season.

During the glory years, when the Raiders won two Super Bowls and six AFC West titles between 1967 (their second year in the coliseum) and 1980, they were 81-21-2.

And neither team can afford to get caught up in the atmosphere. The Jaguars haven't won since October and the Raiders are on a three-game losing streak.

"It's something to experience but I don't think it really affects you all that much," Gilchrist said. "Worry about what we're doing, execute our game plan and eliminate the outside stuff."

Emotional day for Gruden

Raiders coach Jon Gruden, on his second go-around with the team, admitted the game-week preparation has been difficult.

"You don't get a chance to think about it, in the midst of a tough season," he said. "For those of us who have a history here, it's an emotional time, no doubt. We have to make sure we promise nothing other than we will give our very best effort."

Gruden said the Raiders have a legacy to uphold, regardless of where they play.

The history of this franchise is a championship franchise," he said. "The Silver and Black is recognized around the world. We need to get back to winning, which we haven't done for the last 20 years."

But they have one more chance to win in Oakland, in the 314th Raiders football game at the aging, leaky edifice.

The Autumn Wind will blow one more time. Will the slumping Raiders have enough to knock the Jaguars ‘round and upside down?

What the mental equivalent of junk food is doing to your mind

Texto completo: We've all heard the truism, "You are what you eat." Clearly this applies to food intake and how our body composition is directly correlated. Eat fruit and veggies, have a healthy physique. Eat fried, processed foods, have a sick body.
But what if we extended this common sense phrase to our mindset and performance? If we are what we eat, it only stands to reason that we think what our intellect consumes.
Our minds — just like our bodies — are fed regularly, and we consume both good and bad things. Sometimes, we savor 'health food' such as reading a great book, having a thoughtful discussion with a colleague, or watching a compelling TED talk. These inputs are mind-expanding, creating new synapses and elevating our thinking and performance.
Other times, we gobble up the mental equivalent of junk food. These inputs can be the constant barrage of our negative and divisive news cycle, angry rants from customers, or harsh and unproductive criticism from bosses.
Exactly like junk food, some inputs feel good in the moment but take a toll over the long-term: gossip, brainless reality TV shows, jealousy-inducing social media posts, and mind-numbing small talk. These empty calories may 'taste' good, but they create a mental fog rather than a state of growth and empowerment.
Being realistic, most of us eat some good meals and some bad ones. For our minds, the trick is to balance out the junk food with some mental kale.
In other words, ensuring that we consume fresh ideas, creative thoughts, and inspiring content will offset the all-you-can-eat buffet of polluted thinking. It reminds me of the fable of an old Cherokee man teaching his grandson about life:
"A fight is going on inside me," he said to the boy.
"It is a terrible fight and it is between two wolves. One is evil — he is anger, envy, sorrow, regret, greed, arrogance, self-pity, guilt, resentment, inferiority, lies, false pride, superiority and ego."
He continued, "The other is good — he is joy, peace, love, hope, serenity, humility, kindness, benevolence, empathy, generosity, truth, compassion and faith. The same fight is going on inside you–and inside every other person, too."
The grandson thought about it for a minute and then asked his grandfather: "Which wolf will win?"
The old Cherokee simply replied, "The one you feed."
If we want to create inspired work and achieve greatly, we must feed our minds stimulating raw materials.
In the same way an elite athlete carefully monitors her food intake for optimal performance, those of us in the knowledge economy need to take care of what we feed our minds.
Creating habits around positive mental inputs, while keeping the junk food to a minimum, will provide us the strength, stamina, and power to succeed greatly. The higher quality the inputs, the more delicious the outputs.
In this holiday season, let's gobble up many heaping portions of positive thoughts, wisdom, and insights to make 2020 our best year yet. Now that's a dish worthy of second helpings.

'Pity liberal editorial writers': Trump campaign mocks newspaper editorial boards for backing impeachment

Texto completo: The Trump campaign dismissed a number of editorial boards at major news publications that have announced their support for impeaching President Trump.
The House of Representatives is scheduled to vote this week on two articles of impeachment: abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. It will then go to the Senate for a trial, where it's expected to be dismissed quickly.
The Los Angeles Times, the Boston Globe, the New York Times, the New York Daily News, the Philadelphia Inquirer, and USA Today have all called for Trump to be impeached based on the articles.
“Pity liberal editorial writers. They have never recovered from Election Day 2016," Tim Murtaugh, Trump 2020 communications director, told the Washington Examiner on Saturday.
The New York Times' board, which endorsed Trump's impeachment on Saturday, described the president requesting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to launch an investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden as a "textbook example of an impeachment offense," arguing that it's exactly "as the nation's framers envisioned it." They also pointed to the White House's decision not to participate in the House's inquiry, alleging that that decision "left Congress with no choice but to press ahead to a Senate trial."
A different Trump campaign representative noted the New York Times editorial board did not support President Bill Clinton's impeachment in 1998. In the editorial's piece, they argued that a "polarized party-line vote" would "assault the Constitution." They warned that such an impeachment could set a dangerous precedent and noted that "presidents stay in office unless the case against them is so strong that it persuades at least a substantial part of the public — and their representatives in Congress — on the grounds specified by the Constitution."
Editorial boards from 115 newspapers supported impeaching Clinton after the release of independent counsel Ken Starr’s report. The New York Times's decision not to back impeachment came two months after the report was released publicly.
While some have supported Trump's removal from office, a multitude of publications in more moderate areas who endorsed Hillary Clinton appear more skittish to support impeachment, according to Politico.

Even As Humans Send Probes Deep Into Space,an Interstellar Comet Visits In Time For Holidays

Texto completo: It came out of the northern sky, a frozen breath of gas and dust from the genesis of some distant star, launched across the galaxy by the gravitational maelstroms that accompany the birth of worlds.
It wandered in the deep freeze of interstellar space for 100 million years or so, a locked vault of cosmo-chemical history. In spring 2019, this ice cube began falling into our own solar system. Feeble heat from the sun, still distant, loosened carbon monoxide from its surface into a faint, glowing fog; the orphan ice cube became a new comet.
Six months later, Gennady Borisov, a Crimean astronomer, saw it drifting in front of the constellation Cancer and sounded the alarm.
On Sunday, the comet that now bears his name - 2I Borisov - made a wide turn around the sun and began heading back out of the solar system. As it departs, it will steadily brighten and grow in size as sunlight continues to shake off the dust from a long, cold sleep. On Dec. 28, the comet will pass 180 million miles from Earth, its closest approach to our planet.
This procession is being greeted with hungry eyes by a species only just knocking on the door of interstellar exploration and eager for news from out there.
Humanity’s most distant artifacts, the two Voyager spacecraft, recently punched through the magnetic bubble that closes off the solar system from the rest of the galaxy. Meanwhile, a band of scientists and engineers are developing an extravagantly ambitious plan, called Breakthrough Starshot, to launch a fleet of butterfly-size probes all the way to Alpha Centauri, the nearest star system to our own.
But what’s Out There is already In Here. Nature, generous as ever, has been slinging “Scientific CARE packages,” as Gregory Laughlin, a Yale astronomer, put it, toward us in the form of interstellar comets.
Two years ago, astronomers discovered an interstellar rock called Oumuamua cruising through the solar system. It caused a sensation, exciting talk of alien probes until further study concluded that it was actually a comet with no tail - albeit a comet from reaches unknown. Now 2I Borisov has astronomers tingling again, ready to follow its outbound run with their telescopes.
“I think the sense of excitement stems in part from the timing of these discoveries,” Laughlin said. Oumuamua and Borisov, he added, augur well for a new telescope the National Science Foundation is building in Chile called the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope, which will sweep the entire sky every few days, producing in effect a movie of the universe.
That telescope will be superbly positioned to find more interloper comets, perhaps even in time to send probes to greet them with “Deep Impact”-style missions. “The situation is reminiscent of when the first exoplanets were detected,” Laughlin said.
So far, the two examples of interstellar comets that humans have observed could not be more different. Oumuamua was mistaken for an asteroid at first because it had no cometary cloud of gas and dust around it, at least that could be seen. But as it was traveling out of sight, small perturbations in its motion suggested that in fact the rock was actually a comet, being pushed around by jets of gas shooting from its surface.
Estimates of the object’s shape - long and cigarlike - spurred speculation that it could be an alien probe or even a solar sail. Recent analysis by Sergey Mashchenko, an astrophysicist at McMaster University in Ontario, has concluded that Oumuamua was less a rod than a thin slab rocking back and forth as sunlight and radiation wore it away.
“It was vanishing as it went away, like a bar of soap in the shower,” Laughlin said.
Borisov’s comet underwent an astronomical rite of passage of sorts in October, when the Hubble Space Telescope got a good look at it: a white knuckle at the head of a bluish fan of light.
Subsequent observations by telescopes on Earth have confirmed the presence of alien water and carbon monoxide as well as a growing list of chemicals from another part of the universe. As of Nov. 24, the comet’s tail had grown to 100,000 miles long. The comet’s nucleus is only a mile across.
Early in November, the Gemini observatory spotted the wanderer passing about 1 billion light-years in front of a spiral galaxy “romantically known” as 2dFgrS TGN363Z174, said Travis Rector, an astronomer from the University of Alaska Anchorage who was involved in taking the photograph. As if to tease us humans with a reminder of places unknown and unvisitable, the backdrop to the portrait is speckled with faint smudges of even more distant galaxies and stars.
When December began, 2I Borisov was drifting through the constellation Crater. Its brightness in astronomical terms was magnitude 16, far too faint for the naked eye or even binoculars, but accessible to a modest telescope and a CCD camera. (You can track it in real time at SkyLive.)
The comet is expected reach a peak brightness of about magnitude 15 around Friday, plus or minus a week, according to Quanzhi Ye, an astronomer at the University of Maryland and another in the network of observers following the comet.
The comet came from the general direction of Cassiopeia and will exit the solar system through the southern constellation Telescopium, Ye said.
But this is only the beginning of comet-tracking season, he added. Astronomers will be following Borisov through at least the end of next year. Anything could happen on this watch. As comets approach the sun, geysers of vaporized ice, gas and dust can spring forth. Subsurface gas can heat up and explode, ejecting huge plumes of dust, which would make the comet much brighter and more visible.
“Solar system comets often (but not always) display outbursts near perihelion,” Laughlin said in a recent email. “But so far Borisov has been ‘boring’ in this regard.”

Texto completo: After selling newspapers and magazines from around the world from a corner of Pike Place Market for 40 years, First and Pike News is making some news of its own.
Owner Lee Lauckhart has decided to close the landmark newsstand on Dec. 31. The stand was built of words, but the numbers just don't add up, he says. Declining newspaper and magazine readership means declining sales. It's that simple.
"It looks like an unbelievable success story," Lauckhart, 78, said Friday morning. "But the majority of our customers look like me. They're old. And people under 30 don't read printed material. They read it on screens. It's been a digital onslaught."
Lauckhart used to carry 180 different newspapers, but has let that number drop to 55. He once carried 2,000 magazines, but has cut that by about 300.
"It finally came to a point where I would have to start funding it," Lauckhart said in his office above the stand, where the chorus of the Pike Place Fish Market mongers echoed up the stairs. "This has been coming on for a long time. The business has been saved by gum."
The stand sells a lot of Hubba Bubba bubble gum for $2 a pack, which inevitably ends up squished onto the Gum Wall, located down the ramp and around the corner. It takes about that long to chew it.
The stand also sells postcards - four for $1 - and gives a lot of directions. Not a lot of money to be made in either.
Still, there is much to draw customers in. The glossy American titles are stacked in front, with Cate Blanchett and Adam Driver looking hither and yon. On the other side of the wall, well, nearly every interest is covered: Marie Claire. Der Spiegel. Alfred Hitchcock Mystery Magazine. Skin Art. American Bee Journal. Witches and Pagans. There are titles in French and Italian, Spanish and Russian.
For the past 13 years, Lauckhart has not collected a salary. He has been living on his Social Security, while still paying his employees $15 an hour long before it became law. He also pays health benefits, even if the employee only worked one shift a week.
"It just seemed like the right thing to do," Lauckhart said. "If you paid them what they're worth and let them go home by 5 p.m., well, they're happy."
There is no cash register. Clerks keep cash in their aprons ("Old school," Lauckhart said, wagging the front of his apron) so they can wander around. In the tiny kiosk that serves as a counter, there is a credit-card reader, rubber bands and scissors.
When he opened in 1979, "There wasn't much of a plan," Lauckhart said.
A Seattle native who studied environmental health at the University of Washington, Lauckhart spent three months in New York City with his then-wife and her family, selling newspapers from a stand owned by his father-in-law. He loved it. The people, being part of the news of the day.
After the couple divorced, Lauckhart moved back to Seattle with his young daughter, Aana. He started working in the market as a "crafty," making jewelry out of railroad nails. And he befriended Seby Nahmias, who owned the newspaper-vending rights for the corner of First and Pike. (They date back to 1914, when they sold for $300. Lauckhart still has the original documents in his office).
Lauckhart suggested they partner up and open a newsstand with more than just the local newspapers. They were joined by Steve Dunnington.
"We wanted everything possible that we could get because there weren't any phones in your pocket," Lauckhart said.
Not long after they opened, 25 papers from across the country were being sent from numerous cities by air to San Francisco, where a distributor sorted them in the airport and sent them off to Seattle on Flying Tiger, a cargo airline.
Six months later, Mount St. Helens blew. Newspapers from around the region printed extra editions, which landed in huge piles in front of the newsstand, and were snatched right up.
"It gave us a real boost," Lauckhart said. "We had stacks all around us. I felt a little bad about it, so we gave a bit of the profits to the Red Cross."
Back then, Pike Place Market was closed on Sunday - the biggest day for newspapers, Lauckhart realized. So, in the spring of 1980, First and Pike News became the first Market business to open on Sunday. Other businesses followed.
Nahmias died in 1987, and Lauckhart still keeps his name on his locker in the office.
His daughter Aana, now 46, grew up with the newsstand. She lived with her father in a studio apartment above the Market, where they converted the closet into a room for her. "I slept on a shelf in the closet and he slept in the living room," she said.
Every morning, she sat on a stool at the stand, waiting for the school bus that would take her up the hill to T.T. Minor Elementary.
After school, she'd be right back there, learning what she called "the newsboy shuffle" to hawk newspapers: "Get your Times and your P-I," she recited. "If you can't read, you can look at the pictures."
Aana believes her father has been keeping the newsstand alive - and taking the financial hit - as a matter of principle.
"It's because of his deep belief in the free press," she said, "and how democratizing a newsstand can be."
He also kept it going for his employees, many of whom have stayed with him for more than 20 years. At one point he had 33 employees; now he's down to three.
"Artists, musicians and potters," Aana said. "The heartbeat of Seattle."
Lauckhart pays time-and-a-half on days he chose himself: Martin Luther King Jr. Day, Election Day. But also on National Civility Day and on his best friend's birthday.
George Cottrell, 56, who has been working at the stand for just over 20 years, showed off a marble notebook with sightings, quotes and other notes kept by employees. Carrie Brownstein's mother showed up, looking for the issue of Mental Floss with her daughter on the cover.
"One woman who lives two or three doors down, buys The Seattle Times everyday, and never says a word," Cottrell said.
In his office, Lauckhart keeps a list of celebrities who have stopped at the stand, and the date. In October 2004, Martha Stewart came by ("Bill said he thought she was in the joint"); in July 1992, Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid stopped with a child in a stroller to buy the Sunday New York Times; the Queen of England's gofer bought the Los Angeles Sunday Times and The New York Times; and in January 2001, Billy Joel spent $50 on "motorcycle mags."
Now that the closing is imminent, Lauckhart expects a little boost in business, "and we'll be happy with that."
"If somebody was to buy it from me, they'd have to buy all the inventory and throw in good money," Lauckhart said about the newsstand. "But I know it's not going to work for them. And before too long, they'll be crying the blues."
By closing it now, he said, the space will belong to the Market and can be re-imagined.
Lauckhart will send back whatever inventory is left for credit, cancel his decadeslong orders and let the subscriptions expire. He'll spend the month of January in his office, finishing things up, then head home, where he's got "a lot of things to do."
Aana is lobbying for a father-daughter road trip. "Standing on the corner of First and Pike is not an easy hustle," she said. "He could use a nap."
"It was the news," Lauckhart said. "We were what's happening. It's not like running a fruit stand, selling apples and oranges. Every day, every week it's different. You're in Seattle and the world."

From the Keys, an urgent cry for action on climate change

Texto completo: Unlike most politicians in Tallahassee and Washington, D.C., those in the Florida Keys don't mince words when talking about climate change.
How can they with two Key Largo neighborhoods having endured flooded streets for most of the past three months? The flooding arrived with autumn's king tides and didn't drain because the surrounding sea is so high. It's been an unusual year, but leaders expect more, given the impacts of climate change and sea-level rise.
How can they with commercial flood insurance premiums jumping 18% a year? Monroe County Mayor Heather Carruthers fears rising insurance costs will put commercial property values underwater in just five years.
How can they after learning it could cost $180 million to raise just three miles of road high enough to last 40 years? Monroe has over 300 miles of county roads. "It's not all doable," Rhonda Haag, the county's sustainability director, told the New York Times.
Some South Florida residents fear such frank talk could financially sink low-lying communities before the water that is coming our way in coming decades.
But denial was not the issue at last week's annual meeting of the Southeast Florida Regional Climate Change Compact — a coalition of Monroe, Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach County governments, plus 109 cities and two Native American tribal governments.
Rather, we heard an urgency for launching projects — now — that can calm financial markets, slow insurance spikes and reimagine our region as a world leader in resiliency.
If action is taken now, regional leaders are optimistic that our coastal landscape can be reshaped and remain a vital economic engine for our state and nation. Where Miami Beach raised roads and installed pumps, for example, a city official said condo prices jumped 10%.
But first, a gut check, heightened by one of the worst king-tide seasons in memory, the slowing Gulf Stream and the lingering effects of Hurricane Dorian.
Conference presenters showed photos of recent tidal flooding like nothing previously seen in South Florida.
Others showed slides of coral, bird and fish populations in decline because of warmer temperatures and ocean acidification.
Still others raised red flags about the region's rising groundwater table, sludge-filled canals and aging flood-control gates, some of which are just six inches higher than the water they manage.
Democratic state Rep. Kristin Jacobs of Broward cautions against partisanship in discussing climate change, emphasizing the importance of electing moderates, instead. Jacobs received the compact's lifetime achievement award this year for her foundational work in its formation, and her leadership on other water issues.
We need state and national leaders who recognize that our seas, tides and groundwater tables are rising — and who share our region's sense of urgency.
We need more politicians like those in the Florida Keys, who like the canary in the coal mine, are calling attention to the danger ahead and demanding action — now.
"The Invading Sea" is the opinion arm of the Florida Climate Reporting Network, a collaborative of news organizations across the state focusing on the threats posed by the warming climate.

A Patriots Season Packed Full of Highs and Lows (Remember A.B.?)

Texto completo: New England has won plenty of games this year, but an unfamiliar uneasiness has surrounded the team amid several controversial episodes and a handful of concerning losses.
The New England Patriots are 10-3. They currently hold the No. 2 seed in the A.F.C. In all likelihood -- a 76 percent chance, according to The New York Times's playoff simulator -- they will earn a first-round bye for the 10th consecutive postseason.
And yet an uneasy feeling has settled across New England, where fans spoiled by the Patriots' dynasty are coping with three losses in five games, all to division-leading A.F.C. teams powered by quarterbacks set to rule the conference when Tom Brady retires.
Or when he plays elsewhere, a possibility recently broached by his father before New England's offense sputtered yet again in a loss to Kansas City, before boos cascaded from the Gillette Stadium stands, before the Patriots courted controversy by forgetting to inform the Bengals and the league that a video crew would be filming a scout instead of, say, Cincinnati's sideline.
It was just another chaotic week in a chaotic season that, despite it all, still might result in the team basking amid falling confetti on Feb. 2 in Miami Gardens, Fla. Here are the whiplash-inducing highs and lows of the New England Patriots' season so far:
August
Aug. 6: Three days after Brady's 42nd birthday, and two days after he agreed to a new contract that makes him a free agent after the season, NBC Sports Boston reports that he and his wife, the supermodel Gisele Bündchen, have put their Brookline, Mass., mansion up for sale, fueling speculation that this will be his final year in New England.
September
Sept. 7: The Oakland Raiders are exasperated enough by Antonio Brown's antics -- missing two practices, refusing to wear a new helmet, threatening to punch General Manager Mike Mayock -- that they cut him. Within hours, in swoop the Patriots, ever eager to add players whose conduct may discourage pursuit by other teams, and they agree to sign him to a one-year, $ 9 million deal.
Sept. 8: After unveiling their sixth championship banner, the Patriots open their title defense by destroying the Pittsburgh Steelers, 33-3, at Gillette Stadium.
Sept. 10: Brown, in a lawsuit filed in federal court, is accused of raping a woman whom he met while they were attending college together and who later worked as his trainer.
Sept. 15: The Patriots throttle the Miami Dolphins, 43-0, as Brown catches four passes for 56 yards and a touchdown.
Sept. 20: Amid the N.F.L.'s investigation into the accusations against Brown, the Patriots release Brown, saying in a statement: "We appreciate the hard work of many people over the past 11 days, but we feel that it is best to move in a different direction at this time."
Sept. 22: Hours after Brown blasts the Patriots owner Robert K. Kraft in a series of tweets, New England overwhelms the Jets, 30-14.
Sept. 29: The Patriots overcome a meager performance from Brady, who completes 46.2 percent of his passes, his lowest rate in more than two seasons, in a 16-10 victory at Buffalo.
October
Oct. 2: Another critical injury befalls the Patriots a week after losing the fullback James Develin, an essential component of their running game, for the season: Kicker Stephen Gostkowski, the Patriots' franchise leader in points and field goals, is placed on injured reserve with a hip injury.
Oct. 10: The Patriots allow their first touchdown pass of the season in a 35-14 victory against the Giants.
Oct. 21: Before New England's 33-0 romp over the Jets -- when the Patriots' defensive pressure so confuses quarterback Sam Darnold, wearing a microphone for the Monday Night Football broadcast, that he says, "I'm seeing ghosts," while sitting on the bench in the first half -- Adam Schefter reports on ESPN's pregame show that for Tom Brady, returning to New England next season is his "least likely" option.
Oct. 23: The Patriots place starting receiver Josh Gordon on injured reserve but with the designation that they must cut him once he's healthy, a curious decision by a team lacking both quality and reliability at the position.
Oct. 27: The confluence of the Browns' ineptitude and New England's defensive sorcery creates Cleveland turnovers on three consecutive first-quarter plays in the Patriots' 27-13 victory. Improving to 8-0 for the third time under Coach Bill Belichick, who wins his 300th game, New England increases its point differential to plus-189, tied with the 1942 Chicago Bears for the second-most through a team's eight games since 1940, according to Pro Football Reference.
November
Nov. 3: The Patriots are halfway to a perfect regular season, but they have yet to face a quarterback the caliber of Lamar Jackson. Led by Jackson's penetrative running and incisive passing, Baltimore scores as many touchdowns -- four -- as the Patriots' defense had allowed since their Super Bowl victory against the Rams. In dealing New England its first loss since Dec. 16, 2018, with a 37-20 rout, the Ravens affirm their candidacy as a contender in the A.F.C. and puncture the Patriots' aura of invincibility.
December
Dec. 1: Even with a full complement of receivers, the Patriots' offense functions with the utility of an unlocked bank vault, failing to score a touchdown until the closing seconds of the third quarter of Houston's 28-22 victory. A slew of mistakes -- N'Keal Harry's loafing on a slant leading to an interception, Jakobi Meyers's miscommunication on a route -- and general ineffectiveness enrage Brady, who is captured by NBC cameras reproaching receivers on the sideline.
Dec. 6: In an interview with the Boston Herald, Tom Brady Sr. says that it's difficult imagining his son playing with another team but that Belichick will make that decision. "Nobody really knows," Brady Sr. told the Herald. "Bill doesn't tip his hand. There's just been insinuations here and there. This is really kind of between those two. They got to decide what they want."
Dec. 8: The unfathomable happens at Gillette Stadium: Fans boo the lackluster Patriots at halftime of an eventual 23-16 loss to Kansas City, a rematch of last year's A.F.C. championship game. For the fifth time in six games, Brady connects on fewer than 56 percent of his passes.
Dec. 9: Whether it's fire alarms being mysteriously pulled at visiting teams' hotels or headset malfunctions that vex opposing coaching staffs -- or even more serious rules scandals like the so-called Spygate and Deflategate -- no team invites more speculation into the propriety of its comportment than New England. The latest instance surfaces publicly a day after a videographer records the field and the Bengals' sideline while attending the Bengals-Browns game in Cleveland ostensibly to film a Patriots employee scouting Cincinnati in advance of Sunday's game for a feature on the team's website. In a statement, the Patriots acknowledge that their crew "unknowingly violated" league policy and stress that it is "independent of our football operation," which had no "involvement whatsoever in the planning, filming or creative decisions made during the production of these features."

Texto completo: On the eve of the Trump administration’s announcement of a new rule that could eliminate benefits for nearly 700,000 people, I was at an event for a national faith-based hunger charity, surrounded by people who work to help Americans in need. Exhausted and disappointed by this latest assault on the low-income people we serve, we shared our frustration with the administration’s use of the term “able-bodied” to describe who will be affected to obscure what the rule really is: cruelty directed at Americans living in poverty.
The rule, which will take effect in April, makes it more difficult for states, even those that have economically distressed areas where jobs are scarce, to waive a requirement that “able-bodied” adults without dependents work at least 20 hours a week to keep their Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits (formerly known as food stamps).
It will strip 6.2 billion meals from Americans over the next decade. It took Food Bank for New York City nearly 35 years to deliver one billion meals to our neighbors in need. There is no amount of generosity by corporate or traditional philanthropy to any charity that will make up for this loss caused by policy.
The administration says the new rule will encourage people receiving SNAP to find jobs. But we know of neither history nor data connecting the creation of hunger with viable work opportunities for the vulnerable. The idea of cutting SNAP to encourage employment is confusing to us, and probably even more so to the countless Americans who are both working and still needing the help SNAP provides to afford food.
If enacted, this rule will target households with an average income of $557 per month, which in New York City means that about 70,000 will be affected. While neither hunger nor SNAP utilization discriminates, this rule will also disproportionately hurt people of color and the local grocery stores that are able to stay open with help from customers using SNAP.
People in many high-cost-of-living areas and economically distressed communities won’t be protected from this ruthless policy, even as the average cost of a meal in Manhattan approaches $6 — nearly double the national average.
While the rule will not affect SNAP recipients with dependents, those over age 50, pregnant women or people with disabilities, it will affect many other vulnerable people, like poor college students and people who need to care for a family member and cannot work. It will impact more people than live in the city of Boston. And it will create hunger, not a work incentive. Job training makes for better job candidates — hunger does not.
SNAP is our nation’s first line of defense against hunger. When people cannot get this crucial support, they are forced to turn to the emergency food network. Unfortunately, charity support cannot make up for the impact created by bad policy. Food Bank for New York City’s soup kitchens and food pantries are already stretching their resources trying to meet rising need and often coming up short. Our recent report found that 85 percent of soup kitchens and pantries cited an increase in first-time visitors this year, and more than half said they ran out of food in a given month last year.
In the days leading up to Thanksgiving, I was at our soup kitchen in Harlem attempting to calm people waiting in a line that stretched down the street. When a donor asked me if the crowd was due to the upcoming holiday, I explained that no, the line is about growing poverty in an increasingly expensive neighborhood. That line was just one of hundreds across our city.
The alleviation of hunger has historically been a goal that is supported by Democrats and Republicans. That’s why, in a bipartisan vote last year, Congress blocked efforts to pass SNAP restrictions through the Farm Bill. But the administration bypassed Congress, proposed this rule and ignored the more than 100,000 Americans across our country who submitted comments opposing it. Our leaders in Washington must come together to block it.
Many people in communities across the country will need help putting food on the table this holiday season and beyond. Americans have always opened our wallets to help our neighbors, but that alone won’t offset the effects of policies that dismantle the nation’s safety net and leave so many hungry.
Margarette Purvis is the president and CEO of Food Bank for New York City.

Rick Springfield, Richard Marx Team Up For Kirby Concert

Texto completo: It’s not every night two rock icons take the stage for intimate acoustic performances.
Eighties singer-songwriters Rick Springfield and Richard Marx will each offer a solo acoustic set on Sunday at F.M. Kirby Center for the Performing Arts, 71 Public Square, Wilkes-Barre. The show begins at 7 p.m., and tickets start at $39.50. They can be purchased at the box office, kirbycenter.org or by calling 570-826-1100.
During a phone interview from his home in Malibu, California, Springfield assured crowds can expect his hits like “Jessie’s Girl” and “I’ve Done Everything for You” but also storytelling songs.
After Springfield’s autobiography, “Late, Late at Night: A Memoir,” came out in 2010, the musician found an outpouring of requests for a storytelling show. During these performances, Springfield feels he can connect with fans personally. While he’ll playfully call out audience members who are getting up for drinks, he also feels the connection between himself and those in the room. The atmosphere allows for more communication and emotion, which means everything to him as an artist.
“It’s telling stories, some jokes and sort of one-on-one,” he said. “I can actually talk to the audience. It’s low-key, laid-back and completely different from a full-band show. ”
As for Marx, the musician released a string of hits during the late ’80s and early ’90s including “Endless Summer Nights,” “Hold On to the Nights” and “Right Here Waiting.” Springfield said he and Marx have been friends since 1985 and decided to join together to go out on the road. Each will perform his own songs in separate acoustic sets before coming together for the encore. It’s a special night for the musicians and fans alike.
“You get to really hear the lyrics of the songs and the stories behind the music,” Springfield said. “You’re all together, sharing those moments.”
An Australia native, Springfield’s first U.S. No. 1 hit, “Jessie’s Girl,” earned him a Grammy award and solidified his place in pop culture. He followed its success with four more top 10 hits, including “Don’t Talk to Strangers” and “Love Somebody,” and has released more than a dozen albums during his career. He also wrote a novel, “Magnificent Vibration,” which made The New York Times Best Sellers list.
Springfield also has kept busy with acting. He starred in the film “Ricki and the Flash” opposite Meryl Streep as well as on TV, including more sinister roles as Dr. Pitlor in HBO’s “True Detective,” Lucifer on “Supernatural” and, most recently, Pastor Charles on “American Horror Story: Cult.”
“Doing stuff against type is always fun for an actor,” he said. “Showing that dark side.”
Springfield promised fans will see him in more acting roles in 2020, and he plans to release a second novel, a new record and a greatest hits album next year. Springfield also will hit the road with Chicago during the band’s summer tour around North America.
“There’s a lot in store over the next year,” he said.

Texto completo: Our guide to dance performances happening this weekend and in the week ahead.
ALVIN AILEY AMERICAN DANCE THEATER at New York City Center (Dec. 13, 8 p.m.; Dec. 14, 2 p.m. and 8 p.m.; Dec. 15, 3 and 7:30 p.m.; Dec. 17-19, 7:30 p.m.; through Jan. 5). Ailey's robust season lineup is enhanced this week with two company premieres. On Friday, the troupe, for the first time, performs"Busk," created in 2009 by the meticulous, idiosyncratic choreographer Aszure Barton. It gets an encore on Saturday evening with two new works by Jamar Roberts and Darrell Grand Moultrie. On Tuesday, the company adds to its repertory "City of Rain," a galvanic 2010 work by Camille A. Brown that reflects her physical fervor and acuity.

DORRANCE DANCE at the Joyce Theater (Dec. 17-18, 7:30 p.m.; Dec. 19, 8 p.m.; through Jan. 5). This popular company divides its three-week residency into three distinct programs. The one thing they all have in common is "The Nutcracker Suite," a new work set to Duke Ellington and Billy Strayhorn's effervescent rendition of Tchaikovsky's standard holiday soundtrack. We're used to experiencing that familiar tale through the delicate vocabulary of ballet; here Dorrance tells it with gusto through tap, letting us feel and hear it in a fresh way. Joining that work on the first program (through Dec. 22) is "All Good Things Come to an End," a sweet, incisive, vaudeville-inspired work set to the music of the jazz great Fats Waller.
212-242-0800, joyce.org
FRESH TRACKS at New York Live Arts (Dec. 13-14, 7:30 p.m.). This artist development initiative provides five emerging choreographers with rehearsal space, resources and mentorship to put their vision onstage. The program's concluding showcase features Anh Vo's "Babylift," a solo reflecting on the Vietnam War; Annie Heath and Sokunthary Svay's "This Mother/land Fabric," which explores relationships to mothers and homes; Jordan Demetrius Lloyd's "Neighbors," in which five dancers try to avoid collision; Kayla Hamilton's "Nearly Sighted/Unearthing the Dark," an exercise in contact improvisation with light; and Stuart B. Meyers's "KOPFKINO: head cinema," a dialogue with German Expressionism.

'THE NUTCRACKER' SIX WAYS at various locations. The Waltz of the Snowflakes becomes a nor'easter this week with a deluge of "Nutcracker" productions around town. Among them are Dances Patrelle's "The Yorkville Nutcracker," set in 19th-century New York (Friday to Sunday, the Kaye Playhouse, Hunter College); New York Theater Ballet's hourlong "Keith Michael's the Nutcracker" (Friday to Sunday, Florence Gould Hall); a hip-hop infused "The Brooklyn Nutcracker" by Brooklyn Ballet (Saturday, Kings Theater); the wacky "Nut/Cracked" by the Bang Group (Dec. 19-21, the Flea Theater); a traditional staging by National Ballet Theater of Odessa (Saturday, New Jersey Performing Arts Center); and, of course, the splendid "George Balanchine's the Nutcracker" by New York City Ballet (David H. Koch Theater, through Jan. 5).

SUNDAYS ON BROADWAY at Weis Acres (Dec. 15, 6 p.m.). The final seasonal gathering of this casual, intimate performance series in SoHo features Ellen Fisher in "Simple," which asks when mere movement becomes dance, and Carolyn Hall, a choreographer, dancer and historical marine ecologist who uses her research into the fish and fisheries of New York City to hold what she calls a "physical conversation" with the audience. Rounding out the program is the return of "Shorties," a string of micro-dances (one or two minutes long) performed by 11 artists.

ZVIDANCE at New York Live Arts (Dec. 18-20, 7:30 p.m.; Dec. 21, 2 and 7:30 p.m.). The Israeli choreographer Zvi Gotheiner hails from a kibbutz on Mount Gilboa, where (in the Bible) King David famously cursed the land to a future of drought. So Gotheiner has always appreciated, and worried about, water. He now sees scarcity spreading around the world, from South Africa to Mexico City. Gotheiner's latest work, "Maim" ("water" in Hebrew), raises awareness of these impending shortages and reflects on his own relationship to this vital resource. He conveys his warning through effusive, abstract movement.

Court Tackles Emoluments, But Admits It Has Doubts

Texto completo: A hearing in Virginia was the first time a full appeals panel has considered the anticorruption clauses of the Constitution.
RICHMOND, Va. -- A federal appeals court in Virginia heard arguments Thursday about whether to revive a lawsuit accusing President Trump of violating the Constitution by profiting from his hotel near the White House, in a spirited session that indicated sharp divisions among the judges over the legal consequences of the president's conduct.
The three-hour hearing in Richmond was the first time that a full federal appeals court has considered the so-called emoluments or anticorruption clauses of the Constitution. Mr. Trump is the first president to be sued for violating those clauses, and so far only lower courts or appellate panels have ruled on the three cases against him.
The 15-member court in Richmond met to consider whether a three-judge appellate panel had wrongly dismissed a lawsuit over the Trump International Hotel brought by the District of Columbia and the state of Maryland. Once one of the nation's more conservative benches, the court is now almost evenly made up of appointees by Republican and Democratic presidents.
The emoluments clauses of the Constitution restrict the ability of federal officials to accept gifts or financial benefits from foreign or state governments. The local jurisdictions were trying to show that government officials who flock to the president's hotel are showering him with illegal benefits and hurting hotels and convention centers in which Maryland and the District of Columbia have a financial interest.
They had been poised to begin evidence-gathering in the case when the judicial panel threw out the lawsuit in July, saying courts exist to resolve "real cases," not manufactured ones.
Hashim M. Mooppan, a deputy assistant attorney general, told the appellate judges that they should let the case die. He said that without the express authorization of Congress, the president cannot be sued for violating the emoluments bans.
But a number of the justices suggested that the three-judge panel might have acted too hastily. That raises the possibility that the lawsuit might be revived -- either so it can proceed at the lower-court level or, perhaps, so the appeals court has a chance to consider it on its merits.
Judge Pamela A. Harris, an appointee of former President Barack Obama, said the Justice Department was seeking "an incredibly drastic remedy" in demanding that the case be dismissed on an emergency basis.
Two other Obama appointees, Judge James A. Wynn Jr. and Judge Albert Diaz, both suggested that failure to enforce the emoluments clauses effectively places Mr. Trump above the law.
As in other federal cases, President Trump's own caustic comments about the allegations against him were an issue. In October, Mr. Trump dismissed the emoluments clauses as "phony." Judge Robert B. King, a President Bill Clinton appointee, said those comments revealed the president's "personal disdain" for the constitutional restrictions.
Mr. Mooppan said that the president's remarks were "either a tweet or an off-the-cuff statement."
The court's more conservative judges argued strenuously that reviving the lawsuit would recklessly plunge the court into uncharted territory during a politically fraught moment. Judge Paul V. Niemeyer, who was appointed by President George Bush and wrote the three-judge decision, said Mr. Trump "can be removed from office, voted out of office, but to sue the president is an unprecedented action."
He also said that even if the plaintiffs succeeded in forcing the president to divorce himself from his hotel, foreign officials and government guests could still try to curry favor by booking rooms or events knowing that the Trump family would benefit.
"It's not going to change a thing," he said. "You are not removing the president from the equation."
Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson III, who was appointed by President Ronald Reagan, said that the courts had no business trying to define what constituted an illegal emolument and how to punish a federal official who accepted one without any guidance from Congress.
"What is being asked here is just wholly unprecedented," he said. "We have no history to guide us and no precedent to guide us."
"We are up here winging it. We are making it up," Judge Wilkinson said. "If this isn't off the rails, I don't know what is."
If a check on the president is warranted, he said, it is up to Congress or to voters to provide it. He credited a public backlash with forcing the president last month to drop what Judge Wilkinson called a "terribly ill-advised" plan to hold next year's Group of 7 economic summit meeting at his Florida resort. "There are other avenues besides this manufactured suit," the judge said.
In a sign of the case's significance, the hearing lasted an hour longer than scheduled, and every judge spoke. Karl A. Racine, the attorney general for the District of Columbia, said he hoped that by early next year, the appeals court would give the case a "big green light" to proceed under Judge Peter J. Messitte, the district court judge who was overseeing the lawsuit.
"Today, we thought, was a very good day for us," said Brian E. Frosh, the attorney general for the state of Maryland.
Facing impeachment and a tough re-election campaign, the president may be wearying of the lawsuits and steady stream of criticism he has faced over the 263-room hotel. In late October, the Trump Organization announced it was seeking to sell its 60-year lease on the property, which is owned by the federal government.

Texto completo: Our guide to the city's best classical music and opera happening this weekend and in the week ahead.
CHAMBER MUSIC SOCIETY OF LINCOLN CENTER at Alice Tully Hall (Dec. 13 and 17, 7:30 p.m.; Dec. 15, 5 p.m.). The holiday season has come to mean Bach's "Brandenburg" Concertos for the Chamber Music Society, and it gives three performances of the complete set this year. Note that Sunday's concert has limited ticket availability.
212-875-5788, chambermusicsociety.org
JOYCE DIDONATO AND YANNICK NÉZET-SÉGUIN at Carnegie Hall (Dec. 15, 2 p.m.). Two artists with the Perspectives series this season join forces for Schubert's "Winterreise," a work not usually sung by a female voice, but one that profits from it. "Winterreise" fans also can watch Eric Owens, joined by Jeremy Denk, for a performance at the 92nd Street Y (Friday, 7:30 p.m.).
212-247-7800, carnegiehall.org
JACK QUARTET at the Tishman Auditorium (Dec. 17-18, 7 p.m.). As if the nation's leading contemporary-music quartet did not have enough to do, they have started JACK Frontiers, an annual free series showcasing some of the many new works they have had a hand in helping create. On Tuesday, they give the premiere of Catherine Lamb's "Divisio Spiralis," before a program of Clara Iannotta, Lester St. Louis and Tyshawn Sorey on Wednesday. Sorey's willfully ungenred music also makes an appearance this week in a sprawling concert by the McGill/McHale Trio at the 92nd Street Y (Dec. 19, 7:30 p.m.).

NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC at David Geffen Hall (Dec. 17-19, 7:30 p.m.; through Dec. 21). Harry Bicket leads the Philharmonic in Handel's "Messiah" this year, and with a solid cast, too: Louise Alder is the soprano, Iestyn Davies the countertenor, Joshua Ellicott the tenor and Dashon Burton the bass-baritone, while the Handel and Haydn Society Chorus makes its way down from Boston to sing all those holiday favorites. This is the season for "Messiah" fans, of course: You also can catch Kent Tritle and the Oratorio Society of New York, with a chorus that's several times larger than that of the Handel and Haydn Society, at Carnegie Hall (Dec. 19, 8 p.m.).
212-875-5656, nyphil.org
'DER ROSENKAVALIER' at the Metropolitan Opera (Dec. 13 and 17, 7 p.m.; through Jan. 4). Simon Rattle makes an all-too-rare appearance in the pit for the return of Robert Carsen's production of an opera it is impossible not to love. Camilla Nylund is the Marschallin, leading a cast that includes Magdalena Kozena as Octavian, Golda Schultz as Sophie and Günther Groissböck as Baron Ochs. Also at the Met this week: the family-friendly, English-language production of "The Magic Flute" (Sunday, 3 p.m.; through Jan. 4).
212-362-6000, metopera.org
TALLIS SCHOLARS at the Church of St. Mary the Virgin (Dec. 14, 8 p.m.). Making their annual appearance in Miller Theater's early music series, the singers of the Tallis Scholars present a clever program that compares how composers from different eras and different countries have set particular texts. Take your chance to see how Tallis's "O Sacrum Convivium" stands up to Messiaen's, how Byrd and Victoria compare in the Magnificat, and if Croce has any chance against the Allegri classic "Miserere."

How You Helped Save Jews in Halle, Germany

Texto completo: ON YOM KIPPUR THIS YEAR, at a synagogue filled with worshippers in the small city of Halle, Germany, prayers were interrupted by a heavily armed gunman.
Agrande esta imagen.

He had just published a hateful manifesto online declaring his intention to kill as many Jews as possible, though he said he'd be content with killing even one Jew: "After all, if every White Man kills just one, we win." The man showed up at the synagogue's front door wearing a camera on his helmet to stream the massacre online.
Instead, his plans went awry. The synagogue door was locked and fortified. Even after the attacker tried to shoot his way inside, he couldn't get in. He left in a rage. Tragically, this man would go on to murder two people down the street. Our hearts go out to the victims' families for these senseless deaths - every bit as senseless as his planned mass murder of Jews.
Max Privorozki, the head of the congregation, told The New York Times that the building's security ultimately saved their lives, limiting the shooter's body count. "It was a miracle that the door held," he said. "I cannot imagine what would have happened if it had not."
As it happened, the Halle synagogue had recently received those security upgrades - thanks to the actions of our Jewish communities.
Four years ago, in response to rising anti-Semitic violence in Europe, our partners at the Jewish Agency for Israel established a Security Assistance Fund to which our Jewish Federation contributed. The fund provided essential financial aid for synagogues, community centers and schools to upgrade their security systems with CCTV, alarms, locks, gates, and reinforced walls, doors and windows.
Using the fund, the Halle congregation had reinforced their heavy wooden door and installed an electronic security system. The precautions meant that during the Yom Kippur attack, congregation leaders spotted the gunman on the security camera monitor, kept the door locked and instructed the 80 worshippers to remain inside.
And because of you and your support of our Jewish Federation, on that frightening day in Halle, Germany, 80 Jews who had been targeted for murder were kept safe and unharmed.
At the Jewish Federation, we help keep our communities safe through security upgrades, trainings and assessments; Holocaust education; interfaith partnerships; advocacy for stronger hate crimes legislation; information-sharing and more - a multipronged approach that can make all the difference.
Help keep our communities secure. Donate to our Jewish Federation today at Jewishphilly.org/donate.

Texto completo: John Boyega is apologizing after making a comment about social media harassment that some believed targeted his "Star Wars" co-star Kelly Marie Tran.
Tran, who joined the "Star Wars" franchise as Rose Tico in 2017's "The Last Jedi," was met with a wave of online harassment after the release of the film: The fandom had been split on whether the movie met expectations, with some fans hating on Tran and her character in particular.
After months of harassment, the actress deleted all her Instagram posts in June 2018. Her still-empty profile now reads: "Afraid, but doing it anyway. "
In a recent interview with Variety, Boyega was asked about the pros and cons of being able to interact with "Star Wars" fans on social media. The interviewer brought up the negative attention Tran received.
Boyega stressed the positives of social media, lauding the ability to understand "how the masses think" through hearing from fans online.
"But at the same time, for those who are not mentally strong, you are weak to believe in every single thing that you read" he said. "That’s, you know, it is what it is. I don’t know, for me anyway, when I see that (backlash), I’m like, well, that’s actually not true. But no, it is actually not true. So it’s kind of like (shrugs) it is what it is. But to engage, to connect with the fans who otherwise wouldn’t get a day to day experience, especially during things like the press tour, and behind the scenes stuff, is always good. "
The day after the interview published online, Boyega apologized on Twitter, claiming he was "in no way. . . referring to Kelly when I made my comments although the interviewer mentioned her given the topic.
"I was really speaking from my own perspective through the franchise," he added. "Sometimes I've felt strong and sometimes I've felt weak. Badly worded though. I apologize. "
Boyega directed followers to his comments "on Kelly specifically" pertaining to online harassment from June 2018, in which he slammed "Star Wars" fans for harassing stars because they didn't enjoy an aspect of the movie.
"If you don’t like Star Wars or the characters understand that there are decisions makers and harassing the actors/ actresses will do nothing," he wrote at the time. "You’re not entitled to politeness when your approach is rude. Even if you paid for a ticket!"
In an essay published in August 2018 in The New York Times, the "Star Wars: The Last Jedi" actress wrote it "wasn't their words, it's that I started to believe them. "
She wrote the words seemed to confirm what growing up as a woman and a person of color had taught her, that she belonged "in margins and spaces. " She wrote she started blaming herself and felt brainwashed into believing her existence was "limited to the boundaries of another person's approval. "
The actress, who had previously mostly starred in smaller comedic roles, made history as the first Asian-American actress to star in a Star Wars film. Tran wrote she wants to live in a world where people of all races and genders are seen as human beings.
“We always hear these stories about people who are born into a specific position, like you’re the chosen one or you have a power or you are a hotshot,” Tran, the daughter of Vietnamese immigrants, told USA TODAY in 2017. “Rose represents this person who’s in the background. It’s really cool to see someone (like that) be forced into the forefront of the action and how she deals with it. ”

Texto completo: PARIS - France's prime minister said Wednesday that the full retirement age will be increased for the country's youngest, but offered concessions in an ill-fated effort to calm a nationwide protest against pension reforms that critics say will erode the nation's way of life.
The government says it wants to make the pensions system sustainable and simpler but is facing public pressure, including a week of the most debilitating transport strikes in decades.
Major unions were quick to reject the proposals and vowed to strike on.
The day after more than 300,000 people protested across France, metro lines in Paris but two were closed and many train routes remained canceled as unions dig in their heels against President Emmanuel Macron, whom they accuse of shaping policies in favor of the rich.
Prime Minister Edouard Philippe detailed the pension changes in a speech Wednesday, saying bluntly that the French "will need to work longer."
People born after 1974 will have to work until age 64 to get a full pension, instead of 62 previously. Those born before that date will not be affected, he said.
The new scheme is aimed at replacing a complicated pension system that included dozens of special privileges for some sectors, like public transport, with one set of rules.
Philippe said the changes ensure the pension system is "fair and sustainable" for a growing population with a record number of people over 90.
For people entering the workforce, the reforms will only start to apply in 2022, which happens to be the last year of Macron's term.
Nobel laureate Suu Kyi defends Myanmar army in UN court
THE HAGUE, Netherlands - Nobel Peace Prize winner and former political prisoner Aung San Suu Kyi denied Wednesday that Myanmar's armed forces committed genocide, telling the United Nation's top court that the mass exodus of Rohingya people from the country she leads was the unfortunate result of a battle with insurgents.
The image of the former pro-democracy icon appearing before the International Court of Justice to defend the army that kept her under house arrest for 15 years was striking.
Myanmar's accusers have described a deliberate campaign of ethnic cleansing and genocide that drove more than 700,000 Rohingya to neighboring Bangladesh.
Suu Kyi calmly rebuffed allegations that army personnel killed civilians, raped women and torched houses in 2017.
Leaders scramble for votes as UK's ugly campaigning ends
LONDON - Britain's election has been like the country's late-autumn weather: chilly and dull, with blustery outbursts.
On the last day of the campaign, political leaders dashed around the U.K. on Wednesday trying to win over millions of undecided voters who will likely determine the outcome.
Opinion polls suggest Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Conservatives have a lead over the main opposition Labour Party led by Jeremy Corbyn ahead of Thursday's election.
Britain's first December vote since 1923 for all 650 seats in the House of Commons has been dubbed the Brexit Election. It comes more than two years early in hopes of breaking the political deadlock over the country's stalled departure from the European Union.
Report: Giuliani settles long divorce from his third wife
NEW YORK - Former New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and his third wife have reached a settlement in a yearslong court battle that exposed details about their luxurious lifestyle, The New York Times reported.
Giuliani, 75, and his wife, Judith, put an end to their differences and "intend to remain friends in the years to come," Judith Giuliani's divorce attorney, Bernard Clair, told the newspaper.
The couple was married for 15 years.
Throughout the divorce, details about the couple's $230,000 monthly budget became public, including six houses, 11 country club memberships and $12,000 on Rudy Giuliani's cigars.
Giuliani previously was married for 20 years to Donna Hanover. Before that, he was married for 14 years to Regina Peruggi.
YouTube cracks down on racist, sexist insults
SAN FRANCISCO - YouTube is taking another step to curb hateful and violent speech on its site.
The video streaming company said it will now take down videos that lob insults at people based on race, gender expression, sexual orientation or other "protected attributes." The Google-owned company will also prohibit veiled threats of violence, taking a step further into moderating what people can say on the videos they create and upload.
YouTube has been slapped with criticism from politicians, viewers and video creators for the material it allows on - and bans from - the site. The site has been accused of allowing and fostering hate speech and extremism and creating spaces for harassment to linger online, along with other digital sites that allow people to upload their own material, such as Facebook and Twitter.
Chile: Debris found believed to be from missing plane
PUNTA ARENAS, Chile - The Chilean Air Force says it has recovered debris believed to be from a military transport plan carrying 38 people that vanished days earlier en route to Antarctica.
Air Force Gen. Eduardo Mosqueira says "sponge" material was found floating roughly 18 miles from the place the C-130 Hercules last had radio contact.
It had left southern Chile and was flying over Drake Pass, a notoriously turbulent area.
Mosqueira said Wednesday the debris will be analyzed to see if it corresponds to the missing plane. He says the process could take up to two days to confirm.
The C-130 Hercules took off Monday afternoon from a base in far-southern Chile on a regular maintenance flight for an Antarctic base. Radio contact was lost 70 minutes later.
In Niger: About 100 Islamic militants ambushed an army camp in western Niger, a military spokesman said late Wednesday, killing at least 71 soldiers in the deadliest attack on the West African country's forces in years.
The large-scale attack comes amid a surge of assaults on army camps in the Sahel region, which have allowed jihadists to amass weapons and vehicles for their arsenal. Neighboring Mali has seen such an increase in ambushes on its army that it has even closed some of its most remote and vulnerable army outposts.
A Niger army spokesman read the death toll announcement on state TV Wednesday night and said a dozen others had been wounded after the ambush overnight.
Caption: A police officer prepares to strike a lawyer Wednesday in Lahore, Pakistan, where attorneys attacked doctors in a hospital. Authorities said the acrimony began last month when a lawyer alleged mistreatment by doctors after bringing a relative for treatment.

The House Democrats are, as usual, likely to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory by wrapping up a narrow impeachment inquiry, impeaching President Trump on only a scintilla of his crimes and omitting others for which there is ample evidence -- emoluments violations, campaign finance felonies, ties to the Russian mafia and money laundering, fraud by Trump University and the Trump Foundation charity, and sex crimes.
The Senate trial will end quickly and be long forgotten by November. Instead, Democrats in the House should take advantage of the spotlight and hold evidentiary hearings lasting months, understanding full well that it will be the allegations, not the conviction, that will do Mr. Trump in.
If there was a monthlong hearing about just the emoluments violations, followed by another month of woman after woman who say they were sexually assaulted by Mr. Trump, including those who were paid off with hush money in violation of federal campaign finance laws, Mr. Trump would continue to lose his grip, and his re-election campaign would be stymied by his inability to focus on anything other than the impeachment hearings.
There is not a chance in hell of getting a conviction in the Senate. But that doesn't mean that Democrats can't get every one of his crimes in the public spotlight during the campaign.

To the Editor:
An impeachment trial in the Senate now seems inevitable. But who should be considered to be on trial in that venue? On the simplest level, the answer is the president, and we can, unfortunately, be reasonably confident that there will be a failure to convict.
But there is yet another way of viewing the Senate proceeding: as a vehicle for putting the willful blindness of Republican senators on public display.
Given the near impossibility of convicting the president, the Democratic strategy should be to present the case against him with such persuasiveness and clarity that those senators who ignore the abundant evidence will be exposed as being uninterested in the welfare of the nation. Those who are up for re-election in 2020 will then be "convicted" as that election approaches.

Re "Impeach Trump. Save America," by Thomas L. Friedman (column, Dec. 11):
The House Democrats are about to present the Senate Republicans a gift this holiday season. A unique gift, wrought with political peril, to allow Republicans to reclaim their standing in the United States of America. Family values, fiscal responsibility, right vs. wrong were once the staples of Republican politics. I thought no amount of money would cause these values to be tossed into the trash can of history, but I have been proved wrong.
A simple "yes" vote to remove Donald J. Trump from office can help restore the Republican Party, and our nation, to a decent, respectable place to exist. Never look a gift horse in the mouth seems like sage advice.

Texto completo: Several doctors were arrested during a protest this week after they were refused permission to administer free flu vaccines to migrants.
LOS ANGELES -- Since last December, three migrant children have died from influenza in facilities along the southwestern border, where migrants routinely complain that cold temperatures sicken children, and where physicians have reported that crowded conditions spread illnesses.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, concerned that infectious respiratory illnesses were spreading in congested border facilities, this year recommended flu vaccinations "at the earliest point of entry" for migrants who are 6 months or older.
But Customs and Border Protection officials have refused to put a vaccination program into effect, arguing that most migrants spend less than 72 hours in Border Patrol facilities.
The controversy came to a flash point this week, when about 20 medical professionals hauling coolers with flu vaccines showed up at a migrant detention center near San Diego, announcing their plan to inoculate everyone inside the facility who consented.
The physicians and nurses, members of a new health-focused immigrant-rights organization, were told to return the next day for a meeting with border officials, only to hear that they would not be allowed to provide the free shots.
"Of course Border Patrol isn't going to let a random group of radical political activists show up and start injecting people with drugs," the Department of Homeland Security's press secretary said on Twitter.
Trying to provide flu shots to everyone during the few days they spend in Border Patrol custody does not make sense, officials said, because those who go on to be held in longer-term detention facilities routinely receive vaccinations.
The border agency, which invited the C.D.C. to inspect its facilities about a year ago, said it had significantly expanded its medical programs, with more than 250 health care employees now working along the border.
"To try and layer a comprehensive vaccinations system onto that would be logistically very challenging for a number of reasons," the agency said in a statement. "The system and process for implementing vaccines -- including vaccine supply chains, quality control, documentation, informed consent -- are already in place at other steps in the immigration process as appropriate."
Officials at Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which is responsible for longer-term detention of migrants in the United States, said the agency had an annual mass flu vaccination program. Children are offered vaccines "appropriate for their age," and adults are offered varicella vaccinations as needed to avoid chickenpox.
The Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees long-term shelters for migrant children, said it also provided vaccinations, including flu shots, according to federal guidelines.
But doctors who are urging the agency to provide flu shots at the border note that many migrants who arrive there are not being sent to the long-term detention facilities in the United States where the vaccinations are provided. Under the Trump administration's new, more restrictive policies, thousands are being sent back to Mexico, where many wait in teeming, unhealthy border camps.
And many -- including Border Patrol agents -- have complained about the risk of disease transmission in crowded border facilities. Many migrants are ill when they are apprehended, or become ill shortly after arriving at Border Patrol processing facilities.
Christopher Cabrera, a vice president of the local union of Border Patrol agents in the Rio Grande Valley, the Border Patrol's busiest region, spoke in an interview in April about the disease and illness in the building.
"The majority of our agents get sick," said Mr. Cabrera, who has been a Border Patrol agent for 17 years. "Infectious disease is everywhere. There's always scabies in there. Usually we have chickenpox. We have tuberculosis in there. You name it, it's probably been through that building."
Representative Rosa L. DeLauro, Democratic of Connecticut, said it was "unconscionable" that Customs and Border Protection remained opposed to vaccinating migrants in its custody.
"Public health officials at the C.D.C. gave guidance and recommendations to Customs and Border Protection officials regarding flu season," said Ms. DeLauro, chair of the House Appropriations subcommittee that oversees funding for the Department of Health and Human Services. "Yet recent reports indicate that C.B.P. officials are unlikely to vaccinate children and families at the border to safeguard them and others from influenza."
The C.D.C. sent three teams at the beginning of the year to examine Border Patrol detention facilities in El Paso and Yuma, Ariz., with a special focus on respiratory infections.
In a 27-page report, which was reviewed by The New York Times, the C.D.C. advised giving vaccinations as soon as possible to newly arrived migrants, one of a series of recommendations that led to the recent increase in health care workers.
Since last year, several medical groups, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, have raised an alarm over medical care in border facilities.
The group that led this week's inoculation effort, Doctors for Camp Closure, represents about 2,000 medical professionals and students. The organization had been working for more than a month to win approval for a pilot program to inoculate those in Customs and Border Protection custody, said Dr. Marie DeLuca, a co-founder who was among six people arrested on Tuesday at the Border Patrol's regional headquarters in Chula Vista, Calif.
"After more than one year of inaction, we feel that it is important to show that we are serious and ready to provide flu vaccinations," said Dr. DeLuca, who is an emergency medicine physician from New York.
When the group received no response from Customs and Border Protection about its vaccination proposal, about 20 people from the volunteer team arrived at the Border Patrol's processing facility in Chula Vista on Monday with 120 doses of the flu vaccine.
Dr. DeLuca said the group was not allowed into the facility and was told to have two of its representatives return the next day for a meeting with border officials.
On Tuesday, after Customs and Border Protection officially rebuffed the group's offer, doctors, nurses and other supporters protested outside the Border Patrol headquarters nearby. Several demonstrators blocked entrances to the building. Four doctors were among the six people who were arrested and released about an hour later.
"What is at stake are adverse health outcomes and risk of death in a detention center," said Mario Mendoza, an anesthesiologist who was among those arrested. He said he was 7 when he arrived in the United States as an undocumented immigrant. "All we want to do is give passive medical treatment through flu vaccinations," he said.

La extraña aparición de palomas con sombreros por las calles de Las Vegas

Texto completo: Durante varios días, se han visto palomas multicolores con sombrero de vaquero pavoneándose en las calles de Las Vegas. Nadie sabe quién equipa a los pájaros, según publica The Washington Post.
El residente de Las Vegas, Bobby Lee, subió a Facebook un video de dos pájaros con sombreros en miniatura, uno rojo y otro rosado, la semana pasada en Facebook . Los “pájaros tienen sombreros, hermano”, exclama en el clip. La publicación, que se compartió ampliamente, rápidamente se hizo viral en Internet y llegó a Mariah Hillman, cofundadora de un rescate local de palomas llamado Lofty Hopes.
Hillman, de 47 años, y la búsqueda de las aves de su hija de 30 años despegaron rápidamente. Comenzaron investigando áreas conocidas, donde repartieron tarjetas de visita y les dijeron a los transeúntes: “Si las ves, aliméntalas. Estamos a solo tres millas de distancia y podemos llegar bastante rápido “.
I finally found one!!! @LasVegasLocally pic.twitter.com/j2u90R2esL
— ???????? ♥????‍♀️ (@kassandraqueenn) December 9, 2019
Desde entonces, Hillman le dijo a The Washington Post, el dúo recibió dos pistas cada día de personas que vieron las palomas, a menudo adjuntando pruebas de video.
Hillman estaba en casa, limpiando jaulas de pájaros, cuando se enteró por primera vez de un avistamiento. Era demasiado tarde para ir a verlo, pero a la mañana siguiente, tan pronto como Hillman entró en la urbanización cerrada, vio la paloma con sombrero rojo, encaramada a la derecha. Ella desaceleró su auto y dijo: “Hola compañero”.
“Estaba sacudiendo la cabeza, tratando de quitarse el sombrero. Definitivamente es pegamento “, le dijo a The Post sobre el adhesivo utilizado en el pájaro. “Tenemos que mudarlo, lo que llevará tiempo”.
Hillman continuó: “Lo único que no los dañaría es el petróleo, que luego lo convierte en una paloma grasa, como los que están alrededor de McDonalds”.
De cualquier manera, la paloma debe quedarse con Hillman por un tiempo. Durante la persecución de dos horas, la exactivista por los derechos de los animales vio un halcón que rodeaba el área, al que llamó “preocupado”.
El misterio permanece
Aunque la gente ha especulado que los sombreros se originaron con un asistente del Rodeo de las Finales Nacionales, que actualmente se lleva a cabo en la ciudad, la asociación ha negado su participación, según The New York Times, y el Departamento de Policía Metropolitana de Las Vegas dijo que “no parece ser un asunto policial “.
Por ahora, Hillman se centra en localizar a las aves y garantizar su seguridad. Hasta ahora, ella y su hija acogieron a Cluck Norris, que luce un sombrero rojo de vaquero, y Coo-lamity James, que usa uno rosa. Otros avistadores mencionaron pájaros con gorras grises y marrones, aunque Hillman aún no los ha encontrado.
El New York Times entrevistó a un ornitólogo de la Universidad de Cornell, Charles Walcott, que se especializa en palomas. “Disfruté el video”, dijo Walcott al Times. “Solo pensé que esas palomas con sombreros eran lindas”.
Walcott también dijo que no está preocupado por las palomas, que actúan con bastante normalidad y no parecen estar angustiados. Los sombreros son “ciertamente lo suficientemente ligeros”, dijo al Times. “A mí me parecen palomas felices. Es difícil saberlo, por supuesto, porque no nos hablarán”.
Las palomas, dijo Hillman, tienen mucho para ellos: se aparean de por vida, los machos y las hembras producen leche y alimentan a sus crías, pueden vivir hasta 20 años en una unidad familiar, y son una de las diez especies que pueden reconocerse en un espejo.
“Son una gran primera mascota”, agregó, y señaló que tienen picos flexibles y no agudos. “Cuando necesitábamos palomas durante la guerra, eran considerados héroes. Ahora que no los necesitamos, se han convertido en alimañas o plagas. Hacemos eso con muchas cosas en esta sociedad, y eso no está bien”. (Editado por Pelayo Escandón)

Texto completo: “Me cansé de cazar personas negras e hispanas debido a las cuotas de arresto”, dijo el ex oficial Christopher LaForce, en su declaración jurada, explicando su decisión de retirarse en 2015.
Su declaración siguió a una demanda por discriminación presentada contra el Departamento de Policía de Nueva York (NYPD), en la que varios oficiales recientemente dieron declaraciones juradas diciendo que el comandante Constantin Tsachas , que ayuda a supervisar gran parte del sistema en Brooklyn, instó a los oficiales a atacar a los pasajeros negros e hispanos por delitos de bajo nivel, como la evasión de tarifas. Y los desalentó de hacer lo mismo con los blancos o asiáticos.
Las tensiones han aumentado en el Metro en las últimas semanas, con viajeros denunciando y filmando con su teléfono lo que consideran la vigilancia excesivamente agresiva a pasajeros negros e hispanos.
Desde noviembre, algunos neoyorquinos han brincado torniquetes en protesta por los arrestos de jóvenes negros y de una hispana vendedora de churros.
El comandante en cuestión, Constantin Tsachas, estuvo a cargo de más de 100 oficiales entre 2011 y 2015. El distrito que dirigió abarca gran parte del sur de Brooklyn, incluidos diversos vecindarios de Sunset Park, Flatbush y Brighton Beach. Ahora es inspector adjunto.
Las declaraciones juradas firmadas se reunieron en los últimos meses como parte de la demanda, detalló The New York Times.
El inspector Tsachas y el Departamento de Policía se negaron a comentar, pero su representante sindical dijo que el inspector negó las acusaciones de mala conducta.
La aplicación de la ley en el Metro aumentó en el último año . Los oficiales de policía emitieron 22 mil boletos más por evasión de tarifas este año en comparación con 2018.
Cientos de oficiales más también se han desplegado en el sistema de tránsito en los últimos meses, lo que provocó un debate sobre el exceso de vigilancia y la criminalización de la pobreza.
El gobernador Andrew Cuomo ha sido severamente criticado por el despliegue ampliado, mientras la Autoridad Metropolitana de Transporte (MTA) se enfrenta a una inminente crisis financiera e intenta por proporcionar un servicio confiable en el Metro, evitando a los polizones e indigentes.
Tensions over aggressive subway policing have been rising in New York City. Last month, protesters marched through downtown Brooklyn chanting, “How do you spell racist? N-Y-P-D.”https://t.co/DzHyej3pTD

Texto completo: Miguel Jason Rodríguez (39), trabajador emigrante de Ecuador, fue identificado como uno de los seis muertos ayer en un balacera en un supermercado judío en Jersey City.
En el lugar funciona el negocio “Jersey City Kosher Supermarket”, el único negocio kosher en la zona, informó The Fayetteville Observer.
También murieron la dueña del local, Leah Minda Ferencz (33), y su primo Moshe Hirsch Deutsh (24), miembros de la comunidad judía ortodoxa; el detective Joseph Seals (40), considerado un héroe local; y los atacantes, el hombre David Anderson (47) y la mujer Francine Graham (50), que se cree están vinculados al grupo religioso “Israelitas Negros” (Black Hebrew Israelites), según The New York Times.
Desde anoche, el alcalde de Jersey City, Steven Fulop confirmó que los dos atacantes armados que provocaron el caos en Greenville, un barrio residencial, “apuntaron” a una tienda judía cuando intercambiaron disparos con la policía en un tiroteo de una hora.
Fulop, quien es judío, dijo que las autoridades llegaron a esa conclusión sobre la base de la investigación en curso, “después de una extensa revisión de nuestro sistema de circuito cerrado de televisión”.
Williams Machazek, pastor de la Iglesia “Nueva Vida” en Newark, identificó a como víctima Rodríguez, un miembro de su templo que emigró de Ecuador hace tres años.
Rodríguez, dijo Machazek, había estado trabajando en la tienda de comestibles en Jersey City durante más de un año para mantener a su familia, que incluye una esposa y una hija de 11 años.
Moshe Hirsch Deutch estaba de visita desde Williamsburg, Brooklyn. Desde NYC, el alcalde Bill de Blasio condenó el ataque y criticó el antisemitismo en varios mensajes en Twitter después de la declaración de Fulop.
“Esto confirma trágicamente que un patrón creciente de antisemitismo violento se ha convertido en una crisis para nuestra nación. Y ahora esta amenaza ha llegado a las puertas de la ciudad de Nueva York”, escribió De Blasio.
En declaraciones a NBC News agregó que el ataque “fue claramente un crimen de odio”, y que NYPD está “en alerta alta”.

MLB official defends contraction plan, fires back at minor league owners

Texto completo: SAN DIEGO — Major League Baseball has been taking a beating over its minor league contraction proposal that would strip 42 teams of their major league affiliations.
Here at the Winter Meetings, MLB has finally decided it's time to start fighting back.
Not only did commissioner Rob Manfred describe the state of the talks as a “tale of two cities" and advise Minor League Baseball to leave its “take it or leave it" stance to reporters Wednesday afternoon, his deputy commissioner Dan Halem took the battle to another level.
Halem brought 21 photographs from 13 minor league stadiums that he said depicted unsafe playing conditions, high-school-level clubhouses, and cramped training rooms, and shared a copy of an internal e-mail sent from the president of the Carolina League to 10 minor league owners extending them the opportunity to sell 50 percent or more of their club and move it to Wilmington, N.C.
The e-mail is dated Nov. 22 — a month after word leaked out about MLB's plan to effectively abandon 42 communities.
Since October, Minor League Baseball as an organization and many of its owners have spoken to the media about the economic impact the plan would have in the affected communities and scoffed at the viability of an MLB-run independent “Dream League" and college-style wooden-bat leagues.
Congress has latched on to the abandonment issue, with US senators and representatives flooding Manfred's inbox with letters decrying the plan, along with the creation of a “Save Minor League Baseball" task force comprising minor league owners and a 100-plus group of bipartisan House members.
It's a messy, big-dollar dispute that likely will not subside much before the sides reach a September 2020 deadline to hammer out a new Professional Baseball Agreement.
To date, MLB has said little in its own defense, but the exhibits Halem brought to an interview Wednesday marked a new offensive.
Halem also said the list of 42 teams that has leaked is out of date and thus wrong. For example, he said, the Lowell Spinners, the Red Sox' sole affiliate on the list, are not technically affected.
“You can write this: No decision has been made regarding Lowell — internally and not across the table," said Halem. “That list is inaccurate. There are a lot of different moving parts."
For now, Halem said, MLB is not going to release a revised list because of its fluidity and the negotiation's intensity.
And while MLB is willing, for now, to endure criticism, it is unwilling to allow MiLB to continue to frame itself as the victim.
Halem made it clear that MLB believes MiLB has been unwilling to address the concerns about facility upgrades. Talks degenerated when the sides hired auditing firms to decide on facility standards and came up with different results. Trust was not helped, Halem said, when he discovered that information he had shared with MiLB president Pat O'Conner wound up in the New York Times and Baseball America in October.
Minor league owners don't have enough stake in the game because they play in stadiums that are mostly government owned, Halem said, and those leases don't stop a team from leaving a community.
“You have to understand their mind-set, too: They leave communities all the time; this is not like they've never left a community, they've left three in the last year," said Halem. “The problem with them, there is what they say publicly, and what they say privately is different.
“Publicly they're saying, 'We're staying in all these communities blah blah,' and what they say privately is, 'We're going to deal with these situations such as Batavia and Binghamton, we're going to leave and we have an area, a city here that's going to build us a new stadium' — that's the way they're going to deal with it.
“If you don't think they've been trying to get new facilities in some of these places for years, you're mistaken. They have."
Halem described the minor league owners as “very smart" for how they have leveraged major league owners into buying into some of their teams to prevent them from leaving.
“If I wasn't in my job and I had the money, I would buy a minor league affiliate, because these things do not really have any intrinsic value," said Halem. “We supply the players, the city or state supplies the stadium.
“They'll go to the Brewers, let's say, and say, 'We're thinking of affiliating with another club but we'll stay with you if you buy us at a higher valuation.' And our clubs have bought into this because they're desperately afraid if they lose their affiliate, they're going to get stuck in a worse place."
MLB does not think there is a need for 160 affiliated teams in large part because it believes a majority of MLB owners would be satisfied with four affiliates — a total of 120 teams — with more players on those teams having a better chance of making the majors and also making it easier for the MLB to pay them more.

Marie Fredriksson, Roxette's Lung-Busting Lead Singer, Dies at 61

Texto completo: As half of the Swedish duo, which gained fame in the 1980s and '90s, Ms. Fredriksson was known for her powerful voice and dynamic onstage presence.
Marie Fredriksson, the spiky-haired lead singer of Roxette, the Swedish pop duo that briefly ruled the American charts in the 1980s and '90s with dramatically lovelorn ballads and catchy uptempo singles, died on Monday. She was 61.
Her management team, Dimberg Jernberg, did not say where she died or specify the cause of death, but said in a statement that Ms. Fredriksson had struggled with cancer after learning that she had a brain tumor in 2002.
Ms. Fredriksson and the singer-songwriter Per Gessle formed Roxette in 1986. Each had achieved moderate success in Sweden; they decided that together they could strive for international stardom.
"Swedish critics said we'd never make it, but they were wrong," Ms. Fredriksson told The Los Angeles Times in 1990.
American critics were often no friendlier. "Old pop formulas never die; they come back with different haircuts," Jon Pareles wrote in The New York Times in 1992, in a scathing review of the band's New York debut. He added, "Roxette's main asset is Marie Fredriksson, a singer with a sob in her voice, a platinum-blond Billy Idol hairdo and a taste for skintight costumes."
The duo, however, broke through in the United States in 1989 when Dean Cushman, an American student who had visited Sweden on an exchange program, brought a copy of the Roxette album "Look Sharp!" to a local radio station back home in Minneapolis.
The station, impressed by the album, played the strutting single "The Look." It became a local hit before going on to reach No. 1 on Billboard's Hot 100 chart. The American label EMI, which had recently decided not to release Roxette's music in the United States, quickly reversed course.
Three more Roxette singles topped the charts in the next two years: "Listen to Your Heart," "Joyride" and "It Must Have Been Love," the last of which was heard on the soundtrack of "Pretty Woman," the hit 1990 romantic comedy starring Julia Roberts and Richard Gere.

Roxette, like Abba before it and Ace of Base after, achieved huge success as a Swedish group singing in English, making immaculately crafted pop music. The duo didn't just offer counterprogramming to hair metal and grunge; they also made a pop melody feel like a statement of lung-busting defiance, even when the lyrics were daft poetry like "tasty as a raindrop."
On hit power ballads like "Fading Like a Flower (Every Time You Leave)," Ms. Fredriksson sounded as if she could triumph over heartbreak by leaning on a sturdily constructed song. "I think somehow I am more vulnerable if I am singing in Swedish," she said in a video interview in 2000.
Certifying its status as a superstar band, Roxette even got its own stamp in 1991, issued by the Swedish postal service. "It's nice having the entire Swedish nation licking your back," Mr. Gessle said in Rolling Stone.
Marie Fredriksson was born on May 30, 1958, in Skane County, in southern Sweden. Her family was poor, but singing was free: She would sometimes wake up her parents by singing early morning opera into her mirror.
Ms. Fredriksson cited Billie Holiday, Ella Fitzgerald and Chick Corea as early influences; later her favorites would be Mick Jagger and Tina Turner, whom she admired both for their vocal abilities and for their onstage charisma.
She played with two bands, the punk group Strul and the new wave duo MaMas Barn, and released two eclectic solo albums, in 1984 and 1986, before joining forces with Mr. Gessle.
Explaining their partnership to The Los Angeles Times in 1990, she said: "People ask all the time if we're married or romantically involved. They insist we are, but we're not."
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Although Roxette's popularity in the United States peaked between 1989 and 1991, its career lasted longer around the globe. The band released a total of 10 albums through 2016, seven of them certified platinum in various countries; videos of the duo's songs have attracted over a billion views on YouTube.
Ms. Fredriksson's career was derailed in 2002 when she suffered a seizure, fracturing her skull on her bathroom floor. Testing revealed that the cause was a malignant brain tumor. Recoveries and setbacks followed, but she kept making music (she made three solo albums after her diagnosis), and in 2012 she embarked on a reunion tour with Mr. Gessle.
Her illness made it hard for her to learn new lyrics, but she still remembered all the Roxette hits. "Touring makes her feel incredible," Mr. Gessle told The Guardian. "She gets so much back from the audience -- it's like she's in the world's oddest rehab."
Roxette's music was never trendy, but as the years went by it attracted enthusiastic admirers. Derek Miller of the band Sleigh Bells, speaking about Roxette with Spin in 2012, said, "I don't understand how people get this talented."
Ms. Fredriksson is survived by her husband, the music producer Mikael Bolyos -- they met when Roxette was touring Australia in 1990, promptly fell in love and decided to marry 48 hours later -- and two children, Josefin and Oscar.
In a statement on Tuesday, Mr. Gessle paid tribute to Ms. Fredriksson as "an outstanding musician, a master of the voice, an amazing performer." He added, "Thanks for painting my black-and-white songs in the most beautiful colors."
"Time goes by so quickly," he said. "It's not that long ago we spent days and nights in my tiny apartment in Halmstad, listening to music we loved, sharing impossible dreams."

Texto completo: In its annual survey, the Committee to Protect Journalists found that at least 250 journalists are imprisoned around the world, largely by authoritarian leaders.
China nudged past Turkey as the leading jailer of journalists this year, a press advocacy group reported in its annual survey, partly because of severe repression in China's Xinjiang region and Turkey's eradication of "virtually all independent reporting," which has left many reporters unemployed, driven into exile or intimidated into self-censorship.
The survey, released Wednesday by the Committee to Protect Journalists, also found that authoritarianism, instability and protests in the Middle East had led to a sharp rise in the number of journalists incarcerated in that region. Saudi Arabia and Egypt now share the rank of third-worst jailer of journalists, the group said.
For the fourth consecutive year, at least 250 journalists were imprisoned around the world, the group said in a news release announcing the findings. It said President Xi Jinping of China, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia and President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt had shown "no sign of letting up on the critical media."
It was the first time in four years that Turkey had not claimed the dubious title in the group's survey, as the number of journalists incarcerated there fell to 47 from 68 in 2018. But the group said the reduction did "not signal an improved situation for the Turkish media."
Rather, the group said, the reduction reflected the successful drive by Mr. Erdogan to "stamp out independent reporting," with actions that included the closing of more than 100 news outlets. Scores of journalists are now in exile, jobless or too frightened to report on topics the Turkish government finds objectionable, the group said.
Other journalists who had been held in Turkish jails have been freed, because of shortened pretrial detention periods under new laws that grant appeals for convictions of offenses such as "propaganda for a terrorist organization," which the group described as a frequent charge against journalists in Turkey.
"Dozens of journalists not currently jailed in Turkey are still facing trial or appeal and could yet be sentenced to prison," the group said, while "others have been sentenced in absentia and face arrest if they return to the country."
In China, at least 48 journalists are incarcerated, one more than in 2018, the group said, as Mr. Xi has "instituted ever tighter controls on the media."
A crackdown in Xinjiang, where a million members of Muslim ethnic groups have been sent to internment camps, has led to the arrests of "dozens of journalists," the group said, including some incarcerated for work they had done years ago.
In Saudi Arabia, where the number of imprisoned journalists has risen steadily for years, at least 26 are being held, the group said, the same as the number imprisoned in Egypt. In 18 of the Saudi cases, the group said, the charges have not been disclosed.
The group found 16 journalists held in the reclusive sub-Saharan nation of Eritrea, including some who had not been heard from in nearly two decades.
Other countries on the group's top jailers list include Vietnam, with 12 imprisoned journalists; Iran, with 11; Russia and Cameroon, with seven each; Bahrain and Azerbaijan, with six each; Syria with five; and Burundi, Rwanda and Morocco, with four each.
The group said it also had revised its 2018 list to 255 from 251, having belatedly learned of arrests, releases or deaths it had not known of a year ago.
The list is a snapshot of those incarcerated as of Dec. 1, and excludes the many journalists who are seized by the authorities and released throughout the year.
Based in New York, the Committee to Protect Journalists is a leading proponent of press freedom, and its advocacy work has helped lead to early release of at least 80 imprisoned journalists this past year.

Texto completo: As you have likely heard or read, the House Judiciary Committee, on a party-line vote, has adopted two articles of impeachment against President Trump, charging that he “ignored and injured the interests of the Nation” and abused his powers by pressuring Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to announce corruption investigations of former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden, and that he obstructed congressional investigations into his conduct.

FBI Director Christopher Wray is cleaning up James Comey's mess

Texto completo: Cut FBI Director Christopher Wray some slack. The Trump appointee inherited a host of problems from his predecessor, James Comey, and it seems Comey is determined to make those problems worse.

Within hours of the release of Inspector General Michael Horowitz’s report on the FBI’s Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrant abuses, Comey had an opinion article up at the Washington Post, in which he denied any wrongdoing, deception, or political bias.

The report, however, tells a much different story, citing “at least 17 significant errors or omissions” that raise “significant questions regarding the FBI chain of command’s management.”

Wray acknowledged these “serious performance failures” in an interview with ABC News, but pushed back on the GOP’s characterization of the FBI as a “deep state” institution.

“I think that’s the kind of label that’s a disservice to the men and women who work at the FBI who I think tackle their jobs with professionalism, with rigor, with objectivity, with courage,” Wray told ABC News. “So that’s not a term I would ever use to describe our workforce, and I think it’s an affront to them.”

This didn’t sit well with President Trump, who took to Twitter to slam Wray’s unhelpful “attitude.”

“I don’t know what report current Director of the FBI Christopher Wray was reading, but it sure wasn’t the one given to me,” Trump tweeted. “With that kind of attitude, he will never be able to fix the FBI, which is badly broken despite having some of the greatest men & women working there!”

But Wray isn’t the problem. In fact, he’s simply doing what any good boss would do: He’s defending his employees and reiterating his intent to right the ship that had begun to sink long before he took the helm.

If anything, Horowitz’s report confirms that Comey was the problem all along. Trump was right to fire him: He’s a self-important, manipulative man who has no problem bending the rules to advance his agenda.
When confronted, Comey always has an excuse. Indeed, when an earlier inspector general concluded that Comey had acted in an “insubordinate” manner when he “intentionally concealed” his plans to exonerate Hillary Clinton during a press conference, Comey responded with a New York Times piece under the headline, “This Report Says I Was Wrong. But That’s Good for the F.B.I.”
And earlier this summer, Horowitz’s office said Comey set a “dangerous example” for the bureau when he intentionally leaked confidential conversations he had with Trump. Horowitz recommended that Comey be prosecuted, but because Comey’s conversations with Trump had not been legally classified, Comey dismissed the report as defamation.

“I don’t need a public apology from those who defamed me, but a quick message with a ‘sorry we lied about you’ would be nice,” Comey tweeted in August.

This time around, Comey is clinging to Horowitz’s conclusion that serious political bias did not taint the FBI’s investigation into the 2016 Trump campaign’s alleged ties to the Kremlin.

“So it was all lies. No treason. No spying on the campaign. No tapping Trumps wires. It was just good people trying to protect America,” Comey wrote on Twitter.

There might not have been overt bias (a conclusion the Justice Department has disputed), but there was significant irresponsibility and mismanagement, both of which can be traced back to one person: James Comey.

Indeed, it was Comey who pushed to include the faulty Steele dossier in the FBI’s FISA warrant application, despite the fact that the CIA had dismissed it as an unverified report filled with “internet rumors.” It was Comey who ignored the many reports of Steele’s political ties to Hillary Clinton and the Democratic National Committee. It was Comey who installed a mole in the White House to feed the FBI information about Trump and his aides in 2017 — an operation that was “in direct conflict with the no-contact policy between the White House and the department of Justice,” according to one former National Security Council official.

Comey’s self-righteous behavior has set a horrible precedent for the FBI and the rest of the intelligence community. It now falls to Wray to clean up the mess Comey has created, and to do that, he’ll need all the help he can get.

Yankees face five questions as Winter Meetings begin

Texto completo: SAN DIEGO – Conversations about soaring dollar figures for free agents and a myriad of trade configurations will be in the air this week at baseball's Winter Meetings.
It's prime time for the game's buyers and sellers to shape the team rosters of 2020 and beyond.
And the central office for all that activity will be the Manchester Grand Hyatt, where the New York Yankees are already creating a lobby buzz about their pursuit of Gerrit Cole.
Here are five questions facing the Yankees as they go about business in downtown San Diego:
Can they sign Gerrit Cole? The right-handed ace is clearly the Yankees' prime free agent target.
On Sunday, USA Today's Bob Nightengale cited rival executives acknowledging the Yanks as favorites to land Cole, with the Los Angeles Angels as the next-best competitor.
Initial offers are expected to be made this week, and the New York Times' Bob Klapisch reported that the Yanks are preparing a seven-year, $245 million bid.
While that would be a record-setting contract for a pitcher, it might be just the opening salvo.
The Angels and Los Angeles Dodgers could push the bidding closer to $300 million for the prized client of Scott Boras, who also represents free agent starter Stephen Strasburg.
Searching for a shortstop? By failing to make the one-year qualifying offer to Didi Gregorius, thus making him an untethered free agent, the Yankees would appear to have – somewhat stunningly - moved on from a player who mostly thrived in the Bronx.
Are the Yankees really content with Gleyber Torres at shortstop, making D.J. LeMahieu the primary second baseman?
Could the Yanks retain Gregorius at a more reasonable long-term contract, or perhaps pursue another free agent such as Jose Iglesias?
There doesn't appear to be a lot of available depth out there at this primary position.
What about center field? Brett Gardner has lingered longer in free agency than was imaginable after the season, especially given Aaron Hicks' need for Tommy John surgery (right elbow) two months ago.
Hicks might be sidelined until the second half, so the Yankees' current center field depth chart begins with Mike Tauchman.
The Yankees' 40-man roster is currently full, so maybe they're waiting for a trade or some other way to bring back Gardner.
Or maybe, the club's pursuit of Cole means saving money in other areas to accommodate a salary that could push them to the strictest luxury tax penalties.
Adding another reliever? Last winter, the Yankees signed free agent Adam Ottavino and retained a free agent in Zack Britton, bolstering a signature bullpen that already boasted closer Aroldis Chapman and primary setup man Dellin Betances.
But injuries (shoulder, lat, Achilles) doomed Betances' 2019 season. Could he come back on an incentive-laden one-year deal?
The four-time All-Star setup man might have some better offers, leaving the Yankees to try another bounce-back candidate in free agent Blake Treinen or a solid veteran in Will Harris.
What if they miss on Cole? That could create a serious competition between the Nationals and Yankees for Strasburg, or move the Yankees toward free agents Madison Bumgarner, Dallas Keuchel, Hyun-Jin Ryu or some creative trade ideas.
Is there a package that could sway the Cleveland Indians to move Corey Kluber?
Or even All-Star shortstop Francisco Lindor for that matter?
If the Yanks whiff on Cole and Strasburg, the Plan B situations won't be as appealing, but could be fascinating.

Jamelle Bouie: Why the ‘wokest’ candidates are the weakest

Texto completo: Democrats are too “woke” for their own good, or so goes the argument.
“Today’s progressivism is more or less a secular form of religion with its own high standards,” Matt Lewis, a conservative columnist, wrote this spring. “Eventually,” he concluded, “the revolution devours its own.” Bill Maher, host of HBO’s Real Time, urged Democratic presidential candidates to “Get out of Woke-ville, for a day.”
“Wokeness,” in this rendering, is an overly rigid commitment to identity politics and social justice ideology. And in their zeal, these woke Democrats are pushing the Democratic Party away from the voters it needs to beat President Donald Trump in 2020.
If this were actually true, you would expect real traction for the wokest candidates in the Democratic presidential race. But it’s been just the opposite. The woke candidates have been the weakest, electorally speaking, and the defining attribute of the Democratic primary has been a preoccupation with the voters that put Trump in the White House.
Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York centered her campaign on racial justice and the fight against sexual assault. During one debate, she identified herself as a “white woman of privilege” and promised to reach out to “white women in the suburbs who voted for Trump and explain to them what white privilege actually is.” Fluent in wokeness, Gillibrand hoped to win the most progressive, social justice-minded Democrats. But she never broke away from the pack and dropped out at the end of the summer.
Beto O’Rourke, the former Representative of Texas’ 16th congressional district, took a similar approach, barnstorming the country as the wokest of woke Democrats. In the wake of a shooting that killed 22 people in his hometown, El Paso, O’Rourke embraced mandatory buybacks for assault weapons, with fines for people who do not sell their weapons back to the federal government. Later, at a town hall on LGBTQ issues, O’Rourke said he would end tax-exempt status for religious institutions that opposed same-sex marriage: “There can be no reward, no benefit, no tax break for anyone or any institution, any organization that denies the full human rights and the full civil rights of every single one of us.” O’Rourke, like Gillibrand, hoped to win the most culturally liberal Democrats. Instead, his support shrank. He dropped out at the beginning of November.
Sen. Kamala Harris of California was not as openly woke as some of her rivals — although she did voice support for reparations — but as the daughter of immigrants from India and Jamaica, she embodied the “Great Awokening” of the Democratic electorate. If “post-Obama, the Democratic Party is increasingly the party of women and the ‘woke’,” as Perry Bacon Jr., a political analyst, argued in FiveThirtyEight just after she announced her campaign, then “Harris’s biography and politics align well with where the party has moved.” Harris made headway — at first. But she wasn’t able to capitalize on her early success. For most of the fall, she struggled to win over voters and raise money. This week, she left the race.
None of this is dispositive. The Democratic Party might still be too woke for its own good. But the evidence for that isn’t in the primary campaign. A former vice president, Joe Biden, known for his centrist politics and blue-collar affect, leads the field. His nearest rivals, Sens. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, support social justice politics, but they’ve centered their campaigns on inequality and corruption.
Yes, the failure of explicitly woke campaigns is a function, in part, of moderate and conservative voters in the Democratic coalition, including African-Americans and Latinos. But if the Democratic Party is as woke as critics say, the race should be able to sustain one or two woke candidates. The fact that it can’t should undermine, or at least temper, the idea of a “Great Awokening” transforming Democratic politics. At the very least, it shows that Democrats are far more concerned with beating Trump than elevating woke ideology.
With all of that said, I want to make a point about the term “woke” itself. These days, it’s a term of abuse — a shorthand for puritanical political correctness, a pejorative wielded against liberal elitism. But its origins are in African-American vernacular, where it referred to a broad awareness of anti-black oppression. The metaphor of being “awake,” for example, drives Martin Luther King Jr.’s 1965 speech “Remaining Awake Through a Great Revolution.” Like so much other black slang, it’s been borrowed and diluted and worn down, so that the original meaning has faded from view. That meaning, however, is still worthwhile.
Puritanism is not useful for politics or governing. But a broad awareness of oppression — of the ways this country does not work for many of its citizens — is vital. To the extent that Democrats have that awareness, they should not shy away from it.

BACK TO LIFE? DEAL STRUCK ON SURPRISE BILLING BAN: Members of Congress announced changes to their surprise billing legislation this weekend as they attempt to deliver what Republican Sen. Lamar Alexander is calling a “Christmas present” to patients.
The bill, which lawmakers had hoped to pass ahead of the August recess, was floundering due to lobbying efforts by private-equity doctor staffing firms and a push from a large swath of lawmakers who wanted the measure to include arbitration, a provision to set up an independent arbiter to resolve billing disputes.
The push won over. Congressional leaders announced Sunday that the move to set rates, known as “benchmarking,” would remain in the bill, but for certain claims insurers or healthcare providers could turn to arbitration to intervene. Senior aides haven’t released precise details yet on how the mechanism would be triggered.
Despite the many differences in Congress, and the impeachment inquiry in the House, Congress is making it clear this is one area for which they’re willing to put aside their differences.
Sweetening the deal even further, the Lower Health Care Costs Act includes early $20 billion for five years of funding for the nation’s 1,400 community health centers, as well as measures to lower drug prices. And let’s not forget it contains a measure aimed at the vaping issue by increasing the legal age to buy tobacco products from 18 to 21.
The deal will potentially will be attached to a spending bill due Dec. 20. There’s not yet a guarantee that the package will pass, but the latest change boosts the chances that Congress will be able to check this issue off its list for 2019.

THE SENATE DRUG PRICING BILL ALSO GETS A FACELIFT: The Senate Finance Committee has changed the bipartisan bill, which has support from the White House, so that it will fund other healthcare priorities, including Medicaid for Puerto Rico. It also lets seniors pay the cost of their drugs over the course of the year, instead of all at once at the pharmacy counter. It’s not clear drug pricing will go ahead this year, though, as senators still don’t have a commitment from Mitch McConnell to bring the bill to the floor.
Meanwhile, over in the House: The Lower Drug Costs Now Act from Nancy Pelosi to let the government negotiate the price of up to 250 drugs is getting a vote this week. And Republicans are ramping up against the bill Monday by introducing a measure of their own, which largely takes from the Finance Committee bill and which they are daring Democrats to support.
SUPREME COURT WON’T REVIEW KENTUCKY ULTRASOUND LAW: The Supreme Court’s decision means that a 6th Circuit ruling, to allow the law to go into effect, will remain in place.
The law in Kentucky, known as the Ultrasound Informed Consent Act, requires doctors who perform the ultrasound to show and describe the images to patients, and to play the sound of the heartbeat. Women are allowed to look away and to ask for the sounds to be turned off. Doctors who don't comply can be fined and referred to Kentucky's medical licensing board.
SEEMA VERMA TRIED TO CHARGE TAXPAYERS $47K FOR STOLEN JEWELRY: Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Administrator Seema Verma filed a $47,000 claim for lost property in August 2018, Politico reported, after her baggage was stolen from a rental car in San Francisco. When it happened, Verma was nearby giving a speech and ended up losing tens of thousands of dollars’ worth of jewelry. A Health and Human Services spokesperson said the department pays a “discounted rate based on age for the items that were lost,” and added, “It’s perfectly appropriate that the administrator filed a personal property loss claim for goods stolen while on work travel and this is not an unusual practice for federal employees.” Even though Verma filed a $47,000 claim, HHS gave her just $2,852.40.
GOP DEMANDS ANSWERS FROM INSURERS ABOUT HIGH INSULIN PRICES: Energy and Commerce Committee Republicans are demanding answers from insurers, including Blue Cross Blue Shield, Cigna, and Anthem, for information regarding the list prices of insulin versus negotiated prices. They point out that while list prices of insulin products have increased over the past 10 years, the net prices that manufacturers get has stayed the same or decreased.
FDA WARNS UMBILICAL CORD BLOOD PRODUCT MANUFACTURER: The Food and Drug Administration has issued a warning to Liveyon, a company that claims its products derived from umbilical cord blood “may aid in the regeneration of bone, muscle, cartilage and release a host of reparative growth factors and proteins,” through the “miraculous nature of stem cell science.” An FDA inspection of the Liveyon Labs and Liveyon LLC facility in May found that umbilical cord donors were not properly vetted per the FDA’s tissue guidelines.
In the past year, 17 people have been hospitalized after being injected with similar products derived from umbilical cord blood. It is also worth noting that the FDA has sent similar letters to 20 stem cell manufacturing companies in violation of the same guidance as Liveyon.

Texto completo: The Justice Department watchdog offered fresh insight into the role played by former British MI6 agent Christopher Steele in the Trump-Russia investigation, revealing the FBI assessed Steele as reliable but prone to poor judgment.
A lightly redacted report released Monday by Inspector General Michael Horowitz criticizes the FBI's use of a dossier compiled by Steele, which contained unverified claims regarding President Trump and Russia, to obtain Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrants to monitor onetime Trump campaign adviser Carter Page, an American businessman suspected of being a Russian asset.
Counter to what some Trump allies have alleged, Horowitz additionally determined that the genesis of the FBI's counterintelligence investigation into Trump's campaign, code-named "Crossfire Hurricane," was unrelated to the dossier.
High-level Justice Department officials initially disapproved of moving ahead with FISA warrants against Page, expressing a need for more evidence that he was potentially working with Russia. Horowitz's report shows the FBI got the green light after Steele's research showed Page met with top Russian officials in Moscow in 2016.
As the FBI sought to determine the reliability of Steele's research, officials met with one of his primary sources in January, March, and May 2017 that "raised significant questions about the reliability of the Steele election reporting," according to the report.
The FBI also assessed that Steele may have judgment problems but was not prone to making up information, according to Horowitz's report.
Peter Strzok, the disgraced FBI special agent who led the counterintelligence investigation into Trump's campaign, told the inspector general that "Steele sometimes followed the 'shiny object' without a judgment about whether the shiny thing was really worth pursuing given the risks involved ... but that Steele had no history of fabricating, embellishing, or otherwise 'spinning' information."
During a meeting where Strzok briefed his team on information provided by Steele, officials were told that Steele "may have some judgment problems" but that the team could "continue to rely on reports for FISA."
The inspector general report reveals the FBI also embellished Steele's standing in the FISA applications.
Bill Priestap, a former top FBI official, and Strzok were told by a former employer of Steele’s that he had held a "moderately senior" position in Moscow, but the FISA documents refer to him as “high-ranking.”
The inspector general found the FBI's counterintelligence investigation into Trump's team was properly authorized, and there was no political bias influencing the investigation. But he also determined the bureau made "at least 17 significant errors or omissions" in the applications spanning from October 2016 to summer 2017.
Sunday night, on the eve of the FISA report’s release, the New York Times reported Attorney General William Barr approved the public release of details that had previously been redacted in Horowitz’s inquiry. People familiar with the situation claimed Steele was not told what the new info would be, nor was he given the chance to review or respond to the new information.
Horowitz began looking into possible government surveillance abuses in March 2018 after a memo from Republicans leading the House Intelligence Committee alleged the Justice Department and FBI misled the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, which approved four warrants targeting Page, by not adequately disclosing the dossier's Democratic benefactors and his bias against Trump.
House Intelligence Committee Democrats argued in a rebuttal memo that the FISA applications also contained evidence against Page that was not in the dossier, and the FBI "met the rigor, transparency, and evidentiary basis needed to meet FISA's probable cause requirement."
Steele’s career with the United Kingdom’s premier spy agency was often centered on Russia. Steele served under diplomatic cover at the British embassy in the early 1990s, where he admitted Russian intelligence tracked him closely. He was publicly outed online as a suspected MI6 agent in 1999. He then headed MI6’s Russia desk for years, leaving the spy agency in 2009 and founding Orbis Business Intelligence with Christopher Burrows, a fellow former British spy also outed the decade prior.
Before Steele, 55, provided claims on the Trump campaign to the FBI, the bureau worked with him for years, including on a FIFA corruption case.
Steele put together his dossier after being contracted in 2016 by Fusion GPS, an opposition research firm, which at the time was employed by Hillary Clinton's campaign and the Democratic National Committee to collect information on Trump, paid through the Perkins Coie law firm.
Steele was removed by the FBI as a confidential human source in October 2016 because of improper disclosures to the media, although the bureau continued to use his dossier in court filings. Steele continued to communicate with the FBI through an unofficial back channel facilitated by Justice Department official Bruce Ohr.
Multiple officials have raised concerns about the sourcing in the dossier, which Steele acknowledged in a deposition was full of "raw intelligence."
Barr told the Senate in May he was “concerned about” possible Russian disinformation in Steele’s dossier. Making an appearance as an impeachment witness in October, Trump's former National Security Council Russia expert Fiona Hill testified that Steele’s dossier “very likely” contained Russian disinformation. And Daniel Hoffman, a former CIA Moscow station chief, told the Washington Examiner the Steele dossier was likely partly a product of Russian intelligence.
In Crime in Progress: Inside the Steele Dossier and the Fusion GPS Investigation of Donald Trump, the new book by Fusion GPS co-founders Glenn Simpson and Peter Fritsch, Steele said there is no way he was duped by the Kremlin and said his critics “have no idea what they are talking about.” Steele also contended that at least 70% of the assertions in his dossier were accurate.

'Inappropriate' Behavior Leads to Dismissal

Texto completo: The Metropolitan Opera and the Royal Opera in London dismissed the singer for an incident during the Royal's tour of Japan in September.
Vittorio Grigolo, one of opera's star tenors, was dismissed by the Metropolitan Opera on Thursday after he was fired by the Royal Opera in London, which found that he had engaged in "inappropriate and aggressive behavior" during a recent company tour of Japan.
The Royal Opera said that an independent investigation of the incident, which occurred in September in Tokyo, concluded that Mr. Grigolo's "inappropriate and aggressive behavior at the curtain call and afterward fell below the standards we expect of our staff and performers." The Royal removed him from his upcoming performances with the company, and the Met, which had suspended him after the incident, quickly followed suit.
Mr. Grigolo pre-empted the announcement of his dismissal with a post on Instagram. "I recognize that my personality can be very exuberant at times, and I am willing to make sure that what happened will not happen again in the future," he wrote.
With his dismissal from the Royal Opera and the Met, where he had been scheduled to sing Alfredo in Verdi's "La Traviata" this winter, Mr. Grigolo became the latest in a line of opera luminaries whose careers have been upended by allegations of misconduct and abusive behavior.
Plácido Domingo, one of opera's most prominent figures, lost all of his remaining United States engagements this year and stepped down as general director of Los Angeles Opera amid allegations that he had sexually harassed women. And the Met fired James Levine, its longtime music director, in 2018 after finding evidence that he had "engaged in sexually abusive and harassing conduct toward vulnerable artists." (Both men have denied the allegations.)
Mr. Grigolo's dismissal stemmed from an incident on Sept. 18, when he was singing Gounod's "Faust" while on tour with the Royal Opera in Japan.
The details of what happened are not clear. The Sun, a British tabloid, reported that Mr. Grigolo was accused of "allegedly grabbing a female member of the chorus" onstage during a curtain call, in view of the audience, and then arguing "vehemently" when asked to stop. Several Italian publications suggested it had been a misunderstanding, saying that Mr. Grigolo had touched the padded belly of a dancer playing a pregnant woman, and cursed at her when she objected.
The Royal Opera took the allegations seriously enough that Mr. Grigolo was replaced for the next performance by another tenor, Georgy Vasiliev.
Mr. Grigolo's publicist did not respond to a request for comment shortly after the incident. But in an Instagram post this fall, Mr. Grigolo thanked his fans and friends for their support and said that he would cooperate with the investigation. "I remain calm," he wrote. He also posted an image from a curtain call he had taken during the Japan tour.
The Royal Opera did not reveal details about the incident on Thursday, or what its investigation found. Mr. Grigolo claimed in his Instagram post that the investigation had contradicted "accusations made against me by several journalists and tabloids" and said "even though it was never my intention to offend anyone, the situation deteriorated unexpectedly due to a brawl between colleagues."
It was not immediately clear if Mr. Grigolo might be invited back by either company in the future.
In recent years, Mr. Grigolo has been establishing himself as something modern opera houses desperately need in the post-"Three Tenors" era: an exciting leading man. His strong voice and passionate, sometimes over the top stage presence made him a favorite with fans.
Mr. Grigolo also cultivated a rebellious image -- "The Bad Boy of Opera" was the name of a short film Bruce Weber made about him for Italian Vanity Fair, and he was known to race motorcycles and drive sports cars offstage. "I like to push things to the limit," he told The New York Times in April.
Though some critics accused him of showboating and unfocused singing, especially early in his career, he had been winning more than his share of rave reviews in recent years. Zachary Woolfe described one of his Met performances in The Times in 2017 as "both brazen and intimate" and added that "he may be the most galvanically convincing singer in the world today."
The Royal Opera, whose findings now threaten to derail his career, was also where his international reputation was launched in 2010, when he stepped into a performance of Massenet's "Manon" and won plaudits.
"A great operatic career lies in his sights," Rupert Christiansen wrote in a five-star review of that performance in The Telegraph, "if he keeps his wits about him."

Texto completo: He began posting songs online while in high school. On hits like "Lucid Dreams," he combined melodic hip-hop instincts with heavy-hearted angst.
Juice WRLD, one of a crop of sweet-voiced singing rappers who emerged from the streaming platform SoundCloud in recent years, died on Sunday, the authorities said. He was 21.
The Cook County Medical Examiner's Office in Illinois confirmed the death in a statement.
Identifying the artist by his real name, it said Jarad A. Higgins, of Homewood, Ill., had been pronounced dead at 3:14 a.m. at Advocate Christ Medical Center in Oak Lawn, Ill. The cause of death was not available and an autopsy was to be done, the office said.
The rapper's sharp, catchy songs -- which were often freestyled in only a few takes -- combined the melodic hip-hop instincts of Lil Yachty, Post Malone and XXXTentacion with the heavy-hearted angst and nasal hooks of emo and pop-punk bands like Fall Out Boy and Panic! at the Disco.
"I've always been different," he told The New York Times last year. "I used to try to hide it a little bit, but now I have a platform for being different."
Juice WRLD began posting songs online that he had recorded directly onto his cellphone while in high school in 2015. But it was his debut EP, "9 9 9," that caught the attention of labels after its release in June 2017.
After "All Girls Are the Same," his breakout breakup song -- "All this jealousy and agony that I sit in/I'm a jealous boy, really feel like John Lennon" -- took off on SoundCloud, he was signed to Interscope Records at age 19.
From there, his profile rose quickly with the success of "Lucid Dreams," another belted, distressed lullaby, built around an interpolation of the pillowy guitar in Sting's 1993 hit "Shape of My Heart." (Sting, who owned the majority of the royalties for the Juice WRLD song, called it a "beautiful interpretation that is faithful to the original song's form," while also joking that it would put his grandchildren through college.)
"Lucid Dreams" went on to hit No. 2 on the Billboard singles chart, anointing Juice WRLD as one of the few SoundCloud rappers to break through to the pop mainstream.
His first album, "Goodbye & Good Riddance," was released in 2018 and eventually certified platinum; its follow-up, "Death Race for Love," debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 in March. In between, he released "Wrld on Drugs," a collaborative mixtape with the rapper Future, a stylistic forebear who seemed glad to pass the torch.
Juice WRLD frequently touched on themes of mental health, suffering and mortality in his music.
In June 2018, following the deaths of two of his musical contemporaries, XXXTentacion and Lil Peep, he released a two-track EP online titled "Too Soon," including the song "Legends," in which he sang, "They tell me I'ma be a legend/I don't want that title now/'Cause all the legends seem to die out."
Fellow rappers and collaborators expressed their shock on social media. Chance the Rapper called Juice WRLD "a young legend" on Twitter. Ellie Goulding, who sang with Juice WRLD on the song "Hate Me," wrote, "You had so much further to go, you were just getting started."
Interscope Records said in a statement on Sunday: "Juice made a profound impact on the world in such a short period of time. He was a gentle soul whose creativity knew no bounds."
Jarad A. Higgins was born in Chicago on Dec. 2, 1998. He was raised there largely by a single mother, coming to music through childhood piano lessons and from listening to local rappers like Kanye West and Chief Keef, along with rock acts like Senses Fail, Paramore and even Billy Idol. And while his unique combination of influences made for a decidedly nonregional sound, the rapper would eventually fall directly into Chicago's rap music lineage, with management and career guidance from the local artist Lil Bibby and his brother G-Money.
Throughout his brief career, Juice WRLD would speak openly about his early struggles with substance abuse, including his exposure to prescription pills like Xanax and Percocet as a freshman in high school. Drug use, he said in an interview with No Jumper, "opens doors to feel emotions that you probably wouldn't usually feel," but he added, it "can destroy you -- utterly destroy you."
As his star rose, Juice WRLD said he was trying to take better care of himself. "I smoke weed, and every now and then I slip up and do something that's poor judgment," he told The Times. "I have a lot going for me, I recognize it's a lot of big things, a lot of big looks. I want to be there, and you don't have to overdose to not be there."
In another interview with The Times, he addressed his penchant for morbidity disguised in sugary hooks. "I talk about stuff like that because those are subjects that people are a) too scared to touch on, or b) don't do it the right way where people can learn from your mistakes," he said. "I cherish every mini-second of this life."

Texto completo: A British-born son of publicans, he became a bartender in New York, a saloonkeeper, an author of 18 books and a columnist and commentator.
Gary Regan, who began tending bar in his parents' British pub when he was 14, would go on to help lead this century's craft cocktail revolution in America.
He did it by decoding the art of mixology and by infusing it with an ingredient that's difficult to bottle: an empathetic grin.
"Drinks are not the main reason to tend bar," he said in an interview with Drink magazine last year. "The most important thing a bartender can do is make people smile."
Mr. Regan, who died of pneumonia on Nov. 15 at 68 in a Newburgh, N.Y., hospital, achieved his goal as a bartender, saloonkeeper, columnist, author and mentor, all part of an exuberant lifetime in which work and pleasure were indistinguishable.
"Gary made people feel good," said Amanda Schuster, the editor in chief of the blog "The Alcohol Professor" and the author of "New York Cocktails" (2017).
In his "The Joy of Mixology" (originally published in 2003), he meticulously cataloged cocktails and elaborated his occupation's plusses and minuses without romanticizing or disregarding overindulgence by bartenders or their customers.
He also wrote The Cocktailian, a column for The San Francisco Chronicle; hosted a syndicated radio program with F. Paul Pacult, an expert on liquid spirits, called "The Happy Hour"; and created a Worldwide Bartender Database.
Mr. Regan expanded into the liquor business by developing Regans' Orange Bitters No. 6.
He was a self-proclaimed roustabout who settled into a more serene state of mind after surviving a painful bout with tongue cancer, which he blamed on smoking and drinking, in 2003.
He applied eyeliner as an affectation, supposedly to remind bartenders to look customers in the eye. He moved from New York City to Cornwall-on-Hudson, about 65 miles to the north. He called himself "gaz," a singularly lowercase version of the English diminutive for Gary.
And to speed up service at a bistro in Cognac, France, he put an imprint on his signature cocktail, the Negroni (gin, Campari, sweet vermouth, an orange peel twist), by wielding one of his index fingers as a swizzle stick in a row of the drinks ready for waiting customers. (The retailer Cocktail Kingdom now sells a bar spoon in the life-size shape of his finger, either gold-plated or in stainless steel.)
In "A Proper Drink: The Untold Story of How a Band of Bartenders Saved the Civilized Drinking World" (2016), Robert Simonson characterized Mr. Regan as "a bon vivant eccentric, a devil-may-care libertine as blissfully unconcerned with his reputation as your average aging rock star."
"He is an unlikely authority figure -- more barfly than bar scholar," Mr. Simonson wrote. "But an authority figure he nonetheless is, one of the accepted grand old men of the cocktail resurgence. He achieved this status primarily because he got there first."
Gary Lee Regan was born on Sept. 18, 1951, in Rochdale, a town in Greater Manchester, England, to parents who ran two pubs in nearby towns, the Prince Rupert in Bolton and the Bay Horse in Cleveleys.
After training as a chef at Courtfield Catering College in Blackpool, he ran a bistro with his wife, Norma. They divorced after about two years of marriage, and he moved to New York in 1973, when he was 22.
A friend from Bolton hired Mr. Regan to tend an Upper East Side bar in Manhattan, after which he became manager of the North Star Pub at South Street Seaport. There he was schooled in the fine points of barroom banter by observing a customer, a Scotsman, who would pore over reference books on whiskey over lunch so that he could later impress friends with his knowledge.
"I learned the power of storytelling," Mr. Regan recalled, "and the entertainment value of the liquor and bar businesses."
Rosie Schaap, the author of "Drinking With Men" and the former "Drink" columnist for The New York Times Magazine, said, "What mattered most to him about bar culture was what always should matter most: people."
The conceit of eyeliner, a pen name and his substitution of a finger for a swizzle stick notwithstanding, said David Wondrich, an author and historian of the cocktail, "Gary was the one to remind all the budding mixologists that the fundamental rules of bartending still applied. That the people drinking their creations were guests, not fans. That they were in a service business, not an art one."
Mr. Regan was recruited to write a column for Food Arts -- his second wife, Mardee Haiden Regan, worked there -- after her bosses were impressed with his observations about various single malt whiskies as quoted in an interview in Time magazine in 1990. He went on to publish his first book, "The Bartender's Bible," in 1991.
Together, the couple wrote, among others, "The Book of Bourbon and Other Fine American Whiskeys" (1995), "New Classic Cocktails" (1997), "The Bourbon Companion" (1998) and "The Martini Companion" (1999). Among his other books was "The Negroni: Drinking to La Dolce Vita, with Recipes & Lore" (2013).
His second marriage also ended in divorce. He was married 11 years ago to Amy Gallagher, who confirmed his death. He had no other immediate survivors.
Mr. Regan's "Joy of Mixology" became an indispensable resource for both professional and home-schooled bartenders. Mr. Regan offered history, recipes and, "like Linnaeus," as William Grimes wrote in The New York Times Book Review, "he surveys the teeming, seemingly chaotic population of mixed drinks and imposes order."
Mr. Regan's taxonomy grouped cocktails into families, including Sea Breezes and Cape Codders under New England highballs, and Cosmopolitans and margaritas under sours.
He had a simple reason for moving beyond mixing drinks and diversifying into writing and other ventures. "I wanted not to have to stand behind a bar," he once said.

Texto completo: Working undercover for the illusionist, Mackenberg exposed phony psychics who claimed they could connect people to their dead loved ones.
This article is part of Overlooked, a series of obituaries about remarkable people whose deaths, beginning in 1851, went unreported in The Times.
Spiritualism, the religious movement centered on the belief that the spirit survives earthly death and can communicate with the living, was at its peak in the early 20th century; its most famous advocate was probably Arthur Conan Doyle, the creator of Sherlock Holmes.
With that movement came thousands of phony psychics claiming to be mediums who could connect people with their dead loved ones.
Harry Houdini, the renowned illusionist and escape artist, attended hundreds of séances, trying to communicate with his dead parents, before deciding that many self-described seers were in fact con artists soaking the gullible.
He hinted at having occult powers of his own, but ultimately declared that his stage act was "merely a matter of a sleight of hand," as Christopher Sandford related in his book "Masters of Mystery" (2011).
By 1924, however, Houdini wasn't content with renouncing any claim to having mystical abilities of his own. That year he published "A Magician Among the Spirits," a book in which he debunked some of the effects that mediums produced, like wobbling tables and floating objects. "Whenever any of these alleged spiritual mediums tell you that they have supernatural aid," he told a reporter at the time, "you may safely set them down as frauds."
To expose fake psychics, Houdini employed a small army of undercover agents, calling them "my own secret service." Rose Mackenberg, a private eye, was his foremost operative.
By her count, Mackenberg investigated more than 300 psychics and seers in the two years she worked for Houdini and many more after that. In a career that lasted decades and led her to testify before Congress, she proved to be quick-witted, adept with disguises and unblinkingly skeptical. Speaking to a reporter for the Hearst newspapers in 1949, she boasted, "I smell a rat before I smell the incense."
In 1925, for example, Mackenberg visited Charles Gunsolas, a medium in Indianapolis who had described himself in an irate letter to Houdini as "one of the leaders of Spiritualism" in America.
Pretending to be a bereaved mother, Mackenberg told Gunsolas that her baby had died a few months earlier and that she wanted to check on the infant in the afterlife.
Gunsolas claimed to have contact with an 800-year-old Hindu guide in the spirit world as well as with his own "spirit-wife," as he called her, named Ella. He told Mackenberg that for $ 25 he could teach her to access the afterlife by gazing into a bowl of water. He then said it would be easier for her to make contact with the Hindu guide if she took off her clothes. She declined.
She reported her findings to Houdini, who arrived in Indianapolis six weeks later to give a performance that Gunsolas attended. Houdini confronted him from the stage, telling the audience about Mackenberg's experiences. Gunsolas mumbled from his seat that he, too, abhorred fraud, and fled the theater to jeers and catcalls from the audience.
Mackenberg adopted a variety of disguises for the séances, she explained in a 1929 news article, among them the "rustic schoolteacher," the "credulous servant girl" and the "tipsy consultant." She used pseudonyms like "Allicia Bunck" (a play on "all is a bunk") and Frances Raud or F. Raud (for, of course, "fraud"). Often she claimed to be a grieving mother or a bereft widow.
"I never married," a wry Mackenberg told The St. Louis Post-Dispatch in 1937, "but I have received messages from 1,000 husbands and twice as many children in the world to come. Invariably they told me they were happy where they were, which was not entirely flattering to me."
She was frequently groped and propositioned by flimflam men, but as Kenneth Silverman wrote in his book "Houdini!!!" (1996), she resisted Houdini's suggestion that she carry a gun.
In the line of duty, Mackenberg was ordained by so many Spiritualist churches (always for a fee), that her nickname in the Houdini organization was "the Rev."
Mackenberg's most newsworthy case came in 1926, when Congress was considering a bill to outlaw fortunetelling in Washington. Public hearings became chaotic as people made competing claims on the validity of divination. Houdini, a star witness, shared the results of his investigations into spiritualism, calling mediums "mental degenerates" and cross-examining professional psychics himself.
Mackenberg, for her part, testified about her recent undercover experiences visiting Jane Coates, a notable Washington medium. In an article included in a 2016 anthology about Mackenberg, compiled by Tony Wolf, she recalled, "It was my testimony, brief and pointed, that touched off the rockets and pinwheels and giant crackers of startled emotion when wrathful persons broke in with protestations and shouts of 'That's a lie!' and 'We never did such a thing!"'
Her bombshell: She said that Coates had confided to her that the proposed legislation would never be passed because her customers included four senators and because "table tipping séances are held at the White House with President Coolidge and his family." Coates denied the allegations, The New York Times reported at the time, noting, "Today's session was unusually disorderly and came near winding up in a free-for-all fist fight."
Rose Mackenberg was born on July 10, 1892, in Brooklyn to Lewis and Anna Mackenberg, immigrants from Russia. As a young woman she worked as a stenographer in a law office and as a private detective. When a banker asked her to look into a medium who had advised him to invest in a stock that proved worthless, she consulted Houdini, who was already famous for his crusade against psychic swindlers. He advised her on how to uncover the fraud, and then recruited her to join him.
After Houdini died unexpectedly in 1926 at 52, Mackenberg continued their work, taking on clients that had an interest in combating fraud, including police agencies, insurance companies and Better Business Bureaus. She gave lectures on how to spot a phony psychic and revealed the theatrical tricks she had seen hundreds of fake mediums employ in darkened rooms (hidden harmonicas to produce ghostly noises, for example).
She also wrote numerous newspaper and magazine articles on the topic as well as an unpublished autobiography, "So You Want to Attend a Séance?" A 1949 Hearst syndicate article described her as "perhaps the only woman 'ghost-buster' in the world."
Despite a lifetime exposing charlatans, Mackenberg insisted that she wasn't a nonbeliever in spiritualism and that she was willing to be convinced of the afterlife's existence. She had just never seen any proof of it, she said.
While Mackenberg never imagined an era in which purported psychics trolled social media for personal details about their marks, she continued ghost-busting long enough to spot trends in the spiritualism trade. She said, for instance, that fakers proliferated when the United States was at war because they offered easy solace to an unsteady nation.
Before Mackenberg died, on April 10, 1968, at 75, she lived for decades in an apartment at 310 West 24th Street in Manhattan. She kept it well lit because, after years of attending séances, as she told the Hearst syndicate in 1949, "I get tired of dark rooms."

Texto completo: MIAMI – La policía investiga este sábado si el saudí que mató a tres personas la víspera, en un tiroteo en una base militar de Florida donde recibía formación, actuó solo o contó con cómplices.
“Vamos a esclarecer esto”, afirmó el presidente Donald Trump, desde los jardines de la Casa Blanca. “Intentamos averiguar qué pasó, si se trata de una persona o de varias”.

— FBI Jacksonville (@FBIJacksonville) December 7, 2019
Según el diario The New York Times, que cita a una fuente anónima, seis ciudadanos saudíes fueron interrogados en el lugar del ataque, entre ellos dos que habían lo filmado.
El periódico añade que el tirador había enseñado videos de tiroteos masivos durante una fiesta celebrada el jueves por la noche, según una fuente conocedora de la investigación.
“Los motivos del tirador todavía se desconocen”, indicó en Twitter la oficina de Jacksonville de la policía federal estadounidense (FBI), que investiga el caso junto con una unidad especializada en antiterrorismo.
Un miembro del Ejército del Aire saudí mató a tres personas e hirió a siete el viernes cuando abrió fuego con un arma corta en una sala de clase de la base de Pensacola, antes de que la policía lo abatiera.
Antes de su ataque había tuiteado mensajes hostiles hacia Estados Unidos, informó el grupo de vigilancia de movimientos yihadistas SITE.
“Estoy contra el mal, y Estados Unidos se convirtió en su conjunto en nación del mal”, escribió el asaltante, que SITE identificó como Mohamed al Shamrani.
Según medios estadounidenses, los investigadores tratan de comprobar si el autor del ataque publicó realmente aquellos mensajes, en los que se citaba al saudí Osama bin Laden, exdirigente del grupo yihadista Al Qaida muerto a manos de militares estadounidenses en 2011.
Quince de los 19 pilotos que desviaron aviones y provocaron la muerte de unas 3,000 personas en los atentados del 11 de septiembre de 2001 en Estados Unidos eran saudíes.
Tras condenar ese tiroteo “atroz”, Riad intentó el sábado distanciarse de su ciudadano.
“Como muchos miembros del Ejército saudita, he sido formado en una base militar estadounidense y nos hemos beneficiado de ese entrenamiento (…) para combatir el terrorismo y otras amenazas, junto a nuestro aliados estadounidenses”, afirmó el sábado en Twitter el viceministro de Defensa, el príncipe Jaled bin Salmán.
Trump, que habló por teléfono con el rey Salmán sobre lo ocurrido, afirmó este sábado que los dirigentes saudíes estaban “muy afectados” por los hechos de la víspera.
“Creo que [los saudíes] ayudarán mucho a las familias”, dijo el presidente estadounidense.
El gobernador de Florida Ron DeSantis sugirió el viernes que el reino saudí debería ofrecer una indemnización a las víctimas.
“Obviamente, el gobierno de Arabia Saudita necesita aliviar a estas víctimas. Y pienso que tendrán una deuda aquí puesto que [el atacante] es uno de sus ciudadanos”, dijo.

Texto completo: La llegada de Donald Trump a la Casa Blanca y su discurso en contra de la inmigración impulsó a quienes habían sido sus empleados a denunciar públicamente a su antiguo jefe . El mismo Trump que criticaba a los extranjeros que llegaban a Estados Unidos por supuestamente robar el trabajo a los nacionales o que generalizaba apuntándoles como criminales, se había aprovechado en sus propiedades de la inmigración indocumentada .
Durante el año pasado, el Washington Post habló con 48 personas que habían trabajado para Trump sin tener permiso de trabajo . La ahora primera familia había usado los servicios de esta gente en 11 instalaciones de Florida, Nueva Jersey, Nueva York y Virginia. Estos trabajadores habían pasado años -algunos incluso dos décadas- manteniendo limpios los resorts Trump y alimentando a sus invitados.
La mayoría de estos empleados indocumentados perdieron su trabajo o lo abandonaron después de que se hiciera público el escándalo laboral que los salpicaba . Sin embargo, la organización Trump -aún propiedad del presidente aunque dirigida por su hijo mayor-, asegura que no sabía si los inmigrantes tenían permiso para trabajar o no. Por su parte, la Casa Blanca desprestigió las investigaciones del diario llamándolas “basura de tabloide”.
Margarita Cruz, una de las limpiadoras de la familia presidencial, dijo que Trump preguntaba a cada inmigrante que trabajaba para él su nombre, cuánto tiempo llevaba en el lugar y si le gustaba. Tras la pequeña conversación, Trump les daba un billete de $50 o $100 dólares.
El miedo se extendió entre el personal de la organización Trump cuando su jefe llegó a la presidencia hasta que un día, Sandra Díaz y Victorina Morales -ambas en algún momento limpiadoras en Bedminster- decidieron hacerse visibles y hablaron con the Post, The New York Times y otras publicaciones. Lo hicieron, según ellas mismas explicaron, para sacar a la luz la hipocresía del presidente .
Un año después de estos contactos con la prensa, Díaz y Morales ya no trabajan para Trump y las denuncias no han tenido repercusión legal para organización Trump . Tampoco se conoce ningún caso de deportación derivado de lo que revelaron las mujeres pero, aún así, amigos y colegas las han tachado de traidoras por poner sobre la mesa un tema que afecta a la economía sumergida de EEUU. Aún así, ellas insisten en que valió la pena.

Texto completo: This year's awards season chatter includes four words that might sound strange together:
Adam Sandler, Oscar nominee.
His unexpectedly searing performance as a gambling addict in the dramatic thriller "Uncut Gems" (opening Friday, Dec. 13 in Manhattan; Dec. 25, wide) could put Sandler in the running when the Academy Awards are handed out in February. Granted, this year is shaping up as a highly competitive one for the best actor race, making Sandler far from a shoo-in. But for an actor known mostly for lowbrow comedies ("Happy Gilmore," "Jack and Jill") and a multimillion-dollar, eight-film deal with Netflix that has produced more of the same ("The Ridiculous 6"), the fact that he's being mentioned in the same breath as Oscar is a remarkable development. And this isn't just media hype: On Tuesday, the National Board of Review named Sandler the best actor of the year.
"He's really great in this movie, playing a role against type of what we've come to expect," says Pete Hammond, awards columnist and chief film critic for Deadline. "I would say he's very deserving."
spGARN191204_video
Sandler has a history of making dramatic films with well-established directors: Paul Thomas Anderson for "Punch Drunk Love" in 2002, James L. Brooks for "Spanglish" in 2004, Noah Baumbach for "The Meyerowitz Stories (New and Selected)" in 2017. Josh and Bennie Safdie, the writing-directing brothers behind "Uncut Gems," are known mostly on the art-house circuit, where they've earned critical acclaim for the drug-addiction drama "Heaven Knows What" and the heist film "Good Time," starring Robert Pattinson. The Safdies sent an early script of "Uncut Gems" to Sandler's team in 2012 but were turned down; it was "Good Time," released in 2017, that convinced Sandler to work with them.
Sandler plays Howard Ratner, a shady jewelry dealer in Manhattan's Diamond District who seems to thrive on chaos, stress and the adrenaline rush of the long-shot bet. Ratner is in some ways a Sandler-esque role - a combination of boyish charm and masculine rage - but he can also be vulnerable, even helpless. The Safdies have said Ratner was inspired by their father's stories of working in the Diamond District. (The siblings' tangential connection to Long Island - their mother was raised there - also informs the movie. They constructed the set of Ratner's shop at Gold Coast Studios in Bethpage; Ratner's wife is played by Long Islander Idina Menzel; and one of the film's odder characters, an unnamed bag-man with a deep tan and a toothy smile, is played by Oceanside-raised fashion designer Wayne Diamond.
"It's such a frenetic, tireless, tense performance - it mirrors the energy of the movie," Kevin Polowy, a Yahoo Entertainment correspondent and longtime contributor to the awards-race website GoldDerby, says of Sandler. Polowy is one of a handful of experts at GoldDerby who recently predicted Sandler would become a best actor nominee. "His character shouldn't be likeable, he doesn't have any redeeming qualities to speak of - but you can't help but root for the guy," Polowy says. "And I think that stems from Sandler's utterly desperate performance."
"Uncut Gems" has drawn Sandler out of his comfort zone not only as a performer but as a public figure. Sandler recently gave a rare interview to The New York Times Magazine and has been supporting his movie with in-person appearances at such festivals as Telluride, Toronto and - perhaps most surprising - the highbrow New York Film Festival. In short, Sandler appears to be on the campaign trail.
It's a long way from the publicity circuit to the gold statuette, however, and there are major obstacles in between. Hammond at Deadline points out that "Uncut Gems" arrives in theaters late in the year, giving Oscar voters little time to see it before submitting their nomination ballots Jan. 7. Sandler could also get a boost from the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, which will announce the nominees for the Golden Globes on Dec.  9. (After first classifying "Uncut Gems" as a comedy, the HFPA reversed its decision earlier this week and placed the film in the dramatic category competition.) One place Sandler might find some awards-season traction is from critics' groups, though they're not normally his biggest supporters.
All of which doesn't even factor in Sandler's potential competition, a roster of such heavyweights as Robert De Niro in "The Irishman," Joaquin Phoenix in "Joker," and both Christian Bale and Matt Damon in "Ford v Ferrari." Adam Driver, in "Marriage Story," also seems a likely nominee. And if there is a wild-card spot in the best actor race, it could go to Eddie Murphy, who earned rave reviews in his Netflix biopic "Dolemite Is My Name."
Ultimately, Sandler's Oscar chances will be in the hands of his fellow actors who vote in the acting categories, according to Hammond.
"When you see him do this role, Howard Ratner is an insane kind of part," Hammond says. "The actors watching this, they're going to be the most receptive to what he does to pull this off." 
WHO IS THAT GUY? Of the many interesting actors you'll see in the Safdie brothers' new crime drama "Uncut Gems," which stars Adam Sandler, professional basketball player Kevin Garnett and the rapper The Weeknd, one is likely to stand out: Oceanside's Wayne Diamond, making his feature-film debut. Playing an unnamed bag-man who helps a young woman (Julia Fox) carry money out of the Mohegan Sun casino, Diamond cuts quite a figure - a swaggering older fellow with a Florida tan, feathered hair and a schmoozer's smile. Appearing out of nowhere near the film's end, Diamond is likely to prompt viewers to ask: Who is that guy? The question isn't easy to answer, partly because there's little information available on Diamond and partly because he's difficult to pin down in conversation. Asked how old he was during a recent phone interview, Diamond responded with the two-word equivalent of a middle finger - then gave a hearty, hoarse laugh. "I'm a kid! I always wanted to be a kid, and I never wanted to get old," Diamond said. "I look good, that's all that matters." Here's what could be pieced together from Diamond's ping-ponging talk. He is Jewish, grew up middle-class and attended Oceanside High School, where his father taught accounting. After graduation he worked in Manhattan's garment industry and eventually formed his own clothing line, Diamonds Run, which rode the trends of the disco-driven 1970s and the puffy-shouldered 1980s. (You can still find his dresses at the vintage site Etsy.) According to Diamond, his jumpsuits were the talk of the town. "I made hundreds of jumpsuits, different styles," he said. "I was a designer, it was really fun. But in my heart, I really wanted to be an actor." After selling his business in 2001 and retiring with a $110 million nest egg, Diamond lived in Old Westbury for a time and went through a listless period. While drinking at The Spotted Pig in Manhattan one evening, Diamond struck up a conversation with a young director named Josh Safdie, who enjoyed his colorful stories and jokes. They kept in touch. Eventually, Josh and his brother, Bennie, found a role for Diamond in "Uncut Gems." "I still go to school for acting. I want to get a real part, a serious part," Diamond said. "I like Shakespeare, the Russian artists, that stuff." He added, "I'd like to do some real stuff. Something to show that I have talent."

Texto completo: "For Simon, toxic negativity wasn't a tool for reviewing an art form; it was the art form."
Thus did Variety remember the late theater critic John Simon, who died last month at the age of 94. This summation is worthy of the man's urn. The famously vicious pundit is not remembered for his love of theater or superior artistic standards so much as his talent, and evident delight, in personal cruelty.
Wielding a brilliant command of English (which was not even his native language), Simon rarely passed up an opportunity to disparage artists' talent and mock their bodies. He once wrote an essay on the virtue of booing plays.
The late Sylvia Miles dumped a plate of food on his head after he carved her up in print. Like a good legend, the meal varies with the storyteller: Sometimes it is pasta, lasagna, soup or salad; since I live in New Mexico, I will say it was a bowl of menudo.
Simon posed as the unapologetic snob, decrying the complacency of audiences and eroding expectations of the art. Yet it was often plain that cruelty was his real point.
The playwright Edward Albee once wrote that Simon's opprobrium "has been a source of comfort to me over the years." Getting smacked by Simon in New York magazine, where he wrote for 37 years, became something of a rite of passage in the higher echelon of New York theater.
Truth be told, there is a degree of sadomasochism in the theater, where young performers earnestly struggle through a gauntlet of teachers who may ridicule or torment them. Many imagine this treatment reflects high expectations and prepares one for the criticism and disappointment that awaits the professional artist, rather than simple psychological abuse.
There can be some wicked fun in reading a "killer" review, and when professional theaters charge high prices for shows that are poorly conceived and executed, a skillful takedown on behalf of the public may be warranted.
Simon said criticism needed humor. The problem comes when the critic "punches down," targeting artists trying to climb up. Even the long-feared, exacting New York Times book critic Michiko Kakutani boosted authors she estimated highly. The tough critic must exalt something, even in absentia, lest they become mere barking dogs, lifting their leg to the world.
In Providence, where I began my acting career, the local theater critic was one William Gale. Before turning his attention to local stages, Gale wrote restaurant reviews; and some felt that when it came to theater, he knew a lot about food. He was certainly less learned than, say, John Simon.
Nonetheless, Gale knew the audience he was addressing: the non-expert, the general consumer of arts and entertainment looking for a worthwhile outing. Gale served them faithfully.
He was never cruel, and he rarely wrote killer reviews. However, I performed in a show that elicited one of his worst pans ever.
The script was an original work by a playwright associated with the renowned Wooster Group in New York City. To be honest, it was a rough draft, a work that held kernels of brilliance but was, on the whole, a mess. A wildly funny mess, at least.
Gale recognized the sloppiness behind our "experimental" production and so he spanked us with a review that suggested he had consulted a thesaurus, researching new words with which to pummel the production and our uneven performances.
It was such a thorough lashing, the community grew curious and our ticket sales improved. We hung the bad review near the theater entrance in defiance, but we also heard his point. In that sense the negative review was ultimately constructive, seeking to build rather than destroy.

Bears heating up, need help to boost playoff hopes

Texto completo: In the hunt isn't where the Bears wanted to be entering their idle Sunday in Week 14. But it sure beats being out of the hunt, which is where they were in early November before winning four of their last five games.
So here they are, at 7-6 and clinging to faint playoff hopes after their 31-24 victory Thursday against the Cowboys. They insist they're focused only on next Sunday's game against the Packers at Lambeau Field.
For what it's worth, the New York Times' NFL playoff calculator handicaps the Bears' playoff chances at 5%. But you don't need that to understand how their place in the NFC standings (eighth) and the remaining schedule for every team probably means they won't be playing in January.
That said, the Bears can't be eliminated in Week 14. Their best chance of making the playoffs -- albeit a long shot -- is to catch the Vikings for the sixth seed (and second wild-card berth).
The Vikings (8-4) lead the Bears by 1 1/2 games entering their home game Sunday against the Lions. The Vikings' magic number to finish ahead of the Bears is 3 -- meaning any combination of Vikings wins and Bears losses that totals three will ensure the Vikings place ahead of the Bears. So at this stage, Bears fans should be rooting hard against the Vikings. And the Rams (7-5), who are seeded seventh and have a head-to-head tiebreaker over them.

Playoff picture
NFC standings
(Top two seeds get first-round byes; division winners are top-four seeds; seeds 5 and 6 are the wild-card teams)
1. Saints (10-2) vs. 49ers
2. Seahawks (10-2) at Rams
3. Packers (9-3) vs. Redskins
4. Cowboys (6-7) lost to Bears on Thursday
5. 49ers (10-2) at Saints
6. Vikings (8-4) vs. Lions
7. Rams (7-5) vs. Seahawks
8. Bears (7-6) beat Cowboys on Thursday
9. Buccaneers (5-7) vs. Colts
10. Eagles (5-7) vs. Giants, Monday

Scoreboard watching
Lions at Vikings, noon Sunday: Again, the Bears' best path to the playoffs goes past the Vikings, so the Vikings need to lose. But they're 5-0 at home this season and 13-point favorites against the Lions team the Bears beat twice in November.
Redskins at Packers, noon Sunday: The Packers haven't clinched the NFC North. They also haven't eliminated the Bears from winning the division. A win Sunday wouldn't even accomplish that. But if they're going to collapse, losing at home to the Redskins as 12 1/2-point favorites would be the way to start.
Seahawks at Rams, 7:20 p.m. Sunday: The Rams lead the Bears by a half-game and have secured the tiebreaker because of their head-to-head win Nov. 17. So the Bears have to make up 1 1/2 games in the standings to qualify for the playoffs.
Giants at Eagles, 7:15 p.m. Monday: The Eagles have their eyes on winning the NFC East, which seems to be easier than catching the Vikings in the wild-card race.

Football Pioneers Deserve to Retire With Dignity

Texto completo: While the league makes billions, many retired players are living on shockingly low pensions.
Turn on any N.F.L. game on Sunday, and you'll see the league celebrating its 100th season. Thunderous video montages and "Top 10 Tight Ends" specials will exalt football's history with one clear, though unspoken, message: The appeal and profitability of today's N.F.L. derives as much from its past as its present.
What the highlights won't show, however, is how many of the actual human beings in those grainy films -- rank-and-file players from the 1960s, '70s and '80s who helped make the league the $ 15 billion business it is today -- are now, in old age, struggling to make ends meet. The reason is not that their salaries were in the thousands rather than the millions. It's that their pensions from the league are shockingly, immorally, low.
Most N.F.L. players who retired before 1993 receive a pension of about $ 365 a month per season they played, meaning that the typical seven-year player gets about $ 2,500 a month. Thousands get considerably less, and have stories you won't see on network broadcasts.
One star of those New York Jets' Super Bowl team videos now lives in a trailer; unable to afford a dentist, he barely has any teeth. A standout lineman from the storied 1970s Minnesota Vikings played 17 years and gets just $ 2,300 a month (he took some of his pension early). That's not enough to cover his football-related medical bills, leaving him and his wife living check to check. There are countless more like them.
Now, I am not one of these players. I was fortunate to have second careers, in marketing for PepsiCo and as an actor. But I know too many of these men and their families. They need a voice, one that can be heard over the highlights.
This situation is easily fixed. The N.F.L. and the players union are negotiating a labor agreement that will ultimately split up more than $ 100 billion -- perhaps even $ 200 billion -- in revenue. The money for dignified pensions is there. In fact, according to Fairness for Athletes in Retirement, an advocacy group, less than 1 percent of the revenue from each side, the players' union and the league, would more than double the current pension for every pre-1993 player for the rest of their lives.
The question is whether the league and players want to step up for the men on whose knees, shoulders and brains the N.F.L. was built.
Team owners should understand the urgency. They see old players (many of whom they cheered in childhood) on canes at fund-raising events or in wheelchairs at Hall of Fame ceremonies. They know that films about the league's history and the heavily sponsored 100th-season specials will make a fortune for the teams. And they also know that almost none of the players featured in those videos will get a dime of it. Today's paltry pensions are the last vestige of the one-sided labor rules in the league before 1993.
The N.F.L. commissioner, Roger Goodell, has said, "Nothing the league can do can ever fully express our appreciation to the players who helped build our league." I believe he is sincere, but real appreciation would be an appropriate pension.
Current players need more education about the history of their profession. They don't understand that their seven- and eight-figure salaries exist only because players from the 1960s, '70s and '80s -- who are now in their 60s, 70s and 80s themselves -- risked and even sacrificed their careers to fight for basic employment rights that are now taken for granted.
Players of my generation and those who came after me fought to be represented by an agent, to get an independent medical opinion on injuries and to receive severance pay. They had no 401(k) plans or the annuity plans that today give players a total of $ 2 million as a retirement safety net.
Thousands of players went on strike in 1982 and 1987 to pursue and, eventually, win free agency for future generations of players. Yet today, the sole retirement benefit for these pioneers is a pension check that is less than what today's average player makes per snap.
In football terms, today's players should remember their blockers. As a running back, I know that you get only as far as the men who take punishment and remove obstacles for you to run. The nameless linemen in highlight reels didn't block for just me and long-ago stars like Franco Harris and Walter Payton. They blocked for current players, too.
The National Basketball Association understands this. The N.B.A. has pensions that are three times the N.F.L.'s, and in 2017 the N.B.A. and its players agreed that every player, whether from 1966, 2006 or 2019, would receive the same pension amount -- and free health insurance for life.
Chris Paul, the Oklahoma City Thunder point guard who is president of the basketball players' union, put it this way: "The game has never before been more popular, and all the players in our league today recognize that we're only in this position because of the hard work and dedication of the men who came before us. It's important that we take care of our entire extended N.B.A. family."
Professional football is a wonderful sport, and I hope it's around forever. But the men who built it will not be. About 100 die every year, and many of them are struggling because their primary employer, one that is now awash in cash, chooses to give them barely any pension.
When you watch the 100th-season highlight packages, look for those blockers. The players may be remembered. But the men are forgotten.

Texto completo: Dr. Jen Gunter has two New York Times columns dedicated to women's health, a Canadian docuseries called "Jensplaining" and a very active social media presence where she disseminates medical fallacies in a way that the general public can understand. Her latest project is the book "The Vagina Bible: The Vulva and the Vagina: Separating the Myth from the Medicine" (Citadel, $18.95) - a Publishers Weekly and New York Times bestseller.
Born and raised in Winnipeg, Canada, the obstetrician and gynecologist resides with her sons in Northern California. An edited version of our conversation follows.

Q: You're famous for all the information you share about women's health, but let's be real. Your shoe collection is famous too. Where do you buy them?
A: (Laughs) Oh yeah, I have a thing for shoes. I wear a lot of Fluevogs. These are the shoes I purchase the most because they're so comfortable. I have a huge shoe cabinet in my bedroom where I display my most beautiful shoes like artwork. I grew up with size 10 1/2 feet and no stores carried bigger than a 10. My whole life I wore shoes that were too small and painful or just really ugly, so I think that's why shoes are such a thing for me.

Q: You do a lot of writing that you share with the public. Do you write when you're on the road?
A: I actually do. I don't use public Wi-Fi ever, especially in places like airports. So I write a lot on planes and at airports, because I won't be distracted by being online. I can usually sit somewhere and tune everything out. I recently flew to Chicago and worked three hours solid on the way there and back. Writing makes the trip go faster.

Q: What was the first trip you took as a child?
A: My parents emigrated from England and we went back there every few years. The first trip I remember would've been around kindergarten time. It was such a big deal to fly in the early '70s. You dressed up and had to behave. The flight attendants gave you things like wings and little books for kids to fill out.

Q: Given the choice, would you eat at a street cart or fine restaurant?
A: There are people who have street carts who are making amazing food, but I like the experience of going in and sitting down to a great meal and I want my kids to have that experience. I cook at home mostly and we only go out to eat every four or five months, but when we do, it's to a really nice place like a Michelin-starred restaurant as a treat.

Q: Where are your favorite weekend getaways?
A: We don't really go away for the weekends. My kids do, because they'll do that with their dad. But when they travel with me, it's usually on longer trips to see family in Canada or England. But once we get there, we will take overnight trips to another city. It's so much fun as a tourist to take the train.

Q: What would be your dream trip?
A: I'm desperate to go to Greece. I grew up obsessed with Greek mythology. I want to see the Parthenon and Acropolis and all the things I had read about. I also love Greek food!

Q: What are some of your favorite cities?
A: I love Cardiff in Wales. Welsh people are so awesome, but I'm kind of biased because my dad's family is originally from Wales. It's cool to have a castle right in the city that you can walk right up to. It's not crowded or crazy. They have a beautiful art museum in Cardiff and you walk in and there's no crowd.
I also like New York. When I took my kids the first time, they were unprepared for the volume of people on the street. They were a little freaked out. They'd been to Toronto and London, but London's not as dense as New York. It's a big city, but everybody's so nice and the food is great.

Texto completo: A new study answers the question, but also shows that things have been improving.
There are at least 80,000 dogs registered in New York City in a given year, according to the New York Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, which estimates the total canine population at about 500,000. With so many pooches using the city's streets as a toilet, it's surprising that we aren't stepping in their unpleasant remains more often.
In fact, the number of dog-poop complaints received by the city's 311 hotline has been falling in recent years, according to a new study by RentHop, from 3,412 complaints in 2010 to 2,180 in 2018 -- a 36 percent reduction. Despite small annual increases in 2015 and 2017, the trajectory has been downward, and 2019 has been no exception. Between Jan. 1 and Nov. 5, there were only 1,714 complaints, about 18 percent fewer than during the same period a year earlier.
Sometimes, the question is not where the poop is, but when. The study, based on 311 data going back to 2014, showed that Wednesdays had the most complaints and that weekends had the fewest. The most complaints came in February and March, while November had the fewest.
And where are the most treacherous sidewalks today? RentHop found that the Bronx has had the most canine violation complaints per capita thus far in 2019, with about 10 complaints per 10,000 households, and Manhattan has had the fewest, with about three per 10,000. RentHop's researchers provided The New York Times with an expansion of their study, showing the 20 neighborhoods with the most dog-poop complaints per 10,000 households between Jan. 1 and Nov. 5, 2019, as seen in this week's chart.

'Free College for All' Is an Experiment That Has Already Failed

Texto completo: The progressive Democratic presidential candidates mean well when they say they want to make a college education an entitlement. They believe that nothing but good can result from giving children from low-income families the opportunity to attend college.
But they are mistaken. When students realize that they will get into college no matter what they learn in grade school or high school, they will have no incentive to forgo activities that are more fun than attending school, listening to teachers, and doing homework.
As Albert Shanker, the late president of the American Federation of Teachers, wrote in 1993, "Kids are just like adults: they will work to get what they want. If they know they have to work hard, listen in class, and come to school every day with their homework done to get into college, they'll do that. If they know they can get by with less and still get into college, that is what they'll do."
New York's City College was once known as "the Harvard of the proletariat." As the flagship college of the City University of New York, it charged no tuition but admitted only applicants who scored well on an academically difficult test. After African-American and Puerto Rican protesters chained shut the gates of the college in 1969 to call attention to the relatively low numbers of minority students, in 1970 City College adopted a policy of "open admissions" and began accepting underprepared students.
Remedial education was to be the solution. By 1978 the New York Times reported that "two out of three students entering City College now require remedial work in writing, mathematics or reading, and one in five needs it in all three."
Twenty-two years after open-admissions experiment started, liberal journalist James Traub spent 18 months observing how it worked. He interviewed hundreds of City College students and attended classes. On the first day of a remedial course in basic skills, Mr. Traub saw Prof. Rudi Gedamke show students a headline from the student newspaper: "Student Turnout Nil at Games."
Mr. Gedamke asked the students what the headline meant. One student wrote: "He/she is not good for nothing." Other tries, all quoted verbatim, included: "Students spend most of their studies time as their leisure times" and "Students are getting addicted toward it." "Students act uncivilized at games" or "Students turnout facinate at games." There was only one answer Mr. Gedamke deemed correct: "No one didn't go."
Mr. Traub's 1994 book, "City on a Hill," revealed students with academic handicaps too severe to be repaired by their efforts or the efforts of their teachers. His anecdotal accounts were confirmed by statistics. A City College study of 155 students placed in its remedial English program found, Mr. Traub reported, that only seven had graduated after six years, and another half-dozen or so after seven years. Only 15% were projected to complete college after a decade. They weren't flunked out; they gave up and dropped out.
In 1998 the City University's board of trustees voted to end the open-admissions policy at four-year colleges, requiring applicants to pass proficiency tests in reading, writing and mathematics to gain entry. The experiment had revealed the limits of good intentions and remedial education alike.
National studies show that the worse the academic preparation of admitted students, the lower the college graduation rate. Syracuse University's Vincent Tinto, an expert on student attrition, reported in 1993 that colleges with an average SAT score of 1100 or higher have a first-year attrition rate of 8%. For colleges with an average SAT score of 700 or below, the first-year attrition rate is 45.5%.
For a student to understand what college teachers are teaching, he needs to have developed, grade by grade, a working vocabulary of several thousand words. Mr. Gedamke's students couldn't keep up.
Democrats offering "free college for all" fail to realize that college is too late for students with severe academic deficiencies. For many of these students, the problem isn't that they can't afford college; it's that they didn't have sufficient academic commitment in the lower grades to get ready for college. To become ready, they would need new childhoods to replace the ones they had. Even generous taxpayers can't give them that.

Race Informed Arrests On Trains, Officers Say

Texto completo: Multiple police officers in Brooklyn say they were told by a commander that white and Asian people should be left alone.
At a police station tucked into an end-of-the-line subway terminal in South Brooklyn, the new commander instructed officers to think of white and Asian people as "soft targets" and urged them to instead go after blacks and Latinos for minor offenses like jumping the turnstile, a half-dozen officers said in sworn statements.
"You are stopping too many Russian and Chinese," one of the officers, Daniel Perez, recalled the commander telling him earlier this decade.
Another officer, Aaron Diaz, recalled the same commander saying in 2012, "You should write more black and Hispanic people."
The sworn statements, gathered in the last few months as part of a discrimination lawsuit, deal with a period between 2011 and 2015. But they are now emerging publicly at a time when policing in the subway has become a contentious issue, sparking protests over a crackdown on fare evasion and other low-level offenses.
The commander, Constantin Tsachas, was in charge of more than 100 officers who patrolled a swath of the subway system in Brooklyn, his first major command. Since then, he has been promoted to the second-in-command of policing the subway system throughout Brooklyn. Along the way, more than half a dozen subordinates claim, he gave them explicit directives about whom to arrest based on race.
Those subordinates recently came forward, many for the first time, providing signed affidavits to support a discrimination lawsuit brought by four black and Hispanic police officers.
The officers claim they faced retaliation from the New York Police Department because they objected to what they said was a longstanding quota system for arrests and tickets, which they argued mainly affected black and Hispanic New Yorkers.
The authorities have deployed hundreds of additional officers to the subways, provoking a debate about overpolicing and the criminalization of poverty. Videos of arrests of young black men and of a woman selling churros in the subway system have gone viral in recent weeks. Demonstrators have taken to the subway system and jumped turnstiles in protest.
Six officers said in their affidavits that Mr. Tsachas, now a deputy inspector, pressured them to enforce low-level violations against black and Hispanic people, while discouraging them from doing the same to white or Asian people.
Inspector Tsachas declined to comment when reached by telephone this week, but his union representative said the inspector denied the allegations of misconduct. The Police Department also declined to address the allegations.
The department has said in the past that its enforcement of fare evasion is not aimed at black and Hispanic people.
More than three years ago, when Inspector Tsachas was promoted to his current rank, the police commissioner at the time, William J. Bratton, said that allegations Inspector Tsachas pushed quotas were false.
"I have full faith and support in him," Mr. Bratton said. He added that Inspector Tsachas had "the requisite skills and comes highly recommended."
Most of the people arrested on charges of fare evasion in New York are black or Hispanic, according to data the Police Department has been required to report under local law since 2017.
Between October 2017 and June 2019, black and Hispanic people, who account for slightly more than half the population in New York City, made up nearly 73 percent of those who got a ticket for fare evasion and whose race was recorded. They also made up more than 90 percent of those who were arrested, rather than given a ticket.
Some elected officials have complained about the apparent racial disparity in arrests, saying it may indicate bias on the part of officers or an unofficial policy of racial profiling by the police.
"The focus of black and brown people, even if other people were doing the same crime, points to what many of us have been saying for a while," the city's public advocate, Jumaane Williams, said in an interview. "The same actions lead to different results, unfortunately, depending on where you live and an overlay of what you look like."
Enforcement has surged nearly 50 percent in 2019, as city police officers issued 22,000 more tickets for fare evasion this year compared to 2018, according to Police Department data from November 10.
While the affidavits focus on a time period that ended nearly five years ago, they suggest at least one police commander openly pushed racial profiling when making arrests in the subway.
"I got tired of hunting Black and Hispanic people because of arrest quotas," one former officer, Christopher LaForce, said in his affidavit, explaining his decision to retire in 2015.
In the affidavits, the officers said that different enforcement standards applied to different stations across Transit District 34, which spanned stations across South Brooklyn: Brooklyn's Chinatown in Sunset Park; neighborhoods with large Orthodox Jewish communities; a corner of Flatbush that is home to many Caribbean immigrants; and the Russian enclave around Brighton Beach.
"Tsachas would get angry if you tried to patrol subway stations in predominately white or Asian neighborhoods" Mr. LaForce said in his affidavit. He added that the commander would redirect officers to stations in neighborhoods with larger black and Hispanic populations.
Mr. Diaz, who retired from the Police Department last year, described in his affidavit how on one occasion then-Captain Tsachas seemed irritated at him for having stopped several Asian people for fare evasion and told him he should be issuing tickets to "more black and Hispanic people."
At the time, Officer Diaz said, he was assigned to the N Line, which passes through neighborhoods with large numbers of Chinese-Americans. He had arrested multiple residents of that neighborhoods for doubling up as they went through the turnstiles, according to his affidavit.
Other officers described similar experiences. Some of the officers claimed in affidavits that Inspector Tsachas urged his officers to come up with reasons to stop black men, especially those with tattoos, and check them for warrants.
Of the six officers, all but one is retired. They are all black or Hispanic. The affidavits were given to The New York Times by one of the four officers who has sued the Police Department, Lt. Edwin Raymond.
The allegations in the affidavits were bolstered by a police union official, Corey Grable, who gave a deposition in June in the same lawsuit that recounted his interactions with Inspector Tsachas. He recalled Inspector Tsachas had once complained about a subordinate who Inspector Tsachas said seemed to go for "soft targets."
Unsure what that meant, Officer Grable asked if the officer was ticketing old ladies for minor offenses? Inspector Tsachas responded: "No, Asian."
Officer Grable, who is black, asked, "Would you have been more comfortable if these guys were black or Hispanic?"
"Yes," Inspector Tsachas replied, according to Officer Grable's recollection.
Inspector Tsachas joined the Police Department in 2001 and patrolled public housing developments in Harlem for five years. He later analyzed crime patterns in Queens and across the city before being transferred to the Transit Bureau. He was a captain in 2011 when he was appointed to command Brooklyn's District 34, a position he held for at least four years.
In 2015, he took command of neighboring Transit District 32, where Lieutenant Raymond, who is currently suing him, worked. At the time Mr. Raymond held the rank of police officer.
Lieutenant Raymond has charged in the lawsuit that Inspector Tsachas blocked his promotion by giving him a low evaluation as punishment for not making enough arrests.
Lieutenant Raymond, who is now a patrol supervisor in Brooklyn, recorded a conversation in October 2015 in which Inspector Tsachas encouraged him to arrest more people and gave an example of the sort of arrest he did not want: a 42-year-old Asian woman with no identification arrested on a charge of fare beating.
"That's not going to fly," he said, according to the recording, first described in a New York Times Magazine article.
Lieutenant Raymond, who still had the rank of police officer at the time, responded that it was unconstitutional to consider race when deciding whom to arrest. Inspector Tsachas, a captain at the time, then apologized, saying the comment "didn't come out the way it's supposed to."
Lieutenant Raymond said he believed Inspector Tsachas should not have been promoted. "It's a spit in the face of communities of color that this man is given more power after being exposed as a bigot," he said.

Texto completo: Yet, if you look again, you find a durable past that may just save us yet.
We're a hot mess, this bad-tempered country of ours. More than 40 percent of Republicans are slouching toward full-blown autocracy, favorably disposed, in one poll, toward a presidency unfettered by constitutional checks and balances. An even greater percentage of the party of Lincoln thinks Donald Trump is a better president than Lincoln.
At the other extreme are those who look out across the fruited plain and see only silos of identity -- of race, gender, faith and class -- alongside bushels of guilt. It's shame, shame, shame all the time. Wave a flag at your peril. The founders were not Woke. Cancel them.
There's no relief from the exhaustion of our national crackup. Even without impeachment, the holidays are a bracket of culture wars, the muted expressions of cheer loaded with political subterfuge. Taking in this eagle with a broken wing, some of our best historians now wonder if any kind of shared national narrative is possible in a nation where so many feel estranged in a strange land.
Yet, if you look again -- through obfuscations foreign and domestic, beyond the noise of the social media mob -- you find a durable past that may just save us yet. The big story of the American experiment, a nation that is not an ethnic, racial or religious state but an idea, is not dead. It's not even past.
For starters, despite a presidential policy sourced from the sewers of white supremacy, a nation of immigrants has not turned against immigrants. The consensus, though battered, is intact: About 60 percent of Americans say openness to outsiders is essential to our identity. The majority says immigrants strengthen the country.
Twice before, this animating idea has been under deadly assault. In the 1850s, as waves of ravaged Irish refugees washed up on our shores, the Know Nothing Party rose to keep them from becoming citizens. The huddled masses were too dirty, too criminal, too foreign, too loud, too clannish, too Catholic. Lincoln despised the Know Nothings; his rise helped lead to their demise.
Then, again, in the early 20th century our better angels were on the run. At a time when upward of five million Americans took an oath to the Ku Klux Klan, the America of the 1920s was restructured to the Klan's design. Black voting had already been wiped out in the South, and the emasculating repression of Jim Crow prevailed even in some Northern states.
With the 1924 immigration bill, the Klan achieved its other top goal: the most restrictive nativist act in history. It was aimed at closing the gate against "undesirables," mainly Jews from Eastern Europe, Italians and Greeks from Southern Europe and Armenians from Turkey, among others. The Chinese had already been specifically singled out for exclusion. The design was to ensure "pure Americanism," a nation of white, native-born Protestants.
And yet, here we are again, with the percentage of foreign born residents at the highest level in more than a hundred years, nearly 14 percent of the population. And we are all trying to live by the American master narrative -- despite pulls from the left and right to go tribal.
"These values my grandparents taught me, they haven't gone anywhere," said President Barack Obama in outlining American exceptionalism in 2016. It was one of the great speeches of his presidency, and worth recalling now, in these dark days, as the strongest case ever made for progressive patriotism.
"That's why our military can look the way it does, every shade of humanity, forged into common service," he said. "That's why anyone who threatens our values, whether fascists or communists or jihadists or homegrown demagogues, will always fail in the end."
This is the country, Obama said in another speech, "where you can write your own destiny." He certainly could not have said that had he landed here, in chains, in 1619.
But 1619 was not predestination, as some would have it. It was followed by the emancipation of 1863, the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Obama's own election in 2008. None of it purged the original sin of enslavement, but it showed that the American people, more often than not, write their destiny for the better.
Today, there is no external enemy to unite us -- not the British Crown, Nazi Germany or a Communist Soviet Union. For much of the world, and more than half of the United States, Trump is the uniter -- the repellent-in-chief. As we saw again this week in Europe, the president is a laughingstock, mocked for his buffoonery, ignorance and bluster. In just a few days abroad, he made 21 false statements, a microcosm of his presidency.
At home, he wages war on American institutions: the military, the courts, Congress, the press, respect for truth, the Constitution itself. But he also faces certain impeachment, because what he did warrants no other choice. Though he most likely won't be removed, a majority of Americans say he has committed an impeachable offense. He will be forever remembered for the gross violations of his oath.
We should be loud and proud with this to the rest of the world: L'état, c'est moi is nowhere in the founding documents. That's another story America can yet tell.

'Free College for All' Is an Experiment That Has Already Failed; In 1970 New York's City College had the best of intentions. It tried 'open admissions.' It was a bust.

The progressive Democratic presidential candidates mean well when they say they want to make a college education an entitlement. They believe that nothing but good can result from giving children from low-income families the opportunity to attend college.
But they are mistaken. When students realize that they will get into college no matter what they learn in grade school or high school, they will have no incentive to forgo activities that are more fun than attending school, listening to teachers, and doing homework.
As Albert Shanker, the late president of the American Federation of Teachers, wrote in 1993, "Kids are just like adults: they will work to get what they want. If they know they have to work hard, listen in class, and come to school every day with their homework done to get into college, they'll do that. If they know they can get by with less and still get into college, that is what they'll do."
New York's City College was once known as "the Harvard of the proletariat." As the flagship college of the City University of New York, it charged no tuition but admitted only applicants who scored well on an academically difficult test. After African-American and Puerto Rican protesters chained shut the gates of the college in 1969 to call attention to the relatively low numbers of minority students, in 1970 City College adopted a policy of "open admissions" and began accepting underprepared students.
Remedial education was to be the solution. By 1978 the New York Times reported that "two out of three students entering City College now require remedial work in writing, mathematics or reading, and one in five needs it in all three."
Twenty-two years after open-admissions experiment started, liberal journalist James Traub spent 18 months observing how it worked. He interviewed hundreds of City College students and attended classes. On the first day of a remedial course in basic skills, Mr. Traub saw Prof. Rudi Gedamke show students a headline from the student newspaper: "Student Turnout Nil at Games."
Mr. Gedamke asked the students what the headline meant. One student wrote: "He/she is not good for nothing." Other tries, all quoted verbatim, included: "Students spend most of their studies time as their leisure times" and "Students are getting addicted toward it." "Students act uncivilized at games" or "Students turnout facinate at games." There was only one answer Mr. Gedamke deemed correct: "No one didn't go."
Mr. Traub's 1994 book, "City on a Hill," revealed students with academic handicaps too severe to be repaired by their efforts or the efforts of their teachers. His anecdotal accounts were confirmed by statistics. A City College study of 155 students placed in its remedial English program found, Mr. Traub reported, that only seven had graduated after six years, and another half-dozen or so after seven years. Only 15% were projected to complete college after a decade. They weren't flunked out; they gave up and dropped out.
In 1998 the City University's board of trustees voted to end the open-admissions policy at four-year colleges, requiring applicants to pass proficiency tests in reading, writing and mathematics to gain entry. The experiment had revealed the limits of good intentions and remedial education alike.
National studies show that the worse the academic preparation of admitted students, the lower the college graduation rate. Syracuse University's Vincent Tinto, an expert on student attrition, reported in 1993 that colleges with an average SAT score of 1100 or higher have a first-year attrition rate of 8%. For colleges with an average SAT score of 700 or below, the first-year attrition rate is 45.5%.
For a student to understand what college teachers are teaching, he needs to have developed, grade by grade, a working vocabulary of several thousand words. Mr. Gedamke's students couldn't keep up.
Democrats offering "free college for all" fail to realize that college is too late for students with severe academic deficiencies. For many of these students, the problem isn't that they can't afford college; it's that they didn't have sufficient academic commitment in the lower grades to get ready for college. To become ready, they would need new childhoods to replace the ones they had. Even generous taxpayers can't give them that.

Pence stirs evangelical base in West Michigan

Texto completo: While President Donald Trump continues to battle accusations of corruption relating to his dealings with Ukraine, Vice President Mike Pence toured parts of West Michigan on Wednesday to connect with one of the campaigns most reliable voter blocs — evangelicals.
Pence arrived in Kalamazoo shortly before noon. He was greeted by Michigan Republican Party Chairwoman Laura Cox before meeting supporters at a local church. Pence arrived in West Michigan as part of a day of scheduled bus tour stops, culminating with a rally in Holland later Wednesday.
Pence met with faith and community leaders before attending a "Keep America Great" event with former White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders.
Pence's tour through parts of West Michigan coincides with the ongoing impeachment inquiry in Washington.
While Pence had mostly stayed away from the topic, he addressed impeachment in front of evangelical supporters during his first stop in Kalamazoo, maligning it as "three years of endless investigation."
"As partisan impeachment continues today, I've come here to Michigan to talk about all that we've accomplished here, because it really is a lot," Pence said.
The Trump campaign secured a substantial majority of white, evangelical voters in 2016, and Pence's visit aimed at rallying that base.
He told the audience of about 50 people at Valley Church of Kalamazoo that Democrats were straying too far to the left.
"We've seen the Democratic Party nationally take a leftward turn like I'd never thought I'd see in my lifetime," Pence said. "It's amazing to think at a time when life and liberty are winning in America, the Democratic Party today is embracing far left, radical policies on economic issues and on social issues and the values we most cherish.
"Socialism is a scourge, yet now we have leading voices in the Democratic Party (embracing it)."
Democratic presidential nominees like Sen. Bernie Sanders, D-Vermont, and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Massachusetts, have called for higher tax rates on the ultra-rich.
According to a recent New York Times and Siena College poll in November, Trump trailed Sanders by two points but led Warren by six points among a survey of registered voters in Michigan.
In Holland, Pence was expected to speak about President Trump's time in office and the importance of Michigan in the 2020 election.
The Holland stop is Pence's first return to the state since attending the Republican Leadership Conference on Sept. 21 on Mackinac Island, and his first trip back to Holland since Nov. 5, 2016.

Pelosi only adds to burden of Democratic moderates Voters in Trump districts won't support Democrats who tried to take away their right to re-elect him.

Texto completo: With her announcement that Democrats will move forward and vote on articles of impeachment, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., may have signed a political death warrant for dozens of moderate Democrats elected in Trump districts.
Pelosi is speaker today because in 2018 Democrats were able to convince voters in 31 House districts that Trump carried two years before to defect and vote for them. Democrats need these voters to stay in their column in 2020 if they are to hold on to the House and win back the White House.
But in key swing states, large majorities of these 2018 defectors now say they plan to back Trump again in 2020. The New York Times reported that "nearly two-thirds of voters in six battleground states who voted for President Trump in 2016 - but for Democratic congressional candidates in 2018 - say they intend to back the president against each of his top rivals." The Times also reported that in 2018, voters in these states cast their ballots "for Democratic congressional candidates by an average of 6 points, all but identical to their actual winning margins." That means these freshman Democrats already face an uphill battle to hold on to their seats.
Now, Pelosi is adding to their woes by forcing them to vote to recommend the removal of a president that voters in their districts say they plan to re-elect. Already, she forced them to vote to authorize an impeachment inquiry, and all but two did so. But there is a world of difference between backing an impeachment inquiry and voting to impeach. Before the hearings began, swing-state voters said they supported the impeachment inquiry by a margin of 50 percent to 45 percemt, but opposed impeaching and removing Trump by 53 percent to 43 percent. After weeks of wall-to-wall hearings, polls show that Democrats failed to move the needle in favor of impeachment and removal. Indeed, in Wisconsin, opposition to removal has nearly doubled. In other words, Democrats have failed to make their case.
By moving forward with impeachment anyway, Pelosi is putting her most vulnerable members in a terrible position. Split-ticket voting is already rare. The Washington Post reported in 2016 that that election "saw the highest percentage of STRAIGHT-ticket voters in more than a century." And according to Five- ThirtyEight, split-ticket voting hit a new low in 2018. Impeachment makes it even less likely that swing-state voters will split their tickets. Are voters really going to cast ballots to give Trump four more years and also to re-elect the Democratic House members who tried to take that decision out of their hands by impeaching him?
Voters in these Trump districts are already frustrated with their Democratic representatives. They won on promises to work with the president to address issues like health care, prescription drug prices, infrastructure and trade. None of that is getting done, thanks to Democrats' focus on impeachment. Indeed, there is speculation in the White House that the reason Pelosi has been slow-rolling the U.S.-Mexico-Canada free trade agreement Trump negotiated is not out of reluctance to give Trump a win, but because she needs it as leverage with her moderate members to get their votes for impeachment. "She's using USMCA to get the impeachment vote," Trump has said.
Pelosi isn't stupid. She would not have announced a vote on articles of impeachment if she didn't believe she had the votes. But while she can strong-arm the moderates in her caucus, she can't strong-arm the voters in their districts. Her decision to move forward with impeachment means that many of those 31 Democrats seem destined to lose next November. Apparently, that is a price she is willing to pay to placate her party's virulent anti-Trump base.

Re "An Argument for the Unheard Facts" (news analysis, front page, Dec. 5):
In a normal world, where facts matter and minds are open to receive them, I would agree that it would be wise for the Democrats to wait and build a bigger case for impeachment. We do not live in such a world, however. The Senate is the body that would remove the president, and I can think of no further information or action the president could take that would move any Republican to vote for removal.
It is probably best to proceed as quickly as possible and let the Republican senators go on record as condoning the new "do us a favor though" approach to delivering foreign aid and election security.

To the Editor:
What's the rush? Why the hurry? Let the inquiry run its course.
Congress's constitutional duty is to ascertain whether a president committed impeachable offenses. To do this, House committees must sift through all of the evidence -- not some of it -- before voting to send the matter to the Senate for a trial.
Those refusing to testify should be held accountable, and any obstruction correctly labeled as an additional offense. It is -- and should be -- a lengthy process.
The American people deserve to have a clear, easily understood reason for impeaching a legally elected president. It must not be seen as "insider" or partisan politics. Such an inquiry requires time and cannot be dependent upon the election cycle.

To the Editor:
In 2000, the Supreme Court expedited its decision in Bush v. Gore because of the urgency of deciding the presidential election. Given the gravity of the charges against President Trump and the White House's refusal to allow witnesses to testify, why can't the Supreme Court similarly fast-track a decision about this case?
It is disingenuous of those who defend the president to, on the one hand, claim that there is not enough firsthand evidence while, on the other hand, sanctioning the White House's strategy of blocking testimony and the delays that inevitably result. A timely ruling by our highest court would take the option of "running out the clock" off the table, and would be in the best interests of the country.

To the Editor:
Re "A TV Analyst and an Introvert End Up as Impeachment Rivals" (news article, Dec. 3):
President Trump disparaged Daniel S. Goldman, the House Intelligence Committee's lead investigator, for his previous work as a legal analyst on TV. "I see they're using lawyers that are television lawyers -- they took some guys off television," snarked the president.
That raises this question: What does Mr. Trump make of a reality TV celebrity becoming president of the United States?

Texto completo: A former whiz kid in Lindsay's City Hall, he became a knows-everybody "process broker" with wide reach in civic affairs, broadcasting and real estate.
Jay L. Kriegel, who as a 25-year-old prodigy helped shape the Lindsay administration's progressive challenge to New York City's entrenched power brokers, and who later emerged as one himself, in fields ranging from television broadcasting to real estate development, died on Thursday at his weekend home in South Kent, Conn. He was 79.
The cause was complications of melanoma, his wife, Kathryn McAuliffe, said.
A charter member of Mayor John V. Lindsay's so-called kiddie corps, Mr. Kriegel played an outsize role as chief of staff and special counsel in an administration that held power from 1966 to 1973. Later, as an indefatigable but pragmatic outside process broker, he continued to influence a broad spectrum of policymaking through the same power of persuasion.
His behind-the-scenes counsel, on behalf of private clients or the civic groups he volunteered to help, made him everyone's go-to guy in navigating government bureaucracy. Recognizable in later years by his formidable gray mane, he would argue their cases, with his adenoidal inflection, at a machine-gun pace.
"Talking to Jay Kriegel," a colleague once said, "is like putting your finger in an electric light socket."
"A New York City patriot" was how Mayor Bill de Blasio described Mr. Kriegel last month at a tribute organized by former colleagues. "For half a century Jay has been devoted to making this a better place," the mayor said, "and there's no question in my mind that we are better because of Jay Kriegel."
The feeling was mutual. New York, Mr. Kriegel would say, "is my love affair."
His impact on urban affairs was wide and enduring.
Working for Mr. Lindsay, Mr. Kriegel helped initiate civilian oversight of citizens' complaints against the police.
In 1968, when Mayor Lindsay was vice chairman of the Kerner Commission on civil disorders, it was Mr. Kriegel and another Lindsay aide, Peter C. Goldmark Jr., who were assigned to draft overnight a more muscular preface to the commission's final report, a 426-page analysis of urban race riots, before it was to be released the next morning.
They synthesized a sentence that had been buried in the report and made it immortal: "Our nation is moving toward two societies, one black, one white -- separate and unequal."
In the late 1970s, Mr. Kriegel and Steven Brill founded The American Lawyer magazine, with Mr. Kriegel as its publisher.
In 1986, facing a Reagan administration proposal to repeal state and local tax deductions on federal returns, Mr. Kriegel galvanized the New York opposition that helped scuttle it. (Among his allies then was the developer Donald J. Trump, who as president would reverse his position, signing legislation that limited those deductions.)
As the senior vice president of CBS Inc. in the late 1980s and early '90s -- working under Laurence A. Tisch, its chief executive and largest stockholder at the time -- Mr. Kriegel engineered a major, lucrative legislative victory for broadcasters over the cable television industry.
He was later executive director of NYC2012, a long-shot campaign set up by Michael R. Bloomberg's administration to woo the 2012 Summer Olympics to New York. While falling short in its efforts -- London won the Games -- the campaign, organized by Deputy Mayor Daniel L. Doctoroff, nevertheless helped the city derive some enduring benefits from the bid, including an extension of the Flushing subway, the commercial and residential development of Hudson Yards on Manhattan's West Side and the building of Citi Field in Queens, home of the Mets, and the Barclays Center arena in Brooklyn, home of the Nets.
Mr. Kriegel was also counselor to the financial communications firm Abernathy MacGregor Group; counseled the governments of Turkey and Kazakhstan; and most recently served as senior adviser to the Related Companies, the global developer that created Hudson Yards.
Jay Lawrence Kriegel was born on Oct. 10, 1940, in Brooklyn to the children of Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe, I. Stanley Kriegel, who headed an accounting firm, and Charlotte (Karish) Kriegel.
After graduating from Midwood High School in Flatbush, he received a bachelor's degree in English from Amherst College in 1962 and a law degree from Harvard.
Mr. Kriegel was introduced to politics, on the Democratic side, when he was 12, doing odd jobs at the Manhattan headquarters of Adlai E. Stevenson's 1952 presidential campaign. During a summer break from college he went to Washington as an intern for Representative William Fitts Ryan, a Manhattan Democrat.
Early in 1965, Mr. Kriegel and several other Harvard Law students were recruited by Mr. Lindsay, then a Republican congressman, to draft sections of what became the Voting Rights Act of 1965.
Afterward, instead of accepting a job with Judge Thurgood Marshall, the newly named solicitor general and future Supreme Court justice, Mr. Kriegel joined Mr. Lindsay's 1965 mayoral campaign to conduct research. When Mr. Lindsay won the election, Mr. Kriegel was named assistant to the mayor for social welfare and law enforcement. The new administration was quick to identify him as a Democrat, to validate Mr. Lindsay's bona fides as politically independent.
As the mayor's chief of staff, Mr. Kriegel was thrust into the limelight in the early 1970s after two whistle-blowing police officers, quoted by The New York Times, accused the administration of having failed to pursue their specific allegations of police corruption. The officers were later identified as Sgt. David Durk and Detective Frank Serpico.
The Times's reporting on their allegations and on the Police Department's sluggish response prompted Mr. Lindsay to create the Knapp Commission.
In December 1972, the commission found that corruption -- from accepting gratuities to extorting drug dealers -- was widespread in the police force, but that the department's top officials had done little about the problem after being alerted to it by the whistle-blowers and The Times's reporting.
Whitman Knapp, the commission's chairman, concluded that Mayor Lindsay could not "escape responsibility" for the department's foot-dragging. But the degree of the mayor's culpability hinged on what appeared to be Mr. Kriegel's contradictory testimony about how much the mayor had known about the corruption allegations.
In one instance, Mr. Kriegel suggested that he had told the mayor about the officers' accusations; in another, he testified that the mayor had not known of those allegations.
Criticized over his conflicting statements, Mr. Kriegel found a loyal supporter in Mayor Lindsay, who defended him as "a man of unbending integrity and decency."
After Mr. Lindsay left office at the end of his second term in 1973, Mr. Kriegel was named director of special projects for the Loews Corporation, which Mr. Tisch owned with his brother, Preston Robert Tisch; he served in that capacity from 1975 to 1978. He was publisher of The American Lawyer from 1979 to 1982.
At CBS, where he was senior vice president from 1988 to 1993, Mr. Kriegel helped persuade Congress to require the cable TV industry to pay broadcasters for the right to retransmit over-the-air programming. Those efforts "literally saved broadcast TV and hundreds of national and local news stations," Mr. Tisch's nephew Jonathan, the chief executive of Loews Hotels, said at last month's tribute to Mr. Kriegel.
"I think we might even blame 'The Apprentice' on you," Mr. Tisch said to the gathering, referring to the long-running NBC reality show that made its star, Mr. Trump, a household fixture across America.
Mr. Kriegel later ran his own strategic consulting firm and served on numerous philanthropic and civic group boards, including Prep for Prep and New Visions for Public Schools.
His marriage to Joanne Connors in 1971 ended in divorce. In addition to his wife, Ms. McAuliffe, an artist, he is survived by two children from his first marriage, Isabel Hardy and Connor Kriegel; his stepchildren, Jevon and Caitlin Roush and Tessa Bridge; his sister, Myra Zuckerbraun; four grandchildren; and three step-grandchildren.
A workaholic known to juggle multiple callers on hold simultaneously, Mr. Kriegel remained a sometimes wistful unofficial custodian of the equivocal and long-debated Lindsay legacy, forged when he and other mayoral tyros were, in the words of one of them, Barry Gottehrer, "young, beautiful, invincible, and we all really cared."
As keeper of the flame, Mr. Kriegel organized reunions, remembrances and retrospectives, including a book on the 50th anniversary of Mr. Lindsay's 1965 election.
"It seems ironic," Mr. Kriegel wrote in the foreword to that book, "that 'Man of La Mancha' opened three weeks after Lindsay's election, with its 'Impossible Dream.' "

Texto completo: Sen. Kamala Harris told supporters on Tuesday that she was ending her bid for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, an abrupt close to a candidacy that held historic potential.
"I've taken stock and looked at this from every angle, and over the last few days have come to one of the hardest decisions of my life," the California Democrat said. "My campaign for president simply doesn't have the financial resources we need to continue."
A senior campaign aide said Harris made the decision Monday after discussing the path forward with family and other top officials over the Thanksgiving holiday.
Her withdrawal marked a dramatic fall for a candidate who showed extraordinary promise in her bid to become the first Black female president. Harris launched her campaign in front of 20,000 people on a chilly January day in Oakland, California. The first woman and first Black attorney general and U.S. senator in California's history, she was widely viewed as a candidate poised to excite the multiracial coalition of voters that sent Barack Obama to the White House.
Her departure erodes the diversity of the Democratic field, which is dominated at the moment by a top tier that is White and mostly male.
"She was an important voice in the race; out before others who raised less and were less electable. It's a loss not to have her voice in the race," said Aimee Allison, who leads She the People, a group that promotes women of color.
Harris ultimately could not craft a message that resonated with voters or secure the money to continue her run.
She raised an impressive $12 million in the first three months of her campaign and quickly locked down major endorsements meant to show her dominance in her home state, which offers the biggest delegate haul in the Democratic primary contest.
But as the field grew, Harris' fundraising remained flat; she was unable to attract the type of attention being showered on Pete Buttigieg by traditional donors or the grassroots firepower that drove tens of millions of dollars to Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders.
In her note to supporters, Harris lamented the role of money in politics and, without naming them, took a shot at billionaires Tom Steyer and Michael Bloomberg, who are funding their presidential bids.
"I'm not a billionaire," she said. "I can't fund my own campaign. And as the campaign has gone on, it's become harder and harder to raise the money we need to compete."
Harris suffered from what allies and critics viewed as an inconsistent pitch to voters. Her slogan "For the people" referenced her career as a prosecutor, a record that was viewed skeptically by the party's most progressive voters.
Through the summer, she focused on pocketbook issues and her "3 a.m. agenda," a message that never seemed to resonate with voters. By the fall, she had returned to her courtroom roots with the refrain that "justice is on the ballot," both a cry for economic and social justice as well as her call that she could "prosecute the case" against a "criminal" president.
At times, she was tripped up by confusing policy positions; particularly on health care. After suggesting she would eliminate private insurance in favor of a fully government-run system, Harris eventually rolled out a health care plan that preserves a role for private insurance.
Stumbles, often of the campaign's making, continued to dog Harris into the winter, stymieing her ability to capitalize on solid moments. Harris kicked off November with a well-received speech at a massive Iowa dinner, just a day after her campaign announced it would fire staff at its Baltimore headquarters and was moving some people from other early states to Iowa.
Her message was regularly overshadowed by campaign aides and allies sharing grievances with the news media. Several top aides decamped for other campaigns, one leaving a blistering resignation letter.
"Because we have refused to confront our mistakes, foster an environment of critical thinking and honest feedback, or trust the expertise of talented staff, we find ourselves making the same unforced errors over and over," Kelly Mehlenbacher wrote in her letter, obtained by The New York Times. Mehlenbacher now works for businessman Bloomberg's campaign.
With Harris' exit, 15 Democrats remain in the race for the nomination. Several praised her on Tuesday.
Former Vice President Joe Biden, who had a memorable debate stage tussle with Harris this summer, called the senator a "solid person, loaded with talent."
Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders commended Harris for "running a spirited and issue-oriented campaign."
New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, one of two Black candidates still in the campaign, called Harris a "trailblazer."
Harris anchored her campaign in the powerful legacy of pioneering African Americans. Her campaign launch on the Martin Luther King, Jr. holiday included a nod to Shirley Chisholm, the New York congresswoman who sought the Democratic Party's presidential nomination 47 years ago earlier.
One of her first stops as a candidate was to Howard University, the historically Black college that she attended as an undergraduate.
She spent much of her early campaign focusing on South Carolina, which hosts the first Southern primary and has a significant African American population.
But Harris struggled to chip away at Biden's deep advantage with Black voters who are critical to winning the Democratic nomination.
Harris and her aides believe she faced an uphill battle - and unfair expectations for perfection - from the start as a woman of color. Her campaign speech included a line about what Harris called the "donkey in the room," a reference to the thought that Americans wouldn't elect a woman of color.
Harris often suggested it was criticism she faced in her other campaigns - all of which she won.
Her departure from the presidential race marks her first defeat as a political candidate.

On impeachment, Democrats don’t understand their most important audience

Texto completo: What are Democratic lawmakers thinking?
Republicans are not going to vote to remove President Trump from office. The best-case scenario for Democrats is that this impeachment business motivates the general electorate to vote against the president in 2020. But for that to happen, Democrats need to speak to an audience beyond just politicos, journalists, and other obsessively-engaged resistance types who already agree that Trump needs to go.
After this latest round of televised impeachment hearings, I am not convinced Democrats see it this way.
The House Judiciary Committee hosted four legal scholars Wednesday to speak to the allegations against Trump. The three witnesses selected by Democrats were Harvard Law professor Noah Feldman, University of North Carolina School of Law professor Michael Gerha, and Stafford professor Pamela Karlan.
It was a golden opportunity for the pro-impeachment side of the debate to break through the partisan noise with impartial experts to speak plainly and clearly to the case against Trump. It was a perfect opportunity to present a no-nonsense impeachment argument to the middle, that is, the voting bloc Democrats need to make this entire exercise worthwhile. This did not happen. What happened instead was that the three professors used their time before Congress to engage in partisan, resistance-style histrionics – some worse than others.
Feldman, for example, claimed that if Congress cannot impeach Trump for his attempts to pressure Ukraine into investigating the Bidens, then “we no longer live in a democracy. … We live in a monarchy or we live under a dictatorship.”
Really? So is the next election canceled?
Gerhardt said separately that if “Congress fails to impeach here, then the impeachment process has lost all meaning, and, along with that, our Constitution’s carefully crafted safeguards against the establishment of a king on American soil.”
The two scholars did also make some reasonable arguments against Trump’s behavior, laying out the facts of the case against the president. But they could maintain the persona of the legal expert for only so long. They just could not resist undercutting the entire purpose of their appearance before Congress with hair-on-fire commentary. What functional difference was there between what Gerhardt and Feldman said about dictators and monarchs and what Democrats have been saying all along? I would argue there is not much difference at all, which makes Wednesday’s hearing seem like a major wasted opportunity for Democrats.
Then there is Karlan, who describes herself as “a scholar of the law of democracy.” Man, I don’t even know where to start with her. She created a small mess for herself at the hearing when she tried to make a clever pun involving the word “baron” and the name “Barron,” as in “Barron Trump,” the president’s 13-year-old son. It was not a clever pun.
“Kings could do no wrong because the king’s word was law. Contrary to what President Trump has said, Article Two does not give him the power to do anything he wants,” Karlan said.
She added, “I will give you one example that shows the difference between him and a king, which is, the Constitution says there can be no titles of nobility. While the president can name his son Barron, he can’t make him a baron.”
Karlan later offered a half-hearted apology for her stupid resistance-flavored dad joke.
“I want to apologize for what I said earlier about the president’s son. It was wrong of me to do,” she said.
Solid witness, fellas. Nothing broadcasts impartial professionalism quite like lame wisecracks that end in an apology and all of it on national television.
It is somewhat staggering that Democrats thought Wednesday’s hearing was a good idea. Republican lawmakers could not sell impeachment in the 1990s, and they had the benefit of perjury and a sleazy sex scandal to grab voters’ attention. Democrats cannot possibly believe they are going to have better luck with things like Karlan’s and Feldman’s testimony.
At this rate, and if this is the best that Democrats have to offer, the only thing the impeachment proceedings will accomplish is that they will fire up Trump’s base ahead of a presidential election, all while setting up the Left’s constituency for massive disappointment. The middle, meanwhile, will go on ignoring this entire episode because, to those who are not obsessively following the proceedings, it looks like a massive, partisan slap-fight.
But don’t take my word for it when I say Democrats are in trouble. Certain members of the press are starting to panic, including the Washington Post’s Margaret Sullivan (formerly the New York Times’s public editor), who authored an op-ed this week titled, “Wall-to-wall impeachment coverage is not changing any minds. Here’s how journalists can reach the undecided.”
Democrats do have a problem, as recent polls showing a decline in support for removing Trump would suggest. If the Democratic Party’s best response to those sagging numbers is MSNBC-style commentary from Ivy League professors, then we may as well all go home. It is over.

Texto completo: David Fincher's eerie drama is on FXM. And the third part of a Christmastime trilogy premieres on Netflix.
What's on TV
GONE GIRL (2014) 7:40 p.m. on FXM. Ben Affleck stars in this drama as Nick Dunne, a small-town Midwestern man who comes home one day to find his wife, Amy (Rosamund Pike), missing. Nick becomes a suspect in her disappearance, with the only evidence as to Amy's whereabouts coming from her diary entries. These detail the deterioration of her marriage and her fear of her husband. And while Nick maintains his innocence, it becomes clear that Amy may not be a reliable narrator. Based on the 2012 novel by Gillian Flynn, who also wrote the screenplay, "Gone Girl" is "a ghastly vision," Manohla Dargis wrote in her New York Times review. Dargis added that the director, David Fincher, "fashions an ever more haunted, haunting world that wavers so violently between ordinariness and aberration that, as in his other movies, the two soon blur."
What's streaming
A CHRISTMAS PRINCE: THE ROYAL BABY (2019) Stream on Netflix. "When Prince Richard (Ben Lamb) went to New York to ask the New York commoner and 'journalist' Amber (Rose McIver) to marry him in the first movie, I let out a high-pitched squeal," Kaly Soto wrote of "A Christmas Prince" in her Times review of its sequel, "A Christmas Prince: The Royal Wedding." Since Amber first visited the a country, Aldovia, to interview its prince, the couple have been married, and are now expecting a tiny heir to the throne in "A Christmas Prince: The Royal Baby." Complications arise, of course, when a treaty between Aldovia and another country is stolen just before Amber and Prince Richard are to sign it. If the treaty is not renewed, the royal baby will be cursed. All hands are on deck to save the royal baby in the third part of this trilogy where, apparently, it is always Christmastime.
RESERVOIR DOGS (1992) Stream on Starz; rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. The first movie written, directed by and acted in by Quentin Tarantino, "Reservoir Dogs" set the tone for Tarantino's later works. The movie, which includes Harvey Keitel and Steve Buscemi, depicts a jewelry store robbery gone wrong. The story is largely set in a warehouse -- the headquarters for the operation. In his review for The Times, Vincent Canby suggested the audience pay heed. "'Reservoir Dogs' is as violent as any movie you are likely to see this year," he wrote, "but though it's not always easy to watch, it has a point."
THOR: RAGNAROK (2017) Stream on Disney Plus and Netflix; rent on Amazon, Google Play, Vudu and YouTube. Thor's home planet, Asgard, is invaded by the Goddess of Death -- who is his sister -- in "Thor: Ragnarok," the most recent movie in this Marvel trilogy. It is also the most comical of the three, as Thor -- who now lives on Planet Garbage Dump (Sakaar) -- is "a playfully sustained joke," Manohla Dargis wrote in her review for The Times. Marvel favorites like Hulk band together with Thor to destroy this threat to Asgard.

Texto completo: To the Editor:
Re "Philanthropists Bench the M.V.P.s," by Vanessa Daniel (Op-Ed, Nov. 20):
The New York Times Magazine's 1619 Project details how slavery became an engine for what is described as "America's low-road approach to capitalism." It should come as no surprise that the painful history that built our economy also gave rise to philanthropy and the issues articulated by Ms. Daniel.
Foundations need to realize that the wealth they distribute is not theirs to operate or control. Instead, we need to determine how to return money to communities that were exploited in creating today's economy.
In addition to funding more organizations led by people of color, philanthropy can do this by providing grantees more power to decide how resources are allocated within their organizations.
If foundations are serious about addressing inequities, they need to listen to communities and co-create solutions rather than dictate them.

Allan Gerson, Lawyer Who Sought Justice for Terror Victims, Is Dead at 74

Texto completo: A lawyer and the son of Jewish refugees from Poland, he helped families of those killed in the Lockerbie bombing hold Libya accountable.
Allan Gerson, a lawyer whose novel case against Libya in connection with the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988 paved the way for lawsuits in American courts against states that sponsor terror attacks, died on Sunday at his home in Washington. He was 74.
His daughter Daniela Gerson said the cause was complications of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, a degenerative brain disorder.
Mr. Gerson, a child of Jewish refugees from the Holocaust who spent his early years in the United States under a false identity, had a long and varied career. He prosecuted Nazi war collaborators, represented victims of terrorism, taught international law, worked at the United Nations and wrote books. He was also a notable photographer and jewelry maker.
But he was best known for originating the legal argument that was used successfully against the Libyan government for its role in supporting terrorists who bombed a civilian airliner that plunged into the town of Lockerbie. All 259 people aboard -- most of them Americans -- and 11 on the ground were killed in what remains the worst terrorist attack in Britain.
At the time, foreign nations were shielded from prosecution in American courts by the bedrock legal principle of sovereign immunity, even if they had been complicit in terrorism. For that reason, early litigation in the Lockerbie case was directed at Pan Am, for negligence in not checking the baggage thoroughly.
But Mr. Gerson thought that Libya, one of whose agents had been convicted of the bombing, should be held accountable to victims' families. He and another lawyer, Mark S. Zaid, initially brought a suit against the country in 1993, but because of sovereign immunity it was dismissed.
The two lawyers and others then spent three years pushing Congress to amend the sovereign immunity law. In 1996, Congress carved out a "terrorism exception" to allow citizens to sue a country for human rights violations if the State Department had designated that country a sponsor of terrorism.
The Lockerbie suit against Libya was refiled. In 2002, Libya agreed to a $ 2.7 billion settlement, or $ 10 million per victim. Mr. Gerson detailed the case in a book, "The Price of Terror" (2001), written with Jerry Adler of Newsweek.
Similar cases have been filed against Cuba, Iran and Syria, among other countries. In 2016, Congress enacted the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act, which permitted civil lawsuits against Saudi Arabia by families of the victims of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks to proceed; the Saudi government has insisted that it played no role in the attacks, and the litigation continues.
"I have sought to help people not to go through life doubly victimized, first by the atrocity and then by a grinding sense of impotence at being unable to do anything about it," Mr. Gerson wrote in a memoir he finished in August, to be published next year. "I have tried to be their voice in ending that frustration and achieving some measure of justice."
Allan Gerson was born Elik Gerzon in Samarkand, Uzbekistan, on June 19, 1945. Before World War II, his father, Motel Gerzon, -- the name was later changed -- was a bookkeeper at his parents' candy store in Zamosc, Poland; his mother, Peshka (Szajt) Gerzon, was a dressmaker.
His parents were among 200,000 Polish Jews who were deported and imprisoned in Siberian labor camps during the war by the Soviets. In June 1941, when the Germans invaded the Soviet Union, his parents were freed from the gulag and headed to Uzbekistan, where Elik was born in a refugee settlement.
When the war was over, the family went to Foehrenwald, one of the largest displaced-persons camps in Germany. At first they could not get into the camp for reasons that are unclear, Daniela Gerson said, so they bought the identities of another family, the Blumsteins, who were moving to Palestine. The Gerzons eventually obtained visas to the United States under the fake identities.
In December 1950, when Elik was 5, he, his younger brother and his parents arrived in New York Harbor with about 1,000 other Jewish refugees and displaced persons. They settled in Brooklyn and later moved to the Bronx, where his parents opened a dry-cleaning business and dressmaking shop.
For seven years they lived as illegal immigrants, with Elik going by the name Abraham Blumstein and his parents in constant fear of deportation.
By the time Elik was 12, his father was tired of the deception. "With the help of an able immigration lawyer, he went to court and got a sympathetic judge to allow us to obtain U.S. citizenship under our original names," Mr. Gerson wrote in The Washington Post in 2017. They dropped Blumstein and changed Gerzon to Gerson. At that point, Abraham became Allan, while his parents became Morton and Paula.
Mr. Gerson studied at an Orthodox Jewish elementary school and graduated from DeWitt Clinton High School in the Bronx in 1962, when he was 16. He spent a year at the tuition-free City College of New York before winning a scholarship and transferring to the University at Buffalo (also known as the State University of New York at Buffalo), where he earned his undergraduate degree in economics in 1966.
He received a law degree from New York University in 1969, a master of laws degree in international law from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in 1972 and a doctor of juridical science degree from Yale Law School in 1976.
While in Jerusalem, he met Joan Nathan at the Western Wall in 1970. They were married in 1974.
His wife, a prominent cookbook author (her books include "Jewish Cooking in America," published in 1994) and a longtime contributor to The New York Times, survives him. In addition to her and his daughter Daniela, he is survived by another daughter, Merissa Gerson; a son, David; two grandchildren; and a brother, Sam. Another brother, Eric, died of diphtheria in infancy during World War II.
After Yale, Mr. Gerson joined the Justice Department in Washington as a trial lawyer in the newly created Office of Special Investigations. His job was to track down Nazi collaborators -- concentration camp guards, chiefs of auxiliary police and active fascist sympathizers -- who had succeeded in acquiring visas to the United States after the war by misrepresenting their roles in the Holocaust. Before it was disbanded in 2010, the office won rulings against more than 100 collaborators, many of whom were deported or extradited.
In 1981, Mr. Gerson was appointed senior counsel to Jeane Kirkpatrick, the American ambassador to the United Nations, whose tenure he explored in the book "The Kirkpatrick Mission: Diplomacy Without Apology" (1991).
He returned to the Justice Department in 1986, serving as a deputy assistant attorney general in the Office of Legal Counsel. He later held positions at the American Enterprise Institute and the Council on Foreign Relations and taught international law at George Mason University. In 2003 he served as senior counsel to the United States delegation to the Commission on Human Rights.
Mr. Gerson's work prosecuting Nazi collaborators was brief -- just 18 months -- but it weighed on him toward the end of his life, and his memoir is devoted to that period.
Given his own family history of misrepresentation and false identities, he wrestled with the implications of his task: He was prosecuting collaborators for lying to obtain their visas when, as his father had told him, "We all lied." And the powers that were focused on Nazi collaborators one day, his family feared, could turn on them the next.
Mr. Gerson was left mostly with questions. "Is U.S. immigration law an appropriate vehicle for dealing with efforts at historic justice emanating from war crimes of another era in a foreign place?" he asked in his memoir.
"Whatever I learned," he concluded, "it was now my responsibility to remember, to bear witness, to preserve, and to share."

Texto completo: KPFA Radio and Marcus Books are hosting a presentation by Dr. Michael Eric Dsyon on his new book,: JAY-Z: Made in America" on Wed., Dec. 11, 2019, at First Congregational Church in Berkeley.
A bestselling-author, Dyson has created a powerful portrait of the rapper. His book will be published to coincide with the great composer's 50th birthday (December 4).
At its scrappy, brash, irreverent, soulful, ingenious best, "JAY-Z: Made in America" portrays the artist as transcendent a cultural icon as Frank Sinatra, as adventurous a self-made billionaire as Mark Zuckerberg, as gifted a poet as Walt Whitman.
As he reaches the half-century mark, Jay-Z has logged 30 years as a recording artist, become rap's first billionaire, and now reigns as an elder statesman in a field teeming with artists half his age as he continues to make relevant records that invariably chart well.
Jay-Z's body of work is an artistic and political response to revived racism and renewed hostility to blackness. It is an auspicious time to examine his ideas, gifts, and impact, to take measure of his stride as a cultural colossus.
There is no one better suited to this task than Dyson, who has investigated and championed Hip Hop and the work of Jay-Z as a critical American art form for decades.
Just as Jay-Z requested in his 2003 song "Public Service Announcement," to "Allow me to re-introduce myself," this incisive celebration will introduce his work and thought to those who may not know him, and re-introduce him to those who want to examine his art and his evolution more closely.
Jay-Z proclaimed in 2001 that he is the "God MC - me - JAYHOVA." He is a witness to America, a witness of America, and we - this book included - are witness to him and the nation. Describing the evolution of Jay-Z's work and thinking, Dyson offers an in-depth analysis of some of this unique artist's most beloved lyrics. "JAY-Z: Made in America" is destined to become a collector's item.
Dyson, one of America's premier public intellectuals, . is the author of the New York Times' bestsellers "Tears We Cannot Stop" and "What Truth Sounds Like." He is currently a professor of sociology at Georgetown University, a contributing opinion writer for the New York Times, a contributing editor of The New Republic and ESPN's "The Undefeated." Ebony magazine named him one of the 100 most influential African Americans and one of the 150 most powerful Blacks in the nation.
The event is on Wed., Dec. 11, 2019 at 7:30p.m. at First Congregational Church, 2345 Charming Way, Berkeley, CA. Advance tickets are $12 and can be purchased at http://www.brownpapertickets.com/event/4324289: by phone at 800-838-3006 or Marcus Books, Books Inc. (Berkeley), Pegasus Books (all three sites), Moe's Books, Walden Pond Bookstore, East Bay Books and Mrs. Dalloway's. Tickets are $15 at the door, and benefits KPFA Radio 94.1 FM.

Texto completo: The First Division Museum’s popular series "A Date with History" continues with a program on "The Ghost Army" Thursday, Dec. 5. The doors open at 6:30 p.m. at Cantigny Park Visitors Center, 1S151 Winfield Road, Wheaton.
As General George Patton set out to relieve Bastogne during the Battle of the Bulge in December 1944, he received vital assistance from a top-secret deception unit. It wasn’t the first time they came to his aid.
Officially known as the 23rd Headquarters Special Troops, this hand-picked group of GIs used inflatable tanks, sound effects, radio trickery and other forms of illusion to fool the Germans about the strength and location of American units.
From Normandy to the Rhine, they carried out 22 different battlefield deceptions, working with Patton at several key junctures.
Seventy-five years later, author and documentary filmmaker Rick Beyer presents this incredible tale of creativity being used to save lives with an engaging presentation that includes photos, maps, video clips other material.
Beyer is an award-winning documentary filmmaker, a New York Times best-selling author, and a longtime history enthusiast. He produced the acclaimed PBS documentary "The Ghost Army," and is the co-author (with Elizabeth Sayles) of "The Ghost Army of World War II."
Beyer has made documentaries for The History Channel, National Geographic, the Smithsonian and others. He also wrote the popular "Greatest Stories Never Told" book series. He has spoken to audiences around the country and shared his unique take on history on CBS, NBC, NPR and Fox News.
Copies of the featured book will be sold at the gift shop before and after the discussion.
A cash bar will be available along with a small selection of food. Coffee is complimentary.
The monthly programs feature an evening of lively discussion with authors, panelists, historians and special speakers.
There will be free admission and parking. For more information, call (630) 260-8130 or visit cantigny.org.

Texto completo: Charlotte Nebres está haciendo historia como la primera bailarina negra seleccionada para protagonizar “El Cascanueces”, clásico navideño del New York City Ballet (NYCB).
Esa compañía artística ha presentado anualmente esta producción desde 1954 , pero en esos 65 años nunca había tenido una niña negra como protagonista.
Nebres tiene 11 años y es estudiante de “School of American Ballet”, en el Lincoln Center. La familia de su madre es de Trinidad & Tobago, y la de su padre es de Filipinas.
La pequeña dijo a The New York Times que recuerda haberse inspirado Misty Copeland, la primera directora afroamericana en el American Ballet Theatre.
Nebres está escoltada por un grupo diverso de jóvenes bailarines internacionales: el Príncipe de Nebres, Tanner Quirk, tiene raíces chinas. Sophia Thomopoulos, quien también interpreta el rol principal, es mitad coreana, mitad griega. Y el Príncipe de Sophia es interpretado por Kai Misra-Stone, quien tiene origen asiático.
“El Cascanueces” es un cuento de hadas sobre los sueños de una niña la noche de Navidad. Se estrenó por primera vez en Rusia en 1892, con música compuesta por Chaikovski.
Hoy en día es considerado un clásico navideño en todo el mundo y, según el país, la niña protagonista se llama María, Marie o Clara.
Charlotte Nebres is the first black Marie, the young heroine of “George Balanchine’s The Nutcracker,” at New York City Ballet. "There might be a little boy or girl in the audience seeing that and saying, hey, I can do that, too." https://t.co/JoNcYQF3Po

Kamala Harris ends White House bid

Texto completo: SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- Sen. Kamala Harris told supporters on Tuesday that she was ending her bid for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, an abrupt close to a candidacy that held historic potential.

"I've taken stock and looked at this from every angle, and over the last few days have come to one of the hardest decisions of my life," the California Democrat said. "My campaign for president simply doesn't have the financial resources we need to continue."

A senior campaign aide said Harris made the decision Monday after discussing the path forward with family and other top officials over the Thanksgiving holiday.

Her withdrawal marked a dramatic fall for a candidate who showed extraordinary promise in her bid to become the first black female president. Harris launched her campaign in front of 20,000 people on a chilly January day in Oakland, California. The first woman and first black attorney general and U.S. senator in California's history, she was widely viewed as a candidate poised to excite the multiracial coalition of voters that sent Barack Obama to the White House.

Her departure erodes the diversity of the Democratic field, which is dominated at the moment by a top tier that is white and mostly male.

"She was an important voice in the race, out before others who raised less and were less electable. It's a loss not to have her voice in the race," said Aimee Allison, who leads She the People, a group that promotes women of color.

Harris ultimately could not craft a message that resonated with voters or secure the money to continue her run.

She raised an impressive $12 million in the first three months of her campaign and quickly locked down major endorsements meant to show her dominance in her home state, which offers the biggest delegate haul in the Democratic primary contest.

But as the field grew, Harris' fundraising remained flat; she was unable to attract the type of attention being showered on Pete Buttigieg by traditional donors or the grassroots firepower that drove tens of millions of dollars to Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders.

In her note to supporters, Harris lamented the role of money in politics and, without naming them, took a shot at billionaires Tom Steyer and Michael Bloomberg, who are funding their presidential bids.

"I'm not a billionaire," she said. "I can't fund my own campaign. And as the campaign has gone on, it's become harder and harder to raise the money we need to compete."

Harris suffered from what allies and critics viewed as an inconsistent pitch to voters. Her slogan "For the people" referenced her career as a prosecutor, a record that was viewed skeptically by the party's most progressive voters.

Through the summer, she focused on pocketbook issues and her "3 a.m. agenda," a message that never seemed to resonate with voters. By the fall, she had returned to her courtroom roots with the refrain that "justice is on the ballot," both a cry for economic and social justice as well as her call that she could "prosecute the case" against a "criminal" president.

At times, she was tripped up by confusing policy positions; particularly on health care. After suggesting she would eliminate private insurance in favor of a fully government-run system, Harris eventually rolled out a health care plan that preserves a role for private insurance.

Stumbles, often of the campaign's making, continued to dog Harris into the winter, stymieing her ability to capitalize on solid moments. Harris kicked off November with a well-received speech at a massive Iowa dinner, just a day after her campaign announced it would fire staff at its Baltimore headquarters and was moving some people from other early states to Iowa.

Her message was regularly overshadowed by campaign aides and allies sharing grievances with the news media. Several top aides decamped for other campaigns, one leaving a blistering resignation letter.

"Because we have refused to confront our mistakes, foster an environment of critical thinking and honest feedback, or trust the expertise of talented staff, we find ourselves making the same unforced errors over and over," Kelly Mehlenbacher wrote in her letter, obtained by The New York Times. Mehlenbacher now works for businessman Bloomberg's campaign.

With Harris' exit, 15 Democrats remain in the race for the nomination. Several praised her on Tuesday.

Former Vice President Joe Biden, who had a memorable debate stage tussle with Harris this summer, called the senator a "solid person, loaded with talent."

Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders commended Harris for "running a spirited and issue-oriented campaign."

New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, one of two black candidates still in the campaign, called Harris a "trailblazer."

Harris anchored her campaign in the powerful legacy of pioneering African Americans. Her campaign launch on the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday included a nod to Shirley Chisholm, the New York congresswoman who sought the Democratic Party's presidential nomination 47 years ago earlier.

One of her first stops as a candidate was to Howard University, the historically black college that she attended as an undergraduate.

She spent much of her early campaign focusing on South Carolina, which hosts the first Southern primary and has a significant African American population.

But Harris struggled to chip away at Biden's deep advantage with black voters who are critical to winning the Democratic nomination.

Harris and her aides believe she faced an uphill battle -- and unfair expectations for perfection -- from the start as a woman of color. Her campaign speech included a line about what Harris called the "donkey in the room," a reference to the thought that Americans wouldn't elect a woman of color.

Harris often suggested it was criticism she faced in her other campaigns -- all of which she won.

Her departure from the presidential race marks her first defeat as a political candidate.

Texto completo: The senator unveiled a broad plan at a decisive period for his struggling campaign as he faces the prospect of not making the December debate.
Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey on Tuesday proposed investing $ 100 billion in historically black colleges and universities and other minority-serving institutions, a broad proposal in a Democratic field that has offered varying plans to prop up this longstanding yet struggling arm of the educational system.
Many H.B.C.U.s, as historically black colleges and universities are commonly known, have faced widespread financial woes recently, with some schools losing accreditation and facing plummeting enrollment.
Mr. Booker's proposal comes at a precarious time for his presidential campaign: Despite crossing the 200,000 individual-donor threshold last month, he is still short four qualifying polls for the December debate and is in real danger of being left off the stage.
While many candidates, including Senators Kamala Harris of California, Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts; former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.; and Mayor Pete Buttigieg, of South Bend, Ind., have already rolled out proposals to invest billions into H.B.C.U.s, an anchor of Mr. Booker's proposal is dedicating at least $ 40 billion to those institutions for climate change research.
Mr. Booker's plan also calls for an additional $ 30 billion in grants to expand and improve science, technology, engineering and mathematics -- known as STEM education -- at H.B.C.U.s and minority-serving institutions, and another $ 30 billion in grants to upgrade facilities and infrastructure at the schools.
"H.B.C.U.s make our country stronger and more reflective of the diversity that makes us so great," Mr. Booker said in a statement announcing the proposal. "I am here today because of the power of these institutions to uplift and bring about opportunity to black Americans."
More than 70 percent of students at H.B.C.U.s and minority-serving institutions rely on Pell Grants, according to Marybeth Gasman, an education professor at Rutgers University. The Booker campaign aims to expand access to college by doubling the value of Pell Grants to $ 12,400 from $ 6,200, and require that 10 percent of Second Chance Pell Grant programs are given to H.B.C.U.s and minority-serving institutions.
"It's the most aggressive plan," Dr. Gasman said. "Of course it's coming out after the others, so I think that's a smart and bold move on his part."
Indeed, discussion about the many ways the Democratic candidates have proposed to bolster H.B.C.U.s has become a central topic in the Democratic presidential primary.
Ms. Harris, a graduate of Howard University an H.B.C.U. in Washington, proposed $ 70 billion for H.B.C.U.s in a plan she announced over the summer, with a particular focus on STEM education as well. (On Tuesday, Ms. Harris dropped out of the presidential race.)
Ms. Warren committed to investing a minimum of $ 50 billion into H.B.C.U.s, paid for by her wealth tax proposal, within her overarching plan to make public college free and to cancel most student loan debt. She said she would seek to increase the budget with her secretary of education to ensure equity in spending per student compared with other colleges in a given area.
Mr. Sanders, who also proposed universal free public college and canceling all student loan debt, pledged to make similar investments in H.B.C.U.s with a focus on educating teachers and those in the medical field. In addition, Mr. Sanders also proposed canceling the $ 1.6 billion in existing loan debt H.B.C.U.s face through the current Capital Financing Program.
Last month, Mr. Buttigieg wrote an op-ed in The Baltimore Sun, also promising to invest $ 50 billion in H.B.C.U.s.
Mr. Biden proposed more than $ 70 billion in investments for H.B.C.U.s, with dedicated funds to specific needs, such as $ 10 billion to create at least 200 new research incubators, $ 20 billion in high tech labs, facilities and digital infrastructure and another $ 18 billion in grants to help with tuition at four-year colleges, equivalent to up to two years of tuition per low-income and middle-class students.
Some experts, while lauding the financial scope of Mr. Booker's plan, questioned whether focusing so much of the funding on STEM programs and climate change studies was the best solution for many of the H.B.C.U.s around the country.
"There are maybe 10 to 20 H.B.C.U.s facing being shuttered that don't have those fields," said Jerry Crawford II, a professor of journalism and a director of the multicultural scholars program at the University of Kansas.
Of course, underpinning all of these proposals is the difficulty in paying for them. Mr. Booker's campaign said he would request $ 100 billion over 10 years from Congress in his first budget, and has identified other sources of new revenue in previous policy proposals, such as undoing President Trump's tax cuts and restoring the estate tax to 2009 levels.
"If Senator Booker could pull off this kind of investment in H.B.C.U.s," said Dr. Gasman, "it would be historic."

Texto completo: President Trump has a history of falling out with his friends. President Emmanuel Macron of France is the latest.
LONDON -- Their bromance once made headlines. But on Tuesday, it was clear that the days of President Trump and President Emmanuel Macron of France trading cheek kisses and clasping hands were gone.
On the sidelines of a gathering for the 70th anniversary of NATO, Mr. Trump took his one-time friend to task, denouncing comments Mr. Macron made last month criticizing the American president's leadership of NATO, and calling into question several of the French leader's policies.
Mr. Trump is known for trying to build personal relationships with his counterparts, but he also has a penchant for public feuds, fueled in part by his off-the-cuff approach to the news media and his regular Twitter rants.
And Mr. Macron is just one of a handful of one-time buddies whose initial coziness with Mr. Trump has turned cold.
Macron: Dinner at the Eiffel Tower, then a scolding
The budding friendship between Mr. Trump and Mr. Macron was on full display in the summer of 2017, when the American president first traveled to France.
Mr. Macron pulled out all the stops: a military parade, dinner at the Eiffel Tower and lots of hand holding. Despite their differences on a number of issues, the pair poured on the charm.
During a later visit by Mr. Macron to the White House in April 2018, they kissed each other's cheeks in a greeting, and at one point, Mr. Trump gently brushed what he said was dandruff from Mr. Macron's shoulder.
They lavished praise on each other, and played down their disparate approaches to trade, immigration and climate change.
But by the end of last year, the relationship had begun to sour over policy differences. The kisses gave way to terse formalities and tight-lipped smiles whenever they met.
By early last month, Mr. Macron took off the gloves. He said that the United States under Mr. Trump appeared to be "turning its back on us," and that a lack of American leadership and strategic coordination had led to NATO experiencing "brain death."
By the time the two leaders appeared together at a news conference on Tuesday, the bromance appeared to have run its course. At one point, Mr. Trump called Mr. Macron's diplomatic response to a question "one of the greatest nonanswers I have ever heard."
And in one particularly heated exchange, as the two discussed the containment of ISIS fighters in Syria, Mr. Trump tried to jokingly offer captive fighters to the French.
"Would you like some nice ISIS fighters?" Mr. Trump said.
"Let's be serious," was Mr. Macron's curt reply.
Bolsonaro: Praise, then tariffs
When Mr. Trump met with President Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil in the White House for the first time in March, he had nothing but praise for the newly elected leader.
"I think Brazil's relationship with the United States, because of our friendship, is probably better than it's ever been by far," Mr. Trump gushed.
Mr. Bolsonaro, a former army captain, had been criticized as an apologist for the military dictatorship that ruled Brazil for decades, and had made demeaning comments about women, minorities and homosexuals. But despite this, Mr. Trump welcomed him with warmth and promises that their personal relationship would help forge closer trade cooperation.
Their similarly brash personas and populist appeal had many predicting a harmonious future, and Mr. Bolsonaro soon made his close relationship with the American president part of the foundation of his diplomacy.
His son, Eduardo Bolsonaro, a lawmaker in Brazil's lower house, even wore a baseball cap with the slogan Make America Great Again -- Trump 2020 when he visited the White House.
But relations have apparently cooled. On Monday Mr. Trump pledged to slap tariffs on steel and aluminum from Brazil and Argentina, accusing both countries of manipulating their currencies at the expense of American farmers.
Mr. Bolsonaro on Tuesday said he would take the issue up directly with Mr. Trump. But the tariffs may make it difficult for the two to resume their once cozy relationship.
Trudeau: A fallout over trade
Mr. Trump and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada -- who has won international praise for his gender-balanced cabinet and progressive policies -- seemed unlikely to develop a close friendship. But for Mr. Trudeau, getting along with the powerful neighbor to the south is a priority.
So soon after Mr. Trump's election, the Canadian prime minister embarked on a charm offensive, inviting Mr. Trump's daughter, Ivanka, to take part in a meeting of female business leaders, for example. At least for a while, this kind of outreach seemed to work.
During Mr. Trudeau's first visit with Mr. Trump at the White House in 2017, the leaders exchanged niceties and talked around policy issues. Mr. Trump later spoke of their "great personal relationship" when negotiations for a new North American Free Trade Agreement began.
The issue of trade, though, would prove their downfall.
Their breakup began in May 2018, when Mr. Trump announced that he was expanding tariffs on steel and aluminum to include Canada, the biggest exporter of the two metals to the United States. Canada returned the favor, swiftly announcing its own tariffs on $ 12.8 billion worth of American goods.
A tense phone call followed -- in which Mr. Trump brought up unfounded accusations of 200-year-old acts of aggression by Canada against the United States. By the time the Group of 7 summit meeting rolled round in June 2018, they were no longer holding back.
"Canadians are polite, we're reasonable but we also will not be pushed around," Mr. Trudeau said.
Mr. Trump bailed on the meeting early, and sent a pair of tweets calling Mr. Trudeau "very dishonest & weak." He said the United States would not sign the agreement that the other participants had agreed on.
Abe: A courtship through golf but few tangible results
Mr. Trump and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan have logged a lot of hours together. They visited a sumo arena. They had dinners with their spouses. And they played golf -- both at Mr. Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida and during a May visit by the American president to Tokyo.
"We got to know each other very, very well" on the golf course, Mr. Trump told reporters in 2017.
Aligning himself to Mr. Trump has been a critical part of Mr. Abe's strategy to secure a beneficial bilateral trade deal with the United States, an agreement Mr. Trump had vowed would "be something very exciting." And when Mr. Trump visited Tokyo, Mr. Abe described the occasion as an opportunity to enshrine the "unshakable bond" between them.
But Mr. Trump spent much of his time during that visit focusing on domestic issues, and in some cases his own grievances rather than relations with Japan.
And despite the dinners and time together, the two have been able to agree on only a limited trade deal that leaves out Japanese cars, industrial goods from the United States and farm products like rice, butter and sugar.
For Mr. Abe, the question is whether his investment in courting Mr. Trump has been worth it.

Never Mind the Bullock; But plenty of voters still want a moderate Democrat for President.

Texto completo: Montana's Steve Bullock, a two-term governor from a conservative state, has quit the race for the Democratic presidential nomination. But his exit doesn't mean Democratic primary voters aren't shopping for a moderate candidate. A new poll out Monday suggests Democrats are still more interested in beating Donald Trump than in fomenting socialist revolution.
As for today's drop-out, Emily Glazer notes in the Journal that Mr. Bullock "was the only one of the Democratic presidential hopefuls who was elected to statewide office in a state Mr. Trump carried in 2016."
Reid Epstein and Matt Stevens add in the New York Times:
A Columbia University-educated lawyer who had served as Montana's attorney general, Mr. Bullock made his name as a pragmatist who was able to win Republican support for liberal priorities. He was twice elected governor of a state that President Trump carried by more than 20 percentage points.
Mr. Bullock... cautioned voters that the party's leading contenders, including Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, were focused on issues like calling for a single-payer health care system that he warned would cost Democrats in a general election against Mr. Trump.
"Many of the issues that folks are talking about through this primary, they sound good through the primary, but I don't know that that's what's going to be able to win this overall election," he said in the September interview in Iowa. "I have grave concerns that we're already on our way to losing this election."
He certainly was on his way. But many in his party seem to have approved of his message, if not the messenger. A new Hill-HarrisX poll is consistent with other recent surveys showing eroding support for candidates demanding an end to private health insurance. Reporting the results of its poll, The Hill finds a clear leader in the race for the Democratic nomination:
Biden still holds the lead, inching up one percentage point to 31 percent support. His fellow top rivals saw a slight dip, with Sanders dropping 3 points to 15 percent support and Warren sliding 5 percentage points to 10 percent.
Further down in the rankings, a relatively moderate newcomer in the field is running ahead of a prominent liberal:
Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg (D) topped Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.)... The survey released on Monday found that support for the former mayor ticked up from 3 percent to 6 percent among likely Democratic voters and Democratic-leaning independents.
As for the leader in nationwide surveys among Democrats, Mr. Biden has not been polling as well in the key early battlegrounds of Iowa and New Hampshire. This may explain his new message, which manages to be both folksy and nasty. Natasha Korecki reports in Politico :
CARROLL, Iowa – "NO MALARKEY!" screams the campaign slogan on Joe Biden's bus chugging through 18 Iowa counties this week. At stops along the way, aides hand out stickers and posters featuring the rallying cry...
"It's aptly named — the reason we named it 'No Malarkey' is because the other guys all lie," Biden told one Iowa crowd. "So we want to make sure there is a contrast, what we're talking about here."
Yet Mr. Biden's struggles in early states don't seem to be helping the two candidates most committed to the abolition of private health plans —Sens. Warren and Sanders. And now there's more bad news for "progressives."
Economists have lately been poking holes in the theory that U.S. income inequality has risen dramatically in recent decades—and in the claim that the wealthiest Americans pay lower tax rates than the rest of us. Now a new paper from the National Bureau of Economic Research suggests that some inequality simply results from well-educated, white-collar workers putting in longer hours. Rodrigo Fuentes and Edward Leamer summarize their findings :
This paper provides theory and evidence that worker effort has played an important role in the increase in income inequality in the United States between 1980 and 2016... incomes rose only for those with advanced degrees and with weekly hours in excess of 40. We attribute this to the natural talent needed to make a computer deliver exceptional value and to the relative ease with which long hours can be chosen when working over the Internet.
The Washington Post's Robert Samuelson observes that the Internet "has apparently turned millions among us into workaholics, lugging around our laptops, ready at a moment's notice to tackle the latest digital chore."

President Trump’s reversal on vaping the right call for public health

Texto completo: Annie Karni, Maggie Haberman, and Sheila Kaplan of the New York Times describe US president Donald Trump’s proposed ban on flavored e-cigarette products as “a swift and bold reaction to a growing public health crisis affecting teenagers” that Trump backed away from “under pressure from his political advisers and lobbyists to factor in the potential pushback from his supporters.”
Maybe they’re right about Trump’s motivations, but they’re wrong about pretty much everything else.
E-cigarettes are not a “public health crisis.” That supposed crisis is not “growing.” And to the extent that teenagers are negatively affected by e-cigarettes, the very “bold reactions” the three writers seem to favor are far more culpable than e-cigarettes themselves.
E-cigarettes are, according to all credible evidence, safer than burning sticks of tobacco — sorry, FDA, you don’t get to tell me I can’t say so.
A few cases of lung injury from black market “street vapes” have been reported, the cause (use of vitamin E in the “juice”) seems to have been identified, and that problem is already disappearing in the rear-view mirror.
Who buys “street vapes?” People who can’t buy the e-cigarette products they want legally, either because of content (cannabis) or age (the teenagers the Times authors imply they care about so much).
Banning flavored e-cigarette products wouldn’t stop teenagers, or anyone else, from getting flavored e-cigarette products. It would just send even more of them to the “street vape” market for those products.
If Trump reconsidered his proposed ban due to political pressure and the desire to be re-elected, so what? A good decision is a good decision.
President Franklin Delano Roosevelt once told a group of lobbyists, who were pushing a policy change at him, “Okay, you’ve convinced me. Now go out and bring pressure on me.”
That’s how politics works. Politicians appease voters and activist groups who can help or harm their careers. Sometimes that works out well for the public, sometimes it works out badly.
In this case it works out well — certainly for the public, and possibly for Trump. Much of the “I Vape and I Vote” demographic presumably falls outside his existing electoral “base,” and for at least some the issue matters enough to swing their votes.
Now Trump’s Democratic opponents need to decide which they value more: Their desire to run everyone’s lives at the expense of actual public health, or public health and those votes.

Texto completo: Who says pop culture has become too safe?
I left a recent matinee of "Queen & Slim," the mesmerizing new outlaw romance directed by Melina Matsoukas, astonished on two levels. The film itself kept me rapt; I cried through the end and left the theater with the dazed, disoriented feeling you get when a movie makes you momentarily forget everything else in your life. But as amazed as I was by the experience of watching the film, I was equally amazed that it got made at all.
"Queen & Slim" is about a black man and a black woman -- we don't learn their real names until the very end -- who, following a desultory first date, get caught in a traffic stop that goes hideously wrong. The policeman who pulls them over becomes needlessly aggressive, and when Queen, a defense attorney, tries to record him with her phone, he shoots her. In the scuffle that follows, the cop is killed, and the couple, their fates suddenly soldered together, go on the run.
From the title on, the film invites comparisons to Hollywood classics like "Bonnie and Clyde" and, especially, "Thelma & Louise." (It can't be a coincidence that the fugitives in "Queen & Slim," like those in "Thelma & Louise," spend much of the film in a flashy vintage turquoise car.) Producing those earlier movies, both subversive in different ways, was famously difficult. A studio executive reportedly complained about the "Thelma & Louise" screenplay, "Two bitches in a car. I don't get it."
I'd have guessed that the path for "Queen & Slim" -- a film steeped in the politics of Black Lives Matter and helmed by a first-time director who is a woman of color -- would have been even more difficult.
But I'd have guessed wrong. Speaking to Variety, the producer and screenwriter Lena Waithe made working with Universal Pictures seem like an artist's dream. "They just paid for the movie and supported us, and let us do our thing, which was incredible," she said.
A common lament of our time is that our culture has become too safe, and that no one can say anything provocative anymore. "Everyone fears the wrath of the Twitter mob and the social justice warriors and the P.C. police," Bill Maher told The New York Times Magazine in September. There is certainly something to this -- I know that while I try to write without concern for social media, it still inhibits me.
But it's equally true that many artists, performers and thinkers have more freedom to tell transgressive stories than ever before. We don't have more cultural taboos than we used to -- far from it. We just have more contention over who should have the power to create and enforce them.
One of the most celebrated works on Broadway right now, "Slave Play," is also the most shocking piece of theater I've ever seen. It's built around an absurdist conceit. Three interracial couples attend a retreat at a former plantation. There, they undergo something called "antebellum sexual performance therapy," which basically means using slavery-themed sadomasochism scenarios to help the black partners work through racial trauma.
Though "Slave Play," which was written and directed by queer black men, takes a lot of the assumptions of what might be called social justice culture for granted, it's nevertheless promiscuous in its provocations. (A central conflict revolves around a black woman furious at her white husband's refusal to racially degrade her during sex.) When it premiered Off Broadway last year, it attracted outrage, including a Change.org petition calling for its cancellation on account of "anti-black sentiment."
On Friday, a white woman started shouting during a post-show Q. and A. because she was angry about the play's depiction of white people. Such responses, however, haven't stopped "Slave Play" from becoming a sensation. They've probably made it more of one.
Of course, white artists and performers aggrieved by political correctness may not be comforted that artists of color are able to create daring work. They might find more consolation in the resurrection of Louis C.K.
One of the men ostensibly felled by the #MeToo movement, Louis C.K.'s career was derailed for about nine months after news broke of his sexual misconduct with women in his industry. Now performing again, he was recently in the news for making a Holocaust joke in Israel. The crowd reportedly loved it, even if Twitter didn't. He'll be on tour in America soon; most of the dates are sold out.
What men like Louis C.K. or Maher have lost isn't the right to offend, or to make a living, but their place on the cultural cutting edge. That kind of loss feels real; the process of going from being ahead of your time to behind it is a painful one. But the forces that leave some artists and performers feeling newly constrained have liberated others to take risks. Writing about "Queen & Slim" in The New Yorker, Jelani Cobb said, "This is a film that stands as strong a chance of being hailed and lauded as it does of being denounced and picketed."
Twitter rage can be scary, but surely it requires at least as much courage for a Hollywood movie to take on the police.

Texto completo: Much ado has been made about various facets of Martin Scorsese's 'The Irishman,' from its marathon run-time of three and a half hours to the uncanny technology used to de-age its stars to the fact that most viewers will watch the master director's epic on Netflix instead of in a movie theater. Heck, even Scorsese's feelings on Marvel movies " spoiler alert: He's not fond of them, a fact that should shock just about no one but seemed to shock everyone " entered the dialogue surrounding this flick.
In all this, we've collectively overlooked one of the most exciting aspects of the movie: the Joe Pesci of it all. Because Joe Pesci is back, baby!
Look, we pop culture writers love to declare that someone's having some sort of renaissance, which we often celebrate by taking an actor's name and adding - aissance to it. That's how this very reporter came to write about the Keanussaince and the Goldblumaissance, even though Keanu Reeves and Jeff Goldblum never actually disappeared for a significant portion of time. Because, not to lift up the curtain too high, actors rarely actually go quiet for long, so every 'comeback' tends to be a somewhat contrived way of saying that someone is suddenly receiving attention again.
It may seem, at first glance, that Pesci is one such case. He's been a constant in many of our lives. Can you count how many times you've seen Pesci's face on your television in those decades? If you're anything like the rest of us lazy early-afternoon or late-night cable surfers, then just between 'Goodfellas,' 'My Cousin Vinny' and 'Home Alone,' that number probably flirts with triple digits.
But truth is, Joe Pesci is literally having a comeback. Before 'The Irishman,' he'd appeared in three major projects since 1998: a small role in 2006's 'The Good Shepherd,' the second film directed by his friend Robert De Niro; 2010's 'Love Ranch,' about the couple who opened the first legal brothel in Nevada; and (his voice in) 2015's animated 'A Warrior's Tail.' (For comparison, in 1992 alone, he appeared in four movies and a TV show).
In some ways, his entire life seems like a Sisyphean exercise in attempting to avoid working as an actor.
The New Jersey-born Italian American actor entered show business earlier than most of us enter school. As a 5-year-old, he acted in plays around New York City. By 10, he regularly appeared on TV's 'Startime Kids,' a variety show. Meanwhile, he continued focusing on music. As a teenager, he introduced his friends Tommy DeVito and Frankie Valli to Bob Gaudio. The three, of course, went on to found the Four Seasons.
The sad irony lies in the fact that he might have been happier if none of this occurred. With good intentions, his blue-collar father, Angelo, forced showbiz upon him, and he always sounded resentful of his path.
'My father would push me to do it, as everyone pushes their kids, which I don't agree with. I grew up in the business. I had no choice,' he told the New York Times in 1992. 'My father loved me so much that he did not want me to be a laborer or anything. I don't know if it's the right thing to do " push your kids into something and then stay on them until they do it. Let them pick what they want to do.'
In fact, after a brief stint in Hollywood, during which he appeared in the 1976 indie 'The Death Collector,' Pesci packed up and moved to the Bronx to manage a restaurant named Amici's. That little movie caught the eye of Scorsese and De Niro, however, and he was pulled back into show business with his role in 'Raging Bull.'
At that point, he became a bona fide actor, nabbing parts in 'Once Upon a Time in America,' 'Man on Fire' and even 'Home Alone' while continuing to work with Scorsese in such classics as 'Goodfellas' and 'Casino.'
Did he enjoy it, though?
When the man won an Oscar for his work in 'Goodfellas,' he gave the most memorable speech in the award's history " apologies to Matt Damon and Ben Affleck. It's five words long. Not one of them is wasted.
'It's my privilege. Thank you.'
Sure, he later said the short speech derived from the fact that he didn't expect to win, but it certainly seems like he might have been happier at Amici's.
Then the typecasting began. He'd always played Mafia types, generally unhinged psychopaths who went from zero to murder in a second flat. That Italian Brooklyn accent. That kinetic energy packed into his short frame, ready to furiously explode. That near-manic voice. All of it combined beautifully and terribly in the hands of a skilled director. That's what makes his 'You think I'm funny? Funny how, like a clown?' speech so powerful in 'Goodfellas' and his lawyer such a hilarious fish-out-of-water in 'My Cousin Vinny.'
Soon, though, every time any second-rate director needed a 'Joe Pesci-type,' they simply typecast Joe Pesci. After '8 Heads in a Duffel Bag' and 'Gone Fishin',' the man was done.
In his own quiet way, Pesci showed a fortitude most don't possess. He walked away. He walked away to play jazz and golf " which sounds fantastic, without a doubt " but he stepped away nonetheless. And he was serious about it. Famously, back when Louis C.K. was beloved, the comedian attempted to get Pesci to star in his Web series 'Horace - Pete.' The semiretired actor not only turned down the offer but told C.K. that he should try a different line of work because he was terrible at stand-up. He made a surprising appearance in a Google commercial during 2019's Super Bowl LII, but even that spot played with the idea of a Pesci drought. The ad found Pesci watching a modern-day version of 'Home Alone,' though when his 'big scene' arrives we never actually see him.
He didn't return in a major project until he could do something he felt was important, or at least until he was pestered enough. He reportedly turned down a role in 'The Irishman' a whopping 40 times before De Niro persuaded him to join. 'We're friends and he loves Marty and I said, 'Come on, this is it, let's do it, let's try and do it,'' De Niro told the Hollywood Reporter. 'He understood, he loves Marty and wanted the experience of working with him again and me and Al [Pacino].'
'The Irishman' is about growing older, perhaps growing irrelevant, and looking back at all the choices that make up a life. It's about time and regret. Pesci gives a phenomenal performance as Russell Bufalino, a mobster who takes hit man Frank Sheeran (De Niro) under his wing. Unlike the characters of his past, Pesci's Bufalino is a somewhat quiet, extraordinarily measured man. Business is business, but there's no personal score settling, no nonsense. After nearly a decade, Pesci returned with the most thoughtful, restrained performance of his career.
So naturally, journalists would want to ask the actor about his time off-screen. But that certainly doesn't mean he wants to reflect on those years publicly. Perhaps nothing sums up Pesci's attitude toward Hollywood more than a recent Q-A session at the New York Film Festival, where a panel moderator said to him, 'I'm wondering if you could talk about coming on board this project . . . It's been a while since you appeared in a film.'
'No,' Pesci flatly replied. 'I don't know what to say.'
After a brief pause, he added, 'Thank you for asking.'

GOP should heed Gorton's words

Texto completo: He is 91 now, decades removed from politics. But with former U.S. Sen. Slade Gorton presenting a thoughtful opinion piece in the New York Times last week, I am reminded of the time he visited The Columbian's Editorial Board.
It was three years ago, and Gorton had some prescient thoughts about the presidential election that was underway.
“Trump wants to make a deal. He talks about how well he is at making deals. But Trump's definition of a deal is, ‘I win, you lose;' it's a zero-sum game,” Gorton said in May 2016. “But the deals the president of the United States makes aren't like that. With a really good deal, both sides benefit.”
Sounds insightful. Trump has spent his presidency tearing down international relationships and violating the Emoluments Clause. And for anybody who insists Trump is working for the good of the United States rather than his personal interests, we ask one simple question: What in the world are Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner doing in the White House?
Not that Gorton was enamored with Hillary Clinton. The Democratic nominee, he said, “has no guiding philosophy except what's good for the Clinton family.”
Like we said, Gorton is insightful.
Which brings up the op-ed he wrote under the headline, “My Fellow Republicans, Please Follow the Facts.” It is about the impeachment hearings surrounding Trump's efforts to get Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden, and it cut through a lot of the rhetoric on both sides of the issue.
“To my fellow Republicans, I give this grave and genuine warning: It's not enough merely to dismiss the Ukraine investigation as a partisan witch hunt or to hide behind attacks against the ‘deep state,' or to try to find some reason to denounce every witness who steps forward, from decorated veterans to Trump megadonors,” Gorton wrote.
“History demands that we all wrestle with the facts at hand. They are unavoidable. Fifty years from now, history will not accept the position that impeachment was a referendum on the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi. It must be a verdict reached on the facts.”
Well said. Of course, partisans on both sides have found cause to disagree on what those facts mean, and those partisans never will reach unanimity. But Gorton's recommendation of following the facts is preferable to the approach embraced by most Republicans in Congress.
Take Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler, R-Battle Ground. When the Democratic-led House of Representatives voted to launch an impeachment investigation, Herrera Beutler echoed her party's complaints about the process rather than expressing a desire to get to the truth. It was, frankly, shameful. And it was exactly the head-in-the-sand partisanship that Gorton is warning us about.
“Make no mistake: This is precisely the kind of crisis Alexander Hamilton feared,” Gorton writes. “In Federalist No. 75, he warned that a president might be tempted to betray the interests of the country for his own benefit, ‘to sacrifice his duty to his interest, which it would require superlative virtue to withstand'; that ‘an avaricious man might be tempted to betray the interests of the state to the acquisition of wealth'; that a president might ‘make his own aggrandizement, by the aid of a foreign power, the price of his treachery to his constituents.'
“Given the temptations a president might have in dealing with foreign powers, Hamilton's solution was equally clear: Congress should be involved.”
Sacrifice his duty? Avaricious? Aggrandizement? It's almost as if Hamilton knew Trump personally.
All of which has brought us to impeachment hearings, with witnesses testifying that the president withheld military aid for Ukraine while seeking a political investigation for his own benefit. All of which has led a former U.S. senator to write to members of his own party, “Don't fight the process, follow the facts wherever they lead, and put country above party.”
That sounds as if Slade Gorton

Texto completo: Reviewers for The Washington Post and The New York Times picked 20 favorites for 2019, overlapping in just one choice: Ben Lerner's novel "The Topeka School." Across the board, the works tend to draw on serious issues that affect us, stateside or abroad.
From The Washington Post:
Fiction
"Black Leopard, Red Wolf" by Marlon James: Inspired by African mythology, James, a Booker Prize winner, turns a motley group's quest to find a missing boy into a fast-paced, fantastical adventure. These contentious companions explore a hyper-violent world of lush jungles, cities in the sky and dark forests, and they confront a catalog of creatures: ferocious trolls, giant bats and a bloodsucking fiend made entirely of flies. Clearly, Hollywood special effects are still playing catch-up with the magic our very best writers can spin.
"Girl, Woman, Other" by Bernardine Evaristo: The co-winner of the 2019 Booker Prize (alongside Margaret Atwood's "The Testaments") is composed of novella-length chapters that draw us deep into the lives of a dozen women in Britain of various backgrounds and experiences. As the novel progresses, their connections accrue gradually, allowing us moments of understanding spiked with surprise. Evaristo skillfully weaves these tales together, creating a breathtaking symphony of black women's voices, a clear-eyed survey of contemporary challenges that is nevertheless wonderfully life-affirming.
"On Earth We're Briefly Gorgeous" by Ocean Vuong: This debut novel by a Saigon-born poet is labeled fiction but draws heavily on the events of the author's life. The daring mix of historical recollection and sexual exploration is framed as a candid letter to the narrator's mother, a volcanic woman whose life was made possible by the Vietnam War. (Her father was a U.S. soldier.) Vuong's willingness to solve the equation of his own existence, no matter its components, is a hallmark of this poignant and lyrical work of self-discovery.
"Strangers and Cousins" by Leah Hager Cohen: The tale of a quirky family planning a wedding in a tumble-down house contains all the promise of an arthritic romantic comedy, but, as masterfully told by Cohen, it's an absolute delight infused with the most pressing concerns of our era. The story expands to look at a historical tragedy and a current battle over an influx of ultra-Orthodox Jewish residents in the surrounding town. Cohen takes comedy seriously, and it shows in this disarmingly substantive story that's funny, tender, provocative and wise.
"The Topeka School" by Ben Lerner: Here is that all-too-rare masterpiece: a svelte big novel. Lerner does what only great novelists can, which is explore the condition of the whole country in the particular story of a few characters in a small town. He takes us back to Kansas in the 1990s where a high school debate team star and his mother, a psychotherapist, contend with the increasingly toxic language that passes for civil discourse in America.
Nonfiction
"Falter: Has the Human Game Begun to Play Itself Out?" by Bill McKibben: With 1989's "The End of Nature," McKibben was among the first to alert the public to climate change. His latest book is a sprint through what we've done to the planet and what we can do about it now. Determined to keep the words "climate change" from fading into our "mental furniture," he has gathered the most vivid statistics, distilled history to its juiciest turns and made the case as urgently as can be: Our existence is in jeopardy.
"A Good Provider Is One Who Leaves: One Family and Migration in the 21st Century" by Jason DeParle: A riveting multigenerational tale of one Filipino family dispersing across the globe - from Manila to Abu Dhabi to Galveston, Tex., and so many places in between - as parents leave their kids for years at a time to send home wages many multiples of what they previously earned. As immigration emerges as a central political battleground in the Trump era, this book provides crucial insight into the global scope, shifting profiles and, above all, individual sacrifices of the migrant experience.
"Know My Name" by Chanel Miller: Miller, formerly known as Emily Doe, the victim of a sexual assault by Brock Turner, deliberately and triumphantly reclaims her story by drawing a clear-eyed portrait of how difficult it is for rape victims to get justice, and how the process serves as its own kind of re-victimization. In haunting prose, Miller documents a broken system, or several, which her book indicts one by one. "Know My Name" is a gut-punch, yes, but also blessedly hopeful.
"Say Nothing: A True Story of Murder and Memory in Northern Ireland" by Patrick Radden Keefe: This examination of "the Troubles" in Northern Ireland begins with the 1972 murder of Jean McConville, a widowed mother of 10 suspected of being a British informant. Keefe interweaves her story with the rise of Dolours Price, an Irish Republican Army member who was involved in McConville's death. With its dual portrait of an obscure victim and a notorious revolutionary, "Say Nothing" is a cautionary tale about the zealotry of youth, the long-term consequences of violence, and the politics of forgetting.
"The Yellow House" by Sarah M. Broom: Broom's stirring memoir, the winner of the 2019 National Book Award for nonfiction, is set in New Orleans East, a part of the city that tourists don't visit. The yellow house of the title, Broom's family home, is the pride, hope and prison of a black, working-class family. After it is destroyed during Hurricane Katrina, it also becomes a symbol of the issues confronting us today: pernicious racism, corporate greed, displacement and the improbable arithmetic of survival as a member of the working poor.
From The New York Times:
"Best" is "not necessarily all the books we love," said Pamela Paul, editor of the New York Times Book Review, in an account reported by the Publishers Lunch newsletter. "These are books we think will endure."

Texto completo: Asian Americans are often invisible in American culture, and judging by the experience of presidential candidate Andrew Yang, even more so in politics.
Many Asian Americans will relate: White people regularly cut ahead of me in line and then are surprised when I call them out. My Korean American assistant recently reported that a man tried to walk through her on the sidewalk as if she wasn't there. An invitation on Facebook to talk about such invisibility filled up within minutes, with many Asian Americans saying that being ignored or dismissed happens on a daily basis.
Despite Andrew Yang qualifying for every debate so far, media outlets have left him out of various graphics so many times, a supporter created a visual history on Twitter accompanied by a #YangMediaBlackout hashtag on social media, believing this erasure is more than coincidence. Watchdog groups like Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting noted on Twitter, "@AndrewYang is tied for 8th place in the Democratic race -- yet he's not one of the 20 candidates included in @MSNBC's candidate graphic."

Last week, Yang called out MSNBC for omitting him "12+ times" and vowed not to appear on any more MSNBC shows until this is acknowledged.
As a young child in an all-white town, no matter how much I raised my hand in school or tried to make my voice heard, I was ignored so often I learned to use quietness to my advantage. Perceptive teachers would break up whatever raucous clamor that was going on to say, "Let Marie have a turn." Or they'd clear a path for me to have a chance to say what I wanted -- it's no coincidence the title of my first novel is "Finding My Voice ."
I am not a Yang partisan. I wrote an article in September criticizing him for using model minority stereotypes, such as calling himself "an Asian guy good at math." But now, I'm wondering if Yang, denied visibility, is deploying stereotypes as a subversive way to actually get visibility.
The question that Asian American actors and now politicians face is: Is it worth it to take on a role that requires you to traffic in stereotypes in order to garner power, enough to put an Asian face in government, in the popular imagination?
There is no way to prove these omissions are related to Yang's being Asian, but it's impossible to miss the similarities with the micro (and macro) aggressions people in the Asian American community experience daily.
He has been mixed up with Jerry Yang, the founder of Yahoo.
He has been mixed up with John Yang, of NPR.
He has been mixed up with my friend and fellow writer, Jeff Yang.
Yang's platform includes automation, cannabis legalization, a value-added tax for tech and, most famously, his plan to create a national basic income or "freedom dividend." He is not running on foreign policy experience. And yet, during the first debate, the American-born (obviously: he's running for president) Yang, who is of Taiwanese descent, was asked only two questions. One was about China.
In the most recent debate, on Nov. 20, Yang was ignored for 30 minutes before being asked a question. While still on the debate stage Yang tweeted that in four out of five debates, he's been allotted the least amount of time (6.9 minutes), despite polling ahead of longtime senators Cory Booker and Amy Klobuchar.
The "bamboo ceiling" is a term used in academic circles to describe disadvantages in the job market, where qualified Asian Americans "haven't been able to climb up the professional ladder," according to Columbia sociologist Jennifer Lee, author of "The Asian American Achievement Paradox."
I can't help but recall how many times during my years in investment banking I was spoken over, mixed up with the only other Asian person in my department of 200. My ideas were stolen, and I was overlooked for promotions.
Invisibility is hard to pin down precisely because you can't see it. When few Asian Americans are in the top tier of leadership, the visual narrative conveys we are somehow not qualified.
Van Tran, a City University of New York sociologist whose work focuses on Asian Americans and social inequality, characterizes Yang's candidacy as a tale of two extremes: "Asians from certain groups have exceeded whites in education and income, but are still behind whites in terms of wealth and power."
I live and work in New York City, where some Asian groups are among the city's poorest. Yang has been portrayed as an Asian tech zillionaire when his actual net worth, according to the candidates' own filings, is among the lower tier, near that of Bernie Sanders, while Elizabeth Warren is near the top along with Michael Bennet, an actual tech billionaire.
To underscore the idea of Asian American invisibility: Yang is not even the first Asian American candidate to run for president.
That was Hiram Fong, a Republican, who ran in 1964 and 1968 but did not have significant support outside his home state of Hawaii. The same went for Patsy Mink, a Democratic congresswoman from Hawaii who ran in 1972. Former Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal sought the Republican nomination in 2016.
Kamala Harris is also running a national campaign. But in the visibility narrative, she has been described by the Los Angeles Times and the New York Times, among others, not as Asian but as the second black woman elected to the U.S. Senate. Her mother is of Tamil Indian descent, and her father is black.
Yang's candidacy may tell our Asian American children that one day, they, too, can run for president. Or, it may tell them that even if you work hard and play by the rules, there's only so far you can go. A candidate who can't be seen can't win.

Texto completo: Love it or leave it, country music " with its whiskey-soaked nostalgia and crying steel guitars, its trains, trucks and lost love " is a defining feature of the American soundscape. This fall, Ken Burns's documentary series, along with an outpouring of Dolly Parton tributes on NPR, Netflix and the stage at the Grand Ole Opry, has trained a spotlight on the genre. Still, myths infuse many people's understanding of country music " and some of them are integral to its appeal.
Myth No. 1 Country is white music for white people. ' Country is just white to the bone,' the Daily Beast wrote in September. This racial association is so strongly embedded in American culture that it recently supplied the punchline for a 'Saturday Night Live' skit, in which Kenan Thompson quipped, 'A sea of white faces is just looking back at me, and I thought, oh, Lord help me, this must be what it's like to be Darius Rucker!'
In fact, the genre's signature sound has diverse roots. African American string bands were common in the late 19th and early 20th centuries " and played the same types of music, on the same types of instruments, as their white counterparts. Jimmie Rodgers, the 'father of country music,' made a number of recordings with African American musicians, including Louis Armstrong. In the 1940s and '50s, Mexican performers in the Southwest United States mixed their musical styles, including ranchera and norteño, with country; mariachi-style trumpets are heard on Johnny Cash's 'Ring of Fire.' Johnny Rodriguez, whose songs featuring Spanish lyrics topped the country charts starting in the 1970s, amplified similar influences. -
Today, the sounds of Sam Hunt, Chris Stapleton and Sturgill Simpson unapologetically blend soul and country. Within the past year, rapper Lil Nas X had a viral hit, 'Old Town Road,' that challenged listeners' " and the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart's " definition of the genre, and Jimmie Allen, another African American artist, debuted with a No. 1 single on country radio, a ballad called 'Best Shot.' According to a survey by the Country Music Association, the genre's fastest-growing audience is non-white and Hispanic listeners.
Myth No. 2 Country music listeners are mostly working-class. From Kacey Musgraves's 'Blowin' Smoke' to Travis Tritt's 'Lord Have Mercy on the Working Man,' working-class narratives are a staple of country lyrics. The claim that the working class constitutes the genre's 'core audience' has been repeated by sources from Nash Country Daily to the Oklahoma Historical Society .
Country music is certainly rooted in the working class, but as America's midcentury prosperity spurred migration to suburban and urban settings, the audience changed. Beginning in the 1960s, as historian Diane Pecknold documents in 'The Selling Sound,' the recently formed Country Music Association sent representatives to explain to radio station owners and advertisers that country fans were part of the middle-class consumer demographic, with plenty of disposable income. One industry rep said, 'The songwriter who once tended stock on his daddy's farm is now consulting his broker regarding another kind of stock.'
Demographic surveys over the past decade have consistently revealed that the fanbase is better-educated and more affluent than even record executives typically assume. Country music fans have slightly higher-than-average annual household income and rates of home ownership than the general population, and are more likely to be executives and professionals, according to the CMA's ' Snapshot of the Country Listener ' from this year.
Myth No. 3 Country is red-state music. When the Dixie Chicks sparked a backlash in 2003 by criticizing President George W. Bush, one radio programmer commented that the genre is 'more on the right than on the left, and it's always been that way.' The New York Times once encouraged liberals to tune in to country to understand ' what lurks in the heart of a Red State voter .' In 2018, Psychology Today tried to explain 'Why Republicans Listen to Country Music and Democrats Don't.'
But country music listeners aren't wholly conservative. A 2016 Nielsen survey revealed that 'just as many Democratic voters listen to Country radio as Republican voters' in major radio markets. Throughout its history, the genre's-strongly populist leaning has left ample room for a range of political perspectives: Country artists recorded both tributes to and parodies of the New Deal. Today, many country musicians quietly allow fans of all allegiances to assume they agree with them. As singer-songwriter Dylan Scott told The Washington Post in 2017, 'Everyone's got an opinion. And as soon as you give your opinion, somebody's going to hate your opinion and not buy your music.' Others, however, have declared staunch loyalties, including on the left. In 2008, for example, songwriter Gretchen Peters objected to Sarah Palin using her song 'Independence Day' at campaign events, and she donated the song's royalties to Planned Parenthood. Last year, Willie Nelson headlined a Beto O'Rourke rally , where he debuted a new song, 'Vote 'Em Out.'
Myth No. 4 In the past, there were more women in country music. As recent years have brought much-needed attention to the gender disparity in country radio airplay, some commentators have claimed that the problem is worse today than in the 1960s and '70s. 'Where have country music's women gone?' asked the Guardian in 2016. Promoting a special program on the genre's female pioneers, Virginia radio station WHRO claimed that 'by the late 1960s, the country radio airwaves were flooded with female singers .' It's easy to understand why the myth persists: Tammy Wynette, Dolly Parton, Lynn Anderson and Loretta Lynn rocketed to stardom in that classic era.
But a quick check of industry charts reveals that the gender split was no better back then. Billboard's recent chart from Nov. 9 featured five solo female artists in the top 30, along with two bands or duets with female singers. Its chart from Aug. 22, 1970 " the first time Parton cracked the top 10 " had five solo female artists in the top 30, along with three male-female pairs. Some brief periods have offered exceptions to this status quo: In the 1990s, for example, women featured more prominently on country radio. But according to an analysis by musicologist Jada Watson, representation steadily declined over the next two decades. Today, the number of women on country radio is approximately at the same dismal level as it was 50 years ago.
Myth No. 5 Country singers write their own songs about their real lives. Country music has long relied on the perception that its singers are telling first-person tales. Artists often craft the presentation of their songs to suggest an autobiographical connection, such as when Patty Loveless included photos of her coal-miner father in the album liner notes to her recording of 'You'll Never Leave Harlan Alive.' More recently, fans received Tim McGraw's 2004 recording of 'Live Like You Were Dying' as a personal account of his father's death from cancer. Miranda Lambert's parents told the 'Today' show that they initially thought she penned her breakthrough hit, 'The House That Built Me,' which echoes her Texas childhood spent on the brink of poverty.
In fact, all three songs were written by professional songwriters. Though more artists these days have at least some hand in writing the songs they record, traditionally, the country music industry has treated composition and performance as separate jobs. For decades, the professional songwriting community in Nashville largely stayed out of the spotlight: Fans are often surprised to learn that superstars such as George Strait and Reba McEntire have written few to none of their own hits, or that Blake Shelton has a writer's credit on only two of the 25 singles he has released since 2010.

Diving deep into statistics about race Other views

Texto completo: Former presidential candidate Beto O'Rourke said that racism in America is "foundational" and that people of color were under "mortal threat" from the "white supremacist in the White House." Pete Buttigieg chimed in to explain that "systemic racism" will "be with us" no matter who is in the White House. Sen. Cory Booker called for "attacking systemic racism" in the "racially biased" criminal justice system.
Let's follow up by examining Booker's concern about a "racially biased" criminal justice system. To do that, we can turn to a recent article by Heather Mac Donald, who is a senior fellow at the New York-based Manhattan Institute. She is a contributing editor of City Journal, and a New York Times bestselling author. Her most recent article, "A Platform of Urban Decline," which appeared in Manhattan Institute's publication Eye On The News, addresses race and crime. She reveals government statistics you've never read before.
According to leftist rhetoric, whites pose a severe, if not mortal, threat to blacks. Mac Donald says that may have once been true, but it is no longer so today. To make her case, she uses the latest Bureau of Justice Statistics 2018 survey of criminal victimization. Mac Donald writes: "According to the study, there were 593,598 interracial violent victimizations (excluding homicide) between blacks and whites last year, including white-on-black and black-on-white attacks. Blacks committed 537,204 of those interracial felonies, or 90%, and whites committed 56,394 of them, or less than 10%. That ratio is becoming more skewed, despite the Democratic claim of Trump-inspired white violence. In 2012-13, blacks committed 85% of all interracial victimizations between blacks and whites; whites committed 15%. From 2015 to 2018, the total number of white victims and the incidence of white victimization have grown as well."
There are other stark figures not talked about often. According to the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting for 2018, of the homicide victims for whom race was known, 53.3% were black, 43.8% were white and 2.8% were of other races. In cases where the race of the offender was known, 54.9% were black, 42.4% were white, and 2.7% were of other races.
White and black liberals, who claim that blacks face a "mortal threat" from the "white supremacist in the White House" are perpetuating a cruel hoax. The primary victims of that hoax are black people.
Mac Donald says that Barack Obama's 2008 Father's Day speech in Chicago would be seen today as an "unforgivable outburst of white supremacy." Here's what Obama told his predominantly black audience in a South Side church: "If we are honest with ourselves," too many fathers are "missing - missing from too many lives and too many homes. They have abandoned their responsibilities, acting like boys instead of men." Then-Sen. Obama went on to say, "Children who grow up without a father are five times more likely to live in poverty and commit crime; nine times more likely to drop out of schools and 20 times more likely to end up in prison."
White liberals deem that any speaker's references to personal responsibility brands the speaker as bigoted. White liberals don't pay the same price. They don't live in neighborhoods where their children can get shot simply sitting on their porches. White liberals don't live in neighborhoods that have become economic wastelands. Their children don't attend violent schools where they have to enter through metal detectors. White liberals help the Democratic Party maintain political control over cities, where many black residents live in despair.
Black people cannot afford to remain fodder for the liberal agenda. With that in mind, we should not be a one-party people in a two-party system.

Texto completo: NEW YORK — William Ruckelshaus, the first head of the Environmental Protection Agency who later became a heroic figure for resisting President Richard Nixon’s attempts to cover up the Watergate scandal, has died. He was 87.
He died Wednesday at his home in Seattle, according to The New York Times, citing his daughter Mary Ruckelshaus.
Named by Time magazine as one of the 10 best Cabinet officers of the 20th century, Ruckelshaus took charge of the newly created EPA in 1970 and made headlines for pushing through health-based standards for air pollutants and car emissions, and for banning the pesticide DDT.
In 1973, he became best known for defying Nixon’s order to fire Watergate special prosecutor Archibald Cox, who had subpoenaed the White House for copies of tapes made of conversations in the Oval Office.
After Nixon had cleaned house in his administration following the resignations of his top aides H.R. Haldeman and John Ehrlichman, Ruckelshaus became acting director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which was probing charges of abuses of power at the heart of the Watergate matter. He quickly became deputy attorney general, the No. 2 post at the Justice Department, under the new attorney general, Elliot Richardson.
Following the 1973 ouster of Nixon’s vice president, Spiro Agnew, based on evidence uncovered by the Justice Department, Richardson informed Ruckelshaus that Nixon wanted Cox fired in order to avoid turning over the incriminating tapes.
“I remember saying, ‘Don’t worry about it,’” Ruckelshaus said in a 2005 C-SPAN interview, recalling his response to his boss about the White House’s plan. “They’ll never do that. There would be too much of a public furor if they tried. Shows how little I knew.”
Richardson formally refused to fire Cox and resigned on Oct. 20, 1973. Ruckelshaus did the same, leaving the job to Robert Bork, the solicitor general. Nixon’s firing of Cox and the departures of Richardson and Ruckelshaus became known as the “Saturday Night Massacre.”
“I couldn’t have done anything else,” Ruckelshaus said, according to a 1976 article in People magazine. “What the president was asking me to do was fundamentally wrong.”
Ruckelshaus, who had been a legislator in Indiana before his Washington jobs, returned to his home state to practice law until 1975, when he moved his family to Seattle to become senior vice president of Weyerhaeuser Co.
President Ronald Reagan’s chief of staff, James Baker, persuaded Ruckelshaus in 1983 to return to the EPA, which was in disarray following the tenure of Anne Burford. He helped the agency impose controls on hazardous waste, restore and protect Chesapeake Bay in Maryland and Virginia and remove the pesticide ethylene dibromide, also known as EDB, from use on U.S. farms.
William Doyle Ruckelshaus was born July 24, 1932, in Indianapolis to John K. Ruckelshaus, a lawyer who was chairman of the Platform Committee at five Republican national conventions, and Marion Doyle Ruckelshaus. He had an older brother, John, and a younger sister, Bonney.
Ruckelshaus earned a bachelor’s degree at Princeton University in 1957 and a law degree at Harvard Law School three years later.
He was deputy attorney general in Indiana from 1960 to 1965 and became a member of the state’s House of Representatives in 1967.
After leaving government in 1985, Ruckelshaus joined the Seattle law firm Perkins Coie before becoming chief executive officer of Browning-Ferris Industries Inc. in 1988. Then serving as its chairman for 11 years, he left to become a principal at Madrona Investment Group LLC, a private investment business in Seattle, and also a partner in Madrona Venture Group.
Interested in the environment since his time in state government, “Ruck,” as his friends called him, was chairman of the World Resources Institute, a special envoy to the Pacific Salmon Treaty between the U.S. and Canada, and a member of the President’s Council for Sustainable Development from 1993 to 1997.
His first wife died while giving birth, leaving him a widower with twin daughters, Cathy and Mary, to care for. In 1962, he married Jill Strickland, with whom he had three more children: Jennifer, William Jr. and Robin.
Jill Ruckelshaus was an adviser on women’s rights to President Nixon and later a member of the U.S. Civil Rights Commission and the National Women’s Political Caucus. She resigned her White House post after Ruckelshaus’s resignation in the “Saturday Night Massacre.”

Texto completo: OGUNQUIT -- For his senior thesis at Bates College in Lewiston, senior studio art major Matt Tavares wrote and illustrated a children's picture book about a boy who caught a magic foul ball at Fenway Park.
He could not have imagined that 22 years after his graduation, he would have 20 published volumes, including his most recent - a lushly illustrated tale of how Santa got his reindeer.
"Dasher," the new book, landed on The New York Times' best-seller list shortly before Thanksgiving, a first for the acclaimed children's writer and illustrator.
Tavares is "very happily surprised" about that.
The book's roots lie in a call from his editor, who suggested he try a holiday-themed book featuring animal characters, the sort of volume that could, with a little luck, catch the public's eye.
Tavares said he liked the concept, but after mulling it all day "I came up with nothing" beyond the possibility it could focus on reindeer.
Then as he was making the 10-minute drive between his home and his 12-year-old daughter's basketball practice in Wells, "the whole story" came to him: a tale of a brave reindeer doe in a traveling circus, dreaming of freedom under the North Star.
Without giving much away, Dasher reaches Santa and the holiday magic triumphs, filling a major gap in the whole Santa story: Just where did those flying reindeer come from?
"It feels like the story of Christmas," Tavares said, and the words and art he produced to bring it to life have obviously resonated with others.
"It's fun to have this happen," he said, with "Dasher" now one of the best-selling children's books this season.
"Gorgeous illustrations make this one sure to fly off shelves 'like the down of a thistle,'" Kirkus Reviews pronounced.
Tavares, who grew up in Winchester, Massachusetts, a Boston suburb, said he's always loved to draw.
But he wasn't sure at age 17 that he was quite ready to commit himself to a career as an artist.
So he opted to go to Bates, a liberal arts school with a solid arts program in a new building that seemed to have smart teachers and a warm atmosphere.
"It just felt right," Tavares said.
Tavares felt comfortable heading to Maine for college. He'd been vacationing every summer in Ogunquit for years with his parents and three sisters, he said. His parents bought a place there when he was in about fifth grade, he said.
At Bates, he said, he thought about his future, trying "to figure out how to draw every day as a grown-up."
Paintings and galleries "never really appealed to me," Tavares said, but the picture books he remembered from childhood did.
As he contemplated his options, thinking about some Norman Rockwell creations he loved, the notion of illustrating a children's book began to grow on him.
"I was really drawn to that," he said, in part because "a children's book, it lasts forever," or at least a lot longer than the average illustration. Its permanence mattered to him.
Tavares had long recognized that the best children's books often contained some terrific art, from favorites such as Dr. Seuss to Bernard Waber's "Ira Sleeps Over," a 1972 volume he read "a million times" because he loved it so much.
Chris Van Allsburg's "The Widow's Broom," a 1992 children's book with gorgeous sepia-toned drawings, showed him what was possible artistically.
"Really into baseball," Tavares said, he decided to create a volume that focused on the game. He said he set it at Fenway Park because it "is this pretty magical place and I wanted to capture that as a book."
He said his professors encouraged him to try it. Tavares said his thesis adviser, Robert Feintuch, believed in letting students explore their ideas.
He hoped from the start that he could get the book published, but he didn't know anyone who could help.
"In a way, it's good that I knew nothing about the publishing industry and what I was up against," Tavares said.
He found an agent, though, who was a friend of a friend and she shopped the book around, landing him a deal with Candlewick Press that has served him well ever since.
After graduation in 1997, he moved to Arlington, Massachusetts, outside Boston, where he lived for five years, working on more books, often about baseball, and meeting the woman who became his wife, Sarah, a special education teacher who grew up in Wiscasset.
He and Sarah moved into the house in Ogunquit that Tavares' parents had bought years earlier, renting it at first and then buying it for themselves as they raised two children there.
Looking around his studio, with shelves full of children's books and graphic novels, Tavares said he can remember sitting in the room as a child, coloring with crayons.
He's come a long way, learning all sorts of techniques, including how to draw on a computer, to create stunning art.
Tavares, for instance, illustrated a book about Benjamin Franklin's boyhood that's due out in March. He just got the final proofs that show exactly what it will look like.
At one point, he said, an editor thought the Boston docks in one picture looked "too dusty," the sort of thing that would be tough to change on paper or canvas.
On the computer, though, Tavares said he simply removed the third of three layers of dust from the illustration, instantly making it less dusty.
He could also move ships or people around, getting everything just so.
For Tavares, the ability to keep learning new ways to create his art is part of the craft.
"It's fun to mix it up between the different kinds of books," he said.
It's not a lonely endeavor either.
Tavares said he talks often with others in his field. They even have a Skype group where they regularly offer tips and share their work.
"It's cool to see what other people are working on," Tavares said. "A good number of us are in Maine."
Looking around at shelves and cabinets full of his work, his table mostly clear with just a few pencil drawings at the edge, he said it's a good life.
"This is my favorite part," Tavares said, "getting to sit here in my studio and draw."
"This is really important to me. This is what I want to do," he said. "Kids are a great audience."

Texto completo: A key family hauler for much of the 20th century now accounts for a sliver of the American auto market.
If the automobile business in the United States is indeed a cyclical affair, the station wagon is due for a renaissance.
Just don't hold your breath.
The station wagon -- known also, depending on the culture, as an estate, an avant, a woodie, kombi or caravan -- was a key family hauler for much of the 20th century. Wagons shuttled goods to market, picked up arriving guests at the train station (a station wagon!), ferried the children to soccer and served as sleep-in digs for broke surfers.
But these long-roofed, two-box conveyances became victims of the gas crisis of the 1970s. Sales and demand eroded further in the '80s with the emergence of Chrysler's minivan. The big-time blow was struck in the '90s; it was called the sport utility vehicle.
For American wagon devotees seeking a new ride, the list is short and getting shorter. Wagons are a small fraction of the domestic car market. The survivors can be counted on one hand, give or take a couple of fingers. Wagons from Ford, Saturn and Chevrolet are history. The BMW 3 series and the Honda Accord wagons are taillights.
One particularly painful nail was pounded into the coffin this year by Volkswagen of America. The company announced that it would suspend production of the Golf Sportwagen and Golf Alltrack wagons to make room at its Mexico plant to build more, you got it, S.U.V.s.
"More than 50 percent of Volkswagen's American sales are now coming from S.U.V.s," said Mark Gillies, a spokesman for VW. "We have seen demand for the Sportwagen and Alltrack fall away dramatically over the past year, so it wasn't possible to make a business case for the next-generation Golf wagons in this market."
Jamie Lincoln Kitman, a columnist for Automobile magazine who occasionally contributes to The New York Times, offered the industry's cold, hard math. "There's the fundamental calculation, that automakers make more money selling crossovers than cars," Mr. Kitman said. "Look at the Ford Escape, essentially a Ford Focus, and you can spend $ 39,000 for an Escape or $ 23,000 for the Focus.
"It's a paradigm," he added. "The companies say, 'We're just serving the market,' but, really, the market is serving them. Maybe people are coming in and asking for S.U.V.s because the companies have spent billions of dollars marketing them."
A brand that can be seen as either visionary or stultified in station-wagon-land is Audi. By this time next year, the German company should have three on sale in the United States, with one of them -- the 592-horsepower RS6 Avant -- priced well north of $ 100,000.
"We see opportunities with the Avant and the Allroad," said Mark Dahncke, an Audi spokesman. He said the all-wheel-drive Allroads, which are based on the A4 and A6 sedans and start at just below $ 47,000, might attract a buyer who was S.U.V.-ed out.
"It brings a level of functionality wrapped in the package of a car," Mr. Dahncke said. "Young adults of today, after they've lived through four or five S.U.V.s, may say they no longer need an off-road car but one that handles better, with a lower center of gravity."
While some companies are guessing at what might be "the next S.U.V.," Volvo also sticks with a pair of wagons, the V60 and V90, for the United States market. Volvo, based in Sweden but owned by Geely of China, has retained loyal wagon customers since the 1960s thanks in part to its family-friendly reputation for solidity and safety. (Writers have called Volvo wagons a "suburban cliché.")
"There is still a segment that comes looking for wagons," said Peter Fearon of Volvo Cars of Queens, in Bayside. "They don't want a truck. They want the car feel, but they like the extra space."
One issue that puts off potential wagon buyers is the price of leasing. Because wagons generally are low-volume sellers, the manufacturers don't offer aggressive leasing or finance rates on them.
Beyond Volvo and Audi in the States, Mercedes-Benz imports a pair of E-class beauties, the E400 and E63S, with prices that range from $ 66,000 to more than $ 108,000 for the AMG edition. They're hard to find on most dealer lots.
Buick -- where did that come from? -- sells the handsome, all-wheel-drive Regal TourX, which echoes the design cues of previous Volvo and BMW wagons. It's fairly spunky, with 250 horsepower, and has 73 cubic feet of cargo space. The base price is less than $ 31,000.
For wagon fans who may wish to stretch the definition, there are the Mini Clubman and the Subaru Outback. The adorable Clubman is exceptional on the road, but it's a rather shrunken take on the traditional wagon form; in other words, it's a Mini. At the other end of the spectrum, the Outback is practical for hauling, but it's bulky and inelegant; in other words, it's a Subaru.
And for those seeking a viable wagon relic, there's alway a woodie.
More than a half-century has passed since the Beach Boys celebrated these funky wagon/cars in "Surfin' Safari." ("Early in the morning we'll be startin' out, some honeys will be coming along. We're loading up our Woodie, with our boards inside.") There are now more than 2,600 members of the National Woodie Club, according to the elder woodie statesman John Lee (he's 79), who edits the Woodie Times newsletter.
"Actually, the first cars around 1900 were practically all wood, with wood frame and floors, and early bodies were often made of wood," Mr. Lee said. By the '40s and '50s, some carmakers had added handsome side panels, some made of contrasting dark and lighter wood shades, and hand-built hardwood passenger compartments.
But not long after, companies including Chrysler and Buick discontinued wood in favor of steel structures, although some continued to offer a "woodie look" by adding vinyl, plastic or decals to the wagons. Jeep's Wagoneer, perhaps the first S.U.V., soldiered on: It was offered, with wood-grained sides and luxury fittings, from the '60s until 1991. A late-model Grand Wagoneer 4x4 from the restorer Wagonmaster today fetches $ 89,000.
Woodies aside, expanding beyond a niche remains a challenge for station wagons. It will most likely have to follow a resurgence of the conventional sedan-and-coupe segment. The signs are not encouraging; just this year, more than half a dozen car models are becoming extinct, including Ford's Fusion and Focus, and the Chevrolet Impala and Cruze.
"In the rest of the world, the station wagon is a popular car," Mr. Kitman said. "In the U.S., they've become cars for rich people."
He added: "They don't get the fancy leases. They don't get the cash back. They're for people who know cars, people who are smart and they have more money. But they've deprived the rest of us."

"In the rest of the world, the station wagon is a popular car," said a columnist for Automobile magazine, Jamie Lincoln Kitman. "In the U.S., they've become cars for rich people."

Texto completo: Our guide to the city's best classical music and opera happening this weekend and in the week ahead.
'AMAHL AND THE NIGHT VISITORS' at Holy Apostles Soup Kitchen (Dec. 4-6, 7:30 p.m.; through Dec. 8). Returning after last year's debut, this On Site Opera production of Menotti's Christmas classic is put on in partnership with Breaking Ground, a group that provides housing assistance, and is based around a chorus of community members who have themselves experienced homelessness. Devin Zamir Coleman and Benjamin Barham-Wiese share the role of Amahl and Aundi Marie Moore sings the Mother in performances conducted by Geoffrey McDonald and directed by Eric Einhorn.
osopera.org
BENJAMIN GROSVENOR at Town Hall (Dec. 1, 2 p.m.). Pass up no opportunity to hear this young pianist, but especially not at the bargain prices offered by the Peoples' Symphony. Grosvenor's recital is put together with typical thought, and comprises Schumann's "Blumenstück" and "Kreisleriana," Janacek's Piano Sonata "1. X. 1905," selections from Prokofiev's "Visions Fugitives," and Liszt's "Réminiscences de Norma."
212-586-4680, pscny.org
JENNIFER KOH AND DAVÓNE TINES at Advent Lutheran Church (Dec. 2, 7:30 p.m.). Part of the adventurous Music Mondays series, this concert pairs a violinist and bass-baritone -- pioneers both -- in music that ranges from Bach and Beethoven to Julia Wolfe and Missy Mazzoli to a hymn and a Korean lullaby. Oh, and the premiere of a new version of "Give Me Back My Fingerprints," by the Pulitzer Prize winner Du Yun. All that for free.

NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC at David Geffen Hall (Nov. 29-30, 8 p.m.; Nov. 30, 2 and 8 p.m.; Dec. 3 and 5, 7:30 p.m.; through Dec. 7). A busy week for the Philharmonic is taken up mostly with subscription concerts that pair Tchaikovsky's Symphony No. 5 with Scriabin's Piano Concerto. Daniil Trifonov is at the keyboard, except for the concert on Saturday afternoon, when the pianist takes a break, and the Scriabin is replaced by Mozart's Wind Serenade in E flat. (Trifonov is in action on Sunday at 3 p.m. at the 92nd Street Y, though, when he joins the New York Philharmonic String Quartet for his own "Quintetto Concertante";Mozart and Ravel are also on the bill.) Come Thursday, there's another subscription program, with Steve Reich's Music for Ensemble and Orchestra bookended by Beethoven's Symphony No. 2 and Piano Concerto No. 4, with Yefim Bronfman. Jaap van Zweden conducts.

Slade Gorton: Please, my fellow Republicans, follow the facts

Texto completo: In March of 1974, as a young state attorney general, I reluctantly called for President Richard Nixon’s resignation amid revelations of abuses of power related to Watergate. It wasn’t an easy thing to do. As a Republican, I didn’t enjoy breaking with my party or my president. As an elected official and practical politician, I didn’t particularly enjoy the implications of turning against someone who had comfortably carried Washington State just two years earlier. None of it was pleasant, but I believed it was the right thing to do on the facts and on the merits.
John Adams said, “Facts are stubborn things.” Forty-five years after Mr. Nixon resigned before he could be impeached by the House, the facts should be the focus of every elected official, Republican or Democrat, as they decide what to do about another president facing impeachment and a possible Senate trial.
To my fellow Republicans, I give this grave and genuine warning: It’s not enough merely to dismiss the Ukraine investigation as a partisan witch hunt or to hide behind attacks against the “deep state,” or to try to find some reason to denounce every witness who steps forward, from decorated veterans to Trump megadonors.
History demands that we all wrestle with the facts at hand. They are unavoidable. Fifty years from now, history will not accept the position that impeachment was a referendum on the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi. It must be a verdict reached on the facts.
My judgment so far as an objective observer is that there are multiple actions on this president’s part that warrant a vote of impeachment in the House, based on corroborated testimony that Mr. Trump and his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, pressured leaders of Ukraine to investigate Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his family.
From what I have read, it seems clear that President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine was subjected to a shakedown — pressured to become a foreign participant in President Trump’s re-election campaign, a violation of the law.
Several credible witnesses have testified to the existence of a quid pro quo, including William B. Taylor Jr., the acting ambassador to Ukraine; Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, the White House’s top Ukraine expert; and Gordon Sondland, Mr. Trump’s ambassador to the European Union. They and others have testified that there was a push for politically motivated investigations, and three of them were so alarmed that they attempted to report their concerns up the chain of command at the National Security Council.
Are they to be believed? Here’s my bottom line: That’s what an impeachment inquiry and a Senate trial are designed to find out. That’s why there’s a process under the Constitution.
But make no mistake: This is precisely the kind of crisis Alexander Hamilton feared. In Federalist No. 75, he warned that a president might be tempted to betray the interests of the country for his own benefit, “to sacrifice his duty to his interest, which it would require superlative virtue to withstand”; that “an avaricious man might be tempted to betray the interests of the state to the acquisition of wealth”; that a president might “make his own aggrandizement, by the aid of a foreign power, the price of his treachery to his constituents.”
Given the temptations a president might have in dealing with foreign powers, Hamilton’s solution was equally clear: Congress should be involved. “The participation of the whole or a portion of the legislative body in the office of making them,” he wrote of treaties. And in the same vein, the founders gave Congress the power to check a president accused of abusing the power of his office. They expected Congress to render its judgment on the facts.
So, to my fellow Republicans who have been willing only to attack the process, I say: engage in the process. If the president is innocent, use the process to surface those exculpatory facts so that Congress and the country can agree whether or not Mr. Trump should be removed from office. The facts — not rhetoric — should answer this question: Is there an offense serious enough to undo the results of the 2016 election?
A heavy burden to meet, but not an impossible one.
Here’s what I know: Neither the country nor the Constitution is served by a partisan shouting match divorced from the facts, a process boycotted by one side refusing to engage on the merits. John Adams is still right 250 years later: Facts are stubborn things. Facts are what should determine whether a stubborn president stays in office. Republicans, don’t fight the process, follow the facts wherever they lead, and put country above party.

Va. minor league teams may lose MLB ties

Texto completo: Under the proposal, whispers of which were reported weeks ago with a full list reported over the weekend, M.L.B. would cut ties with all but one of the Rookie-class Appalachian League teams.
Tom Goforth made a trip to Bristol this summer to watch his nephew, Ethan Goforth, a catcher with the Bristol Pirates, play baseball.
"I saw three home games and the place was packed," Goforth said. "People really seem to get into baseball down there. A lot of support from the fans."
Goforth grew up around minor league baseball in Bluefield, West Virginia, where the Orioles had a farm team in the Appalachian League for 53 years. That ended in 2010, but Bluefield is now partnered with the Toronto Blue Jays organization and, like Bristol, are still part of the Appalachian League.
"It's kind of cool that my nephew ended up playing in the Appalachian League," Goforth said.
Because the community he grew up in has a team in the same league, Goforth knows how important minor league baseball can be to the fans in those cities. Losing a team, he said, is a big blow.
"It's kind of a community event," he said. "I think it's dangerous when we start losing community events. We need to add them instead of losing them."
A Major League Baseball proposal to sever ties with 42 minor league baseball teams could affect two Virginia communities that have deep ties to the sport.
Under the proposal, whispers of which were reported weeks ago with a full list reported over the weekend, M.L.B. would cut ties with all but one of the Rookie-class Appalachian League teams.
The Bristol Pirates and Danville Braves are the two Virginia teams named in the full list, originally reported by the New York Times. Bristol is affiliated with the Pittsburgh Pirates, and Danville is associated with the Atlanta Braves.
Both the Braves and Pirates are part of the Appalachian League, which has been in operation on and off since 1921 and has been in continuous operation since 1957. It's home to 10 advanced-rookie league teams, including Bristol and Danville. The Pulaski Yankees, a Virginia team affiliated with The New York Yankees, was the only Appalachian League team not on the list.
The economic impact wouldn't be devastating, but culturally, baseball runs deep in both cities.
State line baseball Tucked away on the southwest border of Virginia, the Bristol Pirates play for an audience of two cities with the same name. The team is located in Bristol, Virginia, but it also receives support from Bristol, Tennessee.
Bristol has had a professional baseball team for 75 years, including the last 50 years. They've been affiliated with the Pittsburgh Pirates since the 2014 season, but were previously a minor league team for both the Chicago White Sox and Detroit Tigers.
Bristol Mayor Neal Osborne said Monday that it would be disappointing to lose the team, citing the culture importance of baseball to the cities.
"You've got your people that go to every single game and they all know each other and it's a community," he said. "The location of the field, it's near a residential area, so the whole neighborhood around it, they're very attached to their team."
Run by the nonprofit Bristol Baseball, Inc., the team plays at Boyce Cox Field at DeVault Memorial Stadium, which Osborne said the city owns and leases to the organization for a nominal fee each year. The high school team also plays at the stadium.
Bristol Baseball renewed its lease for five years in the spring, according to The Bristol Herald Courier. Boyce Cox Field has fallen into a state of disrepair, according to the Herald Courier, and the cities have explored building a new stadium on the Bristol, Tennessee side.
Osborne said he plans to advocate for a new stadium regardless of the outcome with the Pirates because the high school team needs a place to play, too.
What does the future bring for baseball?
"Never say never on getting a positive outcome, but I couldn't tell you what will happen at this point," Osborne said.
Osborne said some restaurants and businesses nearby the stadium see an economic impact from the team, but the impact isn't huge. He said the city doesn't give the team money, though the city helps get the field ready ahead of the season.
The team had a total impact of $2.8 million to the Greater Bristol area during the 2012 season, according to an economic impact study by Eastern Tennessee State University.
Home runs along the Dan River The Danville Braves celebrated its 25th anniversary last year, but now its future may be in jeopardy.
Jonathan Fain is the athletic director at George Washington High School in Danville. His school's baseball teams play games at the same field as the Braves, but other than that there is no connection between his high school's team and the Braves.
Still, he wasn't happy with the news that Danville may no longer have a team.
"They are important to the city," Fain said. "A lot of folks here in the community enjoy going to the games and I hate to see it go."
The Braves have been around since 1993, playing games at American Legion Field. The team was previously located in Pulaski, which now hosts the Pulaski Yankees.
Danville Mayor Alonzo Jones said in a statement that the city was monitoring the situation but did not have official confirmation from MLB about the reported proposal.
"Until then, we do not want to speculate on the future of minor league baseball in our city," he said in the statement. "Certainly, the Danville Braves are a local institution, having been part of our community since 1993. We have watched many great players, including Andruw Jones, Jason Heyward, Craig Kimbrel, Julio Teherán, and Mike Soroka, to name a few."
The Danville Braves donated $2,600 to both Danville-Pittsylvania Cancer and the United Way of Danville-Pittsylvania County this past season.
"They have a t-shirt drive and different things like that and donate the proceeds to us," said Shirley Atkins, the client aid coordinator for Danville-Pittsylvania Cancer, a nonprofit organization serving those diagnosed with cancer in the Danville area.
Atkins isn't a big baseball fan, but she said she does enjoy the Danville Braves, and she knows the community embraces the team.
"People really like the Danville Braves," she said. "I go to a church out in the county and lot of the men and women pick a night and go somewhere to eat and then they go to the Braves game. It's a big thing for them. Danville supports the Braves."
An economic impact analysis had not been completed as of 2018, but Danville officials told the Danville Register & Bee that the city was lucky to have a minor league team. Officials said the team put Danville on the map, an especially important distinction for a struggling manufacturing city.

Texto completo: A Manhattan resident says taxis and ride-sharing services, not private cars, are the primary cause of the city's traffic woes.
To the Editor:
Re "Thinking the Unthinkable: Don't Even Think of Parking Here" (news article, Nov. 21), about proposals to eliminate free street parking in Manhattan:
It's hard to imagine in what universe the critics of street parking are living. Haven't they gone outside? Stand on any street corner and watch cars go by. Around 90 percent are taxis or ride-sharing services like Uber and Lyft. New York has been flooded by about 80,000 ride-sharing vehicles in the last couple of years.
Between bike lanes, commercial parking, construction and other lane closures, driving in the city has become an exercise in exasperation. Almost none of this is because of private passenger cars.
Why is free parking being blamed for the traffic problems? And why are those of us who need a car (I have to take a lengthy subway ride to get mine) being punished for a problem we didn't cause? Banning free street parking is undemocratic and misguided, and will not increase traffic flow.

John Simon Had No Time for Bad Art; The critic, who died Sunday at 94, worried that critical indifference would give rise to more of it.

Texto completo: On the jacket of my copy of "Acid Test," a 1963 collection of essays by John Simon, a blurb reads: "When Simon writes about a book, you will want to read it or you will not need to read it." Praise for a culture critic doesn't get much higher than that.
Simon died Sunday at the age of 94. We met once, briefly, almost 20 years ago, but I didn't know him. At the time he was still writing for National Review, among other publications, and I was moonlighting as a film critic for the New York Sun. I enjoyed reading film criticism almost as much as I enjoyed watching films, and Simon was far and away my favorite—not because I necessarily agreed with his opinions but because he made me reflect on my own.
English was Simon's fifth language, and his knowledge of art, poetry and literature was at least as deep as his knowledge of film. But it wasn't simply erudition and versatility that distinguished his writing in the 1960s and '70s, a period widely regarded as the heyday of film criticism. It was also his approach to criticism itself, which included unfailingly high standards and a brutal honesty that wasn't always appreciated by actors and filmmakers, never mind his fellow critics.
Simon argued that film criticism was much like any other kind of criticism. His job was not to indulge the people who make films or even the people who watch them. "It is not for the critic to do the reader's thinking for him; it is for the critic to do his own thinking for the reader's benefit," he wrote. He often was accused of being overly harsh in his assessments, but to his mind it was his fellow critics who were overly generous. Long before Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert helped reduce film criticism to "thumbs up" or "thumbs down," Simon was sounding the alarm. His worry was that critical indifference to bad art, or insufficient opposition to it, would "give rise to further bad art and drive out the good."
Simon sometimes reviewed not only the movie but other reviews of the movie. A good example is his take on Brian DePalma's 1980 film, "Dressed to Kill," which was popular with critics and audiences alike. Simon was having none of it.
He begins his review by citing what he considered excessive praise of the film from the likes of Pauline Kael, who wrote, "It is hardly possible to find a point at which you could tear yourself away from this picture." Next, Simon notes the long lines outside cinemas that were showing the movie, which disappointed him. Finally, we get his own summary of the movie, which offers up little more than "sophomoric soft-core pornography, vulgar manipulation of the emotions for more sensation, salacious but inept dialogue that is a cross between comic-strip Freudianism and sniggering double entendres, and a plot line so full of holes as to be at best a dotted line." And that's just the first paragraph.
Simon's uncompromising judgments translated into a ton of negative reviews of movies and performances, and in a career that spanned more than five decades it's hardly surprising that some of them don't hold up very well. For better or worse, society's tastes have proven to be more malleable than Simon's. He dismissed "The Godfather" as "one of the sleazier films to achieve overwhelming public, and considerable critical, success." He described Diane Keaton as "supremely untalented." And he had no use for "The Graduate," bristling at its "oversimplification, overelaboration, inconsistency, eclecticism, obviousness, pretentiousness" and "rock bottom" soundtrack. Somewhere, Simon and Garfunkel are probably still laughing at that one.
According to the New York Times, his 1972 collection, "Reverse Angle," discusses 245 films and recommends 15 of them. But then, cultural criticism for Simon was never a popularity contest. As he put it: "Critics are after something far more elusive: pursuing their own reactions down to the rock bottom of their subjectivity and expressing them with utmost artistry, so that what will always elude the test of objective truth will at least become a kind of art: the art of illumination, persuasion, and good thinking and writing."
Simon was still writing to the end. His final post on his blog is dated Oct. 27, and there's no indication that he'd gone soft in his dotage. "One person's critic is another person's crackpot," he wrote. "I myself prefer being considered a creep, but that is what you get for having what Vladimir Nabokov called 'Strong Opinions.' "
Fortunately, we still have other cultural critics—Kyle Smith, Armond White, Bruce Bawer, James Bowman, Stanley Crouch—who share Simon's willingness to go it alone, come what may. Unfortunately, we have lost the leader of the pack.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - The Supreme Court refused Monday to shield two conservative writers from being sued for defamation by a climate-change expert whom they accused of having "molested and tortured data in the service of politicized science."
Over a dissent by Justice Samuel A. Alito, the high court cleared the way for Penn State professor Michael Mann to sue the National Review and the conservative Competitive Enterprise Institute for having compared him to former Penn State football coach Jerry Sandusky, who was imprisoned for sexual abuse. Both were investigated by the university.
In his 2012 article, columnist Mark Steyn said that in Mann's case, as with Sandusky and football legend Joe Paterno, who was also involved in the sex-abuse scandal, Penn State "declined to find one of its star names guilty of any wrongdoing." His comment repeated the words of an online columnist at the Competitive Enterprise Institute who first made the comparison between Mann and Sandusky.
The case involves a hotly disputed question that has split lower courts: When can statements of opinion form the basis of a libel suit? Ordinarily, the high court has ruled, a person can't be sued for expressing an opinion. But when a statement mixes opinion with a claim about facts - in this case, the claim that Mann had misused data - courts have struggled to decide whether lawsuits are valid.
Lawyers for the institute and the National Review, a conservative publication founded in 1955 by William F. Buckley, urged the court to block the suit on 1st Amendment grounds. They argued that freedom of speech and the press requires shielding people who comment on matters of great public controversy.
Standing aside in this case, they said, "would be to insert courts and juries into every hot-button political and scientific dispute."
But lawyers for Mann argued the disputed comments crossed the line from protected opinion to a defamatory accusation that Mann engaged in "data manipulation" and "scientific misconduct."
An appeals court for the District of Columbia had refused to block the suit.
The high court's action clears the way for the lawsuits to go to trial. The justices could still intervene later to review the verdict.
In the past, President Donald Trump, among others, called for making it easier to sue the press for libel. Justice Clarence Thomas has also suggested the court should reconsider the landmark 1964 decision in New York Times vs. Sullivan, which shields the press from being sued by public officials except when their reports reflect a "reckless disregard for the truth."
Thomas did not register a dissent Monday in the cases of National Review vs. Mann or CEI vs Mann.
Alito, however, said the court should have heard the cases.
They "present questions that go to the very heart of the constitutional guarantee of freedom of speech and freedom of the press: the protection afforded to journalists and others who use harsh language in criticizing opposing advocacy on one of the most important public issues of the day," he wrote.
"Climate change has staked a place at the very center of his nation's public discourse," he added. "The core purpose of the constitutional protection of freedom of expression is to ensure that that all opinions on such issues have a chance to be heard and considered."

Charles M. Blow: Democrats are failing to decipher black voters

Texto completo: There was quite a bit of talk about the black vote and the black community at Wednesday night’s presidential debate.
Maybe that’s because they were in Atlanta, the majority-black capital of the South. But it is also, I am sure, because black voters have played and continue to play a crucial role in who gets the Democratic nomination.
Joe Biden’s front-runner status — and very likely his entire candidacy — is being kept aloft by black voters. Pete Buttigieg, who has surged in the first two states — Iowa and New Hampshire — is hitting a wall in the third state, South Carolina, where a majority of Democratic primary voters are black.
Furthermore, the three African-American candidates — Sens. Cory Booker and Kamala Harris, and former Gov. Deval Patrick — aren’t the favorite candidates of African-American voters. At the same time, the more progressive Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders have failed to lure significant black support with their views of structural change.
I believe deeply that much of the Democratic field is still struggling — and failing — to decipher what animates the bulk of black voters. As much as I believe in polling and its ability to uncover information, I don’t believe that the way black people are polled is sufficient and comprehensive.
As I’ve mentioned before, the black vote is multifaceted, like any group of voters. Young black voters see things differently from older ones. There is a slight but statistically significant difference in the way black women vote compared with black men. And black voters in the South see things slightly different from the way black voters in the North and West see things.
Let’s focus here on black voters in the Deep South states, those along the Black Belt, because that’s where black voting power is strongest in the primaries.
Specifically, I’m talking about Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, South Carolina and North Carolina. (I’m from Louisiana, and trying to define the Deep South is a subject that can spark a bar fight. I include North Carolina, while many do not. I do not include Florida or Texas. Geographically they are Deep South, but culturally they are different.)
In any case, understanding the South here is important. Black people in America have always lived mostly in the South and continue to do so. Even during American slavery, a majority of free blacks lived in the South, not the North. This was true in every census from 1790 to 1860.
According to researchers at the Brookings Institution, there are 1,200 majority-black towns and cities in America, about 1,000 of which are in the South. And the number of majority-black cities is on the rise.
In addition, almost all of the largest cities in the Deep South, as I have defined it, are majority-black with a black mayor.
Speaking of the South more broadly, every one of the top 10 states with the highest percent of black population is in the South.
I point all of this out because I believe that people’s relationship to power informs the way they see national politics in general and presidential politics in particular.
White working-class voters in the Rust Belt behave one way because they feel that they are losing power. Black voters in the South behave differently because they feel that they are gaining it.
These Southern black voters are in control of the power structure most intimately affecting their lives — local government. However, they often live in states controlled by white Republicans. That is often the most important conflict. The federal government has often been the instrument to prevent or relieve state oppression.
The other thing to remember is that this rise in municipal black power and black self-determination in Southern cities is only a few decades old, dating back to about the 1970s.
Those voters may be less excited by a national revolution because they are living through a very real revolution on the ground. They are feeling their power in cities and increasingly in statewide races. But in presidential elections, their voices are drowned out on the state level — other than Barack Obama narrowly winning North Carolina in 2008, no Democratic presidential candidate has carried my Deep South states since the 1990s.
As such, until that changes, voting in presidential elections can feel mostly symbolic for blacks in the South. The Democratic candidate won’t carry their state. If that person wins the presidency, it will be because of people in faraway places.
But during the primaries, those Southern black voters have a chance to make their voices heard, to reward loyalty and fidelity, to support the candidates they feel they know and to spurn those they feel they don’t.
Big plans mean less and can ring hollow. What James Baldwin wrote in his essay “Journey to Atlanta” rings true:
Of all Americans, Negroes distrust politicians most, or, more accurately, they have been best trained to expect nothing from them; more than other Americans, they are always aware of the enormous gap between election promises and their daily lives.
For these voters, many of the candidates are simply offering promises far beyond their ability to deliver, no matter how good the promises sound or how good they would be if kept.
The promises sparkle during campaign season the same way sunlight plays on the water’s surface: It is an attractive illusion.
Black people in the South are experiencing a surge of real power and the ability to enact real change. Democratic candidates have to talk to them like the people they are: strong and pushing, not weak and begging.

Baker: 'I'm not a virtue signaler' on public transit

Texto completo: Governor Charlie Baker left some listeners' ears ringing after he declared himself no “virtue signaler" when asked why he doesn't take the commuter rail in a radio interview Thursday.
The question came at the end of a brief discussion of Seeing Red, the Globe Spotlight Team's three-part series this week on the region's transportation crisis, during Baker's monthly “Ask The Governor" appearance on WGBH's “Boston Public Radio."
Baker made the comment in response to information from the first report in the series: “Living a 10-minute walk from the Swampscott MBTA Station, Baker is driven to the State House. The Republican has never ridden the commuter rail as governor and did not ride the subway until a media event in September, more than 1,700 days after taking office."
Cohost Jim Braude asked Baker whether he's ever thought maybe he should take the train to the State House and see what everybody else deals with.
“I rode the commuter rail for a lot of years," Baker responded. “I rode the T for a lot of years. And I talk to people all the time who ride both. Look, I live in Swampscott, OK, so I talk to people who ride the commuter rail; I talk to people who take Wonderland and the Blue Line in. I talk to people all the time who ride the public transportation system.
“I'm not a virtue signaler, I guess is what I would say," Baker then told Braude, who responded with a “hoo!"
Cohost Margery Eagan said, “I like that," referring to the politically charged term, which psychologists in a March New York Times op-ed defined as “feigned righteousness intended to make the speaker appear superior by condemning others."
Baker then continued, “I think my job is to try to make the thing better. And given what we inherited on that thing, I'll put our record up against any of our predecessors."
Eagan and Braude indicated they liked the term “virtue signaler" and asked Baker whether it was original to him. The governor said he had “heard it somewhere else."
Baker's comment prompted more criticism than praise from transportation advocates and others online, including some who took his comment as a broad criticism of public transit.
Baker's office did not immediately respond Saturday afternoon to a request for comment.
Eagan had brought up the Spotlight reports near the beginning of the governor's appearance, asking Baker whether he'd read the series.
“I've read some of it," he told her. “I think it's pretty comprehensive, and anybody who spends any time on the roads or on the public transportation system would probably have similar experiences to the ones they're writing about. It's a giant problem."
But Baker said the problem is not his fault, pointing to a long history of state government failing to invest in infrastructure and transportation.
Baker also cited the region's abrupt economic changes over the past five or six years that have put many more drivers on the road, including 300,000 new jobs, tens of millions of square feet of new development in Kendall Square and the Seaport District, and “100 million transportation networking company rides" since the rise of ride-sharing and on-demand delivery.
“And we had a public transportation system that hadn't been invested in in forever," he said. “We are absolutely playing catch-up across the board on this stuff, and that's why we took such an aggressive position in investing in our public transportation system. And I'd be the first to say that work's been done, but there's a long way to go."

Texto completo: With the inclusion of Kim Ng and Jean Afterman in prominent positions of the front office 20 years ago, the New York Yankees were at the forefront of gender diversity in MLB front offices. Two decades later, the team is among the first to hire a woman for an on-field instruction role.
According to the New York Times, the Yankees hired Rachel Balkovec as a roving minor league hitting coach earlier this month. She will report to spring training in Tampaon Feb. 1 before traveling to the various Yankees farm system clubs during the season.
“It’s an easy answer to why we chose Rachel for this role,” Yankees hitting coordinator Dillon Lawson told the Times. “She’s a good hitting coach, and a good coach, period. ”
Balkovec began her baseball coaching career in 2012 with the St. Louis Cardinals' rookie-level affiliate in Johnson City, Tennessee. The 32-year-old from Omaha, Nebraska became the first full-time female strength and conditioning coach in affiliated ball in 2014, a role she held with the Cardinals for two seasons. She and Lawson met while both were working for the Houston Astros organization in 2016, when Bavkovec was the Latin American strength and conditioning coach and he was the minor league hitting instructor.
Balkovec is the latest woman who has been hired by a major league franchise. On Friday, the Chicago Cubs hired Rachel Folden to the lead the hitting lab for its rookie club in Arizona. In 2015, the Oakland Athletics brought on Justine Siegal as an instructor in the Arizona Fall League, making her the first woman to serve as an MLB coach.

Texto completo: News item: The New York Times reported that the High-A Frederick Keys, the longest-running Orioles affiliated minor league franchise, is among the 42 farm teams that could lose their affiliations with major league clubs under a plan by Major League Baseball to reorganize the sport's minor league system.
My take: If the plan - which has not been finalized - is adopted, it would be another kick in the pants for an already beleaguered Orioles fan base. The club's geographically convenient array of farm teams is a very appealing aspect of the organization, which isn't exactly swimming in appealing aspects at the moment.
Related news item: MLB proposed the minor league realignment in an effort to limit each major league club to a specific number of domestic farm teams (five) and prospects (150).
My take: In other words, it's about money, but it will be sold as a way to achieve a greater level of competitive balance among the large- and small-market teams while eliminating a few money-losing franchises.
Bonus take: Minor league affiliates reportedly drew over 40 million fans last season, which makes all this seem like a solution in search of a problem.
News item:Citing gratitude and loyalty to the organization for helping rejuvenate his career, former Ravens safety Eric Weddle told reporters this week that he will not share any intel on the Ravens with his Los Angeles Rams teammates ahead of Monday night's game in LA.
My take: Good man. Now, let's hope that former Rams cornerback Marcus Peters doesn't let his scruples get in the way of him from picking off Jared Goff a couple of times.
News item: Disgraced Cleveland Browns defensive end Myles Garrett appealed the disciplinary action taken by the NFL after he pulled the helmet off Steelers quarterback Mason Rudolph and hit him over the head with it. He asked for a reduction in his indefinite suspension, but the NFL upheld its ruling Thursday.
My take: That's got to seem pretty cheeky to anyone who saw the incident, but Garrett (and his representatives) reportedly argued that Houston Texans lineman Antonio Smith was only suspended for three games - two of them preseason games - for a similar incident in 2013.
Bonus take: And, anyway, how do you reduce an indefinite suspension?
News item: The Miami Marlins have designated former Orioles pitcher Wei-Yin Chen for assignment and could be on the hook for the $22 million he's guaranteed for the 2020 season.
My take: Nobody's picking up that salary, so somebody will probably end up signing him to a minor league contract. He's been a major bust in Miami, but could provide some very cheap left-handed pitching for a rebuilding baseball team near you.
News item: Former Oriole Gerardo Parra, who created the "Baby Shark" craze that helped the Nationals win their first World Series title, has signed a contract to play in Japan next season.
My take: Don't know how the Nats could let him go after he turned a whole generation of toddlers into lifelong fans.
News item: NBC Sports reported that, according to unidentified sources, MLB commissioner Rob Manfred told players union officials in July that owners would not make economic concessions to achieve labor peace during early negotiations to replace the collective bargaining agreement that will expire after the 2021 season.
My take: That's a relief. I was starting to think that we'd never have another interminable work stoppage that ends with a federal court judge in New York ordering the owners to stop being so mean to their millionaire employees.
News item: New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady joked this week that he has disliked the Dallas Cowboys "since coming out of the womb."
My take: I wish I could say the same thing about the Patriots, but I was born five years before they were.

ELECTION 2020; Election day also is Taco Tuesday; Presidential hopefuls visit Mexican eateries: 'Hispandering' at its worst, or candidates courting Latino vote?

Texto completo: There he was, another candidate with White House dreams, shaking hands and exchanging hugs in a gaudy Mexican restaurant, careful not to stain his suit with salsa.
As Latino outreach goes, Julian Castro's recent meet-and-greet at La Parrilla in Boyle Heights seemed ripped from the headlines. Because it was.
Hillary Clinton did it when she visited King Taco in 2008, and Joe Biden this May. Al Gore gobbled up red pork tamales at Carrillo's in San Fernando as part of his presidential run.

And Gerald Ford infamously bit into a tamale still wrapped in its corn husk in front of the Alamo.
Even Donald Trump played the game in 2016, when he tweeted a photo on Cinco de Mayo of himself about to dig into a gargantuan taco salad and declared, "I love Hispanics."
Presidential candidates showing up at a Mexican joint to cash in on votes by scarfing up enchiladas has become as American as kissing bebes.
It's like hitting barbecue joints in South Carolina, biting down on cheesesteaks in Philadelphia, devouring pizza and bagels in New York City, eating deep-fried food-on-a-stick at the Iowa State Fair.
On this Sunday morning, Castro eventually sat down to a plate of huevos rancheros, but so many people wanted to chat him up or take selfies that staffers asked for a to-go box after less than five minutes.
After a short stump speech, the candidate returned to what was on everyone's mind: desayuno.
"Y'all are enticing me with the smell of the Mexican food!" the San Antonio native and former mayor yelled to the roars of the crowd as some urged him to also hit up the legendary Al & Bea's stand nearby for bean-and-cheese burritos.
"Events like these are just like home," Castro said while he waited on Cesar E. Chavez Avenue for a ride to a comida-free forum at Cal State Los Angeles. "But the magic is to hear American stories not heard by mainstream media, an America oftentimes made invisible."
It's a message that Castro's rivals have embraced with open arms and hungry stomachs. Nearly every Democratic candidate in the 2020 presidential race has met voters at Mexican restaurants -- and not just in the Southwest.
Andrew Yang held a town hall at a Mexican restaurant in Okatie, S.C. Tulsi Gabbard addressed supporters at Burrito Me in Laconia, N.H., while Elizabeth Warren hit up Dos Amigos down the road in Concord. Castro enjoyed chicken fajitas in Wyoming (verdict: "I can't say it was as good as Tex-Mex"); Mexican restaurants in the Hawkeye State have hosted everyone from Amy Klobuchar to Kamala Harris and Bernie Sanders.
Pete Buttigieg launched a thousand think pieces when he admitted to spiking salsa with ranch dressing back home in Indiana. Even Joe Sestak, who's barely reaching zero percent in the latest New York Times poll, dropped by a Mexican eatery in Vinton, Iowa, this summer.
Such gatherings "served a different purpose than formal events," said 40-year-old Jeannette Soriano of Pico Rivera, who was the last person to take a picture with Castro at La Parilla. "It creates a brief buzz for most Mexican Americans who aren't plugged into politics."
The evolution of the phenomenon intrigues Matt Barreto. The UCLA professor of Chicano studies and political science frequently teaches Ford's tamale gaffe to his students as a particularly egregious example of "Hispandering."
"Most of them have come a long way," he said. "They have to be serious about doing it. The risk is that it looks like a photo op. Voters want them to come around more regularly."
But Barreto is also mindful of how such visits speak to the continued mainstreaming of Mexican food and Latino political power. "These important meetings and events are happening at Mexican places," he said. "It's not just Italian restaurants, American diners or steakhouses anymore."
The earliest known presidential candidate to hold a public appearance at a Mexican restaurant was Henry Wallace. In 1948, Franklin D. Roosevelt's former vice president spoke before a mixed-race audience at a spot in Dallas as the head of the Progressive Party ticket to decry segregation in the American South.
He launched a love affair between Mexican food and American presidents -- and pretenders -- that hasn't ceased.
Lyndon B. Johnson regularly hobnobbed with donors over combo platters at Matt's El Rancho in Austin, Texas. Richard Nixon regaled reporters at El Adobe de Capistrano before stays at his Western White House in nearby San Clemente; a plaque continues to mark Nixon's preferred table. Both Bob Dole and Walter Mondale visited Lucy's El Adobe Cafe in Hollywood in 1976 as the running mates of Ford and Jimmy Carter, respectively.
"I think elected officials and candidates understand that they have to speak to the [Latino] voter bloc," said Pete Cortez, whose family has run Mi Tierra in San Antonio and has hosted politicians since its 1951 opening. "We're not going to go to you; you have to go to us. So they've identified Mexican restaurants as a place where if you want to talk to people, this is where you have to go."
Mi Tierra's walls have photos of Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush from their dinners there; Castro has been a regular since he was a child. But it was Bill Clinton's patronage that turned politicians' visits to Mexican restaurants from hokey affairs into serious stops.
When he visited on the campaign trail in 1992, Cortez gifted Clinton -- who had dined there as far back as 1972, when he was volunteering for George McGovern's presidential run -- with a Mi Tierra T-shirt featuring a portrait of Mexican Revolution icon Emiliano Zapata. Clinton loved the T-shirt so much that he wore it during one of his public jogs; a subsequent photo made the wires, and Mi Tierra immortalized the occasion with a black velvet painting that now has its own alcove in the restaurant.
Political strategists took notice. By 2000, George W. Bush was making headlines for impressing waiters at Mexican restaurants during the Iowa caucuses with his Spanish. Eight years later, Republican and Democratic candidates alike mugged for cameras with margaritas and more from Nevada to Texas to California and beyond.
The appearances are not without risks for the restaurants in these polarized times. In 2012, Rosa Linda's Mexican Cafe in Denver received death threats after it declined the offer of a visit by Republican nominee Mitt Romney. Four years later, El Sombrero in Las Vegas became the target of a boycott after Trump met with a group of local Latino entrepreneurs there; the restaurant closed in 2018 after 68 years in business for unspecified reasons.
But most restaurateurs welcome presidential visits and promote their brush with history. Moreno's Restaurant in Orange has a photo on its menu of George H.W. Bush making tortillas when he passed through in 1988. In tiny Woodburn, Ore., the walls of Luis's Taqueria still feature framed newspaper clippings and photos from when then-candidate Barack Obama dropped by in 2008.
"Customers see it like a good history to read," said owner Jesus Gonzalez. "And they wonder which restaurant will get the next visit."
Cortez has seen candidates of all political persuasions stop by since Clinton -- who still visits every time he's in San Antonio -- and try to work patrons at Mi Tierra and other Mexican restaurants nationwide. "Some are better than others," he said. "The ones who interact the most with the customers, and not just the invited guests, are the ones that seem to do the best in their races."
Serena Maria Daniels agrees.
"Politicians know that they need to seem relatable." said the editor and publisher of Detroit-based Tostada Magazine. "They know that they have a better shot at winning over those voters in those communities and they want to be sure that they're seen in the 'right' places."
While no presidential candidate has visited a Mexican restaurant in the Motor City yet, Daniels said local Detroit politicians are beginning to hold fundraisers at them.
"It's like Latino student groups who have done this forever," she joked. "Politicians are now like, 'OK, what taco truck are we going to hire, or who's going to bring the beans and rice?' "

Texto completo: The Boston Symphony's summer festival in the Berkshires will also feature a new tradition: Wagner led by Andris Nelsons.
A small string section's worth of violin stars will celebrate the centenary of the violinist Isaac Stern. Andris Nelsons will conduct the Boston Symphony Orchestra in the third act of Wagner's "Tannhäuser." And Paul Lewis will play the five Beethoven piano concertos.
Those are among the highlights of the 2020 season at Tanglewood, the Boston Symphony's summer festival in the Berkshires, which was announced on Thursday.
The soprano Angel Blue, who opened the Metropolitan Opera's season as Bess in "Porgy and Bess," will also open the Boston Symphony's Tanglewood season on July 3, singing Barber's "Knoxville: Summer of 1915," conducted by Ken-David Masur.
The 100th anniversary of the birth of Stern, the violin virtuoso who led the effort to save Carnegie Hall, will be lauded with a series of concerts the weekend of July 24. The violinist Midori will play Bernstein's "Serenade (after Plato's 'Symposium')," which Stern premiered with its composer conducting the Israel Philharmonic in 1954. The violinist Augustin Hadelich will play Dutilleux's "L'Arbre des Songes," which was written for Stern.
The Stern celebration will culminate with a concert featuring the violinists Joshua Bell, Vadim Gluzman, Pamela Frank and Nancy Zhou, who will join the cellists Steven Isserlis and Jian Wang (who, as a child, was featured in the award-winning documentary "From Mao to Mozart: Isaac Stern in China") and the pianist Jeremy Denk in a program featuring Bach's Concerto in D minor for two violins and Beethoven's Triple Concerto.
Mr. Nelsons, the music director of the Boston Symphony, will conduct 12 programs, including symphonies by Shostakovich, Tchaikovsky and Berlioz; Poulenc's "Gloria" with Nicole Cabell; and the Beethoven piano concerto cycle with Mr. Lewis. And, in what has become an annual tradition of Wagner, he will conduct the third act of "Tannhäuser" on July 11. The cast will include the tenor Christopher Ventris in the title role, Sarah Jakubiak as Elisabeth, Marina Prudenskaya as Venus and Michael Nagy as Wolfram.
Tanglewood's Festival of Contemporary Music is being organized for the third season by the composer Thomas Adès. It will open Aug. 6 with the American premiere of a piece by Andrew Haig.
And talk will be back, too. The Tanglewood Learning Institute, the lecture program which opened last summer in the facility's new Linde Center, will offer master classes, talks with visiting artists, and weekend-long programs devoted to Beethoven; film and music; and Stern.

Jake Burton, whose snowboard company helped popularize the sport

Texto completo: As a prep school student, Jake Burton was riding a Snurfer — a precursor to the snowboard — when his hand slammed into a tree, fracturing a finger. That was a lucky break for what became the still-growing snowboarding industry.
Tinkering over the next several years with the design of the Snurfer, which gave standing riders little control, Mr. Burton created prototypes of what would be manufactured by Burton Snowboards — the company he founded. Though he built his operation into a major player in a multibillion-dollar industry, and helped change the face of sports on slopes, he shrugged off suggestions that he had glimpsed winter's future early on.
“When I started the company, I had no idea this would be done at ski areas the way it is today, or in the Olympics," he told the Globe in 2002. “So I give myself much more credit for persevering through the tough times than for having a vision of where this sport was going."
Mr. Burton, who had announced earlier this month that he had been diagnosed with a recurrence of cancer, died Wednesday in Burlington, Vt., according to e-mail sent to the company's staff. He was 65.
Often referred to as the godfather of snowboarding, Mr. Burton was a board chairman who wanted to keep the sport faithful to its outsider origins.
“I just saw snowboarding as an alternative to skiing and the expense," he told the Globe in 1997. “It was just a back-hill kind of thing. That's how we used to go boarding in the beginning."
Even when his company was drawing an estimated one-third of consumer spending on snowboarding, and was sponsoring numerous Olympians, Mr. Burton was seen as the kind of iconic figure anyone would aspire to join on the slopes.
“He's like the cool dad of the sport," Shaun White, a three-time Olympic gold medalist and one of snowboarding's most recognizable figures, told The New York Times in 2015.
Mr. Burton never minded when his employees arrived late on a day of fresh snow. He knew where they were and knew they were only emulating the company's founder. He always tried to snowboard 100 days each year.
“If you get in a couple of runs in the morning, you can work until midnight," he told the Times in 2003.
Mr. Burton's birth name was John Burton Carpenter, though for public purposes he went by Burton after launching his company in 1977 in Londonderry, Vt. The company now has its headquarters in Burlington, Vt.
“He thought Burton Snowboards sounded better than Carpenter Snowboards, and he wanted to honor his maternal grandmother, whose surname was Burton. She had left him a small sum to start the company," Donna Carpenter, the company's co-CEO and Mr. Burton's wife, wrote in the Times in 2012.
Mr. Burton “was our founder, the soul of snowboarding, the one who gave us the sport we all love so much," John Lacy, who shares the chief executive title and duties, said in an e-mail to employees.
Born in 1954, Mr. Burton grew up in Cedarhurst, N.Y., outside of New York City on Long Island.
Mr. Burton attended the Brooks School in North Andover and the Marvelwood School in Connecticut before heading to the University of Colorado at Boulder, where he hoped to join the ski team.
After a broken collarbone derailed that plan, he moved back east and studied economics at New York University, graduating with a bachelor's degree before moving to Vermont and founding his company in his early 20s.
“I was blindly optimistic," Mr. Burton told Business People-Vermont in 2000.
Supplementing his income by bartending in a lodge at the Stratton Mountain Resort, he refined his designs in a woodworking shop that a ski school's instructor let him use.
“I worked there every minute I wasn't working at the restaurant," Mr. Burton told the Globe in 2002. “I was making prototypes."
In her New York Times article, Donna Carpenter recalled that they met at a New Year's Eve party while she was in college. In the company's early years, she wrote, “we were broke initially and led a rustic lifestyle, moving our bed from the third floor of our house to the first to be near the wood stove when it got really cold."
The company established operations in Europe in the 1980s, and the couple lived there for a few years. Along with tapping into the international market early, the company created a women's leadership initiative for employees, along with learn-to-ride centers for potential female customers, wrote Carpenter, who has held titles including president and chief financial officer.
She and Burton have three sons — George, Taylor, and Timi. Information about other survivors was not immediately available.
In his e-mail to employees, Lacy said details about a celebration of Mr. Burton's life would be announced, and that “I'd encourage everyone to do what Jake would be doing tomorrow, and that's riding. It's opening day at Stowe, so consider taking some turns together, in celebration of Jake."
Mr. Burton initially was diagnosed with testicular cancer in 2011. In addition, he had been paralyzed for several weeks in 2015 and hospitalized in intensive care after being diagnosed with Miller Fisher syndrome, a rare variant of Guillain-Barre syndrome. He recovered, and his experiences were chronicled in a New York Times article late that December.
Though the effects diminished over a few months, Mr. Burton had a tracheotomy, was fed through a tube, and spent time at a rehabilitation center in Boston.
“He changed, but he's not the type who needed a wake-up call on how to live," his wife told the Times. “Nobody needed this less than Jake."
Mr. Burton always noted that he didn't come up with the idea of snowboarding — earlier versions of the boards emerged decades ago — but he was credited with grasping its potential and appeal.
“I watched skiing lose its youth culture," he told the Times in 2003. “And as long as I'm around, we won't make that mistake."
Although his sport has yet to eclipse its older, better established competition, he predicted in the 1997 Globe interview that “eventually, boarding will be bigger than skiing. I think the sensation that snowboarding offers is simply more fun."
Indeed, on the cusp of snowboarding becoming an Olympic event in 1998, he emphasized the independence that attracted adherents.
“Accepting and recognizing individualism is what this sport is built on," he told the Globe. “It's about individual expression, how each one relates to winter and snow."
Even as his company sponsored many of snowboarding's top team competitors — including White, Kelly Clark, and Chloe Kim, all US Olympic gold medalists — Mr. Burton determinedly went about clocking 100 days a year on the slopes, reveling in his own individualism.
“The biggest rush for me continues to be the sensation of riding through tight Vermont trees just a little too fast," he said in 1997.
“On one hand, you don't know what's coming up next, but if you're on, you've got so much rhythm that you can absorb anything that comes your way," Mr. Burton added. “It's also real quiet in the woods, and the whole experience is very private, which only adds to the intensity of it all."

Texto completo: Senators were briefed by intelligence officers in recent weeks that Russia had been running a multi-year disinformation campaign to blame Ukraine for election interference in 2016.
Three intelligence officers confirmed that they had alerted several senators that Ukraine was not responsible for the 2016 election meddling or the hacking of the Democratic National Committee emails in recent briefings, according to a Friday report from the New York Times.
Some Republicans, including the president, have continued to inquire about Ukraine’s involvement in 2016. In the July phone call that became the basis for the impeachment hearings, President Trump requested that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky investigate Ukraine’s involvement in election meddling. He hinted at claims that the company CrowdStrike, the firm the DNC hired to investigate its email hack, had ties to Ukraine and was housing a “missing” DNC server.
Trump has since reiterated the accusation that Ukraine was involved in election interference. On Friday morning, he called into Fox & Friends and said, "They gave the server to CrowdStrike or whatever it’s called, which is a company owned by a very wealthy Ukrainian, and I still want to see that server. That’s what the word is.”
He added, “That’s what I asked actually on my phone call, you know. I asked it very point-blank because we’re looking for corruption. There’s tremendous corruption. Why should we be giving hundreds of millions of dollars to countries when there’s this kind of corruption?”
Trump’s concern over Ukraine bled into the questioning delivered by House Republicans during the impeachment hearings. Top Russian adviser Fiona Hill condemned the theories during her public testimony on Thursday and reiterated the claims made by the intelligence community, explaining that the CrowdStrike theories were part of a Russian disinformation campaign.
During her impeachment testimony, Hill said, “Based on questions and statements I have heard, some of you on this committee appear to believe that Russia and its security services did not conduct a campaign against our country — and that perhaps, somehow, for some reason, Ukraine did.”
She continued, “This is a fictional narrative that has been perpetrated and propagated by the Russian security services themselves. In the course of this investigation, I would ask that you please not promote politically driven falsehoods that so clearly advance Russian interests.”
Intelligence officials have generally agreed that Russia is trying to spread claims that Ukraine was responsible for the 2016 election meddling, but have not released an official report on the Russian disinformation strategy.

Texto completo: Amanda Ramírez fue sentenciada ayer a 6 años de cárcel por haber apuñalado fatalmente a su gemela durante una pelea callejera, en medio de una borrachera en Camden, Nueva Jersey.
La joven de 27 años se había declarado culpable en septiembre de homicidio involuntario.
Aunque inicialmente negó haber apuñalado a Anna Marie en el pecho, más tarde admitió el homicidio, pero afirmó que había actuado en defensa propia después de que su hermana tomase un cuchillo y la atacase primero, la madrugada del 22 del junio.
La acusada dijo que el apuñalamiento ocurrió después de una noche de consumo excesivo de alcohol, y agregó que no podía recordar por qué ella y su hermana habían comenzado a pelear.
Una de las versiones que circuló hablaba de un “triángulo amoroso”, según dijo Blanca Class, tía de ambas, al New York Times. “Fueron a una fiesta, volvieron a casa, estaban bebiendo, discutían sobre un novio”, afirmó en junio.
Cuando llegaron al edificio en los apartamentos de vivienda popular “Centennial Village”, había un hombre con ellos, informó New York Post, citando una vecina menor de edad.
Un obituario de Anna Marie publicado en internet la describe como una enfermera, madre de tres niñas.

Growing Legal Standoff Over Anguilla Case

Texto completo: An investment banker, a dead handyman, a lethal dose of cocaine: The case has put the U.S. and Anguilla at odds.
Two men fought in a desperate struggle last April inside a suite at a tropical resort in Anguilla, and only one of them would leave alive.
But what began as a one-on-one encounter has since ballooned into an international dispute over whether the survivor, an American banker, should have been charged with manslaughter.
Officials, lawyers and lawmakers in the United States find themselves squaring off not only against the authorities in Anguilla, a Caribbean island of some 15,000 people, but potentially also against Britain, of which it is a territory.
While the case's outcome is far from predictable, the present standoff could lead to extradition proceedings against the American charged in the case, Gavin Scott Hapgood, an investment banker in Darien, Conn.
The revelation in September that a lethal amount of cocaine was found in the bloodstream of the dead man, Kenny Mitchel, has not slowed the criminal proceedings against Mr. Hapgood.
In recent weeks, Mr. Hapgood has leveraged his social network in Connecticut to mount a formidable public relations campaign, winning sympathy and support from various American politicians.
United States senators on both sides of the aisle and President Trump himself have criticized the prosecution of Mr. Hapgood and the island's failure to guarantee his freedom to return home between hearings.
"Something looks and sounds very wrong," the president wrote on Twitter last month. "I know Anguilla will want to see this case be properly and justly resolved!"
Tensions behind the scenes came to the fore this month when Mr. Hapgood failed to appear at a court hearing in Anguilla, citing concerns for his safety and the possibility that his bail could be revoked.
"This was a very difficult decision for the family to make," Senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut said in an interview. "They had to assess all the personal risks and uncertainties." He and other lawmakers, including Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, signed a letter to the State Department on Nov. 4 to express concern about the case.
Mr. Hapgood's refusal to attend the hearing was immediately criticized by officials in Anguilla, with its attorney general, premier and governor all speaking out.
The governor, Tim Foy, called Mr. Hapgood's concerns for his safety "groundless."
"I invite those making or repeating these fabrications -- including those in public office -- to acquaint themselves with the facts by visiting us," Mr. Foy said in a statement, praising the island's "peace, serenity and calm."
The attorney general in Anguilla, Dwight D. Horsford, said in a statement that his office was seeking a warrant for Mr. Hapgood's arrest and would circulate it through Interpol, the international police organization, which would effectively make him a wanted man in much of the world. The status of that development, and the likelihood of an international warrant, were unclear this week.
On April 13, Mr. Hapgood, 45, was visiting the beachside Malliouhana resort with his wife and their three children when he answered a knock on the door. Mr. Mitchel, 27, a uniformed hotel employee, said he had come to fix a sink. Mr. Hapgood said none of the sinks seemed in need of repair, but invited him inside.
The two men began fighting, crashing into a bathroom and down to the floor. The much larger Mr. Hapgood, a former football player, pinned Mr. Mitchel for some of 30 minutes before the police showed up. Other employees arrived in that time and asked him to release Mr. Mitchel, but he refused, saying later he was afraid they were all working together.
Mr. Mitchel lost consciousness and was pronounced dead a short time later at a hospital. Days after the incident, Mr. Hapgood, who said he was defending himself against a robbery attempt, was charged with manslaughter and spent several hours in the island's tiny prison before a judge allowed him to return to Darien on $ 74,000 bail.
After that tumultuous week in April, the case dragged on until a bombshell revelation in September: The medical examiner in Anguilla, who first had ruled Mr. Mitchel's cause of death was asphyxiation in a prone position, revisited his finding and said Mr. Mitchel died of a cocaine overdose, according to the revised autopsy obtained by The New York Times. Mr. Mitchel had twice the amount of cocaine in his system that has been shown to be lethal in some people.
A preliminary hearing that began in September was to resume on Nov. 11, but Mr. Hapgood stayed in Connecticut. He feared his bail could be revoked, in which case he could face a year or more in jail on the island awaiting trial, his spokesman said. Months ago, an Anguilla judge, in allowing bail, noted that some of the corrections officers in the prison were relatives of the dead man.
"We understand there will be people in Anguilla who say Scott is running from a trial," his lawyer, Juliya Arbisman, said in a statement. "That is 100 percent false. There is nothing Scott wants more than to clear his name and get his life back. But he cannot clear his name if he is dead, or if the legal process by which he is bound is fundamentally biased and unjust."
The Hapgood family, which gave terse, prepared statements through a crisis-management firm in months after the incident, has gone on the offensive in recent weeks, organizing a network of supporters to raise cash and speak out against what it sees as a wrongful prosecution.
Mr. Hapgood's wife, Kallie, appeared on "Fox & Friends" in October and made a direct appeal to one man who she believed could come to her husband's aid: "I've seen Trump help Americans around the globe, and we really need his help," she said.
Minutes after her appearance, Mr. Trump tweeted about the case, saying "something looks and sounds wrong."
The Hapgoods later held a news conference on the steps of Darien Town Hall, flanked by dozens of supporters holding small American flags and signs that read "Justice for Scott," "Drop the Charges" and even "Save Scott Hapgood."
In Anguilla, where dozens of people attended a funeral for Mr. Mitchel in April -- the first of two, with the other in his native Dominica -- supporters for the dead man, who had a 2-year-old daughter with his former girlfriend, have said drug use and violence were not in his character.
Still, their descriptions of Mr. Mitchel as a fun-loving resort worker were complicated by an arrest on a rape charge in the days before his death; Mr. Mitchel's former girlfriend, Emily Garlick, told the police he had attacked her. That case was pending when he died, and Ms. Garlick has since retracted her accusation, calling the incident an argument.
A former member of Parliament in Anguilla, Haydn Hughes, seemed to speak for many of the islanders in a recent video about the Hapgood case posted on Facebook.
"We still want him to return to face the court and to prove that our system is far more fair than even his homeland's," Mr. Hughes said, "and we are an objective, peaceful people."

Texto completo: As a prep school student, Jake Burton was riding a Snurfer — a precursor to the snowboard — when his hand slammed into a tree, fracturing a finger. That was a lucky break for what became the still-growing snowboarding industry.
Tinkering over the next several years with the design of the Snurfer, which gave standing riders little control, Mr. Burton created prototypes of what would be manufactured by Burton Snowboards — the company he founded. Though he built his operation into a major player in a multibillion-dollar industry, and helped change the face of sports on slopes, he shrugged off suggestions that he had glimpsed winter's future early on.
“When I started the company, I had no idea this would be done at ski areas the way it is today, or in the Olympics," he told the Globe in 2002. “So I give myself much more credit for persevering through the tough times than for having a vision of where this sport was going."
Mr. Burton, who had announced earlier this month that he had been diagnosed with a recurrence of cancer, died Wednesday in Burlington, Vt., according to e-mail sent to the company's staff. He was 65.
Often referred to as the godfather of snowboarding, Mr. Burton was a board chairman who wanted to keep the sport faithful to its outsider origins.
“I just saw snowboarding as an alternative to skiing and the expense," he told the Globe in 1997. “It was just a back-hill kind of thing. That's how we used to go boarding in the beginning."
Even when his company was drawing an estimated one-third of consumer spending on snowboarding, and was sponsoring numerous Olympians, Mr. Burton was seen as the kind of iconic figure anyone would aspire to join on the slopes.
“He's like the cool dad of the sport," Shaun White, a three-time Olympic gold medalist and one of snowboarding's most recognizable figures, told The New York Times in 2015.
Mr. Burton never minded when his employees arrived late on a day of fresh snow. He knew where they were and knew they were only emulating the company's founder. He always tried to snowboard 100 days each year.
“If you get in a couple of runs in the morning, you can work until midnight," he told the Times in 2003.
Mr. Burton's birth name was John Burton Carpenter, though for public purposes he went by Burton after launching his company in 1977 in Londonderry, Vt. The company now has its headquarters in Burlington, Vt.
“He thought Burton Snowboards sounded better than Carpenter Snowboards, and he wanted to honor his maternal grandmother, whose surname was Burton. She had left him a small sum to start the company," Donna Carpenter, the company's co-CEO and Mr. Burton's wife, wrote in the Times in 2012.
Mr. Burton “was our founder, the soul of snowboarding, the one who gave us the sport we all love so much," John Lacy, who shares the chief executive title and duties, said in an e-mail to employees.
Born in 1954, Mr. Burton grew up in Cedarhurst, N.Y., outside of New York City on Long Island.
Mr. Burton attended the Brooks School in North Andover and the Marvelwood School in Connecticut before heading to the University of Colorado at Boulder, where he hoped to join the ski team.
After a broken collarbone derailed that plan, he moved back east and studied economics at New York University, graduating with a bachelor's degree before moving to Vermont and founding his company in his early 20s.
“I was blindly optimistic," Mr. Burton told Business People-Vermont in 2000.
Supplementing his income by bartending in a lodge at the Stratton Mountain Resort, he refined his designs in a woodworking shop that a ski school's instructor let him use.
“I worked there every minute I wasn't working at the restaurant," Mr. Burton told the Globe in 2002. “I was making prototypes."
In her New York Times article, Donna Carpenter recalled that they met at a New Year's Eve party while she was in college. In the company's early years, she wrote, “we were broke initially and led a rustic lifestyle, moving our bed from the third floor of our house to the first to be near the wood stove when it got really cold."
The company established operations in Europe in the 1980s, and the couple lived there for a few years. Along with tapping into the international market early, the company created a women's leadership initiative for employees, along with learn-to-ride centers for potential female customers, wrote Carpenter, who has held titles including president and chief financial officer.
She and Burton have three sons — George, Taylor, and Timi. Information about other survivors was not immediately available.
In his e-mail to employees, Lacy said details about a celebration of Mr. Burton's life would be announced, and that “I'd encourage everyone to do what Jake would be doing tomorrow, and that's riding. It's opening day at Stowe, so consider taking some turns together, in celebration of Jake."
Mr. Burton initially was diagnosed with testicular cancer in 2011. In addition, he had been paralyzed for several weeks in 2015 and hospitalized in intensive care after being diagnosed with Miller Fisher syndrome, a rare variant of Guillain-Barre syndrome. He recovered, and his experiences were chronicled in a New York Times article late that December.
Though the effects diminished over a few months, Mr. Burton had a tracheotomy, was fed through a tube, and spent time at a rehabilitation center in Boston.
“He changed, but he's not the type who needed a wake-up call on how to live," his wife told the Times. “Nobody needed this less than Jake."
Mr. Burton always noted that he didn't come up with the idea of snowboarding — earlier versions of the boards emerged decades ago — but he was credited with grasping its potential and appeal.
“I watched skiing lose its youth culture," he told the Times in 2003. “And as long as I'm around, we won't make that mistake."
Although his sport has yet to eclipse its older, better established competition, he predicted in the 1997 Globe interview that “eventually, boarding will be bigger than skiing. I think the sensation that snowboarding offers is simply more fun."
Indeed, on the cusp of snowboarding becoming an Olympic event in 1998, he emphasized the independence that attracted adherents.
“Accepting and recognizing individualism is what this sport is built on," he told the Globe. “It's about individual expression, how each one relates to winter and snow."
Even as his company sponsored many of snowboarding's top team competitors — including White, Kelly Clark, and Chloe Kim, all US Olympic gold medalists — Mr. Burton determinedly went about clocking 100 days a year on the slopes, reveling in his own individualism.
“The biggest rush for me continues to be the sensation of riding through tight Vermont trees just a little too fast," he said in 1997.
“On one hand, you don't know what's coming up next, but if you're on, you've got so much rhythm that you can absorb anything that comes your way," Mr. Burton added. “It's also real quiet in the woods, and the whole experience is very private, which only adds to the intensity of it all."

Texto completo: Memo to Donald Trump: Throw Rudy Giuliani under a bus.
Everything’s going wrong for the White House right now. We just had a Trump-appointed ambassador telling the impeachment hearing that there was indeed a quid pro quo in Ukraine, and everybody knew it.
Most of the Democrats’ witnesses seem both sympathetic and believable. The Republicans produced a diplomat who instantly started telling the room what a terrific, honorable guy Joe Biden is.
And no fair saying this is boring. Tell me you yawned when Wednesday’s star witness described telling Trump that Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy “loves your ass.”
European Union Ambassador Gordon Sondland testified that he was just putting his message in “Trump-speak.” It turns out “loves your ass” translates into “would really work with us on a whole host of issues.”
See? Every day there’s a new nugget.
Nevertheless, it’s hard to imagine a whole lot of minds are left to be changed by the current proceedings. Trump’s aides have presumably figured out that making fun of embattled public servants or Purple Heart recipients is not going to pay off.
Why not just blame everything on Rudy? It wouldn’t change the trajectory of the story, but it would cheer up everybody’s Thanksgiving dinner.
And it’s fair. When it comes to bad news in Ukraine, Rudy Giuliani is everywhere. Some of our diplomats seem to see much more of the president’s personal lawyer than they do of the secretary of state.
“Talk to Rudy,” Trump told a delegation that had just returned from Ukraine.
“I will have Mr. Giuliani give you a call,” he said in that famous July 25 conversation with Zelenskiy.
And it goes on and on. Sondland said he, former envoy Kurt Volker and Rick Perry “worked with Mr. Rudy Giuliani on Ukraine matters at the express direction of the president of the United States. We did not want to work with Mr. Giuliani. … We followed the president’s orders.”
We have to stop here for just one minute to note that Volker, Sondland and Perry, who were supposed to be keeping an eye on Ukraine for the administration, were known as “the three amigos.” “I am a proud part of the three amigos,” Sondland said during his testimony.
“That is the same thing Ambassador Volker said yesterday,” Devin Nunes, the top Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, responded.
That was sort of interesting — in part because it was one of the relatively few times Nunes managed to complete a sentence without crying, “Identify the whistleblower!” or “Hunter Biden!”
Also because Volker actually said the nickname made him “cringe.” He believes “three amigos” should only refer to the glorious bipartisan Senate trio of John McCain, Joe Lieberman and Lindsey Graham. Now, of course, McCain has passed away, Lieberman is a lobbyist for a Chinese telecom company and Graham is Donald Trump’s lap puppy. So the cringy thing really could make sense.
The rest of the world thinks about an old so-bad-it’s-good movie with Chevy Chase, Martin Short and Steve Martin. If there’s a remake, who plays the Chevy Chase role? Rick Perry?
Back to Rudy: Sondland said the Trump amigos hated working with Giuliani, but he was the only person who could get Zelenskiy a meeting at the White House. The diplomats who testified really did seem concerned about helping Ukraine out. Sure, some of them got the job via a million-dollar political donation and then spent way too much refurbishing their official residence. (Looking at you, Mr. S.) Still.
If Trump wants to change the conversation for a minute, he should definitely turn on Giuliani. Almost everybody has come to realize how horrible Rudy is, although some innocent souls remember him from his glory days running New York City after 9/11.
“I only know him as New York’s finest mayor,” said Alexander Vindman, a rather sweet, nerdy military officer who served as one of the stars of the week in Washington. Irritated Republicans looking for a way to undermine his testimony had to stoop to criticizing the lieutenant colonel for wearing his uniform.
Vindman had clearly not heard about Giuliani’s decision, before the attack, to put the city’s emergency command center into the already-bombed-once World Trade Center because he wanted it to be within walking distance of City Hall. Or his 9 million sexual escapades, which have dwindled from sort-of-shocking to really-really-depressing as he’s aged and gone more untethered.
This story is never going to start looking better for Donald Trump. Ukraine will follow him everywhere — through impeachment, into the Senate hearings, and if nothing saves us from the fate, on to the 2020 campaign.
And we all know our president will never blame himself for anything. So why not Rudy? At least we’d get rid of one awful self-obsessed New Yorker in the White House.
A reporter from The Guardian recently asked Giuliani about his under-the-bus prospects. Rudy said he had “insurance” that would protect him.
“He’s joking,” his lawyer said quickly. Yes, the president’s lawyer needs a lawyer.

Texto completo: Presumiendo con fotos suyas su amistad con el ex presidente Bill Clinton, el millonario Jeffrey Epstein seducía a las menores de edad que llevaba a sus casas, según afirma una de sus víctimas en la última demanda presentada ayer en Nueva York.
La ex modelo, quien es identificado sólo como “Mary Doe” en la demanda federal, dijo que cuando fue a su casa del Upper East Side (9 East 71 St) tenía 16 años, en 2004.
Epstein le dijo que él y el presidente Clinton eran “mejores amigos”, afirma la querella, según New York Post.
La demandante dice que llegó a EEUU desde una nación no identificada devastada por la guerra como refugiada unos años antes y le dijo a Epstein que las políticas presidenciales de Clinton hicieron posible que ella y su familia se establecieran en este país.
Al oírla, Epstein le comentó que personalmente agradecería a “Bill en nombre de ella y de su familia”, dice la demanda.
Según la denuncia, Epstein abusó sexualmente de ella varias veces cuando era una modelo adolescente que trabajaba y vivía en la ciudad de Nueva York.
El pasado 10 de agosto, Epstein (66) fue hallado muerto en su celda en el Centro Correccional Metropolitano (MCC) del Bajo Manhattan, dos días después de firmar un testamento, siguiendo un primer supuesto intento de suicidio el 23 de julio.
En esa mansión de siete pisos en Manhattan, la policía reportó tras su muerte que Epstein tenía colgada una extravagante pintura al óleo del ex presidente Clinton, con un vestido azul de mujer y tacones rojos, simulando a Mónica Lewinsky y descansando en una silla en la Oficina Oval.
Desde su arresto en julio, The New York Times destacó la amistad en el pasado de Epstein con personalidades como el Príncipe Andrés de Inglaterra, el cineasta Woody Allen y los presidentes Donald Trump y Clinton.
Enseguida, Clinton emitió un comunicado distanciándose del acusado pedófilo.
Aunque su muerte fue calificada oficialmente de suicidio por ahorcamiento, en las últimos semanas han vuelto los rumores sobre asesinato por estrangulación.
Esta semana fueron imputados los dos guardias que estaban encargados de vigilar su celda, por falsificar datos para encubrir por qué no cumplieron con su trabajo .

Texto completo: The remarkable young violinist Randall Goosby appears in Clarksville this week.
At 7:30 p.m. on Thursday, Nov. 21, the Clarksville Community Concert Association will present a concert by Goosby, who was the youngest winner of the Sphinx Concerto Competition ever at the age of thirteen. Soon after, Mr. Goosby debuted with the New York Philharmonic and won effusive praise from the New York Times, which noted that Goosby's performance "won him a deserved standing ovation for its sheer virtuosity."
In 2018, Randall Goosby won the Young Concert Artists International Auditions, at the age of 22. His Clarksville concert features music by Tomaso Vitali, Claude Debussy, and Richard Strauss, as well as the rarely heard Suite for Violin and Piano by African-American composer William Grant Still. Mr. Goosby plays a Giuseppe Guarneri del Gesù violin on loan from the Stradivari Society. Goosby's concert in Clarksville will take place in Mabry Hall, on the corner of Marion and Eighth streets, in downtown Clarksville. Tickets can be purchased online at www.clarksvillemusic.org or at the door; arrive early for the best seating options. Adult tickets are $25, and students are admitted for $5; Austin Peay State University students are admitted free with ID.

Texto completo: On the heels of starring in and directing the harrowing Sam Shepard play "True West," Patrick Jordan is taking a step back in barebones productions' next show. Hot property "Dance Nation," coming off an acclaimed off-Broadway run last year, arrives in Braddock with Melissa Martin directing and Tome Cousin as the first-ever choreographer for barebones.
For this one, Jordan is wearing his artistic director/producer hat and having a ball watching the play come alive onstage.
"It's not lost on me that a lot of barebones' works skew pretty heavily male," he said. "What a lot of people don't know is that I have been searching for the perfect show that aligns with our mission and content that is a predominantly female cast/story for nearly 10 years. I was raised in a house with all women, and I am surrounded by powerful women in every aspect of my life - I needed to do this right."
Delivering his elevator pitch for "Dance Nation," which opens at barebones' Braddock Black Box theater Friday, it sounds like he's been having a great time setting the table and watching the feast arrive.
"It's funny, it's touching, it's poignant it's raw, plus these dance numbers ... maybe it's just me? I get really giddy," he said. "I am a closet musical theater guy. When we had dance auditions and I heard '5, 6, 7, 8,' I got really excited."
Clare Barron's award-winning play about preteen competitive dancers had its world premiere last year at Playwrights Horizons, drawing ecstatic reviews from both The New York Times and Washington Post.
"A blazingly original play from the insanely talented Clare Barron ... marvel at how close what you see cuts to the bone," said the Times' Ben Brantley.
"I have seen the future and it is 'Dance Nation,' " said the Post's Peter Marks.
The inner strength of these characters, ages 11-13, is unleashing their emerging power while dealing with the onslaught of puberty. In the locker room, you may find one girl playing with a My Little Pony doll, while another is talking about sex.
Playwrights Horizons, where the play premiered, summed up "Dance Nation" as: "Somewhere in America, an army of preteen competitive dancers plots to take over the world. And if their new routine is good enough, they'll claw their way to the top at the Boogie Down Grand Prix in Tampa Bay. But in Clare Barron's raucous pageant of ambition and ferocity, these young dancers have more than choreography on their minds, because every plie and jete is a step toward finding themselves, and a fight to unleash their power."
"It's a real look at a competitive dance troupe of 11- to 13-year-old girls played by actresses ranging in age from their 20s to their 60s," is how Jordan described "Dance Nation."
While putting together a routine for a national competition, the characters also are facing the coming-of-age crises you might expect among tween girls. As vast amounts of research tells us, the early adolescent brain is evolving with regard to emotional development, and emotions in "Dance Nation" often run at a fever pitch.
To find actors who can capture tween lightning in a bottle, the audition process proved difficult in unexpected ways. Martin and Jordan found this was "the hardest show we ever had to cast, because everybody was so good."
"The women in Pittsburgh came out for this play," he continued. "We could have cast it three or four times over, so it came down to razor-thin specific choices for the trajectory of the play."
The play introduces Penn State grad Mita Ghosal, a choreographer who has an MFA in dance from UCLA, while Liron Blumenthal and Mei Lu Barnum are out of Point Park University's conservatory programs. Jerreme Rodriguez, no stranger to Pittsburgh theatergoers, is in his first barebones show, along with stage veterans Hope Anthony, Lisa Brennan, Cary Anne Spear and David Conrad (TV's "The Ghost Whisperer"; "The Legend of Georgia McBride" at barebones) as Dance Teacher Pat.
For Jordan, there's a line in the play that sums up what to expect from "Dance Nation."
"One of the characters talks about what she has inside, and she says, 'What am I going to do with all this power?' And you don't know which way it is going to go."

Texto completo: Three shared online documents listing salary information purport to show stark disparities.
With income inequality a focus of the current presidential candidates, workers in journalism, advertising and book publishing have anonymously posted salary information on crowdsourced spreadsheets, many of them hoping their efforts will lead to higher pay.
"Having salaries that aren't transparent only benefits the people at the top," said Sarah Kobos, a senior photo editor at the consumer products website Wirecutter, which is owned by The New York Times. Ms. Kobos started a spreadsheet for journalists last week.
The document, Real Media Salaries, has more than 1,400 anonymous entries, many listing sex, racial identity and years of experience in addition to salary information. It has given rise to a pair of similar documents in the publishing and advertising industries.
On Tuesday, an Instagram account, Real Agency Salaries, linked to a spreadsheet that has more than 1,000 entries purporting to provide information on compensation in the ad business. The document, which does not identify its creator, states in an echo of the media spreadsheet: "Talking about how much or how little money you make feels taboo, and it shouldn't." Its existence was first reported by the trade news site AgencySpy.
Real Agency Salaries suggests there are striking disparities in pay for different demographic groups. A white, male freelance creative director in New York with 28 years of experience reported a salary of $ 300,000. A Latino man with the same job description in New Jersey and 25 years of experience said he made $ 95,000.
The third spreadsheet, Transparency in Publishing Salaries, had not caught on in the same way, with 15 entries on Wednesday evening.
People are contributing to the lists during a wave of unionization in digital media, an industry of high valuations and young workers. Last week, employees of Hearst Magazines voted to join the Writers Guild of America East. Earlier, NBC News's digital staff chose as its bargaining representative the NewsGuild of New York, which represents employees at The Times, The New Yorker and digital properties including BuzzFeed.
Ms. Kobos, the creator of Real Media Salaries, said in an interview that a recent union drive at Wirecutter had helped inspire the spreadsheet. She also acknowledged an antecedent: a 2017 spreadsheet in which media workers published allegations of sexual misconduct against men in the industry. That list, created as the #MeToo movement was expanding, led to investigations that resulted in the departures of prominent journalists.
The advertising industry had its own version last year, Diet Madison Avenue, an anonymous Instagram account that encouraged workers to submit reports of sexual misconduct. The account led to the dismissals of several men from ad agencies, but was eventually deleted and became the target of a defamation lawsuit that remains active.
Crowdsourced data allows for vast amounts of information to be collected -- but it is a challenge to fact-check. Jessica Lessin, the founder and editor in chief of the tech website The Information, wrote on Twitter that the spreadsheet for journalists was "not even close to fact." In an interview, she added that a listing that matched up with someone on her staff was inaccurate.
Similarly, some of the data on the advertising list seems to have been submitted in jest. One entry reported that an employee at the ad agency We Are Unlimited was paid in "White Claw and tears." A person identified as a senior strategic planner at the VMLY&R agency claimed to have 111 years of work experience.

Vin Gupta: The cowardice behind Trump’s vaping ban retreat

Texto completo: Is there any limit to the Trump administration’s willingness to endanger public health and safety for political purposes?
First, it weakened environmental protection standards, despite clear evidence that the air we breathe is irreparably harming us and our children. Then it formally left the Paris Agreement on climate change, despite its being the only available option to help address our worsening air. Now the president has walked back his promise to regulate the vaping industry and ban most flavored e-cigarettes, even as they render an entire generation more vulnerable to nicotine addiction — not to mention life-altering severe lung injury.
And that’s just in the past month.
You have to mine the deepest depths of shamelessness to understand the prevailing motives for these actions. In the case of the proposed flavored e-cigarette ban, the vaping industry has engaged in a vigorous defense campaign. Its products just help smokers get their nicotine fix more safely, it says. (As it turns out, we have no long-term safety data on the effects of vaping on lung tissue, and what small studies we do have are ominous and suggest vaping might even be more harmful to vital organs than traditional smoking.) Businesses could be hurt by a ban, the industry said; Trump voters might turn on their president.
Attempts by the Trump administration to appease everyone in the room have failed miserably, most likely because they are so intellectually dishonest. The facts remain clear: A vast majority — over 70 percent — of our youth who decide to vape do so because they want to experiment with flavors. Why are we surprised that candy flavors like cherry and bubble gum appeal to youth in ways that tobacco-flavored e-cigarettes do not? As these products have become more accessible, youth vaping rates have risen: Today, one in every four high schoolers report at least occasional use of a vaping device. Between 2017 and 2018, e-cigarette use among high school students increased by nearly 80 percent.
This is a problem. First, just one pod from the e-cigarette brand Juul — a brand especially popular among teenagers — contains as much nicotine as 20 cigarettes, and nicotine has adverse effects on adolescent brain development. Second, e-cigarettes are a known gateway to other harmful substances — most worryingly, conventional tobacco cigarettes.
With nearly 2,000 cases of severe lung illness and 37 deaths across the country attributable to vaping, this crisis has brought new attention to products that have long needed, but never received, federal scrutiny. Vaping devices have been on the market since the late 2000s, and yet the Food and Drug Administration has not examined a large majority of these products for their health or safety impact on humans. This is a failure of leadership on both sides of the political aisle.
High-profile advocates of stronger vaping regulations, like former F.D.A. Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, once had influential platforms in the Trump administration to lead on this issue. Instead, Dr. Gottlieb chose to use his privileged position to grant additional delays to vaping companies before establishing federal oversight of e-cigarette companies. Now that he’s out of office, he has called for a sweeping ban on all pod-based cigarettes. But demonstrating courage on the sidelines after misusing an opportunity to lead is the type of inauthentic leadership we’ve come to expect from our politicians, not our high-level appointed health officials.
As a public health researcher and pulmonologist, I am constantly asked by families how to stay healthy and safe despite a seemingly endless array of health threats all around us. Our lungs, after all, are often our first line of defense against what we are exposed to, both intentionally (vaping) and involuntarily (pollution). I wish I could look to our country’s surgeon general or its F.D.A. commissioner — both physicians — for guidance on how to counsel American families and reassure them that policies will change and help is on the way. But the deafening silence from these members of the Trump administration in the wake of this month’s reversal on flavored e-cigarettes flies in the face of their most sacred commitment: First, do no harm.

Unequal Treatment Seen For Minority Home Buyers

Texto completo: An undercover investigation on Long Island found that real estate agents treated people of color unequally 40 percent of the time.
One Long Island real estate agent told a black man that houses in a predominantly white neighborhood were too expensive for his budget. But the same agent showed houses in the same neighborhood to a white man with the same amount of money to spend.
Another real estate agent warned a white home buyer about gang violence in a mostly minority neighborhood, but she appeared to steer a black buyer with a comparable budget toward homes in that neighborhood.
All told, real estate agents treated people of color unequally 40 percent of the time compared with white people when they searched for homes on Long Island, one of the most racially segregated suburbs in the United States.
Those were among the findings of a three-year undercover investigation published this past weekend by Newsday, a Long Island newspaper, which exposed widespread evidence that discriminatory, and potentially illegal, home-selling practices are helping to keep the area's neighborhoods segregated.
Newsday did the sort of undercover testing that government agencies and nonprofit groups are supposed to do to enforce fair-housing regulations meant to prevent disparate treatment based on racial and other factors.
The newspaper recruited a diverse group of people, some of them actors, to pose as first-time home buyers, outfitting them with hidden cameras to capture their interactions with real estate agents. It is legal in New York to record a conversation or phone call if the person making the recording is a party to the conversation.
Over 16 months, the would-be home buyers conducted about 100 tests. They got help from housing experts and recorded 240 hours of video that the newspaper turned into a 13-article series and a 40-minute documentary. More than 50 reporters, producers, editors and other Newsday employees worked on the project.
The newspaper contacted 93 real estate agents at some of the area's biggest firms. Two testers -- of different races, but of the same gender and about the same age, with similar income and housing preferences -- would independently approach the same agent to test whether they were treated differently based on their race.
The results were startling, even though Long Island is a part of New York where redlining, zoning regulations and other forces have long perpetuated racial divides.
"Black testers experienced disparate treatment 49 percent of the time -- compared with 39 percent for Hispanic and 19 percent for Asian testers," Newsday reported.
In some cases, agents did not show listings to black testers if they had not been preapproved for a mortgage. The same agents would accommodate white testers who did not meet that condition.
The federal fair-housing law, passed in 1968 as part of the Civil Rights Act, prohibits discrimination in housing based on race, religion and other factors.
The Department of Housing and Urban Development is responsible for enforcing the law, mostly through its regional offices and through grants to nonprofits to investigate complaints, conduct tests and educate buyers and renters.
In New York, state agencies also enforce the law, with the state's 133,000 licensed real estate brokers and agents responsible for abiding by fair-housing standards.
The enforcement process, which can be slow, starts mostly with complaints, but undercover tests are often the most effective way of proving disparate treatment. Newsday found that tests were used only sporadically because they are time-consuming and expensive.
Records show few examples of the state imposing heavy penalties, like fines, on agents found to have discriminated, Newsday found.
Government officials said they were examining what Newsday had uncovered.
"We are reviewing this report but make no mistake: Every complaint received is thoroughly investigated and we urge any New Yorker who believes they have been the victim of housing discrimination to contact us immediately," Richard Azzopardi, a spokesman for Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, said in a statement.
Olga Alvarez, a spokeswoman for the federal housing department, said that the agency was examining Newsday's findings.
"Combating housing discrimination is at the forefront of our department's enforcement priorities," she said.
Ken Zimmerman, a distinguished fellow and fair housing expert at New York University's Furman Center, said that Newsday's findings were a "modern manifestation of what has gotten in the way of the legal mandate and policy aspirations of the Fair Housing Act."
"There needs to be more investment in uncovering intentional discrimination, as these tests reflect," he added.
Real estate agents are barred from talking to clients about the backgrounds of people who live in neighborhoods and they are required to provide equal guidance about areas in which they may want to live.
Newsday found that agents ignored those rules repeatedly.
Agents overwhelmingly directed white buyers to Merrick, a hamlet in Nassau County where most of the residents are white. When discussing Brentwood, a predominantly black and Hispanic hamlet where gangs like MS-13 are active, an agent told one black tester that residents there were the "nicest people."
The same agent emailed a white tester to "please kindly do some research on the gang related events in that area for safety."
White customers were often given more listings than minority testers, Newsday found. And in a quarter of the cases, agents appeared to unlawfully steer buyers to different communities based on their race or ethnicity.
"This investigation brought to light what too many people of color in our state know already," Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, Democrat of New York, said in a statement, "that discrimination is real and targeted, and rears its head in every aspect of their lives."

The Attack on Asian-Americans; Progressives call these foes of racial preferences 'the worst kind of Americans.'

Texto completo: Asian-Americans have finally made it in America. How do we know? Not from their wealth or educational achievements, but from the way progressives now target those in the community who believe people shouldn't be judged by skin color. For in so doing, these Asian-Americans have exposed a growing fault line in affirmative-action orthodoxy.
The most recent occasion for progressive grievance comes courtesy of the state of Washington. There, Asian-Americans proved instrumental in killing a law that would have overturned a two-decade-old ban on racial preferences in public education, employment and contracting. To do this, Asian-Americans successfully rallied to force the law onto the ballot—and then defeated it. It's a staggering achievement in a state that ranks among America's bluest, and in a contest where the pro-affirmative-action side enjoyed more resources plus the support of the political establishment, including an Asian-American former governor.
The ballot referendum in Washington isn't the first time Asian-Americans have rebelled against an attempt to sneak racial discrimination back into the law. Five years ago, when California considered a law that would have reversed its own ban on racial preferences, a backlash by the Asian-American community forced three Asian-American Democrats who had voted yes in the state Senate to switch sides—dooming the measure. In New York, Asian-Americans are now battling Mayor Bill de Blasio's bid to increase the number of African-American and Latino kids at the city's specialized high schools—at the expense of Asian-American children. Meanwhile, a high-profile lawsuit brought against Harvard for its race-based admissions preferences is likely to end up before the Supreme Court.
The Asian-American role in these campaigns is not going over well in some parts of the community. Comedian Hasan Minhaj closed out his 2018 Netflix special by calling the Asian-Americans suing Harvard "the worst kind" of Americans. Playwright Young Jean Lee wrote an op-ed in the New York Times calling the Harvard lawsuit "a cynical manipulation that urges Asian-Americans to sell out other people of color." In the Nation, Claire Jean Kim says that what we are seeing is "nascent, conservative Chinese immigrant nationalism" combining with "an older, conservative white nationalism" to inflame anti-affirmative-action politics.
That's one way of looking at it. Another is that increasing numbers of Asian-Americans, rather than unthinkingly embracing identity-politics dogma, have come to recognize that using race discrimination to promote diversity, especially in education, is excluding their children from opportunities they have earned. Some are also struck by a progressive narrative that encourages the celebration of diversity—the Asian-American community itself spans dozens of nations, ethnicities, religions and languages—even while insisting all are required to think alike.
One man whose name comes up often in these complaints is Edward Blum. A visiting fellow at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington, Mr. Blum is also president of Students for Fair Admissions, which is leading the lawsuit against Harvard. In an earlier day Mr. Blum might have been hailed for reaching out across racial lines to work for a colorblind America. Alas, the demonology of the day holds that Mr. Blum is working cynically, as the American Civil Liberties Union puts it, to "pit people of color against one another." Never mind that Mr. Blum makes an unlikely avatar for white privilege.
"I grew up in a Yiddish-speaking household where we children were taught that racial and religious discrimination were malicious," he says. "My efforts to help end the discrimination that Asian-Americans suffer when applying to elite colleges is part of a long tradition of civil rights advocates."
The champions of affirmative action point out that when Washington's ban originally passed in November 1998, it did so with a robust 58% of the vote. This time, it was sustained very narrowly (50.4% to 49.6%), suggesting public opposition to affirmative action is thinning. But Mr. Blum suggests that the vague wording of the referendum—which included language guaranteeing opportunity and prohibiting quotas—may have more to do with the narrow margin.
Compare the wording of Washington ballot measure, he says, with that of a Pew Research Center survey from earlier this year. When asked directly whether "race or ethnicity" should be a "major factor," a "minor factor" or "not a factor" in college admissions, 73% of Americans chose "not a factor." Not only did 78% of whites agree but so did 65% of Hispanics, 62% of blacks, 58% of Asian-Americans—and 63% of Democrats.
Meanwhile Asian-American leaders who contend that affirmative action is doing their community no favors find themselves denounced as sellouts. Wai Wah Chin, president of the Chinese American Citizens Alliance of Greater New York, says this is no different from how blacks and Latinos who also dissent from the progressive party line on race have been treated.
"For many Asian-Americans who mobilized against the Washington ballot initiative," she says, "it was their first participation in American politics. In the 19th century we had the Chinese Exclusion Acts. In the 21st, we are fighting a modern Asian Exclusion Act."

Texto completo: As mayor of Santa Fe, Alan Webber wears many hats.
He's the first full-time elected chief executive officer at
City Hall.
He heads the governing body, presiding over City Council meetings and setting the agenda.
He's the public face of the city, not only at local events but around the country.
He's Santa Fe's biggest cheerleader and champion.
But it's the actual hat on top of his head that has been generating attention lately.
"There are as many stories about my hat collection and my recent discovery of the Open Road model as there are editions of The New Mexican," Webber said, adding that hats are both fun and functional, particularly in a sunny environment such as Santa Fe's.
"I have always liked hats," he said. "I've admired people who know how to wear a hat, from Harry Truman to Indiana Jones."
Webber was initially reluctant to be interviewed for a story about his new accessory, which he began wearing on a more regular basis during the summer.
But once the mayor got talking, it's clear he's long been "cap-tivated" by hats.
Webber said he has a "pretty good small collection" of different kinds of hats. Though he wears them occasionally, they're not a daily component of his wardrobe.
But over the summer, in the course of reading a biography on Truman, Webber noticed the 33rd president of the United States sported a Stetson called the Open Road, a style that former President Lyndon B. Johnson also wore.
Webber noted that other presidents, including Ronald Reagan and Franklin Roosevelt, also wore hats.
"I've never seen [President Donald] Trump with a hat because it might interfere with his hair -- or maybe that is a hat," he said, laughing.
Webber, a founding editor of Fast Company magazine, said he also read a recent piece in the New York Times about the evolution of cowboy hats as part of an emerging and increasingly popular part of people sporting hats again.
"I also noticed that my friendly neighborhood dermatologist said, 'Cover your head better,' " the mostly bald civic leader said.
"These are all many factors in a complicated calculation. This is not something you just arrive at willy nilly," he said, laughing. "It's like an algorithm."
After he decided "the Open Road model was the way to go," Webber said he went to Montecristi Custom Hat Works, which has a retail store on Galisteo Street, and found what he called an "excellent" Panama straw hat in that style.
"They've got this amazingly interesting device that almost looks like a medieval torture machine that fits over your head and then it gives you a measurement, and it also produces a drawing of the shape of your head," he said. "It is fascinating."
Montecristi seamstress Aly Gray said Panamas typically range from $800 to $2,000, though they can be more expensive.
"The version that he got was $1,800," Gray said, adding that the original cost was $2,100 but that Webber got a discount.
When the season started to change, Webber said he broke out a hat he purchased some years ago from a hat-maker outside Galisteo but never really wore.
"After I was so satisfied and content with the summer version of the Open Road, I took the hat that I had made back to Montecristi, and they were able to reconstitute it and reblock it and refinish it so that it's also the Open Road model," he said.
Gray said Montecristi worked on the hat Webber already owned as a special favor to the mayor.
"We don't typically work on hats that are not our Montecristi hats," she said.
Webber said the revamped hat, which he called "a very beautiful color of dusty gray," didn't fit quite right in its original state.
"Hats are all about being confident and I wasn't sure I had -- in the jargon of our time -- that I was rocking the right look," he said. "It was something that the hat-maker and I collaborated on, which in retrospect, wasn't really a particularly satisfying outcome. ... I missed on that one.
"But the hat, the quality of the material and the quality of the hat-maker's work was excellent. I just hadn't evolved enough in my hat taste to have the right model. Now I'm feeling very good about it."
Webber said he found it "interesting" that people took notice of his hat.
"I think the hat I'm wearing right now, the color and quality of the workmanship, is what people like because this morning I was up at the [Randall Davey Audubon Center and Sanctuary] for an event with the governor and the head of the Forest Service, just sitting in the audience wearing my hat, and a couple of people came up and said, 'I really like that hat,' " he said. "So clearly, the hat as a hat is getting positive reviews so far."
When told the hat made him look somewhat presidential, Webber laughed uncontrollably.
"That," he said, "is a ring into which I am not throwing my hat."

'You're done': Radio host fired mid-show after slamming Trump

Texto completo: A radio show host in Denver was fired midway through his three-hour show on Saturday after he criticized President Trump.
The operations manager for KNUS, a conservative talk-radio station, walked into the studio after a Saturday segment about Trump’s former personal attorney Roy Cohn and told Craig Silverman, “You’re done.”
It’s unclear whether Silverman’s firing was due to his critical comments about the president or his appearances on competing stations. Silverman told the New York Times he supported Trump in the 2016 election but has since “stepped back off the Trump train.”
He said he was never told what he could say on-air at the station owned by Salem Media Group, which Silverman described as being “100% behind Donald Trump,” but his invitations to appear on his colleagues’ shows gradually stopped. Silverman said he thought it was because of his views on Trump.
“I expressed myself on Twitter, but I was hoping to be able to express myself on my own radio station, but that wasn’t available,” he said. “So, other media outlets asked me on.”
Silverman said he was warned last week by KNUS managers that his job would be in jeopardy if he continued appearing on competing shows.
“I canceled going on, and then I met with them on Thursday,” he said. “I explained that under my contract, I have a right to go on other media. And they said, 'Well, we don’t want you to do it.'"
Since his firing, KNUS has also removed all of Silverman’s content from its website, including more than five years of podcasts.

The new canon of #MeToo

Resumen: Several new books seek to define the values of #MeToo. Will they change popular consciousness, or turn suffering into forgettable entertainment?

Texto completo: The #MeToo movement – a loose coalition of voices and protests advocating for women’s rights – exploded in 2017. This summer, a spate of books began to enshrine and solidify #MeToo’s values, roots, and rhetoric on paper. While there’s a long history of feminist literature and scholarship, this new group of books is distinct for its wide nonacademic audience.
Two of the most prominent titles are “She Said: Breaking the Sexual Harassment Story That Helped Ignite a Movement” by Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey and “Know My Name” by Chanel Miller. Both made The New York Times bestseller list for multiple weeks.
In “She Said,” Kantor and Twohey recount their investigation into sexual harassment and assault allegations against film producer Harvey Weinstein. Their reporting for The New York Times won a Pulitzer Prize and was credited with helping catalyze the #MeToo movement. Their book also chronicles the events leading up to Stanford Professor Christine Blasey Ford’s appearance before the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee, during which she accused then-judicial nominee Brett Kavanaugh of attempted rape when they were teenagers. “She Said” is a meticulous accounting of confidential meetings, justifiably apprehensive sources, and sticky legal traps – a sophisticated bird’s-eye view of a sensitive operation that compiled a public record of the assaults of dozens of women. 
While Kantor and Twohey document facts, “Know My Name” provides a meditative account of what it’s like to live through the trauma of a sexual assault, as well as a strongly-reasoned deconstruction of rape culture. Miller was attacked by college student Brock Turner in 2015. Her case made headlines across the nation, but most early stories focused on the academic and athletic achievements of Turner, then a swimmer for Stanford University. At the close of his trial in 2016, she penned a trenchant victim impact statement, which went viral. Her memoir is a window into the difficult work she undertook to regain her self-worth and stability. It’s also a searing indictment of the societal and institutional structures that stymie and retraumatize rape victims in their search for justice.
Other prominent titles are Putlizer-winning journalist Ronan Farrow’s “Catch and Kill: Lies, Spies, and a Conspiracy to Protect Predators,” which details his own reporting on Weinstein, as well as his criticisms of NBC’s response to reporter Matt Lauer’s alleged sexual misconduct; and “All the President’s Women: Donald Trump and the Making of a Predator” by Barry Levine and Monique El-Faizy, which details new and old accusations of predatory behavior on the part of the president. 
But Miller’s book stands out from this cohort for its passion and its raw articulation of survivorship. “She Said” and other stories focused on investigations can echo the tone of television procedurals, where the narrative centers on the acquisition of information and the process of justice even in emotionally wrenching situations. 
Nevertheless, similar language and arguments appear in all books, and taken together, these books form an interconnected web of rhetoric that underpins the popular contemporary understanding of rape culture. Most importantly, Kantor, Twohey, and Miller argue that the most effective way to counter sexual harassment is for women to speak out together, as a unified front. One of Twohey and Kantor’s sources “wanted to be one of many women standing up to Weinstein.” Similarly, Miller recognized that she was weakened by isolation: “One of the greatest dangers of victimhood is the singling out.”
And Miller, Kantor, and Twohey all position themselves as precedent-setters. Miller writes, “We fight because we pray we’ll be the last ones to feel this kind of pain.” Twohey and Kantor describe their initial reporting, along with their sources’ decision to speak out, as “a solvent for secrecy, pushing women all over the world to speak up about similar experiences.”
That public record is important. “Women have always been fighting ... to achieve justice, but there’s no linear, progressive story,” says Linda M. Grasso, professor of English at York College, and of liberal studies at The Graduate Center, City University of New York. Academic feminist theory has covered the ground that the public continues to debate again and again, but those conversations don’t make it to the outside world, she adds. That’s why, today, #MeToo is as likely to politically polarize as it is to rally support for women. It’s why the resistance that law professor Anita Hill met when she accused Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas of harassment in 1991 was echoed in 2019, when Blasey Ford took the stand.
The voices of #MeToo are cognizant of this reality. “There isn’t ever going to be an end,” Laura Madden, one of Weinstein’s accusers, tells Twohey and Kantor. “The point is that people have to continue always speaking up and not being afraid.”
And yet Grasso believes the popularity of “She Said,” “Know My Name,” and similar books has as much to do with the mindset of readers as it does with any shift in institutional power. “This spate of books being heard is coincident with political movements that are allowing them to be heard,” she says. “The one really important thing about all of this is to make sure that these books and these ideas become part of the cultural imagination.”

Texto completo: Editor’s note: The story and headline have been updated to clarify the nature of the accusations levied against "Carol’s Second Act" executive producer David Hunt.
Two writers for "Carol's Second Act" quit the CBS show after one filed a misconduct complaint against executive producer David Hunt, according to The New York Times and Deadline.
Hunt is the husband of the show's star and executive producer, Patricia Heaton.
One of the writers, Broti Gupta, confirmed the Times report by sharing the article on her verified Twitter account (writing, "The story laid out here is true) and a thread about the allegations.
According to the outlets, Gupta accused Hunt of touching her inappropriately on two occasions in early September, hugging her twice from the side and running a hand up the side of her thigh. By mid-September, she left the show after feeling penalized for filing the complaint, she told the Times.
Bryan Freedman, a lawyer for Hunt and Heaton, told the Times that Hunt didn't remember the details of the instances described and “does not recall rubbing anyone’s thigh or leg and he disputes that characterization of it. ”
USA TODAY couldn't reach Freedman for comment.
Gupta, according to the Times and her tweets, first told writer and co-executive producer Margee Magee about the alleged behavior. Magee urged her to tell showrunners Sarah Haskins and Emily Halper. Magee resigned in October, saying she felt like her responsibilities on the show changed after she went to higher-ups regarding Gupta's complaint.
In a statement Saturday, the network confirmed "a claim of unprofessional behavior was made by a writer. The matter was promptly investigated by human resources, and appropriate action was taken to address the complaint. The executive producer cooperated fully with the process. The writer and producer decided to leave the show of their own accord. "
In her Twitter thread, Gupta explained why she and Magee felt penalized.
"They admitted to Margee Magee in private that my reporting took us off set (a decision nobody asked for, a decision they made on their own) so when I learned that information, I realized that I had to leave – I can’t work for bosses who lie to their extremely smart/talented staff," she wrote.
Gupta said, "Eventually, Margee left from their mistreatment of her and they started telling other people that Margee was doing this for attention and making my issue about her. They could not envision a world wherein I had an ally. "
CBS defended the producers.
"We looked into allegations of retaliatory conduct by the showrunners at the time they were raised, and we found no evidence of retaliatory intent in their interactions with the writer or the producer," the statement said.
USA TODAY was unable to reach Gupta or Heaton for comment.

Texto completo: State regulators have released the list of medical facilities in New York that treated the deadly drug-resistant fungus identified by U.S. health officials as a serious global health threat, including some in Westchester and Rockland counties.
The disclosure comes after at least 587 cases of Candida auris infections have been confirmed in a dozen states over the last few years. Most of them were in the New York City area, as well as New Jersey and Chicago, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported.
The fungus – also referred to as C. auris – is resistant to some or all antifungal medicines, which makes it harder to treat, the CDC says. It can quickly lead to death in patients who have weakened immune systems or other underlying serious medical problems.
More than one in three patients with an invasive infection of the fungus has died, the CDC said.
The list of medical facilities that treated C. auris in New York consists of 64 hospitals, 103 long-term care facilities, three hospices and one long-term acute care hospital statewide. It was included in the 2018 Hospital Acquired Infections report, as first reported by The New York Times.
What the fungus list means for New Yorkers? Health officials in New York noted in the 2018 report that a broad range of factors are involved in treating and tracking the spread of the fungus.
For example, the patients tend to have multiple serious medical problems with frequent admissions and transfers between medical facilities, which in part makes it difficult to determine where they acquired the infection.
Health officials asserted the list of facilities that treated the fungus should not be used by consumers to decide where to seek care. Inclusion on the lists does not relate to quality of care, they stated in the report.
The list spans between Jan, 1, 2016, and June 28, 2019, and included facilities known to have cared for a person infected, colonized, or possibly colonized with C. auris.
Previously, state and federal agencies have withheld the names of medical facilities that have been affected by the deadly fungus.
Releasing the details on Candida auris New York state health officials said they released the list to provide transparency to consumers and encourage hospitals and nursing homes to help stop its spread, according to the Times.
Darren Dopp, senior vice president of the Healthcare Association of New York State, in an email addressed state health officials' decision to include the list in the 2018 infections report.
"Everyone in the healthcare community is working hard to confront the problem," Dopp wrote.
"Through collaborative efforts and implementation of best practices, we're making progress, but as the report indicates, candida auris and other drug-resistant pathogens are a serious concern," he added.
The health care trade group noted New York is a major travel hub and, as such, its medical facilities are often the first to identify and respond to emerging infections like C. auris. It asserted New York medical facilities have unmatched expertise in addressing the most complicated public health challenges, citing recent CDC and Health Department reports that show decreasing rates of infection in key areas.
The medical facilities on the 'superbug' list In addition to New York City and Long Island, several of the hospitals and nursing homes on the list were in Rockland and Westchester counties. Monroe, Dutchess and Orange counties each had one hospital on the list.
Hospitals:
In Westchester, St. John's Riverside Hospital in Yonkers and Westchester Medical Center in Valhalla.
In Rockland, Good Samaritan Hospital of Suffern, Helen Hayes Hospital in West Haverstraw and Montefiore Nyack Hospital.
Rochester General Hospital in Monroe, Vassar Brothers Medical Center in Dutchess, and Orange Regional Medical Center in Middletown.
Long-term care facilities:
In Westchester, Adira at Riverside Rehabilitation and Nursing in Yonkers, Schaffer Extended Care Center in New Rochelle, and Tarrytown Hall Care Center.
In Rockland, Friedwald Center for Rehabilitation and Nursing in New City; Northern Manor Geriatric Center in Nanuet; Northern Riverview Health Care Center in Haverstraw; Nyack Ridge Rehab & Nursing Center in Valley Cottage; and Pine Valley Center for Rehabilitation and Nursing in Spring Valley.

Bloomberg's Bogus, Belated Mea Culpa

Texto completo: His apology for the stop-and-frisk policy is politically convenient.
Last Sunday I wrote a column entitled "You Must Never Vote for Bloomberg" because of Michael Bloomberg's promotion, advocacy and defense of the racist stop-and-frisk policy that ballooned during his terms as mayor of New York City.
This Sunday, Bloomberg apologized for that policy.
Speaking at the Christian Cultural Center, a black megachurch in Brooklyn, Bloomberg said:
"Over time, I've come to understand something that I long struggled to admit to myself: I got something important wrong. I got something important really wrong. I didn't understand that back then the full impact that stops were having on the black and Latino communities. I was totally focused on saving lives, but as we know, good intentions aren't good enough. Now, hindsight is 20/20. But, as crime continued to come down as we reduced stops, and as it continued to come down during the next administration, to its credit, I now see that we could and should have acted sooner and acted faster to cut the stops. I wish we had. I'm sorry that we didn't. But, I can't change history. However today, I want you to know that I realize back then I was wrong, and I'm sorry."
This is a necessary apology, but a hard one to take, coming only now, as he considers a run for the Democratic nomination, a nomination that is nearly impossible to secure without the black vote.
It feels like the very definition of pandering.
It is impossible for me to take seriously Bloomberg's claim that he didn't understand the impact that stop-and-frisk was having on the black and brown communities when he was in office.
Too much was written about it, by me and others. Too much was studied about it. Too many civil rights activists and groups complained about it.
No, I believe that he knew very well, and understood clearly, the pain that he was causing, but he was making a collateral damage argument: Because there was crime and many of those committing those crimes were born with black or brown skin, all those with that skin should be presumed guilty until proven innocent.
That feels like the very definition of racism.
It is important to remember that racism can exist in the absence of malice, that this dragnet presumption of guilt, even if well intentioned, amounted to a systemic racism to which Bloomberg was not only apathetic, but zealous about.
It is also hard to take his apology seriously because as recently as January he was still vigorously defending the policy, making the incredulous and insulting claim that during the execution of stop-and-frisk "we certainly did not pick somebody by race."
It's hard to take it seriously because as The New York Post reported Sunday, the Police Benevolent Association president, Patrick Lynch, slammed Bloomberg's convenient apology, saying, "Mayor Bloomberg could have saved himself this apology if he had just listened to the police officers on the street." He continued:
"We said in the early 2000s that the quota-driven emphasis on street stops was polluting the relationship between cops and our communities. His administration's misguided policy inspired an anti-police movement that has made cops the target of hatred and violence, and stripped away many of the tools we had used to keep New Yorkers safe."
Bloomberg is no dummy. He knew the statistics. He knew that the vast majority of the people being stopped were black and brown and that the vast majority were innocent. He knew. And yet, he kept the system and defended it.
This was a maximum pressure campaign targeted against black and brown communities, an intimidation tactic to signal constant surveillance and random checks. These whole communities were under siege, and it not only did lasting damage to the relationship between those communities and the Police Department, it accrued immeasurable psychological damage to an entire generation of black and brown boys and men.
Bloomberg's cynicism here is staggering.
But, this is something that black voters must contend with: politicians who do harm through policy to black communities, then come forward with admissions and contrition when they need black people's votes.
I haven't forgotten that it was just this year, as he was about to enter the race, that Joe Biden finally offered a full apology for the disastrous 1994 crime bill that wreaked havoc on the black community, after having defended the bill for years. Biden offered his apology at the National Action Network's Martin Luther King Jr. breakfast.
Bloomberg needed to apologize. But the apology is not for the sake of the hundreds of thousands of young black and brown men subjected to his millions of stops. There, the damage is done. The grip of a strange man's hands, with the power of a badge and gun, groping their bodies will stay with them. The personal, physical trauma and violation that he endorsed will linger for a lifetime.
Bloomberg needed to apologize so that the truth could be told: New York violated the rights and bodies of a generation of black and brown boys and men at the eager, willful insistence of its mayor.
Black voters -- and all Democratic voters -- must ask themselves: Is Bloomberg the antidote to what ails America on race and criminal justice, or is he one of its vectors?

Texto completo: By the time she was 4 years old, Marielle Heller had already rejected "Mister Rogers' Neighborhood." As the eldest of three, she saw her younger siblings watching the PBS show and felt she had grown "too jaded and cynical" for Fred Rogers' brand of cheery positivity.
It wasn't until decades later, when she became a parent herself, that the filmmaker gave Rogers another shot. When her son turned 2, the first television program she and her husband allowed him to watch was "Daniel Tiger's Neighborhood." The animated kids series, which launched in 2012, is produced by Fred Rogers Productions and espouses many of the same values as the original Rogers show -- teaching children how to deal with difficult emotions like anger, disappointment and loss.
"It's like the parenting hack of all parenting hacks," Heller said. "It makes you a better parent, I swear to God, because it gives you, like, tips on how to deal with your children. And there's an episode for everything. When you're potty training, there's an episode that we all have sung and quoted a bajillion times that's, like, 'When you need to go potty, stop and go right away! Flush and wash and be on your way.' "
Heller was steeped in the world of Daniel Tiger when the screenplay for "A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood" came across her desk a couple of years ago. She'd worked with the writers of the script, Micah Fitzerman-Blue and Noah Harpster, on Amazon's "Transparent," and they'd mentioned they were trying to get a film made about Mister Rogers. At the time, however, the movie already had a director attached, but Heller nonetheless asked: "Why am I not directing that?
"I said something very bold like that because it felt so up my alley, being a mom with a little kid," Heller recalled with a laugh.
By the time she was offered the directing gig on "A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood" -- which Sony Pictures will release on Nov. 22 -- Heller had been anointed one of Hollywood's top directors to watch. She made her directorial debut in 2015 with the critical darling "The Diary of a Teenage Girl," about a 15-year-old's sexual awakening. Heller's follow-up, last year's "Can You Ever Forgive Me?" was even better received. The film, which earned star Melissa McCarthy an Academy Award nomination, told the story of an author who forged letters by famous artists to make ends meet.
And -- to the surprise of the producers on the Rogers film -- she had also formed a relationship with the actor most coveted for the lead role: Tom Hanks. Coming off a period in which he'd played a handful of iconic real-life figures, including Capt. Chesley "Sully" Sullenberger and Walt Disney, Hanks had already passed on the "Neighborhood" script three times.
Heller had become friendly with the actor after meeting him at a backyard birthday party held by his son, Colin Hanks. During the gathering, Tom Hanks mentioned he'd just read an article in The New York Times about female directors. Heller pointed out she'd been quoted in the piece. Upon learning more about her, Hanks promised to watch "The Diary of a Teenage Girl." He made good on his word and set up a meeting with the filmmaker, telling her, "We gotta find a way to work together."
For years, Heller said, she and the actor would stay in touch, sending potential projects to each other. So when the team behind the Rogers film expressed how badly they wanted Hanks for their movie, Heller said she'd give it her best shot.
"So I called him and I described how I saw the movie -- that I didn't want it to be a biopic," she remembered. "It was never going to be a prosthetics thing -- it wasn't going to be about trying to make him look just like (Rogers). It was really a character piece about manhood and what it is to be a good person. And he was like, 'Oh, OK, lemme go read the script with all of that in mind,' and signed on like a week later."
"A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood" is far from a Rogers biopic. In fact, Hanks plays the supporting character in the film, which stars Matthew Rhys as an Esquire journalist tasked with profiling the TV legend. Based on Tom Junod's 1998 magazine article about Rogers, the movie explores the effect the star had had on the writer, revealing less about himself in interviews than expressing a genuine interest in the journalist himself.
Shortly after the movie was greenlit, Morgan Neville's hit documentary about Rogers, "Won't You Be My Neighbor?" was released in theaters. The movie collected $22.8 million in theaters, making it a huge box office success for a nonfiction film. At first, Heller admitted, "We had a moment where we kind of were, like, 'Oh, is this a good thing or a bad thing?' And then we thought, 'Oh, more Fred Rogers in the world? This is a good thing."
Before filming began, Heller visited Pittsburgh, where Rogers lived and worked for nearly his entire life. She visited the Fred Rogers Co., meeting with executives who'd worked there for nearly four decades and had been integral to the PBS show. She went to Latrobe, Pennsylvania, Rogers' hometown, where his archives are housed, sifting through the boxes of letters, photographs and emails he'd meticulously stored until his death in 2003.
She also met with Rogers' widow, 91-year-old Joanne Rogers, who lent her late husband's ties to the production and frequently visited the set during shooting.
What Hanks said he admired about Heller's approach to conveying Rogers' beliefs was that she made it a "slow-cooking recipe" without "fakery or trickery," allowing the character to express his identity through his actions instead of words.
Rogers "was not introduced as: here's the most important man there is," the actor explained. "She captured who he was without trying to explain it. She showed it through his behavior and the behavior of others when they were around him."

Texto completo: Picked-up pieces while wondering whether Malcolm Butler will tune in when the Patriots play the Eagles on Sunday.
■ Are sports fans bothered when their teams are caught cheating?
The investigation into the 2017 world champion Astros — triggered by charges from a former Houston pitcher — touches fans everywhere, certainly those who root for New England teams.
Nobody around here liked it much when the Super Bowl-winning Patriots were caught and punished in the Spygate and Deflategate scandals. We lived through years of pushback, denials, and controversy as fans in other regions tried to assign the Patriots' stunning success to petty crimes and misdemeanors.
Ultimately, our best defense came down to: “Sure, the Patriots do little things, but every team does little things. It is not the reason they win."
It was the same with the Red Sox when it was learned that Manny Ramirez and David Ortiz tested positive for PEDs during the baseline testing (no penalties, supposedly no disclosure) of 2003.
This information did not leak until 2009 and there were few who allowed it to tarnish memories of the Sox' magical championships of 2004 and 2007. In this instance, the best New England defense was: “Our cheaters were better than the Yankees' cheaters (A-Rod, Sheffield, Giambi, etc.)," so it just meant we had a level playing field. Few cared to think too hard about the uncomfortable truths.
The 2017 Red Sox were gently spanked (fines were levied) by commissioner Rob Manfred when they got caught stealing signs with Fitbits.
Now it's Houston's turn to squirm.
It's pretty clear that the Astros were dirty in 2017, and have been up to no good for quite some time. For Boston fans, the problematic part lies in the fact that Red Sox manager Alex Cora — a renowned organic sign stealer — must have been part of the Astros' electronic signaling scam when they won in 2017.
Cora has been interviewed by MLB investigators, and has told us he'll have no comment while the investigation unfolds. But this is a bad optic for the Red Sox and their manager. It should be noted that Houston's veteran bullpen coach, Craig Bjornson, came to Boston with Cora after the 2017 season.
Remember the calamity when the Sox caught the Astros cheating in the middle of the 2018 American League Championship Series in Boston? Cora was less than a year removed from his job as bench coach in Houston. When the Astros were caught with the camera guy near the Sox dugout, Houston GM Jeff Luhnow was asked about Cora and said, “He worked for us last year, so clearly he knows everything that we're doing."
Clearly.
This is going to be interesting. The Astros are going to be punished. Cora may or may not be punished, but it's going to be awkward for him. It's impossible to believe Cora was not part of Houston's scam. Do New Englanders care, or have we totally bought into the philosophy of, if you're not cheating, you're not trying?
Regarding these new allegations, I like the solution put forth by the New York Post's Joel Sherman: Moving forward, in the best interest of baseball, Manfred should eliminate all electronics in the dugout during games. And no more visits to the clubhouse during games. Shut it all down.
■ Bad ending for Grapes. Eighty-five-year-old Don Cherry got the pink slip this past week after divisive remarks aimed at immigrants. Cherry was NHL Coach of the Year with the Bruins in 1976 and was behind the bench for the infamous too many men on the ice penalty that cost the Bruins a playoff series against the Canadiens in 1979.
Cherry took the blame for that one. Not so much this time. He's standing behind his remarks. Cherry had a long career as a commentator for “Hockey Night In Canada," and a good run as Bruins coach. He played in only one NHL game — with the Bruins in the 1955 playoffs.
■ Two questions that evidently will never be answered: 1. Why didn't Butler play in the Super Bowl against the Eagles? 2. Why did Ortiz get shot in the Dominican Republic?
I am doubtful that we will ever know the real story on either. Ortiz has handled his shooting investigation the same way he handled things after he got popped for PEDs in 2003: pledge to get to the bottom of things, then go live your life while the episode fades away. Bank on the notion that nobody cares. Works every time.
■ A 98.5 The Sports Hub caller asked if you would trade the Patriots' 28-3 Super Bowl comeback against the Falcons in exchange for the Patriots beating the Giants to go 19-0 in 2007-08. If you could only have one, which would you take?
■ The MIAA really should do something about boys playing on girls' high school field hockey teams. It creates a dangerous, non-level playing field and has made a mockery of some state tournament games.
■ QUIZ: Name the three baseball first-round overall picks who made it into the Hall of Fame (answer below).
■ If you rip/ridicule/critique Dustin Pedroia for trying to come back from knee woes, you are being petty and unfair.
The Red Sox were happy to sign him when they made the deal. Pedroia could have bolted for more money elsewhere. He got hurt on the field. He is trying to come back. The Sox are on the hook for his salary no matter what happens. He cannot retire and forgive the money they owe him and give them relief from the luxury-tax threshold. He is going to get the money because that's how guaranteed contracts work.
Even though Pedroia is highly unlikely to play again, do not punish him for trying to come back. He is trying to “earn" the money he is going to get anyway. How does that make him a bad guy?
■ Jared Goff is borderline terrible. His $134 million contract is looking like something Dave Dombrowski would have handed out after winning the World Series. The Patriots got a huge break facing Goff instead of Drew Brees in last season's Super Bowl.
■ Underplayed story of the week is Tony La Russa leaving Boston to go to the Angels. What happened? Is he upset about the way Dombrowski was treated? It's another indication that the Red Sox owners are hard to work for.
■ After the Jets beat the Giants, 34-27, in last weekend's Stupor Bowl, the New York Times got in on the act with this subheadline: “Jets Win a Back-and-Forth Contest Marked by Stretches of Competence."
■ Anybody else delighted to see Walter McCarty's Evansville Purple Aces beat John Calipari's Kentucky Wildcats, 67-64, Tuesday in Lexington? McCarty was on Rick Pitino's Kentucky team that thrashed Calipari's UMass Minutemen in the 1996 Final Four in the Meadowlands. Like Tommy Heinsohn, we love Walter.
■ LSU quarterback Joe Burrow is going to win the Heisman Trophy after his performance against Alabama last Saturday. Any way the Patriots can trade up to get him in the draft? More likely, Burrow winds up being a Cincinnati Bengal.
■ Amazon god/Washington Post owner Jeff Bezos is rumored to be buying an NFL team. Bezos watched last season's Super Bowl with Roger Goodell and would make a nice boss for the Washington Redskins.
■ Former Holy Cross lefthander Matt Blake has been named pitching coach of the New York Yankees. Blake pitched four years at HC for Craig Najarian, who is now athletic director at Catholic Memorial. Just four years ago, Blake was pitching coach at Lincoln-Sudbury Regional High School.
■ Anyone interested in attending The Tradition at the Garden on Wednesday (Matt Light, Paul Silas, Zdeno Chara, and Manny Ramirez are among the honorees) can visit sportsmuseum.org for tickets and information.
■ QUIZ ANSWER: Ken Griffey Jr., Chipper Jones, Harold Baines.

Texto completo: Books, like underwear, can be terribly personal gifts with the power to embarrass or delight their recipients. There's no need to take those sorts of risks with your cousins or co-workers. Instead, give one of these broadly appealing, sumptuous hardcovers, each of which earns their sticker price and then some.
For the Dungeon Master
“Dead Astronauts"
by Jeff Vandermeer (McClelland & Stuart)
The universally praised Southern Reach trilogy, which includes “Annihilation," the book upon which the eponymous Natalie Portman film is based, catapulted Jeff Vandermeer out of the fantasy section into the broader literary realm and made him one of the most visible and well-regarded genre writers working today. Delight your favorite nerd with his latest novel, out just in time for the holidays, which boasts the most arresting and well-designed dust jacket in recent memory.
For the people watcher
“Bill Cunningham: On the Street"
by The New York Times (Clarkson Potter)
For those who enjoy looking at people, clothes, street scenes, or celebrities, this career-spanning collection can't be beat. Those who live under a rock might not be familiar with the late New York Times fashion photographer and noted man-about-town, and those are the very people who could use this stunning reminder of fashion's infinite variety.
For the concerned millennial
“The Hard Tomorrow"
by Eleanor Davis (Drawn & Quarterly)
Davis has written a graphic novel about a thirty-something couple trying for a baby while reckoning with the inevitability of a terrible future. The way she draws and writes about the lives of Hannah, an activist, and Johnny, a pothead, gives the form its due, creating a beautiful story from the horrible worries that plague everyone of child-bearing age.
For the masochistic
houseplant enthusiast
“Orchid Modern"
by Marc Hachadourian (Timber Press)
Those who raise orchids are the most patient and meticulous indoor gardeners to walk this earth. Marc Hachadourian, who curates the orchids at the New York Botanical Garden, shares his plant genius in such a gentle, helpful way that even those with no trace of green in their thumbs can sort of, almost, kinda envision keeping an orchid alive. Better gardeners will learn how to cultivate orchids in a terrarium. Everyone can admire the nice pictures of these vexing, lovely plants.
For Every Cook
“The Joy of Cooking"
by Irma S. Rombauer (Scribner)
By all accounts, the latest edition of the 1936 classic is an essential addition to every home cook's library. In addition to ethnic cuisine (finally!), “The Joy of Cooking" now includes Instant Pot recipes, fermentation instructions, and kitchen organization tips. And at 1,200 pages, it will surely be among the heaviest, biggest adult presents at any holiday celebration.
For the book hoarder
“Bibliostyle: How We Live at Home With Books" by Nina Freudenberger (Clarkson Potter)
A few years ago, book-lovers gathered their pitchforks against the growing interior design trend of displaying books with their pages facing out. None of that pseudo-minimalist nonsense is included here. Instead, Freudenberger spotlights the splendid, enviable personal libraries of literary figures whose owners obviously care about their book collections and have actually read them, too.
For the purple person
“The Beautiful Ones"
by Prince (Spiegel & Grau)
Before his death, Prince wrote, by hand, 50 pages of his life story and shared them with Dan Pipenberg, with whom he was to collaborate on his memoirs. These handwritten pages are included in full alongside Pipenberg's commentary, one of Prince's own scrapbooks, reproduced lyric sheets, and an overwhelming array of candid photographs documenting every era of The Artist's career.
For the insufferable film snob
“Stanley Kubrick's Barry Lyndon,"
by Allison Castle (Taschen)
The opulent cinematography of Kubrick's exquisite 1975 costume drama, set in 18th-century Ireland and based on a novel by Thackeray, has earned “Barry Lyndon" a place among the director's best-loved films, yet it remains a deep cut when compared to chart-busters like “A Clockwork Orange" and “2001." Taschen has given it a treatment befitting its stature, presenting movie stills, essays, interviews, candid photos, and relevant ephemera from the Kubrick archives alongside a remastered DVD.
For design-conscious people who
like to chuckle
“Keep Scrolling Till You Feel Something: 21 Years of Humor From McSweeney's Internet Tendency"
(Mcsweeney's Quarterly Concern)
For two decades, McSweeney's Internet Tendency has been the go-to blog for short-form humor. This collection, featuring submissions from Hollywood-caliber contributors like Jesse Eisenberg and Meghan Amram alongside the quips of not-at-all famous writers, resembles a bible, with an Italian Renaissance-style cover, gold-edged pages, thumb tabs, and a red ribbon marker sewn into the binding, making it markedly more haute than the other humor compendiums and blog-based books taking up space in our nation's bathrooms.
For the little musician
“Pokko and the Drum"
by Matthew Forsythe (Simon and Schuster)
Pokko's parents give her a drum, quickly regret their decision, and suggest that she play outside. Soon, the young frog is joined by a cadre of forest creatures playing instruments of their own. Forsythe's text is both stirring and darkly funny, but his watercolor, gouache, and colored pencil art is just plain gorgeous.
For the cat dad
(and/or his human progeny)
“My Cat Looks Like My Dad"
by Thao Lam (Owlkids)
Sure it's nominally for children, and children will delight in Lam's cheerful paper-collage illustrations of a man and his cat stretching, napping, and scratching themselves in a remarkably similar manner, but an ever-growing number of self-proclaimed cat dads, particularly those of a certain vintage, will love the book's early '80s vibe, as well as the dad's aviator specs, mustache, and tribal-print yoga pants.
For the pint-size urbanite
“Small in the City" by Sydney Smith (Neal Porter Books)
A tiny child of indeterminate sex wearing a bobble hat traverses a snowy city in search of a lost cat. Intricate double-page spreads and deft linework imbue the journey with wonder and peril. Smith's city, whether depicted in the sliver of a building or a bustling street scene, displays his masterful sense of perspective, allowing readers of all ages to feel just as small as the book's intended audience.

■ Are sports fans bothered when their teams are caught cheating?
The investigation into the 2017 world champion Astros — triggered by charges from a former Houston pitcher — touches fans everywhere, certainly those who root for New England teams.
Nobody around here liked it much when the Super Bowl-winning Patriots were caught and punished in the Spygate and Deflategate scandals.

This information did not leak until 2009 and there were few who allowed it to tarnish memories of the Sox' magical championships of 2004 and 2007. In this instance, the best New England defense was: “Our cheaters were better than the Yankees' cheaters (A-Rod, Sheffield, Giambi, etc.)," so it just meant we had a level playing field.

Texto completo: After spending the past two-plus seasons out of the NFL, free-agent quarterback Colin Kaepernick will work out for NFL teams at the Atlanta Falcons' practice facility on Saturday in hopes of earning a job.
Kaepernick, the 32-year-old former San Francisco 49ers quarterback, last played in the league in 2016, the same year he began kneeling during the national anthem as a means of protesting police brutality and racial inequality.
There have been lots of details trickling out since Tuesday, when the NFL invited representatives from all 32 teams to attend the workout, so let's take a moment to make sense of it all.
Here's a quick primer ahead of Kaepernick's workout Saturday afternoon — which, according to NFL Network, is scheduled to begin at 3 p. m. ET.
So, how did this all come together?
Well, it's still a bit murky.
USA TODAY Sports' Mike Jones uncovered many of the details earlier this week, reporting that the workout caught many within the league office and the NFL Players Association by surprise. It appeared to be rushed, he added, even though commissioner Roger Goodell had kicked around the idea for some time.
Jones also reported that Jay-Z, the rapper who partnered with the NFL earlier this year to work on its social justice initiative, had some influence on the matter and had spoken with Goodell multiple times about helping Kaepernick get back in the NFL.
Opinion: Colin Kaepernick is about to get what he deserves: a chance
More: How Colin Kaepernick's NFL workout materialized and what's next
Ultimately, it all came together relatively quickly on Tuesday. Multiple outlets, including The New York Times, reported that Kaepernick's camp was told of the workout plan and given two hours to confirm whether the quarterback would attend.
What will the workout entail?
It will basically be similar to a pro day, with drills, measurements and an interview — all filmed and made available afterward to every team in the league.
According to NFL Network, the exact schedule will be as follows: An interview at 3:15 p. m. , followed by measurements and warm-ups, followed by timing and testing at 3:50 and, finally, quarterback drills at 4:15.
Which teams will be there?
The NFL announced Thursday that the following 11 teams would be represented at the workout: The Arizona Cardinals, Atlanta Falcons, Cleveland Browns, Denver Broncos, Detroit Lions, Miami Dolphins, New England Patriots, New York Giants, New York Jets, Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Washington Redskins. The Cincinnati Enquirer reported that the Bengals will also be on hand.
In fact, ESPN reported Friday evening that "more than 24 teams" would have representatives there.
The real question, however, is not which teams will be in attendance, but rather which people. On a Saturday afternoon, roughly 24 hours before Sunday's games begin, will any general managers or head coaches make the trip? Any coordinators or quarterback coaches? Or will it simply be a collection of low-level scouts?
Who will run the workout?
According to the league, it will be Hue Jackson, the former Oakland Raiders and Cleveland Browns coach — though former Dolphins coach Joe Philbin will also be there.
Jackson told Sports Illustrated on Thursday that he is "very fond of (Kaepernick as a player and a person. "
"I want to help him put his best foot forward, and also make sure the scouts get to see what they need to see," Jackson told the outlet.
Who will catch Kaepernick's passes?
NFL Network reported Thursday that the receivers for the throwing portion of the workout will "be provided by the National Football Scouting Service that is in charge of staging the workout. " They are expected to be players based in the Atlanta area who have recent NFL experience, the network added.
Meanwhile, ESPN reported Friday morning that because Kaepernick had not received a list of participating receivers from the league, he planned on "taking up the former NFL WRs who volunteered to fly in on their own to help him at workout. " It's unclear whom would be in that group.
Will the workout lead to a contract?
This is obviously the question looming over the entire event, an outcome that could ultimately determine whether it is characterized as a meaningful effort by the league or a simple PR move.
NFLPA executive director DeMaurice Smith told USA TODAY Sports that he would be "stunned" if Kaepernick was not signed to a contract following the workout.
"Because he’s good enough to play anywhere in the league," Smith said.
Others are more skeptical. But there are nevertheless teams that could use him, according to USA TODAY Sports' Nate Davis. He believes the Chicago Bears, Seattle Seahawks and Philadelphia Eagles would offer the best fit.

Texto completo: Critics are telling the hard truth about the film "Good Liar. "
Ian McKellen stars as Roy Courtnay, a charming career con artist who has his eyes set on his next target: Gullible, wealthy widow Betty McLeish, played by Helen Mirren.
Most critics, however, say the crime thriller's plot was "clunky" and "underwhelming," despite the best efforts from the British acting legends. ("Good Liar" has a Metacritic rating of 54 out of 100 and is listed as 63% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes as of Friday evening. )
New York Times' Ben Kenigsberg says "the real good liar is whoever convinced Mirren and McKellen to class up such thin and arbitrary material. "
'The Good Liar' trailer: Ian McKellen and Helen Mirren face off in thriller
The Hollywood Reporter's Jon Frosch says the film, which is based off Nicholas Searle’s 2016 novel, proves "that not every halfway-decent book should be made into a movie. "
"'The Good Liar’s sophistication is nothing if not skin-deep. For all its nasty twists and turns, its fake-outs and flashbacks and cheekily preposterous pile-up of double-crosses, this story of an elderly con man and the wealthy widow he targets feels fatally devoid of danger," he adds. "'The Good Liar' is a work of skill but little spark. "
Though the movie has a plot twist that "dropped out of the sky and landed on your head," Rolling Stone's David Fear said Mirren and McKellen acted "beautifully despite the material. "
"Yes, you would watch these two in virtually anything. You just wish it wasn’t this," he writes. "They deserve something sturdier and far less head-slappingly preposterous, and that’s the truth. "
He continued: "The real question is: Are you willing to endure all of that random swerving for the simple pleasure of these performers’ company?"
More: Helen Mirren said being mistaken for Keanu Reeves' 'girlfriend' was 'very flattering'
On the other hand, the unpredictable and erratic nature of the film's plot is what the New York Post's Johnny Oleksinski enjoyed the most.
"The fun of 'The Good Liar' is that, just when you think you’ve got a proper handle on what’s going on, your reality is completely shattered. A few times," he says.
"The Good Liar" hit U. S. theaters Friday following U. K. 's premiere last week.

Trash-Stalking With Rachel

Texto completo: On a recent Saturday there was strong foot traffic on the fifth floor of the Whitney Museum of American Art where the New York artist Rachel Harrison's exuberant midcareer survey is installed. And the traffic wasn't moving fast. Visitors were spending time with sculpture that, despite -- or because of -- its enigmatic zaniness, inspired a slow look. And people seemed to be having fun looking, even if they weren't exactly sure why.
Maybe it was because puzzlement can be fun, and Ms. Harrison has set it as one of the tasks for her work. Many of her assemblage-style sculptures suggest the kind of accidental urban still lifes you see on New York City sidewalks on trash collection day: bottles, bedding, defunct appliances, outgrown toys, discarded Christmas trees in season and, always, sealed garbage bags filled with you don't want to know what. All of these together, once you start to look, translate into information about commerce, class, value, accident, appetite, waste, color, shape, zeitgeist -- even life and death. There's material there for stories, many. But you have to write them.
Ms. Harrison has photographed such arrays in the past and inserted the pictures in her sculpture, though the earliest piece in her current exhibition, "Rachel Harrison Life Hack," a career survey covering some 25 years, looks like the unsavory something that the inside of a garbage bag might yield.
That piece is titled "Dinner" and is -- or once was -- just that. One night in 1991, the artist ordered a meal in an East Village restaurant downstairs from a gallery where she was in a group show. When her food arrived -- shish kebab, salad, cheesecake -- she divided it into Ziploc bags, which she took upstairs and tacked to the gallery wall as her contribution. A few days later she transferred the now-rotting food to glass jars, which remain sealed to this day and are displayed on a small shelf just inside the entrance to the Whitney show.
You can slot "Dinner" into various categories: as Conceptual art, as a species of organic abstraction, as the souvenir of a career event, or as a relic of a lost place and time. In the end, it can only be securely defined by what it does: It catches your eye, pulls you in close, makes you struggle for meaning, and leaves you not knowing what to think.
The same might be said of a room-size installation from 1996 with a block-of-type title that amounts to an object in itself: "Should home windows or shutters be required to withstand a direct hit from an eight-foot-long two-by-four shot from a cannon at 34 miles an hour, without creating a hole big enough to let through a three-inch sphere?"
In its original form, the work, which has been recreated for the Whitney survey, was set up in a Brooklyn brownstone parlor and made up the entire content of Ms. Harrison's first solo gallery show. There it created a room within the room through artificial, stage-flat "walls," a theatrical device Ms. Harrison would repeatedly return to. At the Whitney, where surviving components of the original installation are included in the reconstruction, the layering is not just of space but of time, present and past.
So in a sense the work is another reliquary. And even when new the piece had time-capsule features. Its title was lifted from a 1995 New York Times article written in the wake of an apocalypse-strength Hurricane Andrew. The "walls" are hung, now as then, with framed photos, taken by the artist, of trash bags waiting for pickup. And here and there we find colorfully labeled cans of supermarket peas (do the brands still exist or are the cans archival?) stacked in corners or perched on shelves made in part from what look like stiffened socks.
Faced, without explanation, with such idiosyncratic elements, our organizational instinct, our default to logic, kicks in. We start to construct a narrative. So: flimsy walls, a report of damages from a storm, piled-up trash bags, a stash of canned food. Suddenly there's tension, drama, a hint of darkness. But one look at the work's wackier features pulls us in another direction and we're back with bemusement.
Again, this push-pull is a driving dynamic of this artist's work. It withholds fixed meanings while suggesting that meanings exist. It works hard to elicit reactions, potentially strong ones, without determining what the reactions should be. You feel things will come clear if you hang out and keep looking. And people do.
Career surveys are usually arranged chronologically so as to suggest an artist's development. The organizers of this show -- Elisabeth Sussman, curator of photography at the Whitney; David Joselit, a professor at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York; and Kelly Long, a curatorial assistant at the Whitney -- honor that convention, but only so far: They put early work, from the 1990s, in the opening gallery, but beyond that, mix things up.
In general the work tends to grow more "sculptural" -- in the sense of more concentrated, unitary, handmade -- as time goes on. One example is "Alexander the Great" (2007), in which a nude, prepubescent department store mannequin, wearing an Abraham Lincoln mask on the back of its head, stands atop an Abstract Expressionist-patterned meteorite. Another is the scary "Brownie" (2005), a kind of Giacomettian column embedded with life-size skulls, drizzled with paint, and topped with a silver wig.
The show's inventories of sculptural ingredients can become quite elaborate. "Huffy Howler" (2004) includes sheepskin, fox tails, brick-filled tote bags and a studio shot of Mel Gibson in "Braveheart" attached to the brand-name bike of the title. "Nice Rack" (2006), with a found Hallmark-greeting-card rack, brings together costume jewelry, fake fruit, an ergonomic snow shovel and a photographed portrait of an imperious Ronald Reagan.
One look at the Reagan image has you scrambling for a political message. As far as I can tell, there's no hard message to be found, but in suggesting there might be, the work has done its job. It has made us look, with a synthesizing eye, at every detail, and then, thwarted but living in hope, look again.
Although Ms. Harrison is not credited as a curator, she is largely responsible for the show's distinctive look. It was her idea to have the floor of the big central gallery covered with black-painted plywood and marked with maplike lines drawn in chalk. The design was inspired by the minimalist studio set used in Lars von Trier's 2004 film, "Dogville," and whatever its significance may hold for the artist or for us, it provides a persuasive setting for sculpture, allowing each piece, like a character in a film, to retain its personality while clearly participating in a collective story.
And it was her idea, in the show's final gallery, to turn 15 extraordinarily inventive sculptures into a multivocal ensemble by corralling them together within a circle of outward-facing metal chairs, on which visitors are invited to sit.
It might have made more logical sense, in the interest of contemplative looking, to have had the chairs face inward toward the art. But destabilizing logic is what the show -- which includes a set of drawings of the singer Amy Winehouse as an avenging angel of art history -- is ultimately about. (Looking at art is often pitched as a learning experience; Ms. Harrison makes it an unlearning experience.)
Oh, and I've learned that "life hack" is internetese for myriad improvised tricks or techniques devised to make the practical crises of daily existence -- how to remove ketchup stains from a shirt, how to relax with strangers -- more manageable. No doubt some of these interventions work better than others, but the fact that they're a popular phenomenon, a thing, suggests that a lot of us are looking around and seeing chaos, and trying, with whatever panache we can muster, to make it productive. Ms. Harrison's art is really good at that.

New Jersey Is Demanding $649 Million From Uber

Texto completo: The move by New Jersey could reverberate across the gig economy.
New Jersey has demanded that Uber pay $ 649 million for years of unpaid employment taxes for its drivers, arguing that the ride-hailing company has misclassified the workers as independent contractors and not as employees.
The state's Department of Labor and Workforce Development issued the request this week to Uber and a subsidiary, Raiser, after an audit uncovered $ 530 million in back taxes that had not been paid for unemployment and disability insurance from 2014 to 2018.
Because of the nonpayment, the state is seeking another $ 119 million in interest.
The case represents a major escalation in how states nationwide view the employment practices at the core of many app-based companies, and the first time that a local government has sought back payroll taxes from Uber, which has hundreds of thousands of drivers in the United States.
A spokeswoman at Uber said the company disputed the state's findings. "We are challenging this preliminary but incorrect determination, because drivers are independent contractors in New Jersey and elsewhere," the spokeswoman, Alix Anfang, said.
Across the country, states and cities have moved aggressively to rein in gig-economy companies that depend on inexpensive and independent labor, potentially reshaping their business models. Such companies have so far been able to successfully beat back attempts to alter the decades-long trend of outsourcing and franchising work.
In California, a new law could require that workers be designated as employees, allowing them to gain access to basic protections like minimum wage and unemployment insurance. Pushed by labor groups, similar legislation has taken root in New York, Oregon and Washington State. In New York City, drivers for ride-hailing apps now receive a minimum wage, though they are not classified as employees.
Last week, the New Jersey Senate took up legislation that could restrict when some businesses are permitted to classify workers as independent contractors. As employees, they would be entitled to basic protections and benefits, such as overtime pay, health care and unemployment insurance.
The labor costs of companies like Uber and Lyft could rise by 20 to 30 percent if they were required by regulators or courts to treat drivers as employees, according to industry estimates.
"The New Jersey Department of Labor and Workforce Development is cracking down on employee misclassification because it stifles our work force and inflicts a huge financial toll on our economy," Robert Asaro-Angelo, the department's commissioner, said in a statement.
A department spokeswoman declined to discuss the specifics of the case, which was reported by Bloomberg Law.
Labor groups praised the action taken by New Jersey.
"It's a stinging rebuke of the architects of the gig economy, and we hope it permeates across other sectors." Bhairavi Desai, the executive director of the New York Taxi Workers Alliance, said in a statement. "New Jersey is sending a message that the state's labor laws aren't dictated by corporations."
A 2018 audit of about 1 percent of New Jersey's employers determined that more than 12,000 workers had been misclassified as independent contractors. Just for those workers, the result was more than $ 462 million in underreported wages and millions in unpaid employment taxes, the state said.
Some Uber drivers have sued the company in New Jersey, claiming they are employees and have not been paid adequately or compensated for the costs they incur.
"It's a double whammy," said Roosevelt N. Nesmith, a lawyer in Montclair, N.J., who filed a class-action suit on behalf of several drivers.
Uber controls when and how much the drivers can work but does not pay them overtime, Mr. Nesmith said. In some weeks, the drivers' pay, after subtracting the costs of operating their cars, doesn't amount to minimum wage, he added.
"Uber has sufficient controls over the work of the drivers such that they should be deemed employees," Mr. Nesmith said.
Uber has responded to the suit Mr. Nesmith filed by invoking a requirement in its employment contracts that drivers must take disputes to arbitration. But Mr. Nesmith sees his clients as a possible exception.
They take passengers to and from airports and train stations and therefore engage in interstate commerce, which is one type of work that courts have exempted from mandatory arbitration.
In September, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals found that a federal judge in New Jersey had erred in deciding, in a separate case, that Uber drivers automatically failed to qualify for the interstate-commerce exemption. That case, Singh v. Uber Technologies, was filed on behalf of Jaswinder Singh and other Uber drivers who argued that they should be paid overtime.
Justin Swidler, a lawyer in Cherry Hill, N.J., who represents Mr. Singh, said many Uber drivers liked the flexibility of the job but did not consider themselves independent contractors.
"A lot of drivers like the freedom in scheduling and that it can be a part-time job," Mr. Swidler said. "But that's not the test in New Jersey. You can have those things and be an employee."
Conversely, if you ask the drivers, "Do you think you're running an independent business that isn't dependent on Uber?" he said, "you'll universally get a no."

Texto completo: Music lovers will have the chance to hear the work of a titan of world music as City College Center for the Arts presents "Emeline Michel's Black Pearls," a special one-night-only concert Friday, Nov. 15. An acclaimed artist and an icon of Haitian music, Emeline Michel has brought the music of her homeland to stages across the world for more than two decades. The 7:30 p.m. concert will feature Michel and voices of the new generation of Haitian singers, Princess Eud and Riva Précil. The trio, having joined forces for their recent hit song "Egzotik," are sure to delight audiences with the energetic and mesmerizing sounds of their storied island nation.
Praised by The New York Times as a "dancing ambassador with a voice serene and warm like the breeze," Michel was born in Gonai'ves, Haiti, and began singing with a gospel choir there. After studying at the Detroit Jazz Center, she returned home to Haiti and musical fame soon followed. Captivating audiences with her unique fusion of Haitian rhythms, pop, jazz and blues, the skillful singer-songwriter amassed a long list of hit songs including "Flanm," "A.K.I.K.O.," "La Chanson de Jocelyne," and "Pran Mem M (Take My Hand)."
The "Black Pearls" concert-its name a nod to the rare excellence of its performers as well as to Haiti's nionlker as "the pearl of the Antilles"-will also feature the ralent of the rising generation of Haitian performers: Eud, a talented rapper and singer known for hit sengs such as "Hey" and "Eudomination and Précil, a Haitian-American smger-songwriter celebrated for her mix of jazz and Haitian beats.
"We are excited to welcome this musical icon to Aaron Davis Hall and present New York audiences with the chance to hear the sounds of Haiti," said Gregory Shanck, managing director of CCCA. "As we near the ten-year anniversary of the 2010 Haitian earthquake it provides us with the opportunity to focus on the glory and promise of that nation."
"Black Pearls" will also feature the Sacred Heart Children's Choir of the Sacred Heart Roman Catholic Church in Cambria Heights, New York. Tickets for "Emeline Michel's Black Pearls" are $40 general admission and $32 for students and seniors; they are available for purchase online at www.citycollegecenterrorthearts.org or by calling the box office at 212-650-6900.
Tickets can also be purchased in person at the Aaron Davis Hall box office Tuesday through Friday from noon to 6 p.m. Aaron Davis Hall is located on the campus of the City College of New York at West 135th Street and Convent Avenue (129 Convent Avenue).

NOV. 9, 1938: The Final Solution had begun with us in Germany - men into concentration camps, businesses looted, moneys confiscated. When it ended, 6 million Jews across Europe, murdered. Who could foretell any of this?
We had no inkling. Certainly not I, as an 8-yearold mischievous boy who had, that evening, peeked into the huge synagogue (as big as Rodef Shalom) next door. Why not? It was my father's, the rabbi's, and I had done so many times before.
We went to sleep, and fire engines awakened my little brother and me - delighted, till we saw that it was our synagogue burning as we wereyanked from the window. In the room next door, my father the rabbi was being interrogated by the Gestapo. That had happened several times before about 4 a.m., always with searches for the supposed secret documents of the B'nai B'rith of which my father was district president. That evening when the Gestapo agents left, they took my father with them, along with several hundred Jewish men. They were trucked to Dachau, a concentration camp two hours away. In this dank, freezing winter night, they left - no coats, no goodbyes and their astonished families wondering and no one to ask. After a month or six weeks, they were released one by one.
For days, members of our community (Augsburg: population 300,000, 1,500 Jews) wondered whether we had been singled out or had this occurred elsewhere in Germany. Eventually, we learned that this had happened to every German Jewish community. Anti-Semitism had been nurtured for years and had led to this.
How did our and other families cope in this period when women largely dealt with family and home while business and finances were the male domain? Decisions were shared, but rarely left entirely to the women, who were now utterly on their own.
My mother was told that it was not safe to be alone in our apartment with two little boys and we moved into the home of the congregational president, which we boys thoroughly enjoyed. We were safe, but my mother was concerned with our future and immediately left for Stuttgart, the nearest American consulate, as our only hope was emigration as soon as possible. She spent two icy days standing in line, received a number and was told to wait till they contacted her - how long? - perhaps two or three years.
My family had begun to plan for emigration to America in the summer of 1938; our American family had provided the necessary papers, which were endless. The families had remained in touch since their arrival in the 1870s. Not much practical work needed to be done - just downsizing our furniture to fit into a small home that we might be able to afford; we boys would grow and there would be little money for new clothes, so we purchased two, three or four sizes too large. Tight government regulations, changing daily, limited what we could take, if we would be able to leave. My mother had to grapple with all this while keeping two boys and their friends, whose school had been closed, occupied. Radio programs might have been helpful, but we had carefully avoided owning a radio to avoid the mandatory demand to listen to all Nazi speeches.
My family, along with all others, yearned for news about our men. Were they healthy in this cold, wet winter? What was happening to Jews elsewhere in Germany? Could they help us? Each family had endless questions, but it was not even wise to ask. My family had an unusual additional source as we subscribed to the weekly New York Times (we had always read English and French) and through some bureaucratic error, it continued to arrive.
Friendly non-Jews were careful; what was permissible? Who was watching, listening? The most courageous act I saw was a milkman who, on Nov. 10, pushed his way through a large crowd of gawkers and delivered as always, despite the police waving him off.
We children were given only information as absolutely necessary. Fortunately for my mother, 5- and 8-yearolds could be handled. She and everyone else knew or quickly learned that a single wrong remark could doom a family.
What happened to our small family? After six weeks, my father, along with most other men, was released. Neither then nor later did he talk about this period. My parents worked hard to prepare for emigration as my parents understood that the mood might change without warning. Generously the British government, through the chief rabbi, provided temporary visas for several hundred rabbis and scholars, provided they did not work, and my father left for England. We children and my mother, eliminating all but three toys each, remained in Augsburg as we had no money in England and .the small amount the German government permitted us to withdraw each week would see us through.
When my mother in March of 1939 saw tanks on the roads leading to Czechoslovakia, she felt that war was imminent, phoned my father in London, told him we would arrive the next day and answered no questions. She gave our prepared dinners to friends and took our ever ready suitcases to the train for England. That began 10 months in London with our family that had arrived a few months earlier and now had enough family with them that we ate in shifts.
There would be plenty of adventure till we resettled in the United States, but we were safe and ever, ever grateful. �
Rabbi Walter Jacob is rabbi emeritus and senior scholar at Rodef Shalom Congregation in Pittsburgh.

Pennsylvania Low Wage Experimenter

Texto completo: Every Northeast and Middle Atlantic state other than Pennsylvania regularly has increased its minimum wage since 2012, as Pennsylvania lawmakers trot out the disproven canard that a higher minimum wage is the working person’s worst enemy.
Now a series of studies on the wave of minimum wage increases, several of them using Pennsylvania’s appalling $7.25 hourly minimum wage as the basis for comparison, have found that the increases do not broadly reduce employment or work hours, or provide an advantage to neighboring jurisdictions with lower wages.
The Federal Reserve Bank of New York recently found that minimum wage increases to $12 an hour in New York counties that border Pennsylvania did not reduce employment in the New York counties or increase employment in adjacent Pennsylvania counties mired at the $7.25 minimum wage.
Upshot, the statistical analysis department of The New York Times, conducted its own analysis zeroing on the hospitality and restaurant industries, and found similar results. Wages in Delaware County, New York, for example, increased by 30% since 2012, driven partially by a higher minimum wage, as employment grew on pace with the rest of the country. In adjacent Wayne County, Pennsylvania, wages increased by 14% since 2012 as employment increased at a comparable pace. Likewise, wages increased by 11% in Tioga County over the period and by 30% in adjacent Steuben County, New York. Similar numbers surfaced in Erie County and adjacent Chautauga County, New York.
A broader study of seven states, by economist Arindrajit Dube of the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, found that minimum wage increases in California, Oregon, Washington, Colorado, Massachusetts, New York and Maine did not produce significant job displacement.
“Up to a point, minimum wages can be absorbed without any substantial changes in employment,” Dube concluded.
Part of the reason for that is millions of workers have more money to spend, which helps to mitigate any price increases that might result from higher wages.
There are individual exceptions to the broad trends. But the overall consensus that Pennsylvania lawmakers should absorb is that they should increase minimum wages to help make low-income workers more prosperous rather than lab rats to test the smarter policies of nearby states.

20 years later, 'Tiger Lady' still hard to fathom

Texto completo: One of the more memorable, stranger-than-fiction sagas in New Jersey history began with a sight almost too surreal to believe: a Bengal tiger, roaming through a backyard in Jackson on a brisk January day.
That sighting on Wright Debow Road on the afternoon of Jan. 27, 1999, sparked an eight-hour search through the township that brought upward of 100 state and local officers to the scene.
Police blocked off roadways, contacted the nearby schools to make sure buses wouldn't be dropping off students and worked to prevent onlookers from getting near the scene.
Staff from the nearby Six Flags Great Adventure theme park, all of their safari's tigers accounted for, joined in the search.
Helicopters buzzed overhead and the media descended on the then still-sleepy Ocean County town. The headline in the New York Post the next morning would tell of a "TERRIFYING HUNT IN N.J. WOODS."
After finishing his workday at ecological restoration company the Dawson Corp. on Wright Debow Road around 5:15 p.m. that day, Steve McNamara was walking to his Ford Explorer in the parking lot when he realized he was within 50 feet of something extraordinary.
"A large, four-foot high, eight-foot long orange blur," his how he described it to the Asbury Park Press.
The blur moved a little closer, came into focus, and McNamara was in disbelief.
"I was startled," he said at the time. "I said, 'This can't be true. A tiger can't be sitting in my parking lot.'"
Hours into the search for the big cat — a male measuring more than 9 feet long and weighing 431 pounds — the tiger was spotted by a local woman in the parking lot of a Wright Debow Road business, and came within 20 feet of now-retired Jackson police officer Anthony Senatore.
"When there's no bars between you and a tiger," Senatore said, "yeah, he's pretty big."
Staff from Great Adventure unsuccessfully tried to shoot the tiger with a tranquilizer gun.
With nightfall rapidly approaching, the New Jersey Division of Fish, Game and Wildlife, which was in charge of the operation at the scene, made the decision to have the tiger killed.
Using their lights and sirens, police drew the tiger out of the woods. Senatore, armed with a department-issued .308 sniper rifle, and another officer fired.
"I hit him, he fell, he rolled, he got back up, and he went into the woods," Senatore said.
"So now I was dealing with a wounded tiger."
Sniper rifle in hand, Senatore, a tracker and another officer entered the woods to track the animal.
Yet this wild tale was only just beginning.
While a tiger on the loose in Ocean County is certainly notable, the ordeal shined a national spotlight on a reclusive local woman, nicknamed "The Tiger Lady," who had been harboring big cats for decades on her property.
The suspicion and controversy that swirled around Joan Byron-Marasek was covered in the pages of the New York Times, warranted a 2002 New Yorker profile by "The Orchid Thief" author Susan Orlean and even inspired a novelty song (Julie Gold's "Tiger in New Jersey.")
"COPS EYE CAT-LOVIN' 'TIGER LADY' IN JERSEY SCARE," screamed a headline in the New York Post.
Byron-Marasek, reportedly a former circus performer, had housed tigers under a theatrical animal permit at the Tigers Only Preservation Society, an 11.7-acre compound on Route 537 near Allyson Road in Jackson since the mid-1970s.
"I eat, sleep, and breathe tigers," she told the New York Times. "I never take vacations. This is my love, my passion."
For many years, the smattering of homeowners in the area had few issues with her single-minded hobby.
"I've been here 13 years and I have never had a problem with her or her tigers," neighbor Ed Schlechtweg of Berwyn Lane told the Press in the immediate aftermath of the wandering tiger incident.
But by the late '90s, big changes were happening in Jackson — and in Byron-Marasek's neighborhood.
Between 1990 and 2000, the 100-square-mile township's population rose 29 percent to 42,816 residents. Another 12,000 or so people would be living there by 2010.
Emblematic of the town's emerging suburban character was The Preserve, an ironically named subdivision of 31 single-family homes that opened next to Byron-Marasek's property in 1997.
Her new neighbors complained that the compound smelled like a "dirty animal cage." The odor of raw meat was particularly bad in the warm weather, they said.
"We do not want to put up with another summer of this because when it gets 90 degrees-plus, it gets bad," Kevin Wingler, a resident of The Preserve, told the Press in 2002.
"I don't mind her having tigers on her property," Scott Kayser, president of the Quality Express trucking company on Allyson Road, said in 1999. "But you have got to have the proper measures to prevent an escape. ... I'm pretty sure the tiger belongs to her."
Yet the "Tiger Lady" insisted it wasn't.
To this day, it's still not certain the tiger belonged to her.
On the day of the tiger search, school bus driver Barbara Clayton had to take a longer alternate route back to her nearby Wright Debow Road home because of police barricades.
When she finally arrived, she found her her 4-year-old son, Stephen, and her 5-year-old nephew, William, playing in the front yard.
Only later did she learn that the tiger was just an eighth of a mile away.
That's where Senatore, the Jackson cop, and his search party finally tracked the tiger down, near Interstate 195, about a half an hour after wounding it.
"I put another kill shot into him," Senatore said, "and that was it."
The tiger was killed less than a mile from the Tigers Only compound. Yet that wasn't conclusive proof it had come from there.
"It's absolutely not her tiger. I walked around the grounds and couldn't see how a tiger could've got out," her lawyer, Valter H. Must, told reporters days after the tiger was killed, when state game wardens conducted a search of the compound.
"There was no hair, no evidence of a cat moving through the area of containment," Must added. "(Byron-Marasek) said there's absolutely no way a cat could scale a fence of that height."
Municipal officials, however, were convinced. "It's not a hundred percent conclusive, but all indications are the tiger came from her property," then Jackson Mayor William J. Allman told reporters.
"The longest-range possibility (is) someone came from out of state and dropped it off, but that's a pretty far-fetched thing," Allman added.
Months later, in June 1999, state officials announced that DNA hair samples taken from the preserve matched hair taken from the dead tiger. Yet a deputy attorney general would say in court the following year that the state could not definitively prove the tiger was Byron-Marasek's.
Of greater concern for Byron-Marasek was the state's decision not to renew her permit to keep tigers on her property, due to poor condition of the preserve and sloppy record-keeping.
An intense, four-year legal battle ensued.
"This is my life. This is 25 years of my work. Many of these tigers were born here and raised here. To close us down would be a travesty of justice," Byron-Marasek told reporters during a press conference held on her property in 2000.
"We have been here 25 years without a single person being injured. There is not a zoo, circus, or amusement park that can boast of a similar safety record," she said. Her tigers had formed a family unit, she added, and if forced to move and be separated, "most would die from shock and fright."
However, in October 2002, Byron-Marasek's husband, Jan Marasek, suffered head and arm injuries inflicted by one of the tigers. A little more than a year later, in November 2003, after Byron-Marasek lost her final appeal, the state confiscated her 24 tigers and had them transported to the Wild Animal Orphanage in San Antonio, Texas. By August 2004, the Press had reported that at least three healthy cubs had been born to one of the tigers.
Three of the Jackson tigers had been euthanized by then. Two had developed illnesses: Misha, an approximately 5- year-old male, had a brain tumor, while an 8- or 9-year-old female had kidney failure. A third tiger, named Marko, who had injured Byron-Marasek's husband, was put down due to aggressive behavior, the Press reported.
After their arrival in Texas, the tigers were treated for ailments including foot infections, dehydration, stomach parasites and malnutrition, according to the Massachusetts-based International Fund for Animal Welfare, a major backer of the Wild Animal Orphanage.
"The tigers' health has improved greatly since their arrival to our sanctuary," said Carol Asvestas, the preserve's executive director. "They now have proper care and the space they deserve. For most of these animals, it's a happy ending."
But that wasn't the end of the story.
The Wild Animal Orphanage closed in September 2010. The San Antonio Express-News reported in 2011 that the Global Federation of Animal Sanctuaries had found sanctuaries for the facility's 55 tigers. That total included seven remaining tigers from Jackson.
Four of the tigers were relocated to the Carolina Tiger Rescue in North Carolina, while three went to the Big Cat Rescue in Florida, according to Global Federation of Animal Sanctuaries executive director Valerie Taylor.
The last of the Jackson tigers, Max, died in January in North Carolina at the age of 19, Taylor said.
Byron-Marasek lost the Route 537 property via a tax lien foreclosure in 2017, according to public records. The property is currently owned by a Lakewood-based LLC and is on the market for $950,000.
The Press was unable to reach Byron-Marasek for comment.
Senatore, who was assigned to the detective bureau at the time, retired for the force in 2010 after 19 years of service.
John Bergmann, director of the Associated Humane Societies' Popcorn Park Zoo in the Forked River section of Lacey, said there's a clear lesson he hopes people learn from the "Tiger Lady" saga.
"You want a pet, go get a domestic dog or cat," he said. "There's shelters all over the country that are facing (the decision) sometimes to euthanize to animals because (there's) not enough owners or not enough people to adopt them.
"Go get a dog or a cat and let that be your companion."

Texto completo: The Latin Grammy Awards air on Univision. And an acclaimed drama from Joanna Hogg is streaming on Amazon.
What's on TV
LATIN GRAMMY AWARDS 8 p.m. on Univision. The three-time Latin Grammy winner Ricky Martin will host the 20th Annual Latin Grammy Awards, along with the actresses Roselyn Sánchez and Paz Vega. The ceremony will include performances from Alicia Keys, Miguel and Prince Royce, and will open with a tribute to the 20th anniversary of the awards.
What's Streaming
THE SOUVENIR (2019) Stream on Amazon; Rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. Joanna Hogg wrote and directed this drama, which stars Honor Swinton Byrne. The story follows Julie, an ambitious young film student played by Byrne, as she balances her aspirations and the demands of a turbulent relationship with Anthony, played by Tom Burke. As the relationship drains Julie, her once urgent work feels farther away. The couple face resistance from Julie's friends and family, especially her mother -- played by Byrne's actual mother, Tilda Swinton -- which layers the tension between them. The film "is one of the saddest movies you can imagine," A.O. Scott wrote in his review for The New York Times, "and it's an absolute joy to watch."
THE WORLD ACCORDING TO JEFF GOLDBLUM Stream on Disney Plus. Brought to you by Jeff Goldblum, this new weekly show explores the most ordinary of topics with a quirky inquisitor. The show is influenced by Goldblum's own curiosity and his self-proclaimed "ability to have a childlike sense of wonder." This tone is wildly apparent in the first episodes, in which Goldblum delves into the cultural phenomena surrounding sneakers, ice cream, tattoos and jeans and emerges with a world of his own conclusions. "Goldblum's genius is for rendering a child's overwhelming need for attention in a pure, nonirritating form," Mike Hale wrote in his review for The Times. Goldblum, Hale wrote, "is nearly impossible not to like."
INSTANT FAMILY (2018) Stream on Hulu. Inspired by his own story of adopting children from foster care, the director Sean Anders brings us "Instant Family." It's a familial Hollywood comedy starring Rose Byrne and Mark Wahlberg as Ellie and Pete, who are newly parents to a 15-year-old girl and her two younger siblings. This feel-good film asks more difficult questions than may be expected from the director of the "Daddy's Home" movies, while scattering positive messages about adoption throughout. "The movie has some conviction," Glenn Kenny wrote in his review for The Times, adding that it takes a "head-on approach to the social concerns around adoption culture."
THE STRANDED Stream on Netflix. In the wake of a devastating tsunami, private school students find themselves trapped on an island. As unexplainable events begin to unfold, they learn they are not alone. The series, which premieres Thursday, is a Netflix original from Thailand.

Texto completo: "I think we'd go out together," Mike Bryan told Tennis magazine in 2016, when asked about his brother and fellow doubles savant, Bob. "We've got a special bond."
On Wednesday, the most successful doubles team in tennis history, and two of the most decorated American players ever, made a joint statement on Tennis Channel: 2020 will be their final year on tour.
"We wanted to see if we wanted to keep going," Mike announced on Tennis Channel Live, "and we've decided that 2020, at the [U.S.] Open, we're going to shut it down.

"One more season -- and we're excited for it."
The 41-year-old identical twins from Camarillo reached three finals in 2019 and won the prestigious Miami Open. As recently as July, Mike was ranked No. 1 in the ATP doubles rankings.
The U.S. Open was the tournament where the Bryans began their career in 1995. In the 24 years since, they've set nearly every significant doubles record, often obliterating previous marks. They have established standards of longevity and prosperity that may never be matched again. As a team, Bob and Mike have not finished outside of the year-end top 10 since 2000. They've won a record 16 Grand Slam doubles titles together, and over 1,100 matches, with a career winning percentage exceeding 75%.
--
Rafael Nadal saved match point at 5-1 down with a perfect drop shot and then rallied to beat Daniil Medvedev 6-7 (3), 6-3, 7-6 (4), keeping alive his chances of advancing from the group stage at the ATP Finals in London.
The win gives Nadal a 1-1 record after two round-robin matches, while Medvedev fell to 0-2.
In the late match, Stefanos Tsitsipas beat defending champion Alexander Zverev 6-3, 6-2 for his second straight win, a result that guarantees him a place in the semifinals.
--
ETC.
Auerbach resigns from CHRB
Madeline Auerbach, vice chairman of the California Horse Racing Board, resigned from the board Monday amid calls from Gov. Gavin Newsom to eliminate conflicts of interest from the panel.
Auerbach, a prominent California thoroughbred owner and breeder, was appointed to the CHRB in 2014 by Gov. Jerry Brown. Her resignation was announced Wednesday.
She was expected to be the new chairman until Newsom said he was pulling away from appointing members with "direct conflicts" to the board in favor of a "more objective oversight capacity." He made those remarks to New York Times reporters last month.
The Los Angeles Times reported in August that Auerbach had a business relationship with Tim Ritvo, chief operating officer of the Stronach Group, which owns two race tracks in California. They were co-owners of a horse named Fravel, named after the Breeders' Cup chief executive who is now CEO of the Stronach Group.

Looking back at a stellar weekend in dance: Black Grace, Ashwini Ramaswamy and Bruno Beltrão/Grupo de Rua

Texto completo: You never know what you’ll see in dance, especially contemporary dance. You might have a general idea if you’ve seen a company before, or other examples of a choreographer’s work. But you might be wrong. Live performances are ephemeral. Films of complete dances are rare. Written descriptions can be puzzling. There’s no narrative or plot.
Dance has been called the art that disappears at the same time it is created. It is only retained by memory. How much, and how accurately, will you remember? How much, and how soon, will you forget? With the amount of work that goes into making a dance, it seems unfair that it doesn’t last longer, that we can’t play it later like a CD or page through it like a book or display it like a photograph.
Over the weekend, we saw three extraordinary dance performances that left vivid impressions, evoked strong emotional responses and surprised us in ways we’ll remember. Our dance card was full.
Black Grace
On Thursday at Northrop, Black Grace, New Zealand’s leading contemporary dance company, delivered a combination of traditional Samoan slap dance and seated dance, modern dance and hip-hop, chanting and singing, live drumming and music by Vivaldi and Bach.
Founding artistic director and choreographer Neil Ieremia is of Samoan heritage. The dancers have Samoan, Maori, Tongan and New Zealander roots. During a performance preview, Ieremia talked about being asked, “Why Bach? You’re Samoan.” His answer: “Because I’m human.”
Watching Black Grace was an intense, totally involving experience. The dancers are strong and fast. They are always in motion, leaping, flying, running, falling, rolling, bouncing from foot to foot. In “Crying Men,” a new work that addresses the dark side of masculinity and confronts physical abuse, the dancers were fierce and terrifying. Their faces wore silent screams. It was hard to watch, and disturbing.
“Crying Men” was followed by “Method,” an explosion of pure joy. The movements were based on Ieremia’s boyhood memories of playing sports; the music was from Bach’s “Brandenburgs,” performed by the New Zealand Guitar Quartet. It wasn’t an antidote to “Crying Men,” but it left us with a happy ending to the evening.
Ashwini Ramaswamy: “Let the Crows Come”
On Friday at the Lab, a sold-out house saw what many of us had waited ages to see. Ashwini Ramaswamy’s “Let the Crows Come” took three years to develop, under the watchful eye and guidance of the St. Paul Chamber Orchestra’s Liquid Music and its founder, Kate Nordstrum.
For the past seven years, Liquid Music has been one of the most exciting music series in the Twin Cities, or anywhere. The New York Times paid attention. Due to shifts in corporate funding, the series’ relationship with the SPCO will end in December. We don’t yet know what will happen next.
“Let the Crows Come” was one of three final SPCO-sponsored Liquid Music performances. It was also one of the most complex and fully-formed Liquid Music events we’ve seen. Liquid Music often presented works in progress, projects it had commissioned or co-commissioned, and some were in their nascent stages. But what we saw on Saturday was polished and sure.
It began with Carnatic music performed by three musicians: percussionist Rohan Krishnamurthy, vocalist Roopa Mahadeven and violinist Arun Ramamurthy. Ramaswamy slowly entered the Lab’s enormous stage and danced an exquisite Bharatanatyam solo of delicate gestures and powerful moves. It was similar to what we’ve seen her dance with Ragamala Dance Company, and she was wearing traditional costume. This wasn’t a Ragamala moment, but it was the Ashwini we know.
Then it changed. The music passed from the Carnatic trio to cellist Brent Arnold and DJ Jace Clayton, becoming singing cello notes, electronic loops, remixes and beats. Two more dancers appeared. Berit Ahlgren is trained in and teaches Gaga; Afro-Caribbean dancer Alanna Morris-Van Tassel was named one of Dance Magazine’s “25 to Watch!” for 2018. Both are former members of TU Dance. Morris-Van Tassel soloed to Arnold’s music, Ahlgren to Clayton’s. They also danced together and with Ramaswamy.
The Carnatic music and Ramaswamy’s Bharatanatyam dance were the core of the performance. Both were transformed. Ahlgren and Morris-Van Tassel filtered Ramaswamy’s gestures and movements through their own bodies and approaches to dance. You could still see them, but they were different. Similarly, Arnold and Clayton combined Carnatic music with their own aesthetics and styles.
Ramaswamy describes herself as having dual identities. She was born in America; her mother Ranee and sister Aparna, Ragamala’s co-artistic directors, were born in India, and Bharatanatyam is a classical Indian dance form. In “Let the Crows Come,” she created a place where her two identities could meet.
From its premiere at the Lab, “Let the Crows Come” toured to Carleton College, Ramaswamy’s alma mater. In March it will go to Lanesboro, and in April to Massachusetts and Pennsylvania. Like “Come Through,” an earlier project cooked up by Nordstrum, it deserves to be seen and heard more widely. A hugely successful collaboration among Bon Iver and TU Dance, “Come Through” debuted at the Palace Theatre in spring 2018 and is still touring.
Bruno Beltrão/Grupo de Rua: “Inoah”
On Saturday at the Walker’s McGuire Theater, we felt lucky to get out alive. OK, an exaggeration, but everything Grupo de Rua did looked dangerous, sometimes threatening. We feared for the people in the first row. Not really, but these are thoughts you might have while watching 10 incredibly fit male dancers move at hyperspeed, when one wrong move could mean a rocket-fueled fist to the face.
Brazilian choreographer Bruno Beltrão started out teaching street dance at age 15, then formed his own company with a friend at 16. At first, they were competitive hip-hop dancers. Over time, Beltrão and his company – the other founder left in 2001 – have evolved, creating their own version of hip-hop, one that aims at connecting people and relies heavily on teamwork. One that includes moments of absolute stillness.
We knew going in to expect that, or we would have been confounded by something that happened early in the performance. To the deep, low room-filling roar of Felipe Storino’s soundtrack, music you could feel in your bones, two dancers stopped and stood motionless near each other. They stayed that way for (best guess) five minutes before very slowly starting to move. It seemed like an eternity.
Grupo de Rua is super-fast, super-strong, and seemingly immune to gravity. When they throw themselves on the ground, they bounce. They speed-walk hunched over, fists nearly on the ground. They break, pop and lock into strange, bent positions, arms dangling. They slide on their heads and launch themselves through the air. They pick up and drop each other in moves that look shoulder-dislocating.
When two or three are dancing, you can focus on individuals. When all 10 are on the floor, it’s a tornado. How they get through a performance without broken bones and bloody noses attests to their virtuosity, Beltrão’s choreography and the time they put into getting it right.
“Inoah” took place on a stage meant to look like a big, empty room with bare walls and high ceilings. Near the top, far above the dancers’ heads, video projections of narrow horizontal windows offered glimpses of the Brazilian outdoors: a mountain with trees, a bird on a wire. Clouds passed. Night fell and stars came out. The dancers continued in their fleetness and fury. It was thrilling to be there.

Texto completo: As Democrats debate the best way to achieve universal coverage and lower health care costs, the Trump administration has a different approach to the challenges of our current system. It’s working overtime to make the system more fragile for the sick and the poor, even as it misrepresents to Congress and the American public what it’s up to.
Speaking to reporters in late October, President Trump said that “we have a great Republican plan” to replace the Affordable Care Act. “Much less expensive. Deductibles will be much lower.” His statements came on the heels of a congressional hearing in which one of his top health officials, Seema Verma, said that the administration would do “everything we can” for Americans with pre-existing conditions. Under oath, she swore that the administration was aiming to help people find a pathway out of poverty.
None of this is true.
Pre-existing conditions
Far from supporting protections for people with pre-existing conditions, the Trump administration has thrown its weight behind a lawsuit seeking to topple the Affordable Care Act. In court filings, if not in its public statements, the administration is clear about what it wants done to the law: “The proper course is to strike it down in its entirety.”
If the lawsuit succeeds, protections for people with pre-existing conditions would be wiped from the books. Overnight, we’d be back in a world where private insurers could discriminate against the sick.
In her testimony, Ms. Verma insisted that “the president has made clear that we will have a plan in action.” But she refused to share any details. And no wonder: Without the Affordable Care Act, the Trump administration doesn’t have the power to force insurers not to discriminate against the sick. You’d need a new law for that.
Good luck getting Congress to pass one. Though Republicans have no shortage of white papers endorsing controversial reform plans — the Republican Study Committee, a group of legislators, recently released another one — they’ve never been able to coalesce around a piece of actual legislation.
And the bills that are most popular among Republicans don’t actually protect sick people. During the repeal-and-replace debate in 2017, for example, the leading replacement bill would have increased the number of uninsured by 23 million over a decade. For the sick, deductibles would have gone up, not down.
The Affordable Care Act exchanges
In the meantime, the Trump administration is trying to sabotage the exchanges. A new rule that took effect last month will exploit a loophole in the law allowing for the sale of “short term” health plans.
Originally meant to serve as a stopgap for those with temporary breaks in coverage, short-term plans discriminate against people with pre-existing conditions and usually exclude vital protections, including prescription drugs and maternity care. They’re cheap — but you get what you pay for.
Now, under the new rule, plans that last for 364 days out of 365 can qualify as “short term.” As relatively healthy people who like the low price tag leave the exchanges to buy short-term coverage, the pool of people left on the exchanges will be relatively sicker. Prices will surge by an average of 18 percent in most states, according to researchers at the Urban Institute.
Already, unscrupulous brokers are using high-pressure tactics to sell short-term plans over the phone. Internet searches for “Obamacare plans” or “ACA enroll” will usually direct people to brokers selling short-term plans, not comprehensive coverage. Many of those people will be in for a rude shock when they get sick and discover how little their insurance actually covers.
There’s more. Earlier this year, a low-profile rule change reduced the subsidies for people who buy health insurance through the exchanges. President Trump’s own health officials recommended against the change because it “would cause coverage losses, further premium increases, and market disruption.” But the White House approved the cut anyway, and 70,000 people are expected to lose coverage as a result.
Insurance for the poor
At the same time, the Trump administration is laboring to tear health care from the poor. In its most galling move, it has been allowing states to add work requirements to Medicaid. To date, 18 states (most Republican controlled) have sought to impose work requirements, though Kentucky is likely to drop the request after Gov. Matt Bevin’s apparent loss last week.
Work requirements poll well: If you’re getting benefits on the government’s dime, shouldn’t you be expected to pull your own weight? But they are a policy nightmare. Fully 60 percent of those who are subject to work requirements already work. Of those who don’t, the overwhelming majority are in school, disabled or caring for dependents. There just aren’t that many people on Medicaid who can work but have chosen not to.
That’s why work requirements can’t stimulate much new employment. Every Medicaid beneficiary who’s subject to the requirements, however, has to jump through the bureaucratic hoops of attesting to their work status. Desperately poor people who lack the bandwidth or the wherewithal to comply will lose health coverage because they can’t manage the paperwork.
Experience in Arkansas bears the point out. More than 18,000 people, or nearly one in four Medicaid beneficiaries subject to work requirements, lost coverage in the first seven months of the program. A careful study in the New England Journal of Medicine found that “lack of awareness and confusion about the reporting requirements were common.” Employment rates didn’t budge.
Losing Medicaid isn’t a pathway out of poverty. It’s a pathway to destitution. A randomized trial out of Oregon, for example, shows that getting Medicaid eliminated catastrophic medical bills and cut in half the rates of people who had to borrow money or skip other bills to pay for health care. Recent research also shows that Medicaid sharply reduces evictions.
Attacks on the poor go beyond work requirements. For decades, Title X has offered grants for family planning services — including contraception and screenings for sexually transmitted diseases — for low-income women and families. In February, however, the Trump administration eliminated funding for any organization that refers patients for abortions.
The change was a deliberate effort to target Planned Parenthood, which, through its large network of clinics, serves about 40 percent of the women receiving help through Title X. Planned Parenthood has since withdrawn from the program, with the predictable result that poor women, especially those in rural areas, will face new barriers to receiving care.
Trump is even using health care as a weapon in his immigration war. Most legal immigrants are eligible for Medicaid once they’ve lived in the United States for more than five years, and millions have enrolled. But in a new “public charge” rule, originally set to take effect this month, the administration said that it would start denying citizenship to immigrants who are on Medicaid.
The courts have enjoined the rule for now; one judge said it was “repugnant to the American dream.” If the rule takes effect, however, millions of poor immigrants — every one of whom is legally present in the United States — will lose coverage.
So ignore what the Trump administration says. Pay attention to what it’s doing. It’s working to eliminate protections for the sick, destabilize the exchanges, and strip insurance from the poor. That’s the ugly truth.

Texto completo: Rep. Adam Schiff, chair of the House intelligence committee, wrongly implied that his committee had no contact with the whistleblower before receiving the complaint. Schiff claimed, “We have not spoken directly with the whistleblower,” when the whistleblower had in fact reached out to a committee aide before filing a complaint.
A Democratic committee official told us Schiff “could have been more clear” but was “referring to the Committee officially interviewing the whistleblower, and himself personally. ” It was clearly known, however, that the committee hadn’t officially interviewed the whistleblower at that time.
Factcheck: Adam Schiff’s ‘parody’ and President Trump’s response
The New York Times broke the story on Oct. 2 that Schiff knew about “the outlines” of the whistleblower’s concerns before the Aug. 12 complaint was filed. The whistleblower had contacted an intelligence committee aide after passing along concerns to the CIA’s top lawyer and being “[c]oncerned about how that initial avenue for airing his allegations through the C. I. A. was unfolding,” the Times reported.
New York Times, Oct. 2: The House staff member, following the committee’s procedures, suggested the [whistleblower] find a lawyer to advise him and meet with an inspector general, with whom he could file a whistle-blower complaint. The aide shared some of what the officer conveyed to Mr. Schiff. The aide did not share the whistle-blower’s identity with Mr. Schiff, an official said.
In an Oct. 2 press conference, President Donald Trump speculated that “I think [Schiff] probably helped write” the complaint, but there’s no evidence of that. Patrick Boland, spokesman for Schiff and the House intelligence committee, said in a statement, “At no point did the Committee review or receive the complaint in advance. ”
New revelation: Sondland said Trump 'cares more' about Biden investigation than Ukraine, Taylor says
On Sept. 9, Michael Atkinson, the inspector general of the intelligence community, sent a letter to the House intelligence committee saying he had received a whistleblower’s complaint relating to an “urgent concern,” and that he had sent “my determination of a credible urgent concern” along with a copy of the complaint to Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire. Contrary to “past practice,” Atkinson said, Maguire hadn’t forwarded the complaint to Congress within seven days of receiving it.
Six days later, Schiff was asked about the complaint in a Sept. 17 MSNBC interview and stated, “We have not spoken directly with the whistleblower. ”
MSNBC contributor Sam Stein: First off, have you heard from the whistleblower? Are you — do you want to hear from the whistleblower? What protections could you provide to the whistleblower? And then, you also said that the DNI is refusing to turn over the stuff, citing a request from a higher authority — the insinuation left, at least for me and others, was that the President himself had intervened. Is that the insinuation you sought to provide and, if so, what basis do you have for making that insinuation?
Schiff: We have not spoken directly with the whistleblower. We would like to, but I’m sure the whistleblower has concerns that he has not been advised, as the law requires, by the inspector general or the director of national intelligence, just as to how he is to communicate with Congress. And so the risk for the whistleblower is retaliation. Will the whistleblower be protected under the statute if the offices that are supposed to come to his assistance and provide the mechanism are unwilling to do so? But yes, we would love to talk directly with the whistleblower.
Stein later asked, “Do we know what the nature of the issue at hand is? … What can you tell us about the actual substance of the matter? Are you in the dark as well?”
Schiff responded: “Well we don’t have the complaint, so there’s a limit to what I can say about the substance of it,” he said. “But we do know from the Inspector General that the subject matter relates to an intelligence activity, that it is not just a concern but an urgent concern, that it deals with a serious or flagrant abuse, and that’s really all that is necessary to provide that complaint to Congress. ”
The whistleblower’s complaint charges that Trump “is using the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 U. S. election” by, “among other things, pressuring a foreign country to investigate one of the President’s main domestic political rivals. ” (For more on the complaint, see “The Whistleblower Complaint Timeline” and “Q&A on Intelligence Community Whistleblower. ”)
Stein addressed Schiff’s remarks on Oct. 3, saying on MSNBC that he had spoken to Schiff, who “expressed regret for not having been more clear in his wording. ” Schiff said at the time “there wasn’t 100% certainty that the whistleblower who had approached his staff was the same one who was behind the actual complaint,” Stein said.
As for the committee’s contact with the whistleblower, we don’t know if the complainant had “spoken” to any committee staffers or contacted the committee through email or letter. On Oct. 2, Boland provided us with this statement without answering our follow-up questions: “Like other whistleblowers have done before and since under Republican and Democratic-controlled Committees, the whistleblower contacted the Committee for guidance on how to report possible wrongdoing within the jurisdiction of the Intelligence Community. This is a regular occurrence, given the Committee’s unique oversight role and responsibilities. Consistent with the Committee’s longstanding procedures, Committee staff appropriately advised the whistleblower to contact an Inspector General and to seek legal counsel. ”
Impeachment hearing: Diplomat says Trump felt 'wronged' by Ukraine and that they 'owed' him
There’s support for the statement that it’s “a regular occurrence” for whistleblowers to contact congressional committees. A May 2019 Government Accountability Office report said “whistleblowers who contact the Congress typically reach out to oversight committees, the offices of their own representatives or senators, or authorizing committees. ” In a 2016 story in The Intercept, a spokesman for Republican Rep. Devin Nunes, then the chair of the House intelligence committee, said the committee received whistleblower complaints in the “dozens” each year from both the intelligence community inspector general “and via individuals who approach the committee directly. ”
But this “regular occurrence” wasn’t disclosed by Schiff when asked about it. Instead, wrongly implied the committee had not been contacted, when he said, “We have not spoken directly with the whistleblower. ”

Texto completo: The name of former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley's new book, "With All Due Respect," sounds better if you don't know the context behind the title. In April 2018, Haley went on "Face the Nation" to announce new sanctions on Russia for supporting Syrian President Bashar Assad.
President Donald Trump had already axed the sanctions, because he loves Russian President Vladimir Putin like cats love string, but no one told Haley. Larry Kudlow, director of the National Economic Council, announced Haley "got ahead of the curve" and "there might have been some momentary confusion.
And Haley famously responded, "With all due respect, I don't get confused."
Thanks to a decade as a journalist in South Carolina, I know Haley a bit. She gets confused as much as most middle-aged folks, which is to say, a lot. And the fact that the sanctions she promised were never imposed ruins the book title for anyone who knows the story.
But my point is not to bash Haley, who has her pros and cons: She was unprepared for her first term as governor but grew tremendously in the job. Her handling of the Charleston church shootings and their aftermath was empathetic and inspired, and her run as UN ambassador was polished and unembarassing, which is a lot in this administration. She is a true conservative of the sort who thinks paving roads and paying teachers more than a pittance is a waste of taxpayer money, and if that's your cup of tea, you can support her for president someday.
But she is once again confused, and other current and former top Trump officials are, too. In her book, Haley alleges that former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and former White House chief of staff John Kelly tried to  persuade her to join them in combating and undermining Trump.
"Kelly and Tillerson confided in me that when they resisted the president, they weren't being insubordinate, they were trying to save the country," Haley wrote. "It was their decisions, not the president's, that were in the best interests of America,  they said.  The president didn't know what he was doing. To undermine a president is really a very dangerous thing. And it goes against the Constitution, and it goes against what the American people want. And it was offensive."
Haley apparently thinks the way to let the nation know that Cabinet members are staging a coup is in a book written for money more than a year later. A news conference held immediately after that conversation would have been the way to go.
Haley says she let Trump know, but we have no reason to believe the president would handle such a dangerous situation competently, and it was the people's government being undermined, not just Trump's.
That brings us to the close-mouthed resignations of Kelly, Tillerson and Secretary of Defense James Mattis, and the anonymity of the senior White House official who has published an op-ed in The New York Times and now a book claiming he or she is part of an internal "resistance."
These people, whose disgust with Trump is known but whose specific stories are not, owe it to the nation to make full public statements of how they saw Trump behave in the White House, and in the case of the anonymous author, to unmask themselves. There is no honor or adherence to duty in hiding the facts of this presidency from the American people, or waiting to reveal them as part of a juicy book, or hiding behind anonymity to report it, whether the plots uncovered are committed by Trump, for Trump or against him.

Pete Buttigieg's problem isn't Black homophobia

Texto completo: Reducing Pete Buttigieg's struggle to attract Black support solely to Black homophobia is not only erroneous, it is a disgusting, racist trope, secretly nursed and insidiously whispered by white liberals with contempt for the very Black people they court and need.
I have never been blind to this - the people who see Black religiosity as an indicator of primitive thinking and lack of enlightenment.
(For the record, I am bisexual and not a religious man.)
They are those who see Black people as a blight on our big cities, pathologically prone to violence and in need of pity and crumbs they cast about and call philanthropy.
They see these Black voters as needing to be led, directed and better informed rather than as sophisticated voters fully capable of making informed decisions that they believe are best for their lives and communities.
These people blame Black voters when their candidate or their cause fails, even though Black voters are the most consistently loyal Democrats in this country.
It is tiresome and disappointing to constantly have to defend yourself not only from people who are openly hostile to you, but also from those who feign friendship but are secretly hostile to you.
It is in the tribal nature of gay culture that white men still center their white maleness as privileged, if one step removed from that enjoyed by their heterosexual brothers, where racial minorities are too often fetishized and thing-ified, seen more as an opportunity than an equal.
The latest round of blaming Black homophobia for Buttigieg's lackluster Black support came last month when McClatchy obtained the report from a focus group the Buttigieg campaign had conducted with Black voters.
According to McClatchy, the report found that "being gay was a barrier for these voters, particularly for the men who seemed deeply uncomfortable even discussing it.... [T]heir preference is for his sexuality to not be front and center."
First thing to note here is the size of the group: only 24 people.
The second thing is that focus groups aren't scientific surveys. As Liza Featherstone, author of "Divining Desire: Focus Groups and the Culture of Consultation," has put it, "Focus groups are not a scientific and quantitative method of gathering knowledge."
But none of that mattered. This fed a narrative that liberals - including some older Black politicians and pundits - have nursed. A raft of articles was published. Social media posts started to fly.
South Carolina Congressman Jim Clyburn was asked about the focus group on CNN, and he fed into the narrative, saying: "That is a generational issue. I know of a lot of people my age who feel that way."
The anchor asked if Clyburn was saying that for older African Americans Buttigieg's gayness was an issue, and he responded: "Yes, it is. There's no question about that. I'm not going to sit here and tell you otherwise because I think everybody knows that's an issue."
Really?
Is there homophobia in the Black community? Of course. Is it higher in the Black community than in other communities? It is. But even that needs context.
Acceptance and rejection of gayness is highly correlated to religiosity. Black people in general are more religious than other racial groups. But, while Black Protestants are more opposed to same-sex marriage than white mainline Protestants (more moderate), they are more supportive of it than white evangelical Protestants (more conservative), according to a May Pew Research Center report.
Furthermore, it found that a majority of Black people (51%) now approve of same-sex marriage, just 7 percentage points fewer than Hispanics and 11 fewer than whites. That spread isn't inconsequential, but it's also not an overwhelming difference.
But the most important question, it seems to me, is whether feelings about gayness dictate political actions.
A 2007 study by researchers from the City University of New York found that "though Black [Americans] provided more harsh lip service (attitude) to homosexuality, when it comes to discrimination (behavior), they are much more supportive."
Black people have a long history with discrimination in this country that can make it distasteful for many to abide in any form.
In addition, whatever level of homophobia may exist in the Black community, African Americans consistently vote for Democratic candidates with progressive views on gay rights. These Democratic presidential candidates haven't won a majority of the white vote in modern history, but time and again they get a clear majority of the Black vote.
Buttigieg isn't the only candidate struggling to strengthen his support among Black voters. He will have to appeal to that group like he appeals to any other, by listening and being responsive. And he's already doing that.
A June Post and Courier-Change Research poll of likely Democratic primary voters found: "Most notable is Buttigieg's growing support from Black voters. He collected 6% African American support, good enough for fourth this month, after he received none in May."
Black voters generally favor candidates with a demonstrated history of loyalty to the community. Buttigieg is a young man, relatively unknown, and with a curious history on race relations in South Bend, Indiana. He will have to get over those hurdles.
Pretending those hurdles don't exist, and instead assigning the blame to Black homophobia, hurts Buttigieg's campaign more than helps it.
And the people who are so committed to the Black homophobia narrative must search themselves for the answer to this question: Why do you want - need! - this trope to stay alive?

Texto completo: The time is now.
Government regulation, public pressure, worker action -- all these and more are needed to rein in the big tech companies, which have been allowed to operate largely unhindered for too long.
That was the view of most participants at The New York Times DealBook conference task force -- made up of eight technology experts in the public and private sectors -- looking at the question of "How Big Should Big Tech Be?"
"I think we have lived for decades now with no regulation, so to speak, of tech," said Chris Hughes, a co-founder of Facebook and now the co-chair of the nonprofit Economic Security Project. "And the time's come due for regulation, for structural solutions and for a general cultural rethinking of how to ensure that these platforms are working for us rather than us working for the platforms."
The challenges include increasing concerns about how private data is collected and used; the spreading of false information that could influence the 2020 election, by both foreign and domestic actors on social media; and whether behemoths like Facebook, Google and Amazon should be split up.
"I definitely think we need market regulation," said Gabriel Weinberg, the founder and chief executive of the search engine DuckDuckGo. "I think it's the only way to correct systemic market failures."
But addressing the myriad issues is not a one-time affair. "I'm worried Congress is thinking that we're going to pass one privacy bill and be done for 20 years," he added.
And one tool will not resolve all the different and complex issues, said Noah Phillips, commissioner of the Federal Trade Commission. First, "we need to ask what is the harm that we're solving and how does the remedy address that harm?"
If the question is competition, he said, then that's what antitrust laws are for. Privacy, on the other hand, will require other approaches. And therein, he and others have said, lies the crux of the dilemma.
For there to be any change in how the big technology companies are operating, most agreed that there must be a confluence of several factors: a strong congressional mandate, leadership to address long-term needs, more resources for agencies like the Federal Trade Commission and a public willingness to lose some of the ease and convenience people now get through companies like Amazon.
Steve Huffman, the chief executive of Reddit and the only head of a social media company in the room, said: "When it comes to regulation it's the detail that matters. I don't want to see regulation that's knee-jerk or comes from a position of fear."
But he acknowledged, "The state of our political discourse is as toxic as it's ever been in my lifetime."
Mr. Huffman said Reddit was not following Twitter's lead in banning political ads -- something Facebook has refused to do. He said he believes such an action favors incumbents, but Reddit is considering enabling comments on all political ads. Currently, those who buy the ads can decide whether or not they are open to comments.
Such discussion reflects "a healthy debate about how we treat political ads in this country," Mr. Huffman said. "While I don't agree with their decisions, I also don't really agree with the status quo."
Some said, though, that the workers inside companies can make a bigger difference than government officials coming in from the outside.
"I've seen more regulation go bad in technology than produce good," said Craig Newmark, the founder of Craigslist and the head of Craig Newmark Foundations. "I've been working with line workers, grunts, my fellow nerds in these tech companies who are now actively working to try to get their management to do the right thing, and that's beginning to bear fruit."
For Kate Crawford, a co-founder of the AI Now Institute at New York University, which aims to understand the social implications of artificial intelligence, it isn't a matter of choosing between government intervention or worker and public action, but advocating for both.
"The question isn't whether regulation works or do we need it," Ms. Crawford said. "I think we absolutely need it, but the question we have to ask is 'Is it going to be enough?"'
She said collective action by workers at companies like Google, investigations by the news media and institutions like hers were all shining a light on the workings of the major technology companies as never before.
On the question of whether the big tech companies should be broken up -- as Elizabeth Warren has advocated in her presidential campaign -- Mr. Hughes said it was now clear that a majority of Americans want that.
"In a time when Republicans and Democrats can't really agree on anything, there seems to be a pretty wide bipartisan consensus that we should be paying more attention to this," he said. "Now the question is, where does that go, and how does that develop over the next year?"
But Ms. Crawford warned that breaking technology companies into smaller entities would not necessarily solve the problem.
"If we move from 10 major players to 100 but don't question the underlying business model, is that really going to address this very complex set of problems?" she asked. "Why are we not talking about, essentially, the sort of rapacious excavation of everybody's biometric information, location data, the use of everything that is available to train A.I. systems? Why are we not looking at labor practices in terms of contract work forces?"
Or as Alexa von Tobel, the founder and managing partner of Inspired Capital, noted, "You can be a really small company with incredible A.I. and quantum computing and owning data of enough people and be very, very dangerous."
While the challenges can seem overwhelming -- and at times the conversation steered toward the apocalyptic -- Mr. Hughes, for one, was optimistic.
"We can get regulation right. We do it with airlines. We do it with pharmaceuticals. We do it with the F.C.C.," he said. "We have come to a cultural agreement in the United States that when private industry is crucially important in our lives, we have to ensure that it works for the people."

Texto completo: Officers summoned to a Brooklyn apartment discovered the grisly remains of what was once a romance: A 30-year-old man in a jealous rage had shot his former girlfriend in the head, then shot her new boyfriend in the chest before killing himself on Sunday, the police said.
The ex-boyfriend, Darnell Solomon, and his former girlfriend, Jened Duncan, 24, died at a hospital while the victim's boyfriend, Miguel McLawrence, 33, was expected to survive, the police said.
It was the third murder-suicide in a week in New York City involving domestic violence. Two other women were stabbed to death by their abusive husbands, who then killed themselves, the police said. One of the men also killed his 5-year-old daughter, according to the police.
The violence in Brooklyn on Sunday afternoon unfolded in a second-floor apartment on a stretch of Utica Avenue in the Flatlands neighborhood, where small apartment buildings and townhouses sit near a scrap yard and a tire shop.
Three loud bangs startled a neighbor, who recognized the sounds as gunfire and called 911, the police said.
On Sunday evening, Utica Avenue was blocked off to traffic as one or two police officers stood outside the building, whose entrance was surrounded by police tape.
Ms. Duncan and Mr. Solomon had previously lived together in the apartment, the police said. It was unclear how long ago that arrangement ended.
The owner of a hair salon under the apartment, Alison Wilkinson, said that she was shocked and saddened to learn of the violence but that she was grateful her business had been closed.
"Thank God for that," she said.
Domestic violence has long been a problem for the police, who say they often have no warning about such strife before it leads to violence. Complaints of domestic violence preceded about one in six such killings this year, the police said in September.
Police officials say the vast majority of domestic violence goes unreported.
Officers respond to about 230,000 such cases each year in New York City -- the equivalent of more than 600 calls a day, according to the Police Department. Yet in 2018, victims and witnesses filed just 86,184 complaints, according to city data.
A police spokesman did not know whether officers had responded to prior domestic disputes involving the gunman on Sunday.
In another case this week, the police said they did not know of trouble between a Harlem couple in the middle of a divorce before the husband, Yonathan Tedla, 46, slit the throats of his wife and their 5-year-old-daughter on Thursday. But the woman, Jennifer Schlecht, had obtained an order of protection in 2016 against her husband, who hanged himself in a closet, relatives said.
And Dineshwar Budhidat, 33, killed his wife at his Queens home on Friday before hanging himself from a tree, the police said. The victim, Donne Dojoy, 27, had an order of protection against her husband stemming from his arrest in August after hitting and choking her. She was visiting him when she was killed, the police said.
Ms. Dojoy had told her friends that her husband abused her and that he was jealous of her infatuation with a Bollywood star, The New York Post reported.
The killings add to a grim toll that has fluctuated over the years but appeared to be declining in 2019. At the end of October, murders stemming from domestic violence had decreased to 44 from 52 during the same period in 2018.
Nearly 600 New Yorkers were killed in domestic violence episodes from 2010 to 2018, according to an annual city report. Almost 50 of them -- nearly all of them women -- were killed by a partner who then took his or her own life, the report said.
The police developed a strategy last year to rely on tips from victims and witnesses to find abusers' guns. Officials say it has resulted in the seizure of 126 illegal firearms so far this year. But even without firearms, abusers have found other ways to kill.

David Leonhardt: American big business is overcharging you

Texto completo: When Thomas Philippon moved to Boston from his native France 20 years ago, he was a graduate student on a budget, and he was happy to discover how cheap American telephone use was. In those days of dial-up internet connections, going online involved long local phone calls that could cost more than $10 apiece in France. In the United States, they were virtually free.
Philippon eventually got a doctorate in economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and decided to stay here. He’s now a professor at New York University. And over the years, he has noticed something surprising about his adopted country: Internet usage is no longer a good deal.
Today, his parents pay about 90 euros (or $100) a month in the Paris suburbs for a combination of broadband access, cable television and two mobile phones. A similar package in the United States usually costs more than twice as much.
Figuring out why has become a core part of Philippon’s academic research, and he offers his answer in a fascinating new book, “The Great Reversal: How America Gave Up on Free Markets.” In one industry after another, he writes, a few companies have grown so large that they have the power to keep prices high and wages low. It’s great for those corporations — and bad for almost everyone else.
Many Americans have a choice between only two internet providers. The airline industry is dominated by four large carriers. Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google are growing ever larger. One or two hospital systems control many local markets. Home Depot and Lowe’s have displaced local hardware stores. Regional pharmacy chains like Eckerd and Happy Harry’s have been swallowed by national giants.
Other researchers have also documented rising corporate concentration. Philippon’s biggest contribution is to explain that it isn’t some natural result of globalization and technological innovation. If it were, the trends would be similar around the world. But they’re not. Big companies have become only slightly larger in Europe this century — rather than much larger, as in the United States.
What explains the difference? Politics.
The European economy certainly has its problems, but antitrust policy isn’t one of them. The European Union has kept competition alive by blocking mergers and insisting that established companies make room for new entrants. In telecommunications, smaller companies often have the right to use infrastructure built by the giants. That’s why Philippon’s parents can choose among five internet providers, including a low-cost company that brought down prices for everyone.
In air travel, European discount carriers like easyJet have received better access to the gate slots they need to operate. The largest four European airlines control only about 40% of the market. In the United States, that share is 80%, and, as you’d expect, airfares are higher. Even Southwest Airlines has begun to behave less like a low-fare carrier.
The irony is that Europe is implementing market-based ideas — like telecommunications deregulation and low-cost airlines — that Americans helped pioneer. “EU consumers are better off than American consumers today,” Philippon writes, “because the EU has adopted the U.S. playbook, which the U.S. itself has abandoned.”
The European Union has created an impressively independent competition agency that’s willing to block mergers, like General Electric-Honeywell and Siemens-Alstom. In the United States, the process is more political, and companies spend vastly more money on campaign donations and lobbying. Lobbyists — and, by extension, regulators — justify mergers with dubious theories about money-saving efficiencies. Somehow, though, the efficiencies usually end up raising profits rather than lowering prices.
Whirlpool’s 2006 purchase of Maytag is a good example. The Justice Department rationalized the deal partly by predicting that foreign appliance-makers would keep the combined company from raising prices. But Whirlpool later successfully lobbied for tariffs to keep out foreign rivals. Washers, dryers and dishwashers have all become more expensive.
The consolidation of corporate America has become severe enough to have macroeconomic effects. Profits have surged, and wages have stagnated. Investment in new factories and products has also stagnated, because many companies don’t need to innovate to keep profits high. Philippon estimates that the new era of oligopoly costs the typical American household more than $5,000 a year.
It’s a problem that should inspire bipartisan action. Some solutions feel conservative: reducing licensing requirements and other bureaucratic rules that hamper startups. Others feel progressive: blocking mergers, splitting up monopolies and forcing big business to share infrastructure.
There are signs that the politics of antitrust are shifting. Several Republicans, like Sen. Josh Hawley, now talk about the issue, and many Democrats — not just Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, but also Amy Klobuchar — do too.
But we have a long way to go. Too often, both parties are still confusing the interests of big business with the national interest. And American families are paying the price.

The police developed a strategy last year to rely on tips from victims and witnesses to find abusers' guns. Officials say it has resulted in the seizure of 126 illegal firearms so far this year. But even without firearms, abusers have found other ways to kill.

Texto completo: In the seventh grade, New York Times bestselling author Karen White played hooky from school one time only, and that was because she was deeply entranced in reading "Gone With the Wind."
"I hid on the rooftop of our building and just read and read. But I never had any dream of being a writer, not then and not ever," says White. In fact, she remembers "hating" writing fiction "because my thoughts were always 10 pages ahead of my handwriting, and I'd get so frustrated."
Her sentiment changed in 1996. She was 32 and living in Alpharetta with husband Tim White, a banker, and their children, Meghan and Connor, then 4 and 2, respectively. She had just finished reading the first three titles in Diana Gabaldon's Outlander series, a romantic-fantasy-adventure saga about a 20th-century British nurse who time travels to 18th-century Scotland.
"(They)completely transported me to another place and time so that after reading for a while, I would look up and be surprised to find myself in my suburban Atlanta home," says White, who now lives in Milton. "They were the kind of books we all long for because the luscious writing and characters completely absorb the reader. I had a very bad book hangover after those books. Nothing else would do, so I decided to try and write my own. I wanted to see if I could create that kind of a book hangover."
Four years later, she published her debut novel, "In the Shadow of the Moon," a time-traveling romantic fantasy set in Civil War Georgia.
"I found books as a reader, but the writing found me."
And how. White has published 26 romance novels in 19 years.Her latest, published last month, is "The Christmas Spirits on Tradd Street," the sixth title in her popular Tradd Street series set in Charleston, South Carolina. A romantic-mystery series with paranormal elements, it features Melanie Middleton, a Charleston real estate agent who specializes in historic homes. About halfway through the series, Melanie becomes a Trenholm when she marries dashing, bestselling author Jack Trenholm.
Launched in 2008, the Tradd Street series involves ongoing ghostly encounters and various mysteries involving stately old homes and Charleston of yesteryear. In the latest Tradd Street book, Jack's career has taken a nose dive, triggering Melanie's need to fix everything while she grapples with the emotional wounds of her past. Plans for an important holiday fundraiser involving the Tradd house have everyone in a tizzy. Meanwhile, the Colonial-era cistern in the backyard is being excavated amid rumors of a long-lost treasure.
White is a wildly prolific writer, but year upon year, her novels have become less heart-fluttery lightsome and more multilayered, as she's beefed up the historical research.
"I'm endlessly fascinated by how the past influences the present," she says.
White calls her style "grit lit." It often drips with descriptions of Spanish moss and Southern ways and witticisms. There are plenty of "bless her hearts"and myriad descriptions of sticky heat. But she also creates believable characters that contend with everyday problems, like Melanie, the keeper of secrets on Tradd Street.
"(Readers) relate to her," says White. "She's juggling a lot. She's trying to come through for everyone. She's got all the typical insecurities, and she doesn't always make the right choices."
Of all her characters, White is most like Melanie, she says.
"She tends to think like me. She's flawed, but flawed is interesting. Perfect is boring."
Like Melanie, who's an over-the-top control freak, White loves her label gun. And they both have a weakness for donuts.
And while White doesn't see ghosts like Melanie does, she believes in "the aura of ghosts" and houses that have souls.
"I don't think it's out of the realm of reality to think that a house can't be witness to its own history. To some extent, I think that houses can absorb some of the human emotions their walls have held."
Born Karen Elizabeth Sconiers in Tulsa, Oklahoma, White moved often as a child and sometimes lived abroad, thanks to her father's job as an executive with Exxon. But every summer she spent time with relatives in Indianola, Mississippi, which helped inform her fiction. She describes fond memories of "sitting around my grandmother's table with my mother and her sisters and cousins and just all that they would talk about, and how they talked and how they moved."
After earning a business degree from Tulane University, White worked as a media buyer for an advertising agency, then as an operations manager for a software development company. Karen and Tim met at Wimbledon. After they married, they moved to Georgia in 1992.
White describes herself as "a seat-of-your-pants writer. I'm not a plotter. I start with my main character and what her conflicts are, and then I just go."
She says she approaches each book as a reader.
"Do I want to read a book if I know how it ends? Who does? It's scary as hell, just to start going, but that's what works for me," she says.
White writes seven days a week. Her favorite place to work is on her screened-in back porch, but she says she can write anywhere. She's composed in emergency rooms while waiting on loved ones. When Tim's in the driver's seat en route to their new beach house in Florida, she taps away.
The South Carolina Low-country has provided endless inspiration.White has set many of her books around there, including "On Folly Beach" (2010)and "The Time Between" (2013).
"I love its ambience, architecture, its lore and secrets, its grace and gentility -- and yes, it's ghosts,"White says.
"The Night the Lights Went Out" (2017) is her only novel set in the Atlanta area. A crafty blend of heartache, humor and intrigue, it follows newly divorced mom Merilee Dunlap and her eccentric 94-year-old landlord, Sugar Prescott. The Star News in Wilmington, North Carolina, called it a "chick-lit thriller" with shades of "Steel
Magnolias" and "Gone Girl."
White's output also includes two meaty yarns co-written with fellow bestselling scribes Beatriz Williams and Lauren Willig: "The Forgotten Room" (2016) and "The Glass Ocean" (2018). In January, this same "Team W" trio will release a third collaboration, "All the Ways We Said Goodbye," that jumps from between the two World Wars to the 1960s, with Paris' legendary Ritz hotel as a common setting.
White relished the chance to collaborate again with Williams and Willig, who live in Connecticut and Manhattan, respectively.
Their collaborative writing process is quite different from White's solo process, in which "you just hear crickets in response to the questions you're asking yourself," she says.
The three authors go on a spa vacation together and between facials and such, they decide the plot twists and turns and figure out which one of them will create which characters. Then they return to their homes and begin writing chapters round robin-style. Publicists boast that readers can't tell which author has written which chapter. And just like Melanie of Tradd Street, White plans to keep that a secret.

Texto completo: Gilbert Cruz, who heads up the arts department as Culture editor and is sad that Halloween month is behind us, shares a few of his favorites.
THEATER
American Utopia
David Byrne's new Broadway show, which is basically a concert that alternates between Talking Heads classics and the singer's solo work, takes place on a mostly bare stage. Just Byrne and his band (everyone -- the keyboardist, the drummers -- wears their instruments) marching around, and it's mesmerizing. There was a moment when everyone around me leapt to their feet at the beginning of "Burning Down the House" that was so joyous I wanted to experience it again immediately.
BOOK
Catch and Kill
Ronan Farrow's account of his investigation into Harvey Weinstein, for which he shared a Pulitzer Prize with The New York Times's Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey, is gripping. But -- and I cannot stress this enough -- the audiobook version might be the best way to experience it. Farrow narrates and does actual voices for Israeli agents, European actresses, British journalists and (make of it what you will) his estranged father Woody Allen.
CLASSICAL
Knoxville: Summer of 1915
I'd never heard this piece, in which an essay by the writer James Agee is sung over a yearning Samuel Barber composition, before seeing Kelli O'Hara do it with the New York Philharmonic this fall. It taps into simple feelings about childhood and family -- I cried then, and I listen to it often now. Read Agee's piece while listening to it for the first time for the full effect.
FILM
Candyman
Look, I know Halloween is over, but I'd been meaning to rewatch "Candyman," the 1992 adaptation of a short story by "Hellraiser" writer and director Clive Barker, for years. It's currently on Netflix and is as creepy and weird and gross as I recall. The voice of Tony Todd, who plays the hook-handed titular character, lingers.
ART
"Playtime " at MoMA
A good deal of pleasure to be had at the Museum of Modern Art, which recently reopened after expanding its footprint and reshuffling its collection, comes from new and interesting juxtapositions. For example, you can walk into one gallery and catch a scene from Jacques Tati's architecture-obsessed film "Playtime" through a triptych of blue-tinted windows from the United Nations Secretariat Building. It's a combination both as natural and as playful as the best of Tati.

Despiden a fiscal de Houston que no investigó un caso de asalto sexual porque creía que la víctima era “ilegal”

Texto completo: Un fiscal asistente del condado de Harris, Texas, fue despedido este viernes tras rechazar investigar un caso de intento de agresión sexual a un preso de una cárcel por considerar que la víctima era un inmigrante ilegal.
Kim Ogg, la fiscal de este condado, en el que se incluye Houston, anunció que tomó la decisión de cesar al funcionario después de que se llevara a cabo una investigación interna. “Preguntar a una víctima acerca de su estatus migratorio está mal, va en contra de nuestras políticas y no podemos tolerarlo”, afirmó en un comunicado.
Los hechos ocurrieron en la noche de Halloween, según The New York Times. Un preso de una cárcel de la metrópoli texana desnudó su miembro e intentó acercarse a otro detenido contra su voluntad, lo que hizo que la víctima gritara pidiendo ayuda.
Un policía intervino y separó a los dos hombres. Después, denunció lo acontecido a la oficina de la Fiscalía del condado de Harris. El agente creía que se abriría una investigación por intento de agresión sexual y que se aplicara ese cargo al presunto autor, un hombre arrestado por supuestamente conducir ebrio.
Pero las cosas no fueron así. El fiscal asistente John Denholm, quien recibió la denuncia del agente, le preguntó si la víctima era un inmigrante regular o no y si estaba dispuesto a testificar.
El policía le dijo que no le parecía una información relevante, pero alegó que el agredido parecía ser de México. Denholm entonces rechazó la denuncia al pensar que se tratara de un indocumentado.
El caso salió a la luz tras la denuncia de un sindicato y generó gran alboroto en Houston, una ciudad con fuerte presencia de hispanos y donde la policía considera una prioridad evitar cuestionar a víctimas y testigos sobre su condición migratoria. Como explica The Washington Post, un policía presentó la demanda ante otro fiscal. Denholm fue reasignado a otras tareas.
Pero dos sindicatos de funcionarios de aplicación de la ley, al menos un legislador estatal y la Liga de Ciudadanos Latinoamericanos Unidos, un grupo nacional de defensa de los latinos, pidieron el despido del fiscal al considerar insuficiente que se le reasignara o se determinara una sanción disciplinaria contra él. El viernes, la fiscal Ogg decidió escuchar estas criticas.
Denholm trabajaba en la oficina de la Fiscalía del condado de Harris desde enero de 2017. Anteriormente estuvo de teniente de la Oficina del Alguacil del mismo condado. El presidente de una organización de agentes locales indicó al Houston Cronicle que ya en otras ocasiones Denholm rechazó casos y tuvo encontronazos con funcionarios de aplicación de la ley.
En un email de este viernes, el ya ex fiscal asistente dijo al Post que sabía quién había formulado las acusaciones que llevaron a su despido y pareció dar a entender que la versión de la policía sobre este caso era incorrecta.

Divide between Santa Fe, Carlsbad need not be wide

Texto completo: In the article titled "New Mexico's Oil Boom: Bounty for One of the Country's Poorest States," the New York Times wildly missed the mark. As a longtime resident of New Mexico who lives in Santa Fe and has worked in our oil and gas producing areas, it was infuriating to see our complex state reduced to snide comments and shockingly reductive representations of the rich dynamics in our state – especially given that the topic is so serious. We're fighting for the future of New Mexico's air, land and water at a time when the very fabric of our economy is changing. The Times is wrong to focus only on the divide between the northern and southern parts of our state – without accurately representing either group.
For three years, CAVU has worked to build bridges between environmental and oil and gas communities by focusing on what unites us. The purpose of this work is to decrease the divisions in our state – whether they be between urban and rural, southern and northern – and increase understanding.
The Times article quotes organizations in NM that focus on utilities and do not work directly on oil and gas issues. These groups are specifically geared toward reducing greenhouse gases from our utilities. We can't address only one piece of the puzzle. What about transportation, plastics and other aspects of our economy that will – for better or worse – be relying on oil and gas for decades?
There is a fundamental question we as environmental organizations need to ask ourselves. How do we work to address climate change while also benefiting from the oil and gas industry? The fact remains that the oil and gas industry makes significant contributions to our state's budget. We need to diversify our economy to ensure varied and stable sources of income. In order to do so, we need to leverage this oil and gas boom to bring all of us into the 21st century.
Furthermore, it is incredibly important to give respect to the men and women who work in the oil and gas fields. They work long and hard hours in rough conditions, usually away from their families, living in so called "man camps" because there isn't enough housing for them or their families. While those of us that work on climate change want to see our state move forward to a clean energy economy, these people will continue to do what they see as a meaningful service for our country.
We need to remember that in order to make meaningful and lasting change, we need to be willing to see people who disagree with us as people – not objects of an opposing view. When the Times says that people in Lea and Eddy counties feel that we in Santa Fe don't care or understand them, I don't blame them. But their feelings are aimed at the wrong people.
The New Mexico Oil and Gas Association (NMOGA) has an incredible opportunity to be a leader in innovative technological advances that could make a BIG difference in the venting, leaking and flaring of methane – the most potent greenhouse gas resulting from oil and gas operations. NMOGA could loudly and proudly support the governor's process for developing statewide, comprehensive methane rules and acknowledge the benefits of doing so. If their goal is to be part of the change New Mexicans want, they could choose to leverage their influence to bring people together, rather than to widen the divide. Thanks to Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, who has made it a priority to bring people together, collaboration is happening right now. For our state to truly benefit, we must move beyond the finger pointing and really start doing the exciting work of making our oil and gas communities safer and integrated into our state and our future. I encourage the New York Times to dig deeper next time to tell the bigger story or explore what we can do to bridge the divide. There's so much more here.

Texto completo: Former New York Mets general manager Sandy Alderson was frustrated when he called Citrus Countys library office Wednesday morning.

He had read about local commissioners saying they would not pay $2,700 for digital subscriptions to the New York Times for 70,000 library cardholders. Fake news, the commissioners had said, professing their support for President Donald Trump.

Fine, Alderson thought. Ill pay for it.

Honestly (I) was outraged by the attempt to censor responsible journalism, and the idea of not making the New York Times or frankly any newspaper available to library members was ridiculous, said Alderson, who lives in St. Petersburg and is a special adviser for the Oakland As. He said he reads the New York Times and considers himself an independent voter. He declined to say whether he voted for President Trump. The people at the library, he said, made note of his name and said they would get back to him.

Im sure there are many people who felt the same way, Alderson said.

He was right.

Citrus County has received so many emails about the controversy that its computer servers temporarily crashed, according to spokeswoman Cynthia Oswald.

Never happened to little Citrus County before, she said. Nothing like it.

Word of the commissions decision took off with help from Trump himself as he shared stories on Twitter about the move and subsequent backlash.

For several days following the councils Oct. 24 meeting, commissioners received a relative trickle of feedback, mostly from residents. Some of those emails are excerpted below, just as they were written.

Thank you for canceling the NYT (New York Lies), its at the top of the list for fake news, wrote a man from Crystal River.

Commissioner Scott Carnahan, who had spoken most strongly against the New York Times, replied: Your very welcome and with a price tag of $2700 dollars a year is outrageous. Plus we have enough fake news in this country.

Not everyone was so supportive.

Mr. Carnahan, you in particular, stated that you did not want the New York Times in this county. Should we expect some goons will come to our house to check our devices? Are you that afraid? a couple from Lecanto wrote. Ugh. Anyone who fears knowledge should not hold public office. You are not leaders, gentlemen. What a shame.

Carnahan responded, I made my decision solely on fiscal responsibility. Its not the taxpayers responsibility to pay $2700 for a online publication. They can use this money in other place to enhance our great library system.

When the Tampa Bay Times and Washington Post picked up the story from the Citrus County Chronicle, the debate ratcheted up even more. The conversation in the commissioners inboxes devolved.

Shame on you! more than one person wrote.

Kiss my tourism dollars goodbye. Youre nothing more then redneck a*******. Dont bother f****** replying, turds, another wrote.

Oswald said the countys tourism office has received emails from people threatening to stop visiting Citrus. An author who writes about sports car racing called the commissioners actions disgraceful and said, I am encouraging people NOT travel to your county via my social media sites.

One person didnt explicitly mention the controversy but wrote: Now that I have to boycott Citrus County, and cant return to the beautiful Homosassa, where is the next best place to see manatees?

Oswald responded: Citrus County is the only place to swim with manatees. You can see manatees in other areas of Florida in areas where the water temp. is warmer than the ocean in the winter. If I can be of further assistance please let me know.

Amid the growing anger, out-of-town residents looked for ways to send money.

Two GoFundMe pages raised a combined $6,179 from 222 donors for the Citrus County Library System by late Wednesday. Oswald said other people have called to offer direct contributions.

I am a Librarian, wrote a user named Laurie Charnigo, who donated $30 to one of the GoFundMe fundraisers. We do not select materials or deselect materials based on a political view. A robust library with ALL types of information and all resources made available to our citizens is central to a healthy democracy.

The libraries normally accept donations, Oswald said, but they have never seen this kind of rush. Administrators dont know what to do.

Eric Head, director of the system, explained his standard response to people in an email to another county official Oct. 29.

Ive informed them that currently we do not have this subscription available, however the Friends (of the Library) appreciate any and all donations, Head wrote.

In separate messages, he said the system spends $8,909 a year on print-only newspaper subscriptions, including $981 for the Citrus County Chronicle; $1,664 for the Tampa Bay Times; $2,990 for the New York Times; $1,882 for the Wall Street Journal; and $1,392 for USA Today.

The librarys board, Oswald said, will discuss how to spend donated funds at a meeting Nov. 14. Five days later, the county commissioners will once again take up the digital subscription issue and possibly vote on their next step.

Texto completo: "Every generation blames the one before." -- Mike + The Mechanics
So I guess "OK Boomer" is a thing now. And I gather I'm supposed to be offended by it. Certainly, some people seem to be.
The saying -- a dismissive eye roll from Generation Z to their elders -- is suddenly all the rage. It appears on hoodies, headlines, tweets and memes, this catch-all response to old folks' nonstop nagging and criticism. Some members of the Baby Boom generation are not amused.
Maureen Dowd of The New York Times sees it as "intergenerational war." Steve Cuozzo of The New York Post says the young ones "really, really hate us." Bob Lonsberry, a conservative radio host, declared "boomer" -- no joke -- "the n-word of ageism."
Granted, these are media types -- not real people -- so we should be careful about generalizing. I, for one, can't say I really feel "hate" from young folks. But to whatever degree I should be taking this seriously -- "You darn kids, get off my internet!" -- I find that I can't.
I keep laughing instead.
It strikes me as funny that some in my generation, which defined itself by an insolent rejection of the old, are traumatized by a younger generation's insolent rejection of us. Am I the only one who remembers when the hippies warned, "Don't trust anyone over 30?" Does no one else recall when Pete Townshend sneered, "Hope I die before I get old"?
Then how dare any of us clutch our pearls over a little intergenerational sniping? Besides, it's not as if the kids don't have a point. Our record is certainly mixed.
I'd say our music was better than theirs, but they have better television -- and more of it -- than we could've dreamt. Boomers made great strides in civil rights for black people, women and the LGBTQ. But we dropped the ball on climate change, failed to address a rigged financial system. And we -- the white cohort of us at least -- bear blame for the catastrophe of Trump. We deserve both credit and castigation. Every generation does -- even the "Greatest."
When I was a kid, I used to tease this old man in the neighborhood for being an old man in the neighborhood. "Keep a'livin'," he'd always retort. And I did. And here I am, just turned 62 and wondering how the heck that happened. The Gen Z kids will too soon enough wonder the selfsame thing. The big wheel keeps on turning.
Usually that confers perspective and context, the soil from which wisdom grows. But you couldn't prove that by these overwrought responses to young people's taunts.
I'm remembering teenage battles with my mom as I write this. As it happens, I've got Nat King Cole playing in the background. He was mom's end-all and be-all. She didn't want to hear any noise from my room about P-Funk getting funked up, Papa being a rolling stone or midnight trains to Georgia. As far as she was concerned, music stopped when King Cole died. I got sick of hearing his name, scorned him on general principle.
But I remember one day mom deigned to listen to the Stylistics with me. Afterward, she sniffed that "Betcha By Golly Wow" was actually a pretty song to have such a silly title. It was a backhanded compliment, but I felt vindicated by it just the same. I doubt she needed my vindication -- adults didn't need that from kids back then. Still, somewhere in the intervening decades, I decided Cole wasn't so bad either. I just had to learn how to hear him -- and I did.
So the kids may "OK" this Boomer to their heart's content. Because as they will eventually discover, that old man in my neighborhood was right.
Keep a'livin' indeed.

Just three of the last seven Democratic presidential nominees led national polls at this point

Texto completo: Three months out from the first 2020 primary season contests, Joe Biden leads the Democratic pack in most polls, followed closely by Elizabeth Warren, with rivals like Pete Buttigieg further back.
But that may not last, according to recent political history.
Only three of the last seven Democratic presidential nominees led national primary polls in November or December before primary contests began. And all three had much larger leads than Biden’s current 7.2% lead over Warren in the RealClearPolitics average of primary polls.
“We have never had a candidate who was ahead in the polls this far out who has ever gone on to be president,” Democratic presidential hopeful and New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, who is stuck in the low single digits in most national polls, said in September.
“The candidates that win from our party that energize the kind of movement elections we want to see are folks that were considered long shots at this point. Carter, Bill Clinton, Barack Obama were all behind,” Booker said.
Most recently, Hillary Clinton led the Democratic field through the entirety of her 2016 campaign, and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, her most serious challenger, never passed her in RealClearPolitics’ polling average. She led Sanders by more than 20 points in November 2015.
Vice President Al Gore was the next most recent longtime front-runner to become the Democratic presidential nominee. He consistently led presidential primary polls by double digits throughout 1999, with a November Gallup poll finding him at 58% and closest competitor former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley at 33%.
Former vice president and 1984 presidential nominee Walter Mondale held a decent lead over John Glenn and large lead over Colorado Sen. Gary Hart for the entirety of 1983. Mondale polled in the mid-40% range with Ohio Sen. Glenn in the low 20s and Hart in the single digits that November, according to a 2008 paper examining primary polling data.
Other Democratic presidential primary races in recent history were more dramatic, with the eventual nominee trailing in the polls in the months before the Iowa caucuses.
Having gained name recognition from his 1984 bid, Hart launched his 1988 presidential campaign as the front-runner, dropped out after his campaign was derailed by accusations of an extramarital affair, and then reentered the race in December and regained front-runner status. A December 1987 New York Times/CBS national poll had him a 21%, Rev. Jesse Jackson at 17%, and Gov. Michael Dukakis at 9%. Dukakis came in third in the Iowa Caucuses, won the New Hampshire primary, and eventually became the Democratic presidential nominee.
In the 1992 race, New York Gov. Mario Cuomo led in national polls throughout 1991 despite never launching a presidential campaign, but polling among declared candidates showed a much tighter race. Former (and future) California Gov. Jerry Brown had a 13% average while eventual nominee Bill Clinton and other candidates polled in the single digits, according to FiveThirtyEight. Arkansas Gov. Clinton placed second in the New Hampshire primary but did not start to consistently win state primary contests until mid-March 1992.
John Kerry, the eventual 2004 Democratic presidential nominee, consistently came in fourth or fifth place in national Democratic presidential polls conducted in November 2003. Former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean was the front-runner at the time, but negative campaigning between him and Missouri Rep. Dick Gephardt took a toll on both campaigns, making way for Kerry to win Iowa and nearly all state nominating contests.
Barack Obama was behind Hillary Clinton in the polls for the entirety of 2007 — by more than 20 points in November of that year, according to RealClearPolitics’ average. The Illinois senator didn’t catch up to his Senate colleague from New York in the national polling average until after winning the Iowa Caucuses.
The tight, volatile races give mid and bottom-tier candidates hope that they can gain traction in the final weeks or months of the campaign, either with a “breakout moment” or by capitalizing off competitors’ stumbles and surging.
Early state polls rather than national polls may provide a clearer indication of changing voter preferences. University of New Hampshire professors Dante J. Scala and Andrew E. Smith found in their 2008 paper that "New Hampshire polls, conducted in a state where voters receive far more news about the candidates and pay a great deal of attention to the campaign, are much more sensitive to changes in the dynamics of the nomination contest than national surveys."
Biden is currently in fourth place behind Warren, Buttigieg, and Sanders in RealClearPolitics' average of Iowa polls. He is in second place behind Warren in its average of New Hampshire polls.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – In a new book, an anonymous staff member to President Donald Trump – and self-proclaimed member of the anti-Trump "resistance" – says he is unfit for office, and that colleagues considered mass resignations and the 25th Amendment to try and remove him.
Trump is "like a twelve-year-old in an air traffic control tower, pushing the buttons of government indiscriminately, indifferent to the planes skidding across the runway and the flights frantically diverting away from the airport," says the book entitled “A Warning” by the author dubbed Anonymous, according to news reports.
The Washington Post, which obtained an early copy, says the book "paints a chilling portrait of the president as cruel, inept and a danger to the nation he was elected to lead," and depicts him "making misogynistic and racist comments behind the scenes. "
The book is scheduled for publication Nov. 19. The Post writes that the writer is "a senior official in the Trump administration. "

White House officials are pushing back against the book's claims, emphasizing the fact that the author has chosen to remain in the shadows.
"The coward who wrote this book didn’t put their name on it because it is nothing but lies," said White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham. "Real authors reach out to their subjects to get things fact checked – but this person is in hiding, making that very basic part of being a real writer impossible. "
Grisham described the book as "a work of fiction. "
The Post reports that the author wrote anonymously because "this debate is not about me,” before continuing, “It is about us. It is about how we want the presidency to reflect our country, and that is where the discussion should center. Some will call this ‘cowardice. ’ My feelings are not hurt by the accusation. Nor am I unprepared to attach my name to criticism of President Trump. I may do so, in due course. ”
Vice President Mike Pence disputed one of the book's major claims: That staff members believed Pence would have joined them in a bid to invoke the 25th Amendment, which outlines the process for removal and succession of a president who is deemed disabled.
“I never heard anything in my time as Vice President about the 25th amendment. And why would I?” Pence told reporters.
He called the book's claims "appalling. "
Prison guards: Federal prison guards falsified records of cell checks, inmate counts
The Post reported that the book reflects many concerns about the president's mental state.
“I am not qualified to diagnose the president’s mental acuity,” the author writes, according to the Post. "All I can tell you is that normal people who spend any time with Donald Trump are uncomfortable by what they witness. He stumbles, slurs, gets confused, is easily irritated, and has trouble synthesizing information, not occasionally but with regularity. Those who would claim otherwise are lying to themselves or to the country. ”
The book says that staff members considered a mess resignation last year, but decided it would only further destabilize an already struggling government, the Post reported.
Anonymous first became known with a September 2018 column in The New York Times entitled "I Am Part of the Resistance Inside the Trump Administration. "
In that piece, the Trump staffer said that "many of the senior officials in his own administration are working diligently from within to frustrate parts of his agenda and his worst inclinations. "
In the book, Anonymous says the column was wrong about the "quiet resistance" within the Trump administration.
"Unelected bureaucrats and cabinet appointees were never going to steer Donald Trump the right direction in the long run, or refine his malignant management style," the authwrites, per The Post. "He is who he is. ”

In its review of Anonymous' book, The New York Times said the book lacks specificity in many cases: "Any revealing details have been explicitly and deliberately withheld to protect this person’s identity. Who is this 'me' that we’re supposed to trust?"
Earlier this month, the Trump Department of Justice sent a letter to the Anonymous book's publishers, claiming the author might be violating nondisclosure agreements signed by administration officials. The publisher and the author's agents described the letter as an intimidation attempt.

Texto completo: With a year to go before the 2020 election, some national polls show Donald Trump facing daunting, double-digit deficits in his re-election bid.
But the polling in Wisconsin and other swing states paints a far more competitive picture.
Can both be right?
The gap between Trump's worst national polls and his best battleground polls is so big it simply doesn't add up.
But it also reflects something very real about the political landscape: that nationwide surveys don't always capture what's happening in the handful of states most likely to determine the Electoral College winner.
Wisconsin is a prime example. It is at the top of the list of pivotal battlegrounds in the eyes of most analysts, suggesting that public opinion here shouldn't deviate all that much from what it is nationally. Yet Trump has performed consistently better in Wisconsin than he has in nationwide polls.
The president is averaging in the low 40s in job approval in national surveys.
But in Wisconsin, he is at 46% approval in a Marquette Law School poll released two weeks ago, 47% in a New York Times/Siena poll released Monday, 44% in a Fox News poll released last month, and 42% in a poll just released by the Kaiser Family Foundation and Cook Political Report. Trump's average job approval in those four surveys is 45%, far from stellar but not crippling to his re-election prospects either.
"I think the battleground polls are more meaningful" than the national polls, said Diane Feldman, a longtime Democratic pollster who has conducted many surveys in Wisconsin.
The seeming disconnect between national surveys and battleground surveys was highlighted this week when the New York Times published polls showing Trump either tied, narrowly behind or narrowly ahead of his best-known Democratic rivals in the key states of Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Florida, Arizona and North Carolina.
Takeaway: In the states that matter most, the race is up for grabs.
A day later, a nationwide Washington Post-ABC News poll showed Trump trailing Joe Biden by 17 points, Elizabeth Warren by 15 and Bernie Sanders by 14.
Takeaway: Trump is in dire, dire straits.
"There is a profound disconnect between the state-level polling on the horse race and what we're seeing in the national polling. I don't know whether Joe Biden is up by 17 points nationally or if he's only up a couple of points in Wisconsin, but both can't be true," said political scientist Ken Goldstein, who conducts his own polls in Wisconsin and elsewhere.
Part of the explanation involves different pollsters using different methodologies and capturing different cross-sections of voters with different partisan leanings. Feldman said sometimes national polls oversample the populous coasts, which would skew a survey toward Democrats.
Part of the explanation involves the normal variations in polling that always produce occasional outliers.
But that still leaves the fact that, as the 2016 election showed, the Electoral College picture can deviate from the picture of the nation as a whole. Three years ago, Trump won the decisive battlegrounds of Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania by under 1 point while losing the national vote by 2 points.
If that pattern holds, Democrats might have to win the popular vote by 3 points or more in 2020 to carry the key state battlegrounds they need to win the Electoral College.
Polling since Trump took office reinforces that point.
"In Wisconsin, our (Trump) approval number has been consistently about 3 points higher than his national average," said Charles Franklin, who conducts the Marquette poll. Trump has averaged a little under 46% approval in Wisconsin over the past year in Marquette's polling.
As a result of this gap, anyone focused on the polling in battleground Wisconsin is probably going to get a more competitive picture of the electoral fight than he or she would get from national surveys, where Trump is typically getting approval ratings of 41% to 44% — or, in the case of the Washington-Post-ABC poll, 39%.
"The news this week was unequivocally bad for the White House if you were looking at national polls and unequivocally bad for the Democrats if you were looking at state polls," said Goldstein, a political science professor with the University of San Francisco and before that, the University of Wisconsin-Madison. (The White House also got bad news with the GOP's election setbacks Tuesday, losing legislative control in Virginia and a contest for governor in Kentucky).
"Battleground states are battlegrounds precisely because they're close. We should expect Wisconsin and probably Pennsylvania and North Carolina or Florida and Arizona to be pretty close states," Franklin said.
There have been variations in both the state and national polls. Nationally, an NBC/Wall Street Journal poll shows Trump trailing Biden by 9 points, while Trump's deficit in the Washington Post survey is almost twice as large.
In Wisconsin, a Fox News poll released in early October had Biden leading Trump in Wisconsin by 9 points. The recent Marquette poll had Biden leading by 6. The New York Times/Siena poll had Biden leading by 3.
While the New York Times poll puts Trump's approval here at 47% and Marquette puts it at 46%, the new Kaiser survey puts it at 42%. One thing that could explain these differences is that in the Marquette poll, the mix of Republican and Democratic voters was close to even; in the Kaiser survey, the sample was more Democratic-leaning in its makeup.
But in the case of the state's most frequent poll (by Marquette), Trump's ratings have been remarkably consistent. The president's approval ratings in the last six Marquette polls dating back to October 2018 are: 46, 47, 44, 46, 45 and 46%. Those numbers have deviated even less than you would expect simply from random statistical variation.
Franklin said his numbers are very consistent with the possibility that Trump's true level of approval among all registered voters in Wisconsin hasn't changed at all over the past year.
What do Trump's job ratings in Wisconsin suggest about his prospects of winning the state again?
If you believe that a president's approval rating is highly predictive of the incumbent's share of the vote, that would suggest Trump is at a significant disadvantage in this state right now.
"Every president running for reelection over the last 60 years has received on Election Day a percentage of the popular vote within a point of their job approval number," ABC news analyst Matthew Dowd, a strategist for President George W. Bush who now considers himself an independent, wrote this week.
But some experts believe Trump can and will "overperform" his approval rating, as he over-performed his popularity rating in 2016.
Why? Because so many of his own supporters have such mixed feelings about him personally that it holds down his overall approval rating among people who are happy with key aspects of his performance — such as the economy — and will end up voting for him anyway. Others who dislike Trump may end up disliking the Democratic nominee even more, which happened in 2016.
"He has a vote that goes beyond the voters that approve of him," Feldman said.
Trump's flat approval ratings make it incumbent upon him to drive up the "negatives" of the Democratic nominee, said Ed Goeas, a GOP pollster.
"It's going to be driven by how high the negatives of his opponent are," said Goeas, who doesn't think Trump's approval number is as good a guide to his re-election performance as it has been for past presidents.
"His approval overall is kind of a worst-case scenario for him," he said.
Franklin said the Wisconsin polling suggests "the president's job approval has been consistently net negative, but not enormously so. He has been behind Biden in the (last two Marquette polls) but quite competitive with the other Democrats."
The Marquette pollster said, "it would be wrong to see the state as anything other than close," with Trump still facing an "uphill" battle due to his negative ratings.
"Everyone's obsession with Wisconsin isn't just hype. It's truly competitive," Goldstein said. "Trump is very much in a gray area, where he would be in trouble if this were a pure referendum (on him) but has a chance because it's going to be a choice."
Feldman, the Democratic pollster, said "We are maybe looking at a situation that is more similar to 2016 than (Democrats) would like it to be," meaning a very narrowly decided contest.
If that is true, then after all this time, Wisconsin would be right back where it was in the last election — on a knife's edge.

Lawmakers Ask Why F.A.A. Ignored Safety Experts

Texto completo: The regulator's employees had raised concerns about a rudder system. Now two powerful House members want answers.
Two of the most powerful lawmakers on the House transportation committee demanded Thursday that the Federal Aviation Administration explain why some of its managers overruled the agency's own safety experts during the development of Boeing's 737 Max plane.
Representatives Peter A. DeFazio of Oregon, who is the chairman of the committee, and Rick Larsen of Washington said in a letter to the agency that when F.A.A. employees raised concerns about a set of cables that help control the Max, they were sidelined by agency managers. The cables are part of a rudder system that is separate from the automated software that contributed to two fatal 737 Max accidents.
A New York Times investigation revealed in July that F.A.A. managers had sided with Boeing in a dispute over the cables, deciding not to require the company to change the system, citing the cost.
The letter also notes a different instance in which senior managers at the F.A.A. broke with their own employees' assessment and allowed Boeing to remove lightning protection from part of the 787 Dreamliner.
The episodes suggest that "the F.A.A.'s safety and technical experts are being circumvented or sidelined while the interests of Boeing are being elevated by F.A.A. senior management," Mr. DeFazio and Mr. Larsen wrote.
As the Max was being built, engineers at the F.A.A. who were responsible for approving the plane grew concerned about its new engines, which were bigger and more complex than on previous 737s. They worried that if the engines broke apart during a flight, there was a greater risk that the chunks would sever the cables, which control the plane's rudder. The F.A.A. employees wanted the company to make changes to avoid a potentially catastrophic failure.
But Boeing resisted the change, arguing that it was highly unlikely that an engine would explode midair and damage the cables. Against the advice of six F.A.A. specialists, senior leaders at the regulator decided not to force the company to redesign the cables. An F.A.A. employee later submitted an anonymous complaint about the incident to a safety board inside the agency.
"During meetings regarding this issue the cost to Boeing to upgrade the design was discussed," the engineer wrote in the complaint, which was reviewed by The Times. "The comment was made that there may be better places for Boeing to spend their safety dollars."
In an email Thursday, an F.A.A. spokesman, Lynn Lunsford, said the agency would "respond directly to the chairmen." A Boeing spokesman, Gordon Johndroe, said in a statement that the issues in the letter were "properly considered and addressed by Boeing, thoroughly reviewed with and approved by the F.A.A., and handled in full compliance."
The 737 Max, Boeing's best-selling jet, has been grounded since March after two crashes killed 346 people. Boeing is still working to return the Max to the air. In the aftermath of the two accidents, the F.A.A. has come under scrutiny for its close ties to Boeing and its reliance on the company's employees to determine the safety of new airplanes.
In the letter, the lawmakers also highlighted a second set of safety concerns. They wrote that F.A.A. employees had flagged Boeing's decision to remove from the Dreamliner's wings copper foil designed to protect against lightning strikes.
F.A.A. engineers worried that the change might increase the risk of a fuel tank explosion midair. The agency rejected the new design in February, but by then Boeing had already produced dozens of Dreamliners without the foil on the wings, according to the letter.
The fact that Boeing changed the design before it was approved by the F.A.A. demonstrates "either willful neglect of the federal aviation regulatory structure or an oversight system in need of desperate repair," the lawmakers wrote.
A Boeing employee said the company had discussed the issue with Ali Bahrami, the F.A.A.'s head of safety, according to the letter. Mr. Bahrami previously worked as an industry lobbyist for a trade group that represents Boeing. On March 1, the F.A.A. reversed course, and accepted the new design.
Last month, the regulator asked Boeing to submit more documentation demonstrating the safety of the new design. The lawmakers criticized the regulator's actions as "woefully inadequate to ensure the safety of the flying public."
Taken together, the lawmakers said, the incidents "raise questions about how the agency weighs the validity of safety issues raised by its own experts compared to objections raised by the aircraft manufacturers the F.A.A. is supposed to oversee."

Texto completo: The consumer advocate says she will hold the financial industry accountable for its misdeeds. Also: The F.T.C. and privacy; China's looting of technology; the future of the Catholic Church.
To the Editor:
Re "As Warren Gains in Popularity, Her Anti-Greed Message Has Wall Street Rattled" (front page, Nov. 4):
No wonder that Elizabeth Warren's conservative proposals have Wall Street rattled. She offers comprehensive law and order to bring under control the corporate crime wave, the reckless speculation with "other people's money" and the violations of fiduciary duties to their clients.
For years before and after the 2008 self-inflicted Wall Street crash -- steeped in greed and conflicts of interest -- the undertaxed financial firms have expected immunities and taxpayer bailouts, weaker regulation and diminished disclosures.
What Senator Warren is telling them is that the sheriff is coming to town. The Wall Streeters should not be above the law any longer.

The Federal Trade Commission's Track Record on Privacy To the Editor:
"Does America Need an F.D.A. for Privacy?," by Natasha Singer (news analysis, Sunday Review, Nov. 3), misses the mark in suggesting that the Federal Trade Commission treats privacy as "a side hustle," and that the cure for commercial privacy abuses is a new privacy agency.
The F.T.C. has a proven track record in protecting consumer privacy. We've brought hundreds of privacy cases against companies like Facebook, YouTube, Microsoft, Twitter and Uber, with recent cases generating some of the largest privacy fines in the world.
Our cases have covered everything from stalking apps to smart TVs to connected toys. We've issued 50 reports and held 70 workshops on privacy issues like artificial intelligence, facial recognition, drones and connected cars. Our yearly PrivacyCon event spurs cutting-edge privacy research.
Do we need a federal privacy law in the United States? Absolutely. Do we need more authority and resources, as Ms. Singer suggests? Of course. But the solution to any privacy vacuum is not an untested new bureaucracy that would enter the game in the fourth quarter. The F.T.C. is already a world-class, award-winning privacy agency, despite its limited authority and resources. Imagine what we could do with more.

China, Stealing Our Secrets
To the Editor:
Re "In F.B.I.'s Sights: Stolen Research Flowing to China" (front page, Nov. 4):
Chinese scientists are not just stealing secrets from the National Institutes of Health and the biomedical community. With active support and encouragement from China's central government, the systematic looting of American technologies is occurring on virtually every scientific front inside the United States.
The American scientific community has a major problem on its hands that it has not been able to address: Its open research climate continues to spawn world-class ideas, but the Chinese are stealing ideas and trying to commercialize them before the Americans can, thanks to generous funding from Beijing.
When will America wake up and start defending its secrets?

The Survival of the Catholic Church
To the Editor:
Re "For Bishops, It's Anything but a Woman" (Op-Ed, Oct. 31):
Sara McDougall is on target in pointing out that the Roman Catholic Church is much more ready to have married men as priests than to ordain women. But there is an even deeper problem: clerical control.
Eventually, the church will ordain women if that's the only way to survive institutionally. But turning power over to the laity will be the very last resort. The election of diocesan bishops by local laypeople, for example, is unthinkable.
We see some of the same dynamic in Protestant churches that have ordained women while remaining just as hierarchical as before. Elected lay boards may have significant power in areas like money and property management, although sometimes that power is nominal, with clergy suggesting the most important decisions. But more critical areas -- sermons, liturgy, staffing and defining the church's mission -- are typically controlled by clergy.
The Catholic Church is the most clericalist. To get and deserve lay support, it needs not only to ordain women but also to redistribute power. Protestant churches, while not as hierarchical, also need to much more robustly carry out Martin Luther's view that "we are all consecrated as priests."

Stalking Endangered 200-foot-tall Wax Palm Trees Isn’t As Easy As You Might Suspect

Texto completo: In 1991, Rodrigo Bernal, a botanist who specializes in palms, was driving into the Tochecito River Basin, a secluded mountain canyon in central Colombia, when he was seized by a sense of foreboding.
Two palm experts were in the car with Bernal: his wife, the botanist Gloria Galeano, who worked alongside him at the National University of Colombia in Bogota, and Andrew Henderson, visiting from the New York Botanical Garden. They were chasing the Quindio wax palm, the tallest of the world’s palms.
Wax palms have long intrigued explorers and botanists for their remarkable height, with some reaching 200 feet. Until the giant sequoias of California were discovered, wax palms were believed to be the tallest trees on Earth. A thick wax coats their trunks, something not seen in other palms, and they live where palms aren’t supposed to: on the chilly slopes of the Andes, at elevations as high as 10,000 feet. This has made them notoriously hard to collect and study. “They were these huge, iconic palms no one knew much about,” Henderson said recently.
The Quindio wax palm - the species predominant in Colombia - was named the country’s national tree in 1985, but the distinction came with little protection. Bernal and Galeano warned, in paper after paper, that wax palms were in danger. Many were marooned in pastures and vegetable fields, remnants of forests past. Wax palms cannot reproduce outside a forest: Their seedlings die in full sun, or are eaten by cows and pigs.
In Colombia’s largest known stand of the palms, only a couple of thousand remained. But the scientists had heard that there were hundreds of thousands tucked away in the Tochecito River Basin - making it the world’s biggest wax palm forest, if the rumor proved true. The trouble was that no one could reach the place safely.
The entire canyon, Bernal knew driving in, was controlled by guerrillas with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC. As a field scientist who often found himself in lawless corners of the country, he had encountered armed groups and come away unscathed. But now with Henderson in the car - a foreigner, an easy target for kidnapping - the solitude became terrifying. “I put the car in reverse so quickly I damaged it,” he recalled.
But they had ventured far enough to see and to photograph lush stands of the palms cascading down mountaintops, their pale wax-covered trunks extending like matchsticks from the dark understory. This was the same view that Alexander von Humboldt, the German explorer, had absorbed in 1801. He later described the vista as among the most moving in all his travels: “a forest above a forest, where the tall and slender palms pierce the leafy veil around them.”
Bernal decided that if he couldn’t study Tochecito’s palms, he would have to forget them, “to erase them from my mind.” The Colombian conflict had that effect: it created spaces forbidden even to think about, blank spots on maps and in minds.
To the scientists’ surprise, they were able to return to Tochecito in 2012, after the Colombian army had driven out the FARC. In the guerrillas’ absence, they found, the last giant stands of wax palms faced new and dire threats. Now Bernal and his colleagues are trying to save the palms, and study them at the same time.
‘A place you couldn’t go’
By the time Tochecito became safe to visit again, the scientists had a new collaborator: Maria Jose Sanin, now a botanist at CES University in Medellin. To Sanin, a generation younger than her mentors, Tochecito had been no more than a tantalizing photo they’d snapped on their aborted 1991 trip. “It was always described to me as a place you couldn’t go,” she said.
Most of what is known about wax palms comes from Bernal, Galeano and Sanin, collaborating with one another or with outside researchers. Galeano died of cancer in 2016; since then, the research team, once a trio, has mainly been a duo.
For all Bernal and Sanin have contributed to the science of wax palms, conserving them remains an elusive goal.
Colombia’s only established wax palm sanctuary lies near the coffee-growing town of Jardin. It is run by a bird conservation group that aims to protect the endangered yellow-eared parrot, which nests in wax palm stems. The problem is, the palms must be dead.
“That population of palms is geriatric and massively dying,” Sanin said. “So it’s good for the parrots and the bird watchers, but terrible for botanists.”
In 2012, the scientists mounted an effort to protect some 2,000 wax palms near the town of Salento, in a place popular among tourists, but where there is also heavy cattle grazing and the constant threat of mining. They briefly helped make Salento’s wax palms a cause celebre. But their detailed conservation plan drew little interest from local authorities and landowners.
They soon turned their efforts to the newly accessible Tochecito, which had about half a million palms growing on private land, and fewer owners to win over. The valley had been spared the expansion of grazing and mining that would most likely have occurred had the FARC not isolated it for so long.
In 2016, some 13,000 members of the FARC demobilized after a peace agreement with the Colombian government. Although other armed groups, including some made up of dissident FARC members, remain a threat, the accord opened up whole swaths of the country for agriculture, mining and conservation - with each faction scrambling for priority.
That year, Bernal and Sanin proposed a government-backed palm sanctuary that would protect the entire 32 square miles of the river basin. But after 18 months of “meetings in Bogota, meetings with proprietors, meetings with the ministry of the environment,” Bernal said, most of the Tochecito landowners walked away from the table, feeling that their activities would be too restricted.
Cows aren’t the only threat the palms face; a South African company still hopes to create an enormous open-pit gold mine on the other side of the valley. A local referendum halted work on the project in 2017, but many doubt that it can withstand legal challenges, especially given the firm’s deep pockets and support from Colombia’s national government.
Welcome, tourists
In recent years, a number of rural communities in Colombia have rejected large-scale mining, opting to rely instead on farming and, increasingly, tourism.
Bernal said that in the first years of his return to Tochecito, he saw no visitors. The road that runs through it did not appear on digital maps; impassable for so long under the guerrillas, it had been all but forgotten.
Now Jeeps full of young adventurers, most of them European, travel this road every day. Cycling outfitters haul clients and bicycles to a hilltop farm, allowing them to enjoy striking forest views as they descend.
On an overcast morning in August, Michael Pahle and Teresa Ludde, from Berlin, rested on a grassy bluff, taking in a misty mountainside dense with palms as part of their cycling tour. Pahle later said he thought the more famous palms near Salento appeared “rather scattered and sad” by comparison.
A few landowners have reinvented their properties as wax palm reserves. One charges a modest admission of $1.50 for its views and serves snacks. Another is phasing out its cattle herds and receiving tourists and researchers.
Even still, the specter of mining is never far off. As the scientists drove out of the valley, Sanin noticed holes carved by a backhoe in the high earthen bank flanking the road: evidence of recent prospecting.
Bernal said he believes that the best hope for Tochecito lies in land purchases to create a contiguous chain of private sanctuaries. Just two large tracts harbor a quarter of the palms, he said. With four, most of the forest could be saved.
He stopped his car briefly at the base of the valley, where the FARC encampment used to stand. There was virtually nothing left of it, just remnants of a garden the guerrillas once maintained, in a clearing they’d used as their dance hall.

Texto completo: And cultural giants were lionized by the New York Public Library.
Leave it to actors to nail a Hollywood-themed Halloween party.
The dress code for Bette Midler's annual Hulaween dinner, held last Thursday at the Hilton Midtown, was the golden age of cinema. And so Judith Light channeled Marlene Dietrich, Ben Platt and Beanie Feldstein were Tin Man and Dorothy from "The Wizard of Oz," and David Hyde Pierce came as Cary Grant.
Not everyone got the memo. Wearing slightly off-theme costumes were: Katie Couric, who dressed as Elizabeth Holmes of the Theranos blood-testing scandal; New York State Senator Brad Hoylman, who went as Bill Cunningham, the eulogized fashion and society photographer for The New York Times; and Michael Kors, who wore a gangster outfit festooned with Barbies ("Guys and Dolls," get it?).
Cyndi Lauper began the night as the Jazz Age actress Louise Brooks, sporting a large black chandelier headdress. Later she changed into a gorilla costume, before stripping down to Dietrichesque white-satin tails for a 30-minute set of her hits that brought 700 guests to their feet.
Ms. Midler spent the night vamping in red feathers as Mae West, as attendees dined on chicken potpie and baked alaska. Nearly $ 2 million was raised to benefit the New York Restoration Project, the nonprofit she founded in 1995 to green the city's open spaces.
Honorees included Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta-Jones (who came as Jean Harlow and Lawrence of Arabia); Laurie David, the jet-setting climate activist (Cher); and Ron Delsener, a veteran concert promoter (Rhett Butler).
It seemed like a good opportunity to ask the celebrities if they have had any restoration done on themselves.
"No," Ms. Zeta-Jones said firmly.
"I've had a fair amount done on 75th Street," Mr. Douglas said.
"He's talking about yourself, honey," Ms. Zeta-Jones said. "Your physical appearance."
"Oh," he said. "Well, we're hanging in there."
Ms. Midler said she restores herself by "getting up and dancing to 'Papa Was a Rolling Stone,' every day of my life -- 30 minutes. You try and do it."
Clive Davis, the music executive, came with Joan Collins, who was dressed as a ringmaster with a top hat, fascinator and riding crop. Are there any restoration projects she has considered?
"Mending my face," Ms. Collins said. "But I don't do that."
Overdue Books
Anthony W. Marx, the president of the New York Public Library, was trying to give a speech at the Library Lions gala on Monday night, but the 500 guests were making a ruckus.
Maybe it was the presence of Charlie Rose, the former television host fired by CBS and PBS amid #MeToo allegations, who was a topic of animated gossip.
So Mr. Marx did what countless librarians have done before in the Rose Main Reading Room; he issued a stern "Shhhh."
It worked. In addition to the gala co-chairs (which included Princess Firyal of Jordan, Christine and Stephen A. Schwarzman, and Andrés and Lauren Santo Domingo), the chatty attendees included a cross section of the city's literary (David Remnick, Jay McInerney, Gay and Nan Talese, Calvin Trillin, Joyce Carol Oates), political (Mayor Bill de Blasio, Senator Chuck Schumer) and philanthropic circles (Agnes Gund, Daisy Soros).
There was a performance by Wynton Marsalis, and then medallions were presented to the night's honorees: Elizabeth Alexander, the poet; Jill Lepore, the historian; Jamaica Kincaid, the novelist; and Frederick Wiseman, the documentary filmmaker. A fifth honoree, Philip Glass, the composer, did not attend because of ill health.
After dinner, some of the newly anointed Lions sheepishly admitted to having overdue library books.
"I get a bill every month" for late fines, Ms. Lepore said. "Mostly they're lost books, and I'm convinced I'll find them."
Ms. Kincaid said: "I had to write an encomium for Elizabeth Alexander a few weeks ago, so I took out all her books from the Widener Library at Harvard, and they're all overdue."
Ms. Alexander, however, said she would feel too guilty to keep any overdue books, especially if they were by Ms. Kincaid, whose "gorgeous, lyrical voice," she said, inspired her to start writing poetry.
"I was a poet, but I didn't know it," Ms. Alexander said.
Wait, real poets actually say that?
"Yeah," she said, laughing. "I said it and I meant it."

Texto completo: Sen. Rand Paul says no law can stop him from revealing the identity of the Ukraine whistleblower, whose complaint sparked impeachment proceedings against President Trump.
"There's nothing that prevents me from saying it now, other than that I wanted to be more about the process and less about the person," the Kentucky Republicans during an interview Tuesday. "There's no law that prevents me from mentioning the name of who's been said to be the whistleblower," he added.
Paul, who claims to know the whistleblower's identity, was speaking with Fox News anchor Bret Baier, who noted the speech and debate clause in the Constitution grants lawmakers wide-ranging immunity for things they say on the floor of Congress.
The whistleblower, whom the Washington Examiner has reported is a CIA analyst, was detailed to the National Security Council. The official filed a complaint in August about Trump pressuring Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky during a July phone call to investigate Joe Biden, who is running for president in 2020, in relation to his son Hunter's business dealings in Ukraine. The revelation of this complaint sparked concerns about potential abuse of power and led to impeachment proceedings in the Democrat-controlled House.
Paul argued the whistleblower needs to answer questions as part of the proceedings. "I think he should be interviewed not as the whistleblower, but as a material witness to the Biden corruption in Ukraine," he said.
iFrame Object
Earlier, Paul told reporters he "probably will at some point" identify the whistleblower, which elicited a warning from the whistleblower's legal team who say their client's anonymity is afforded by the law.
"If he does, he will be personally responsible for anything harmful that happens. And let's be clear, @RandPaul will be acting as surrogate for President Trump, making him just as responsible," said attorney Mark Zaid.
Paul has also called on the media to out the whistleblower. At a rally Monday in Kentucky with Trump, the senator exclaimed, "I say tonight to the media, 'Do your job and print his name!'"
But most news outlets have shown no appetite to publish the name, and those that had so far have no confirmation. Not even Fox News host Sean Hannity, an ardent Trump defender who claims to have "multiple confirmations" of the whistleblower's identity, has uttered the name on-air.
“I’m not convinced his identity is important at this point, or at least important enough to put him at any risk, or to unmask someone who doesn’t want to be identified,” New York Times executive editor Dean Baquet told the Washington Post. “Pretty much everything has now been discussed or confirmed on the record, multiple times, by others in the administration. So I’m not sure I see the point of unmasking someone who wants to remain anonymous.”
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer denounced Republicans for making "despicable" demands for the whistleblower be identified. "The whole purpose of the whistleblower law was to protect people when they had the courage to come forward," the New York Democrat said on Tuesday.

Texto completo: Mexico City • The women and their children were taking a drive along a familiar rural road in northern Mexico when the gunmen attacked, riddling the three-car convoy with bullets.
One woman was shot at close range in the chest. One child was shot in the back. Several others — among them 6-month-old twins — were burned beyond recognition when one of the vehicles caught fire.
When the shooting stopped, six children and three women were dead, all members of the LeBarón family, dual Mexican and American citizens who have lived for decades in a fundamentalist Mormon community near the border.
“When you know there are babies tied in a car seat that are burning because of some twisted evil that’s in this world, it’s just hard to cope with that,” Kenny LeBarón, a cousin of the women who were killed, said in a telephone interview.

Many questions remained Tuesday about what happened on that lonely stretch of road a day earlier, amid the rugged scrubland of Mexican border state Sonora.
But coming closely on the heels of two other prominent episodes of violence, the ambush horrified a nation reeling from a record-high number of murders. And it added to the pressure on Mexico’s president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, to fulfill the promise he made when he took office nearly a year ago: that he would curb the killings.
López Obrador seems to be struggling to fashion a coherent response.
In mid-October, at least 13 police officers were killed in the state of Michoacán in an ambush stemming from a struggle between rival criminal groups.
Days later, nearly 400 gunmen from the Sinaloa Cartel — the group once led by Joaquín Guzmán Loera, the imprisoned drug trafficker known as El Chapo — took control of Culiacán, the state capital of Sinaloa, after government forces tried to arrest one of Guzmán’s sons.
But Mexicans seemed especially taken aback by the sheer brutality of the latest spasm of bloodshed — children and their mothers slaughtered in broad daylight — and the government’s seeming inability to do much about any of the violence.
On Tuesday, López Obrador rejected rising criticism that his government is merely improvising against organized crime groups and struck a defiant tone over his approach.
“You can’t fight violence with more violence,” he said at a news conference.
He vowed that there would be “intelligence, rather than force” and “punishment, not corruption.” Collusion between authorities and criminals, he said, would end.
After taking office, López Obrador had vowed to end his predecessors’ so-called war on drugs and address the roots of crime by tackling poverty.
But Tuesday, Carlos Bravo Regidor, a political analyst in Mexico City, said the recent violence had “exposed the limits and deficits of the president’s new vision for security.” He added, “The president can no longer continue with his discourse of ‘hugs, not bullets’ after what happened yesterday.”
President Donald Trump offered via Twitter on Tuesday to help Mexico eradicate organized crime groups, saying that it was time “to wage WAR on the drug cartels and wipe them off the face of the earth.” The Mexican leader declined, however, saying that “in these cases we have to act with independence.”
López Obrador and his top security official said authorities were still gathering information about the assailants in the latest atrocity.
They speculated that the family might have been victims of mistaken identity. Their SUVs “could have been confused by the criminal groups that are fighting in the region,” said Alfonso Durazo, Mexico’s security minister.
But details of the attack remained murky Tuesday. In particular, it was unclear whether the attackers had intentionally targeted the family, which has in the past spoken out about the criminal groups that plague the northern border states of Sonora and Chihuahua.
The three cars were traveling Monday morning from La Mora, in the state of Sonora, to Colonia LeBarón in the state of Chihuahua, a four-hour drive partly along a dirt road through the mountains, relatives said. They knew the route well.
Julián LeBarón, a cousin of the three women driving the vehicles, said in a telephone interview from Bavispe, Mexico, that his cousin Rhonita Miller had been traveling to Phoenix to pick up her husband, who works in North Dakota and was returning to celebrate the couple’s anniversary.
Her car broke down, LeBarón said, and the gunmen “opened fire on Rhonita and torched her car.”
She was killed, along with an 11-year-old boy, a 9-year-old girl and the twins, he said.
The two other cars were attacked down the road, and the two other women killed, LeBarón said. A 4-year-old boy and a 6-year-old girl were also killed, he said.
One of the women, Christina Langford, 31, was shot outside her car, LeBarón said. “They shot her point blank in the chest,” he said.
Several family members posted a video, said to have been taken after the attack, showing a charred vehicle riddled with bullet holes, with a fire still burning inside.
Several children hid by the roadside to escape the attackers and were later rescued, family members said. One boy, who is 13, hiked several miles to La Mora to alert family members about what had happened, said David Langford, a relative.
The boy’s younger sister, who is about 9, was injured and set out on her own. She became lost, and it took hours for the family to find her, said David Langford, who grew up in Sonora and now lives in North Dakota.
The surviving children were taken to Arizona for treatment.
Among the victims was David Langford’s sister, Christina Langford, who grew up in La Mora, a small community of Mormon families surrounded by orchards and dairy cows, and had six children.
Christina Langford was planning to move this week with her children to North Dakota to be closer to her husband, who had relocated there to work in the oil business. “She doesn’t like the city life, and she was trying to give them a better life, and sacrificing being with her husband to do it,” David Langford said.
Julian LeBarón said the family had not received any threats, other than general warnings not to travel to Chihuahua, where they typically went to buy groceries and fuel.
David Langford said relatives had been warned by criminal groups to “stay off” the road between La Mora and LeBarón at night, a command they had complied with.
“We’ve been traveling that road for 50 years,” he said.
LeBarón said that perhaps the killings would finally spur enough outrage to force change.
“We need the Mexican people to say at some point, ‘We’ve had enough,” he said. “We need accountability — we don’t have that on any level.”
Mormon families have lived in northern Mexico for decades. Unaffiliated with the mainstream Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, some practice plural marriage, while others are monogamous.
The communities make a living on both sides of the border, with many of their members speaking English and holding dual citizenship. In Mexico, they raise cattle and farm alfalfa and chili peppers. The men also travel to the United States to work in different parts of the country.
Over the years, there have been tensions between the Mormons and local criminals. In 2009, two members of the LeBarón family were murdered after organizing local communities against the gangs.
But the Mormons have learned to live with the occasional threat, said Lynn Wariner LeBaron, a part-time resident of the community of Colonia LeBarón. And Ruth Wariner, who grew up in the region, said that in recent years, the Colonia LeBarón community seemed to have established a truce of sorts with the gangs.
So the killings, Wariner said, were a surprise. There just didn’t seem to be any reason for them.
“Things seemed to be getting more peaceful,” she said.

Texto completo: “Every generation blames the one before.”
— Mike + The Mechanics
So I guess "OK Boomer" is a thing now. And I gather I'm supposed to be offended by it. Certainly, some people seem to be.
The saying — a dismissive eye roll from Generation Z to their elders — is suddenly all the rage. It appears on hoodies, headlines, tweets and memes, this catch-all response to old folks’ nonstop nagging and criticism. Some members of the Baby Boom generation are not amused.
Maureen Dowd of The New York Times sees it as “intergenerational war.” Steve Cuozzo of The New York Post says the young ones “really, really hate us.” Bob Lonsberry, a conservative radio host, declared “boomer” — no joke — “the n-word of ageism.”
Granted, these are media types — not real people — so we should be careful about generalizing. I, for one, can't say I really feel "hate" from young folks. But to whatever degree I should be taking this seriously — "You darn kids, get off my internet!" — I find that I can't. I keep laughing instead.
It strikes me as funny that some in my generation, which defined itself by an insolent rejection of the old, are traumatized by a younger generation's insolent rejection of us. Am I the only one who remembers when the hippies warned, "Don't trust anyone over 30?" Does no one else recall when Pete Townshend sneered, "Hope I die before I get old"?
Then how dare any of us clutch our pearls over a little intergenerational sniping? Besides, it's not as if the kids don't have a point. Our record is certainly mixed.
I'd say our music was better than theirs, but they have better television — and more of it — than we could've dreamt. Boomers made great strides in civil rights for black people, women and the LGBTQ. But we dropped the ball on climate change, failed to address a rigged financial system. And we — the white cohort of us at least — bear blame for the catastrophe of Trump. We deserve both credit and castigation. Every generation does — even the "Greatest."
When I was a kid, I used to tease this old man in the neighborhood for being an old man in the neighborhood. "Keep a'livin'," he'd always retort. And I did. And here I am, just turned 62 and wondering how the heck that happened. The Gen Z kids will too soon enough wonder the selfsame thing. The big wheel keeps on turning.
Usually that confers perspective and context, the soil from which wisdom grows. But you couldn't prove that by these overwrought responses to young people's taunts.
I'm remembering teenage battles with my mom as I write this. As it happens, I've got Nat King Cole playing in the background. He was mom's end-all and be-all. She didn't want to hear any noise from my room about P-Funk getting funked up, Papa being a rolling stone or midnight trains to Georgia. As far as she was concerned, music stopped when King Cole died. I got sick of hearing his name, scorned him on general principle.
But I remember one day mom deigned to listen to the Stylistics with me. Afterward, she sniffed that "Betcha By Golly Wow" was actually a pretty song to have such a silly title. It was a backhanded compliment, but I felt vindicated by it just the same. I doubt she needed my vindication — adults didn't need that from kids back then. Still, somewhere in the intervening decades, I decided Cole wasn't so bad either. I just had to learn how to hear him — and I did.
So the kids may "OK" this Boomer to their heart's content. Because as they will eventually discover, that old man in my neighborhood was right.
Keep a'livin' indeed.

Texto completo: Un video divulgado ayer mostró a la presentadora Amy Robach desahogándose “en privado” porque a su juicio ABC News censuró y subestimó “durante tres años” la historia que estaba proponiendo con entrevistas a víctimas “de pedofilia” del multimillonario Jeffrey Epstein, arrestado y luego hallado muerto en su celda del Bajo Manhattan este verano.
Desde su arresto en julio, The New York Times destacó la amistad en el pasado de Epstein con personalidades como el Príncipe Andrés de Inglaterra, el cineasta Woody Allen y los presidentes Donald Trump y Bill Clinton.
Según el testimonio de Robach divulgado por el portal Project Veritas, ABC News no prestó atención al tema por presión de la familia británica.
“He tenido esta historia durante tres años. He tenido esta entrevista con Virginia Roberts”, dijo Robach a alguien fuera de cámara, refiriéndose a la víctima de abuso sexual más conocida de Epstein. “En primer lugar, me dijeron: “¿Quién es Jeffrey Epstein? Nadie sabe quién es. Ésta es una historia estúpida’”.
La co-anfitriona de “20/20” luego se queja de cómo “el Palacio” (la corona británica) descubrió las acusaciones de Roberts de que era menor de edad cuando tuvo relaciones sexuales con el Príncipe Andrew. El Palacio, detalla Robach, “nos amenazó de un millón de maneras diferentes”.
“Teníamos tanto miedo de no poder entrevistar a (los príncipes) Kate y Will que nosotros (…) eso también anuló la historia”, agregó Robach.
Horas después de la divulgación del video, Robach debió emitir un comunicado a pedido de ABC News, reportó New York Post.
La presentadora dijo entonces sobre el video que fue “atrapada en un momento de frustración privada” , y que fue grabado en julio.
En su declaración, Robach afirmó que estaba “decepcionada” de que su entrevista con Roberts, grabada en 2015, no se emitió al aire ya que no cumplió con los estándares editoriales de ABC News, e insistió en que nunca le habían dicho que dejara de informar sobre el escándalo de Epstein.
Fuentes de ABC News dijeron a Page Six ayer que había “cero verdad” sobre que la entrevista se detuvo a favor de la corte británica y, en particular, como dijo Robach ante la cámara, para obtener una entrevista con el príncipe William y su esposa Kate Middleton.
Aunque la muerte de Epstein fue calificada oficialmente de suicidio por ahorcamiento, en los últimos días han retomado los rumores sobre asesinato por estrangulación.
Attorney Stan Pottinger on ABC's decision not to broadcast Amy Robach's interview with his client, Virginia Giuffre: "I don't remember any reason not to run this that makes sense to us, either as a manner of editorial policy or as a manner of law." https://t.co/jHAvVP8LdJ

Attorney Stan Pottinger on ABC's decision not to broadcast Amy Robach's interview with his client, Virginia Giuffre: "I don't remember any reason not to run this that makes sense to us, either as a manner of editorial policy or as a manner of law." https://t.co/jHAvVP8LdJ

Texto completo: This week, we celebrate what many consider the 50th birthday of the Internet. The underpinnings of the World Wide Web originated in an American communications network built for national defense and the pursuit of knowledge: ARPANET. Funded by the Defense Department's Advanced Research Projects Agency, the network was designed so that scientists could share computer hardware, software and data.
It worked. In the ensuing decades, the ARPANET, and after the 1980s, the National Science Foundation Network (NSFNET), did indeed allow scientists to collaboratively build knowledge around networked tools and information. But expanding access to the Internet, combined with looser government regulations, ultimately produced a situation no one foresaw or intended. On today's Internet, conspiracy theories run rampant, identities can be faked and our real-life elections are vulnerable to manipulation. A network designed for spreading truth became a profit-driven industry, a public sphere that threatens to undermine the public good.
The original ARPANET was designed for a relatively small community of people united by a technical challenge. At the time, computers from different manufacturers ran incompatible software, and long-distance data communications links were costly and unreliable. Networks connected only a few identical computers within a small region.
But ARPANET had an audacious proposal: It would span the continental United States to connect 15 research sites encompassing a diverse array of computers.
"Almost every conceivable item of computer hardware and software will be in the network," project leader Larry Roberts pointed out. "This is the greatest challenge of the system, as well as its greatest ultimate value." As a leading funder of computer science research, ARPA was able to mobilize a talented group of faculty and graduate students to design, build and debug the network, sending the first message on Oct. 29, 1969.
Like many academic environments, the ARPANET community was open and informal, and security was lax; in the early 1970s, students were rumored to have used the network to conduct transcontinental drug deals alongside their official research. But the relatively closed world of networked computing was opened up with the introduction of personal computers in the 1970s. The Defense Department soon found "unauthorized penetrations" of the ARPANET by hackers, complaining that "the availability of inexpensive computers and modems have made the network fair game for countless computer hobbyists."
By 1983, security concerns were so acute that Defense split off military users into their own network, ceding the rest of the ARPANET to academic researchers. In 1990, the ARPANET was absorbed into a new network built by the National Science Foundation that consisted of several regional networks connected by a high-speed backbone. As a nationwide civilian network, NSFNET rapidly increased the size and visibility of the Internet.
Politicians and businesses wanted to capitalize on the potential of a national network to connect citizens and consumers. In the early 1980s, the general public, though not yet allowed on the Internet, had begun using commercial dial-up services such as CompuServe and AOL to access servers offering chat rooms, games and email. In 1986, Congress, prompted by Sen. Al Gore, began debating whether the nation needed an "information superhighway" to connect K-12 schools and libraries for all citizens. Congress included funding for a National Research and Education Network (NREN) in its High-Performance Computing Act of 1991.
Had this plan come to fruition, the Internet would have remained under federal control until the late 1990s, potentially allowing time to upgrade security or create regulations to protect users. But before the NREN could get underway, the industry contractors providing the NSFNET infrastructure rushed ahead with plans to offer commercial network services, ultimately causing Congress to abandon the NREN.
The result was the de facto privatization of the Internet. The nonprofit organizations that had operated the NSFNET's backbone and regional networks reinvented themselves as the first commercial Internet service providers, serving both the NSF and private customers. The NSF now had the option to outsource its networking needs to these commercial providers, which it did as it retired the old NSFNET in 1995. While this removed an administrative burden from the NSF, the hasty transition left little time to consider the policy implications. So a commercialized network developed without public oversight of the Internet's operation.
Privatization opened the floodgates for new services: social media, gaming, e-commerce, and millions of personal websites and blogs. Industry advocates insisted that the Internet should not be regulated, lest innovation be stifled. Regulatory models that had been developed for common carriers, publishers and broadcasters did not fit a new medium that combined aspects of all these media and whose services and business models were in constant flux. Online businesses were free to experiment with ways to make money, eventually landing on the advertising-based business model that led to escalating surveillance and collection of user data to better target ads.
None of this has prevented scientists - the Internet's original users - from continuing to build reliable knowledge based on networked data and computational tools. The scientific community has time-tested processes to validate and protect the information it shares. But the general public is in a more precarious position. Anyone can be a publisher online, and the obvious clues to legitimacy that came with print and broadcast media - the investment in reporting and fact-checking, obligations to paying customers, an identifiable organization that could be held liable for false content - can be absent or faked online. The same type of user profiling that stimulates business also enables bad actors to target inflammatory social issues and widen political divides. We have inadvertently created a culture where misinformation can be spread without accountability.
Long-term trends of increasingly open access and diminishing government oversight have fueled the Internet's growth and unleashed the creativity of millions. They have also left a vacuum where the public interest should be. Can we work together to build a better Internet for the next 50 years?

Texto completo: Picked-up pieces in the shrinking daylight . . .
■  Sunday's 37-20 loss to the Ravens was easily the most entertaining Patriots game of the season thus far. Sorry, but I find a game like this more enjoyable than yet another nauseating 60-minute network homage to the greatness of Bill Belichick, Tom Brady, Bob Kraft, and New England's Boogeyman defense.
Patriots-Ravens was still a 4-point game through three quarters. The Patriots had plenty of chances to come back and win it. Silly me, I find this more exciting than watching a 43-0 blowout at Miami, or seeing the Browns turn the ball over on three consecutive touches in the first half of a beatdown at Gillette. I like it when there's some big-boy pushback from the other team, when the coach on the other sideline is not genuflecting at the Altar of Bill.
It's called competition, and it's what got most of us into sports in the first place. The contest : that crazy notion of anticipating a game and not being certain which team is going to win.
In the Patriots' unparalleled two-decade run of success, the spirit of competition has been replaced around here by one of entitlement. Because there are so many bad teams, stupid coaches, and poorly run franchises, we go into each year assuming the Patriots will win the AFC East and gain home-field advantage throughout the playoffs.
Invariably, they wind up with a first-round playoff layup, then beat one good team at Gillette to qualify for the Super Bowl. That's where it looked like we were headed before the Ravens game. Now, it's Game On in the AFC. Something to watch. Something to root for.
Last year's Super Bowl run was more fun because it was more challenging. The Patriots struggled early in the season and had to beat a good team on the road (Kansas City) to get to the Super Bowl. It was like the first years of this dynasty when the Patriots twice won AFC Championship games in Pittsburgh. Those were hard-earned, contested, and more fun.
Bring on the Eagles, Cowboys, Texans, and Chiefs — four teams with winning records (what a concept!). It'll be so much more fun than crushing the Tomato Cans of the first eight weeks.
■  The weekend of July 25-26 next summer could be a biggie for Boston baseball fans. The Red Sox will be in New York City to play the Yankees. Meanwhile, the Hall of Fame will hold its induction ceremony, and there could be a few inductees/honorees with ties to Boston and the Red Sox.
Derek Jeter is a lock to be enshrined on his first time on the ballot, but Curt Schilling has his best chance yet to get the 75 percent of votes required. Here's the New York Post's inimitable Joel Sherman on Schill's chances: “Most likely to join Jeter on the Baseball Writers' Association of America's ballot is his old nemesis and general embarrassment to the species Curt Schilling."
The BBWAA voting results will be announced in January. On Dec. 8, we will find out whether Dwight Evans passes the audition with the “Modern Era" panel at the Winter Meetings in San Diego. Dewey is one of 10 candidates on the Modern Era ballot. Others include Marvin Miller and Tommy John.
Meanwhile, three of the eight candidates for the coveted Ford C. Frick broadcaster's award have Boston roots: Joe Castiglione, Ken Harrelson, and Ned Martin (“Mercy!"). The late Nick Cafardo is one of three finalists for the J.G. Taylor Spink Award presented for contributions to baseball writing. The Frick and Spink winners will be announced at the December meetings.
■  Baseball is not as bad off as you might think. It simply has morphed into a regional sport more than a national pastime. Ratings for MLB's big events (World Series, All-Star Game) shrink almost every year, but many of the local markets remain strong and lucrative.
The New York Times reports that, according to Nielsen ratings, 12 of the 29 US-based major league teams were the most popular prime-time broadcast in their market. On cable, 24 big league teams ranked first in their market in prime time.
■  Has any team other than the 2019 Red Sox had three hitters bat .300 with 30 homers and 100 RBIs (J.D. Martinez, Rafael Devers, Xander Bogaerts) and not made the playoffs?
■  QUIZ: Cuban-born Yuli Gurriel homered in the Astros' Game 7 loss to the Nationals. Name the last Cuban-born player to homer in a World Series Game 7. (Answer below.)
■  Favorite story about Red Sox baseball boss Chaim Bloom: When Don Zimmer served as a senior adviser with the Tampa Bay Rays, Bloom would watch games in the clubhouse with Zim, the late, great baseball lifer who died in 2014.
■  Scott Boras had nine players in this year's World Series, including Jose Altuve and Juan Soto. He also has free agents Gerrit Cole, Stephen Strasburg, and Anthony Rendon.
■  New York's Nassau County has a three-year-old policy designed to prevent blowouts in high school football games, and last week a coach in Plainedge was suspended after he did not pull starters in a 61-13 victory over South Side. According to officials, if a team wins by more than 42 points, the winning coach has to explain why he or she could not avoid the carnage (I'd call it the Auriemma Rule).
In Belichickian fashion, the Plainedge coach told a committee that he did not pull his starters because he was concerned South might mount a comeback from a 35-point deficit at the start of the fourth quarter.
■  Weak sauce: Belichick getting asked (postgame Sunday) if he could be more specific regarding how he needed to coach better and answering, “It's obvious. Did you see the game tonight?"
■  Harold Reynolds played high school basketball against Danny Ainge when both were teenagers in Oregon.
■  Try naming the worst NFL coach. It's like trying to identify the worst member of the presidential cabinet. Cleveland's Freddie Kitchens and Chicago's Matt Nagy are my front-runners.
■  Has Ed Davis cracked the case in the Dominican Republic yet?
■  I don't know about you, but I find it troubling that the new Red Sox assistant hitting coach never played above A ball. Another win for the geeks.
■  The Jackie Bradley Jr. Love Society must be in mourning after JBJ was snubbed again in Gold Glove voting. I mean, if you're going to be considered untradeable despite hitting .225 with 155 strikeouts, can you at least win the Gold Glove?
■  Sunday's joust between the winless Dolphins and the 1-6 Jets reminded me of the 1981 season-finale “Stupor Bowl" pitting the 2-13 Patriots vs. the 1-14 Colts at Baltimore. Ron Erhardt's Patriots lost, 23-21, in front of 17,073 at Memorial Stadium. The Stupor Bowl loss earned the Patriots the No. 1 pick, and they wasted it on Ken “Gameday" Sims," a Texas lineman who only wanted to play hard on Sundays.
■  Veteran Globe scribe Marvin Pave delivered a spectacular obituary for longtime Bruins defenseman Ted Green in Sunday's Globe. Green's former teammate Ed Westfall recounted the moments in an Ottawa hospital in 1969 when it was feared Green might die after engaging in a stick fight with Wayne Maki. Green did not play that season, but when the Bruins won the Stanley Cup, teammates made sure his name was engraved on the chalice.
■  Steve Belichick almost got more TV airtime than Brady Sunday night.
■  UMass's football team is 1-8, allowing 52 points per game. The Minutemen were beaten at home by Liberty, 63-21, Saturday. What can taxpayers do to make this stop?
■  There's still time to get tickets for The Tradition at the Garden Nov. 20. Matt Light, Paul Silas, Ben Crenshaw, Zdeno Chara, Michelle Kwan, and Manny Ramirez are the honorees. For tickets and information, visit sportsmuseum.org.
■  Quiz answer: Tony Perez famously homered off Bill Lee's eephus pitch in Game 7 of the 1975 World Series.

Texto completo: Readers highlight the important role that Twitter plays in this presidency. Also: The Ukraine whistle-blower should testify in person; New York bans foie gras; the "Joker" staircase.
To the Editor:
Noticeably absent from the Nov. 3 special section on "The Twitter Presidency" was an iota of self-reflection. Imagine how different our republic might be today if the media had refused to cover President Trump's tweets from the start.
This administration might actually have been forced into more traditional forms of facing the public. The citizenry would not be subjected to mercurial rantings from the White House in which government policies change within the same day depending upon the number of "likes" received.
Sadly, we will never know.
Kim Hunter
St. Paul
To the Editor:
Among the practices that should be adopted immediately following the Trump presidency (may the day come as soon as possible), let's add a new one: no tweets from any president, ever. The president has many other channels of communication. Certainly, the rest of the government, and the military, should never regard a tweet as a declaration of policy or an order for action; this principle should be legislated if necessary.
So kudos to The Times for shining a light on this, and kudos to Twitter for leading the way toward taming the destructive power of social media by refusing all political ads.
Ron Meyers
New York
To the Editor:
I was stunned to see "The Twitter Presidency." Does the press not understand that the more you cover his tweets, the bigger his bullying megaphone becomes? Tweeting requires no coalition-building, no across-the-aisle negotiating, no dialectic with citizens about ideas, social mores or governing policies.
President Trump is a blowhard king throwing hyperbolic missives from his tower into the crowd below. By republishing his tweets, you cast us all in the role of powerless peasants standing with our mouths agape, stunned by his cruelty, crassness and craziness.
I say, stop it. Stop covering his tweets. Cease. Desist. Even when you argue with his tweets, you create a firmer foundation for the medium, normalizing what should be appalling. Just stop, I beg of you.

Calls by Republicans for the Whistle-Blower to Testify in Person
To the Editor:
Re "Whistle-Blower Is Willing to Answer Republicans' Questions, Lawyer Says" (news article, Nov. 4):
Republicans are rejecting the whistle-blower's offer to answer their questions in writing. Representative Jim Jordan says written answers "will not provide a sufficient opportunity to probe all the relevant facts." Yet somehow I don't recall Mr. Jordan voicing such righteous indignation when President Trump refused to be interviewed for the Mueller probe and chose, instead, to provide written answers.
Peter Wortmann
New York
To the Editor:
You report that the Republicans would like the whistle-blower on the Ukraine matter to appear for questioning in person so they can establish the individual's potential biases, a process for which they find written testimony inadequate. President Trump has asked that the individual's identity be revealed for the same purpose.
Yet you also report, for example in "President Likens Inside Sources to 'Spies"' (front page, Sept. 27), Mr. Trump's veiled suggestion that the whistle-blower be executed: "You know what we used to do in the old days when we were smart with spies and treason, right?"
Mr. Trump and his congressional acolytes want the person who Mr. Trump, whether jocularly or not, thinks should be executed to come out into the open? I don't think so. Better a voice-only teleconference from an undisclosed location with a voice mask.

The Banning of Foie Gras
To the Editor:
Re "A Sign of Increasingly Progressive Times: City Bans Foie Gras" (news article, Oct. 31):
Animals, and those of us who are concerned about them, should thank the New York City Council for its vote to phase out the sale of foie gras.
My own state of California has already banned the production and sale of foie gras, and with good reason. Any reasonable person knows that it's simply cruel to force-feed ducks or geese to the point where their livers become engorged up to 10 times their normal size.
Future generations will likely be shocked when they learn how we treated animals, especially farm animals, in our era. New York City's admirable move against foie gras will be seen as a sign of changing times that helped lead us toward a more civilized society.

In the Footsteps of the Joker
To the Editor:
"'Joker' Stairs Turn Bronx Into Magnet for Tourists" (news article, Nov. 2) leapt out at me.
I went down that staircase every school day from 1945 to 1951 to get the train to Hunter High School and Hunter College. The stairway was too long and steep to climb up on the return trip, so I had to walk around on Shakespeare Avenue.

Texto completo: Every Republican in Congress should be required to watch Sen. Rand Paul’s brief remarks at President Trump’s rally Monday night. They should all watch it again and again.
In the span of two minutes, Paul said everything that needs to be said about the Democrats’ impeachment effort.
He called on congressional Republicans to defend the president, he leaned into the attack on the corruption of the Bidens, and he hit the national media for refusing to publish the name of the career government employee who started the whole farce, otherwise referred to as “the whistleblower.”
“We also now know the name of the whistleblower,” said Paul. “I say tonight to the media, do your job and print his name.”
If only Paul had just said the name himself — nothing is stopping him, if he does in fact know the guy's name.
There was naturally a meltdown among liberals, who were horrified that a Republican might actually fight for the leader of his party and confront this ridiculous attempt to remove Trump from office. Doesn’t Rand know that there’s an impeachment going on and that he’s supposed to be hiding under his chair right now?
CNN liberal Keith Boykin tweeted, “Rand Paul should be ashamed of himself, but he’s not because he’s chosen blind loyalty to the president over patriotism to his country.” (True “patriotism” would be for Paul to lay down and cede power to Democrats, duh.)

National Journal's Josh Kraushaar, bowing to the media myth that the “whistleblower” is legally entitled to anonymity, said it was “deeply irresponsible” for Paul to ask that the name be published. Claire McCaskill, a former Democratic senator and now an MSNBC “analyst,” said the next day that Paul is “just kind of an idiot about stuff.”
Associated Press reporter Jonathan Lemire said on MSNBC it “would be illegal” to put out the name. Note that none of this is true — government whistleblowers have no legal right to anonymity.
CNN’s Pamela Brown repeated the lie that “the whistleblower is legally allowed to remain anonymous” and her colleague Anderson Cooper dutifully replied, "Right, the whistleblower is legally allowed to remain anonymous.”
There is no law that secures the bureaucrat any right to anonymity. If there were, a lot of people would be in legal jeopardy at this very moment because a lot of people, including reporters at the New York Times, know exactly who it is. Why aren’t any of them being prosecuted if this is a legal issue? Because it’s not.
Some liberals are also pretending this is a matter of protecting the safety of the bureaucrat. Where is the evidence of that? Stefan Halper covertly worked with the FBI to spy on the Trump 2016 campaign. His identity was eventually reported by multiple major news outlets, including the Washington Post, Wall Street Journal, and New York Magazine. He’s still alive and kicking — just fine, in fact, last I heard.
Valerie Plame was a CIA employee. When her identity was published, she was unfortunately killed.
Just kidding! She was on CNN this week. She's running for Congress.
Rand Paul did a service to the country with his rallying cry. Every Republican should follow his lead.

Texto completo: No nevará este año tan temprano como se había alertado en la ciudad de Nueva York, pero el pronóstico de clima cruel se mantiene, con lluvia helada la noche del jueves.
Los meteorólogos inicialmente predijeron que la ciudad posiblemente vería una nevada húmeda el jueves por la noche hasta el viernes, a medida que las temperaturas cayesen, pero eso ahora ha cambiado, destacó New York Post.
Los neoyorquinos pueden esperar una lluvia muy fría el jueves por la noche , cuando se espera que la temperatura caerá a 38 grados F (3 C).
“Si se ve algo de nieve, será en los suburbios lejanos del Valle del Hudson y Nueva Jersey”, dijo hoy el meteorólogo principal de AccuWeather, Paul Walker. “No creo que haya nada cerca de la ciudad”, más allá de una lluvia helada.
Para el viernes por la mañana se pronostica que el sol brillará en NYC, aunque seguirá el frío, con un máximo de 42 grados y un mínimo de 30F (5 a -1C).
Se espera que los primeros copos de la temporada caigan en el noreste, con un par de centímetros de nieve.
Mucho más se pronostica para el norte de Maine, que podría acumular de 6 a 12 pulgadas de nieve a medida que pasa la tormenta, previó Walker.
El año pasado, la primera nevada llegó por sorpresa a NYC el 15 de noviembre, desatando un caos en el transporte y fuertes críticas a las autoridades por la falta de previsión.
Las 6.4 pulgadas de nieve que cayeron ayer esa noche en Central Park constituyeron la mayor nevada en noviembre en al menos 136 años, reportó The New York Times.

They're Not Your Typical Airbnb Rental

Texto completo: The home-sharing platform has offered several novelty lodging opportunities lately, like a stay in Barbie's mansion or a night in the Goodyear blimp. They earn headlines, and that's the point.
It was a warm August evening in Evanston, Ill., just north of Chicago, when the Wienermobile rolled out the red carpet for a sleepover.
Actually, the carpet was green, and not so much carpet as artificial turf. Inside the Wienermobile, the meat brand Oscar Mayer's signature marketing machine, there was a pullout bed and a mini fridge. There were hot dog sunglasses, hot dog onesies and actual hot dogs with all the accouterments. (But no ketchup: Chicago doesn't really do hot dogs with ketchup. It's a thing.)
It was the first time a Wienermobile had been repurposed for paid lodging, the result of a collaboration between Oscar Mayer and Airbnb, the home-sharing platform that has increasingly tried to woo customers by promising adventure as well as accommodation.
If the Wienermobile stunt sounds familiar, it may be because Airbnb has entered into similar collaborations since then. The Goodyear blimp welcomed Airbnb guests last month. A life-size version of Barbie's Malibu Dreamhouse opened its doors last week. And Downton Abbey -- that is, Highclere Castle in Hampshire, England -- will take two lodgers this month.
All of those offers were part of a marketing campaign at Airbnb, and all of them made news headlines. That was no accident.
"I think a lot of brands, in the future, they need to be in the business of making news, not just advertising," said Brian Chesky, Airbnb's chief executive. "And to make news you have to do something that is worth somebody reporting about."
The first of those collaborations was with Oscar Mayer, a brand owned by Kraft Heinz. Bonnie Rosenberg, 32, a Chicago resident, stayed in the Wienermobile on Aug. 1, its first night as a hotel. She knew the whole thing was a marketing ploy for Oscar Mayer and Airbnb. But it all seemed so campy, nostalgic and fun.
"I saw an article on Twitter from The Chicago Tribune covering it, and I was like, jackpot," she said. "I definitely want to do this."
Ms. Rosenberg said she and her husband, Bill Welense, 36, had a good time leaning into the absurdity of it all. "It was really surreal, I have to say, because it was set up like a movie set would be," she added.
The Wienermobile and similar lodging opportunities were available on a first-come-first-served basis, and only for a few nights. So while millions of people read about them, not many were able to book them.
That scarcity can be effective for companies seeking news coverage, according to Ron Berman, an assistant professor of marketing at the Wharton School. "It needs to be more of an interesting story -- let's call it an aspirational experience -- than an actual experience," he said.
While getting the right kind of attention is difficult, news reports that link brands with interesting opportunities can make for excellent marketing, Professor Berman said. And New York Times reporters who write about those marketing tactics could be helping the brands even more.
But Airbnb, which has been valued at about $ 30 billion, is worth watching as it expands beyond lodging and into the more nebulous realm of experiences. The platform has already asserted itself as a disruptive force in the hotel and real estate industries -- clashing with cities, neighborhoods and residents in pitched legal battles at almost every step of the way. And last week, after a shooting at a rental property that killed five people at a Halloween party, Mr. Chesky said on Twitter that Airbnb planned to crack down on "party houses."
In Malibu, Calif., the Barbie mansion didn't really exist as such until Mattel teamed up with Airbnb to promote the Barbie brand's 60th anniversary. Adorned with pops of pink specifically for last week's booking, the property was open to four people for just two nights. Still, it earned news media coverage from CNBC, The New York Post and Fox News.
"We felt that this partnership with Airbnb would be a really fun and relevant way" to reinforce Barbie's place in popular culture, said Lisa McKnight, the global head of Barbie and dolls for Mattel.
The stay in a Goodyear blimp, which was stationed in a hangar in Ohio, also gave people something to talk about; it was covered by CNN, USA Today and Maxim. A listing for a November reservation at Highclere Castle, a filming location for "Downton Abbey," targeted fans of the television series and the movie released in September. It was covered in The Los Angeles Times, Town & Country and Forbes.
Some brands were approached by Airbnb to create the experiences that made news headlines or caught fire on social media. But others, Mr. Chesky said, were beginning to seek listings independently.
Jim Beam, which makes bourbon in Kentucky, offered limited stays at a century-old cottage on the company's distillery grounds in Clermont as part of its own marketing plan, said Dan Cohen, a spokesman for Beam Suntory, Jim Beam's parent company.
"We've always thought about potentially bringing in some of our fans to experience such an authentic and intimate and unique experience in our distillery by allowing them to stay in this house," Mr. Cohen said.
(Only two one-night stays at the cottage were available on Airbnb -- one this month and one next month -- and both were quickly booked.)
This summer, Airbnb, founded in 2008, introduced a high-end rental tier, Airbnb Luxe, for users to rent villas, lodges or castles for thousands of dollars a night (give or take). The company also offers Experiences -- activities with Airbnb hosts -- and Adventures, like surfing, sailing and foraging.
It plans to go public in 2020, something employees have been pushing for. Mr. Chesky declined to comment on whether the company would do an initial public offering or a direct listing.
A marketing blitz would make sense for a company preparing to go public. And while Airbnb's spending this year is in line with past patterns, Mr. Chesky said, 2019 has been "an investment year."
For the few lodgers who have been able to take advantage of the recent marketing campaign, the investment has paid off. The couple who booked the Goodyear blimp on its first night got engaged during their stay. And for Ms. Rosenberg, the Wienermobile was definitely a once-in-a-lifetime experience.
"I think it was unique from any other Airbnb that I've encountered," she said.

Texto completo: ALBANY – President Donald Trump is a New Yorker no more.
For decades, Trump was a symbol of Manhattan wealth and status, a real-estate developer whose name was emblazoned on buildings and face was often plastered on the tabloids.
But Trump's decision to change his legal residence from Trump Tower in Manhattan to his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida, means Trump will call a state other than New York home for the first time in his life.
"I cherish New York, and the people of New York, and always will, but unfortunately, despite the fact that I pay millions of dollars in city, state and local taxes each year, I have been treated very badly by the political leaders of both the city and state," Trump tweeted Thursday night.
New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo wasn't buying Trump's explanation, instead theorizing that a Florida move could somehow aid him in his bid to keep his tax returns private.
(They're currently the subject of a subpoena from Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance, which Trump is fighting in federal court.)
"Good riddance, Mr. Trump," Cuomo told reporters Friday in Albany.
Here's a look at some of Trump's extensive New York history:
Son of a Bronx-born developer Donald Trump's origins in the state can be traced back to when his grandparents on his father's side immigrated to New York from Germany.
Fred Trump, Donald's father, was born in the Bronx in 1905 and would go on to become a real estate developer where he made millions. He eventually married Mary Anne MacLeod, a Scottish immigrant.
The couple would go on to have five children, including the eventual 45th president of the United States.
Donald Trump is a Queens native Donald Trump was born in Jamaica Hospital in Queens on June 14, 1946.
He spent the first four years of his life living in a 2,000-square-foot home his father built in 1940 as part of the Jamaica Estates.
The family eventually moved to a larger home in the same neighborhood, according to the New York Times.
Trump went to school in Orange County When he was a teenager, Trump attended the New York Military Academy beginning in 1959.
Trump would spend the next four years at the academy in Cornwall-on-Hudson, an Orange County village about an hour north of New York City.
He graduated from the academy in 1964 and would go on to attend Fordham University where he would study business administration before transferring to the Wharton School of Business at Pennsylvania University.
Took over the Trump Organization Trump took over his father's real estate business in 1971, rebranding the business as the Trump Organization.
Trump would go on to become one of New York City's major real-estate developers, cultivating his image through frequent appearances in the pages of the city's famed tabloid newspapers.
His organization went on to develop sites big and small in Manhattan, including Trump Tower, Trump Plaza, the Commodore Hotel and the Wollman ice skating rink in Central Park.
Trump Tower opened in 1983.
The Manhattan building most associated with Trump is the Fifth Avenue skyscraper that bears his name.
Trump Tower opened in 1983, giving the future president a marquee, 58-floor building in the heart of Midtown with retail, office and residential space.
Donald and Melania Trump have a three-story penthouse home there, which served as their primary residence until last month, when they filed legal paperwork shifting their residence to Mar-a-Lago.
Trump considered running for New York governor In 2014, with Cuomo seeking a second term, a group of Republicans tried to woo Trump into running for governor.
Trump publicly said he would consider a run, one of his many flirtations with seeking office before he launched his 2016 presidential campaign.
He went as far as speaking at a rally against New York's SAFE Act, a series of gun control laws, outside the state Capitol, buzzing his Trump-emblazoned helicopter over the crowd on his way out of town.
But he ultimately decided against a run, blaming Westchester County Executive Rob Astorino and Republicans for failing to unify behind him. (Astorino ultimately became the GOP nominee, losing to Cuomo.)

Texto completo: How a meticulously crammed sewing-machine repair store became an accidental museum.
A bell rang as a man came through the door, hands deep in his pockets. Steve Hecht looked up.
It was a clean-out guy he knows. He stops in when he finds something Mr. Hecht might like to buy. This time it was a dress form, a big one.
"You want a size 20?" the man asked. It was nearby, he said.
"Nope," said Mr. Hecht, crossing thick arms over a suede apron. "It's a little too much woman for me."
As the man left, Mr. Hecht said, "I have three or four 20s. You have to have your limits."
Mr. Hecht has a lot of old dress forms in his meticulously crammed storefront on West 38th Street in what is rapidly becoming the former garment district.
He also has nude photos and ticket stubs from Show World, the shuttered Times Square sex emporium, even an old type cutter from the days when The New York Times printed its papers on 43rd Street.
He has an antique lightning rod from a shirt company in Hell's Kitchen, oil cans found when the old Pennsylvania Station was being dismantled. The bell on the front door once rang in a local boxing ring.
Mr. Hecht, 60, is the third-generation owner of Hecht Sewing Machine and Motor Company, a more-than-century-old sewing-machine repair shop that has also become, as the neighborhood's garment factories and small businesses have died off, a repository of old New York.
"We are the undertakers," Mr. Hecht said.
For years, the collection that quietly amassed in the shop -- as the neighborhood was transformed -- has remained all but secret, a tip passed selectively from one artist to another.
Robert Frank, the photographer, used to scour the shop for early colorized photographs and lead figurines, according to Mr. Hecht, and when friends asked where to get him a gift, he sent them there. James Gandolfini, the actor known for his role as Tony Soprano, shopped at Hecht for tchotchkes and collectibles for his driver, his doorman and Matt Damon.
More recently, hip-hop luminaries have been directed there by the clerks of Nepenthes New York, an unmarked Japanese fashion boutique across the street that deals in glittering track pants and cashmere suits.
Tourists do not fare as well. Most are dispatched before their eyes have even adjusted to the light. Hecht does not permit photography, or accept credit cards. A heavy chain divides the shop.
"The tourist chain," Mr. Hecht says. "It preserves my sanity."
Most things in the shop are not for sale anyway. Mr. Hecht might make an exception for an obsessive collector of, say, thimbles or fountain pens or trench art from World War I, or for a star he recognizes who comes over from Nepenthes: "J. Lo," said Mr. Hecht, referring to Jennifer Lopez, for example. "Fellow Bronx girl."
But as he tells tourists daily, this is not an antique store -- it is a sewing-machine repair shop.
You could be forgiven for thinking otherwise. Along with oil-streaked machines and cabinets of parts, Mr. Hecht -- and his parents and grandparents before him -- also filled the shop with 19th-century maritime ephemera (anchors, glass buoys and hand-woven hemp fenders), painted signs, neon signs, animal pelts and taxidermy, pinups and framed photos of New Yorkers, once illustrious, perhaps -- and more.
From the time he was a child, he said, there were things you would not expect to find in such a place. They mainly served practical purposes: a glass porthole from a Navy ship with a thick lip became a place to put screws while making repairs; a mammoth bank safe became the workbench.
Mr. Hecht expanded the collection -- significantly -- yet he still relies on the sewing-machine business, which has enough clients, he said, ranging from the Metropolitan Opera to seamstresses in Queens, that he does not need to sell his treasures to pay the rent, though he does lease and sell items to prop stylists for television and film.
On a recent afternoon, a would-be customer touched the glass of a locked case containing pocketknives -- not for sale!-- and gazed wistfully at one. "It's little and adorable," she said. "You can get away with murder with it."
Hecht looks small from the street. The storefront is narrow, and its yellow sign, faded by time and pigeon slurry, is easy to miss amid a busy pizzeria, the Consulate General of Guyana and an upscale trattoria.
Inside, though, the shop stretches the length of two subway cars, and in places it is packed nearly to the ceiling. Mr. Hecht can be found there five days a week, crouched at the workbench, where he fixes sewing machines for the likes of Broadway costumers and the alteration departments of big retail stores, or in what he calls the front office, a wooden booth about the size of a ticket taker's at the cinema.
Founded by Morris Hecht, Mr. Hecht's Austrian-born grandfather, the business moved from a nearby street to its present quarters around 1920, and actually predates the tall Shampan Building that rises above it, said Mr. Hecht. "They built around us," he said.
In the cavernous old shop, bundles of scissors dangle from columns like chili peppers at a Mexican market. Bushels of whisk brooms, made of straw and horsehair and boar hair, lie on shelves. Large glass bulbs, now containing clippings of a pothos plant, hang here and there.
"Fire grenades," Mr. Hecht said. They once contained a fire-extinguishing liquid and could be lobbed at flames. These items were collected, mainly by Mr. Hecht himself, from hundreds of garment district factories.
It began in the 1970s, while he was still in high school, when industry in the neighborhood began to wind down. "That was when the big manufacturers that went in after World War II retired, when there was the downturn," he said.
"Factories were closing and people were retiring to Arizona and Florida. You'd go up there and the cigar would still be in the crystal ashtray," he said.
"People wanted nothing to do with it. It wasn't until 'Antiques Roadshow' and the picking shows that people picked up something like this" -- Mr. Hecht grabbed the nearest item, a candlestick -- "and said, 'This could be worth thousands."'
The Hechts bought the equipment, and took whatever else was left behind in the factory lofts, sometimes for a small price. "Usually you were doing them a favor," Mr. Hecht said. "It had to be broom-clean."
Before long, pickers and pushers -- rack-pushing garment workers -- learned of Mr. Hecht's penchant for collecting, and they began to come to him, bringing the flotsam of the garment district and beyond.
Mr. Hecht particularly loves mysteries, salvaged items he had to identify, before Google, using encyclopedias. Extracting from a nook a steel instrument with a curved shaft and a sharp tip, he announced: "Cheese bore. You get a 12-inch read on the texture of the cheese. You get a perfect plug of cheese. It's a pretty important item! How could you leave that behind?"
His clientele of dressmakers and milliners has by now expanded to include antique dealers, prop stylists, and commercial photographers (including for The New York Times Magazine). The shop has served as the backdrop to a murder scene on TV, though Mr. Hecht declines to name the show.
Yet the secret to the shop's longevity remains the same. "A very simple machine, and a very troublesome one," said Mr. Hecht, patting a sewing machine on a recent afternoon.
He has a few mechanics on staff but handles many jobs himself, and that day, he had received a vintage Elna carried in by an art director in her 20s, Shelby Tuper.
Ms. Tuper is something of a regular, hunting for pieces for her freelance gigs, although that day she was getting the machine repaired for a company she was working for.
As Mr. Hecht opened the lid of the Elna, she stepped in chunky sneakers over the tourist chain and disappeared.
When she returned, she was holding a velvet purse with a silver clasp, a painted wooden box, a cigarette case the size of her palm. She looked at Mr. Hecht hopefully.
"There are a bunch of them back there," she said of the cigarette compact. "Some had ... not so exciting things inside."
"The lock of hair?" said Mr. Hecht.
She laughed.
"This," she said of the shop, "is my secret jewel."

Texto completo: Tim Page may have won a Pulitzer Prize for his music criticism, but readers might know his work from an array of disciplines: His tireless efforts to resurrect the work of mid-20th century novelist Dawn Powell gave her new attention after decades of relative obscurity. Page's bestselling 2009 autobiography, "Parallel Play," recounted his tempestuous youth living with undiagnosed Asperger's syndrome. For much of the 1980s, he hosted an afternoon new music show on WNYC in New York.
Before all that, he was the upstart star of "A Day with Timmy Page," a cult-classic 1967 documentary made about him when he was a precocious preteen filmmaker. Directed by Dave Hoffman, the short film shows young Timmy enthusiastically, at times tyrannically, directing friends in low-budget, furrow-browed super-8-mm movies.
Like a pint-sized Cecil B. DeMille, we see Page in his family's suburban Connecticut neighborhood as he wrangles his actors, gauges camera angles and shouts, "Action!" In cut-away interviews, the young Page expounds on French new wave directors and silent film stars with the intellect of the Pulitzer-Prize winning critic he'd become.

On Nov. 10 at the Echo Park Film Center, the Center for Home Movies will present a program that includes a rare screening of "A Day with Timmy Page," along with two films Page made as an adolescent auteur. Recently restored by the USC Hugh Hefner Moving Image Archive at the School of Cinematic Arts, Page's movies haven't been shown in five decades.
Page, who is a professor at both the Annenberg School of Journalism and the Thornton School of Music at USC, recalled his film work during a recent back-patio conversation at his home in Santa Monica. The conversation has been edited for length and clarity.
--
How did you come to be the subject of a documentary film when you were so young?
Dave Hoffman's nephew was occasionally in my films, and he told Dave about it. They came up and they stayed a day with me. Actually, now I'm going to get really obsessive on you. It was actually the night before, when I showed them my films, and then the whole day we shot this. So I guess it really was "a day with Timmy Page," but there was sleeping in the middle of it.
--
How did "A Day with Timmy Page" first achieve attention?
It was screened in 1968 at Lincoln Center as part of the New York Film Festival. It was the short feature with a [Swedish] film called "Hugo and Josephine," which was about two kids. They decided to make it a kids' program, and they showed it in what was then Philharmonic Hall. The New York Times did an article with me holding a camera like I'm filming. Esquire did an article on me. All of the sudden, everyone was interested in me.
--
How had you learned so much about film by such a young age?
I got a book as a remainder called "Classics of the Silent Screen," and I just became obsessed. I guess I would have been 10 or 11. I started to buy 8-mm versions of silent films, and I watched them all obsessively after school.
In 1966, I talked my dad into filming a film that I had written the script for, and after that, the camera sort of passed on to me. I liked the idea of having my friends over [to film]. We'd make these things where we pushed each other around or did spy movies. But we also did some that were actively striving for something. Those are the two ("Kyrie" and "Opus 21") that I'm showing. There are a lot more, and you really don't need to see them.
--
Half a century later, which have stood the test of time?
I particularly like the only film I ever did about kids, which is called "Opus 21." I like it because it's not everybody with a machine gun and blowing things up.
And I think it's rather a touching little film. I was a bullied as kid. I was autistic, and nobody realized that. So I was really, really good at some things, and I had some teachers who really loved me. I could recite the names and dates of the presidents back and forth. I could do all sorts of things, but I could not keep awake during an algebra class and I couldn't control myself. If I got angry, I'd have a real meltdown.
"Opus 21" is from 1967. And I had just started seventh grade and had been getting bullied a ton. And so I made a film about it. It was certainly autobiographical, and I was certainly depressed. It was filmed in my neighborhood. I was actually friends with the three bullies, but you know, they were actors. They played the bad guys. They were actually lovely people. And one of them was really one of my very, very best friends.
--
Did you show the films to your classmates?
I did screen some of my films for my classes, but not very often, because most people just thought I was one weird, angry kid. But I would show them to my friends. They'd come over, and we watch the movies, and we'd talk about what was good and what was bad.
--
When you watch "A Day with Timmy Page" now, do you recognize that boy? Are you glad you participated in the documentary?
I have mixed feelings about it. I don't really like the kid. You know, it was a kid really struggling hard to figure out what he wanted to do. I spent most of the rest of my time in my late teens getting high like a lot of other people from my generation. I also had mixed feelings about what it did to me, because it made me a little famous, but then, all the fame went away, and I was just sort of a stoned-out kid from Storrs, Conn., wondering what the hell I was going to do with my life.
--
When you say you were semi-famous, what do you mean?
Right after "A Day with Timmy Page" came out, Kodak got interested and they gave me a brand new Super 8 camera. Kodak made a one-minute commercial, and the first time it was run was before what was called "Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color." Kids all across the country were watching that, so I got recognized a couple of times. I signed my first autograph in the summer of '68.
--
Did that change your standing at all at school?
Not a whole lot. I think it was something that made me proud. It was something that set me aside and said, "You're not just a weird freak of nature. People are actually going to be interested in you, and there might be a life for you, somehow, in this."
--
Did it surprise you, 50 years later, that someone wants to make a program of your work?
I'm finding it a little odd because I turn 65 tomorrow. I've done so many different things in my life -- please don't let this sound like I'm bragging -- but I find that I've got fans in five or six different fields. The people who know my autism work don't know much about my music. Some of the music people, they're only interested in Glenn Gould or Phil Glass or someone like that. And then there's Dawn Powell.
And so I was really shocked when [the film request] came about. And I thought, you know, it would be really fun to talk about it all, because I think it all makes sense. Anything I was interested in, I went after. And I was lucky enough and in the right situation and intent enough that, you know, it all kind of worked.

Media worldwide attracted to 'super glue' assault case in Stockbridge

Texto completo: CHILTON — Ken Kratz has handled his share of high-profile cases, but the Calumet County prosecutor has never dealt with a media onslaught as powerful as the one generated by the super glue revenge case.
♦ Click here to sign up for news, weather and sports text alerts.
From the New York Daily News to the New York Times, and all the way across the Atlantic to news organizations in England, Germany and Italy, media outlets are stuck on the story of four women who lured a man to a motel to punish him for philandering. National late-night TV talk shows also have made light of it.
The story has staying power. It's been five days since the women — Therese A. Ziemann, 47, of Menasha; Wendy L. Sewell, 44, of Kaukauna; Michelle M. Belliveau, 43, of Neenah; and Tracy M. Hood-Davis, 30, of Fond du Lac — were charged, but Tuesday evening Kratz appeared on CNN to talk about the case.
Kratz has some guesses to why people are so fascinated. "It could be the super glue thing. It doesn't let go," he said.
The "super glue thing" is the titillating part of the case, and surely what's drawing attention. Ziemann used the powerful adhesive to attach the man's penis to his stomach, the criminal complaint says.
She also cut off his underwear and slapped him, and the others taunted him, prosecutors say, after Ziemann lured him to a Stockbridge motel room, where the man allowed her to tie him up. As soon as he was secure, Ziemann summoned the others by text message.
The women were angry, they told investigators, because they discovered he was cheating on his wife, Hood-Davis, with Ziemann and Sewell, neither of whom knew about the other relationships. Belliveau, who is Ziemann's sister, had no relationship and was there only to offer "moral support," Sewell told The Associated Press.
Although Kratz understands that some people find humor in the payback, prosecutors are taking it seriously, as reflected in the felony false imprisonment counts filed against all four women, as well as the fourth-degree sexual assault charge against Ziemann.
"The response has pretty much been that is a little too aggressive to not be held accountable for it," Kratz said.
At least one participant recognizes the incident was no joke.
Sewell told The AP the story has been twisted and she's embarrassed. "I am disturbed," she said. "I am upset. I am having a hard time handling life; an emotional wreck. I am ashamed."
Not surprisingly, the story has people abuzz in Stockbridge, a village of 1,500 people that is best known for sturgeon spearing each winter on nearby Lake Winnebago.
"There are a lot of jokes going around about it," said Fire Chief William Van Hoorn, whose department serves both the town and village of Stockbridge. "At the coffee shop in the morning, guys are talking about it."
Some TV programs have tried to put a serious spin on the story by bringing on legal experts to debate whether women are charged similarly to men in these situations. "It's important to treat women violent defenders like you would a guy," Kratz said.
Nonetheless, Kratz isn't fooled into believing he's talking to media across the world because people are interested in examining the issues of gender equity in the criminal justice system.
The reaction is similar to the international coverage of Lorena Bobbitt, the Virginia woman charged in 1993 with cutting off her husband's penis (she was acquitted in 1994 after showing she had been subjected to years of abuse by her husband).
"It is what it is," Kratz said, "but it's not an international case."

Texto completo: ALBANY – President Donald Trump is a New Yorker no more.
For decades, Trump was a symbol of Manhattan wealth and status, a real-estate developer whose name was emblazoned on buildings and face was often plastered on the tabloids.
But Trump's decision to change his legal residence from Trump Tower in Manhattan to his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida, means Trump will call a state other than New York home for the first time in his life.
"I cherish New York, and the people of New York, and always will, but unfortunately, despite the fact that I pay millions of dollars in city, state and local taxes each year, I have been treated very badly by the political leaders of both the city and state," Trump tweeted Thursday night.
New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo wasn't buying Trump's explanation, instead theorizing that a Florida move could somehow aid him in his bid to keep his tax returns private. (They're currently the subject of a subpoena from Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance, which Trump is fighting in federal court.)
"Good riddance, Mr. Trump," Cuomo told reporters Friday in Albany.
Here's a look at some of Trump's extensive New York history:
Son of a Bronx-born developer Donald Trump's origins in the state can be traced back to when his grandparents on his father's side immigrated to New York from Germany.
Fred Trump, Donald's father, was born in the Bronx in 1905 and would go on to become a real estate developer where he made millions. He eventually married Mary Anne MacLeod, a Scottish immigrant.
The couple would go on to have five children, including the eventual 45th president of the United States.
Donald Trump is a Queens native Donald Trump was born in Jamaica Hospital in Queens on June 14, 1946.
He spent the first four years of his life living in a 2,000-square-foot home his father built in 1940 as part of the Jamaica Estates.
The family eventually moved to a larger home in the same neighborhood, according to the New York Times.
Trump went to school in Orange County When he was a teenager, Trump attended the New York Military Academy beginning in 1959.
Trump would spend the next four years at the academy in Cornwall-on-Hudson, an Orange County village about an hour north of New York City.
He graduated from the academy in 1964 and would go on to attend Fordham University where he would study business administration before transferring to the Wharton School of Business at Pennsylvania University.
Took over the Trump Organization Trump took over his father's real estate business in 1971, rebranding the business as the Trump Organization.
Trump would go on to become one of New York City's major real-estate developers, cultivating his image through frequent appearances in the pages of the city's famed tabloid newspapers.
His organization went on to develop sites big and small in Manhattan, including Trump Tower, Trump Plaza, the Commodore Hotel and the Wollman ice skating rink in Central Park.
Trump Tower opened in 1983.
The Manhattan building most associated with Trump is the Fifth Avenue skyscraper that bears his name.
Trump Tower opened in 1983, giving the future president a marquee, 58-floor building in the heart of Midtown with retail, office and residential space.
Donald and Melania Trump have a three-story penthouse home there, which served as their primary residence until last month, when they filed legal paperwork shifting their residence to Mar-a-Lago.
Trump considered running for governor In 2014, with Cuomo seeking a second term, a group of Republicans tried to woo Trump into running for governor.
Trump publicly said he would consider a run, one of his many flirtations with seeking office before he launched his 2016 presidential campaign.
He went as far as speaking at a rally against New York's SAFE Act, a series of gun control laws, outside the state Capitol, buzzing his Trump-emblazoned helicopter over the crowd on his way out of town.
But he ultimately decided against a run, blaming Westchester County Executive Rob Astorino and Republicans for failing to unify behind him. (Astorino ultimately became the GOP nominee, losing to Cuomo.)
A portrait of Donald Trump hangs on the wall at the New York Military Academy in Cornwall-on-Hudson, New York, on Sept. 8, 2016.

Texto completo: On a recent afternoon, Candace Bushnell and I were sitting at the poolside bar of the Beverly Hills Hotel. It had been 25 years since she had submitted her first "Sex and the City" column to the New York Observer, the weekly broadsheet where I was an editor. In that quarter century, during which Candace and I remained close friends, the column became a book, which became the wildly popular HBO series (running from 1998 to 2004 and winning several Emmys for its stars), which was followed by two movies, "Sex and the City" in 2008 (worldwide box office $415 million) and "Sex and the City 2" in 2010 ($294 million).
Candace was wearing a gray pinstriped, men's-style vintage Tuleh jacket, flowered linen shirt, white silk trousers and leather Gucci slippers lined with lambswool. She ordered scrambled eggs and a pink Frose cocktail. Tan, whippet-thin and preternaturally optimistic, Candace swivels between impish and WASPish -- the "New England stiff upper lip" she was raised with in Connecticut sharing time with the crooked smile that made her a Meg Ryan doppelganger and It-Girl of demimonde Manhattan in the 1990s.
This summer, Grove Press published Candace's most recent book, her eighth, "Is There Still Sex in the City?" part memoir, part dating guide for women over 50. Candace is developing the book into a TV series with Paramount Television and Anonymous Content; she is cowriting the pilot and will serve as executive producer. If she was a sensation in her 30s, Candace has become a franchise at 60.

"When I first got the column, the first thing I thought was, 'This will be my big break,'" she said of her 34-year-old self. "I felt like I had been practicing for that moment for years. And when something like that happens to a woman, people tend to think, 'Oh, it's a random thing, and you just kind of got lucky.' No. I'd been working professionally in journalism since I was 19. And one of the continual frustrations of being me at that time was the incredible sexism. Those were real #MeToo times. I find out now there are men out there who actively tried to sabotage my career. One even told me so. That's one of the things that I really remember, is how the men behaved, and how as a woman you had to negotiate all of this. You're trying to make a living against a backdrop where the negotiations are not straightforward. They're always muddied by sexism."
Candace's initial title for her new book had been "Middle-Aged Madness." In 2011 her husband, former New York City Ballet principal ballet dancer Charles Askegard, asked her for a divorce. (They had married in 2002, in a union chronicled in the "Vows" column of the New York Times.) "I felt like the system had defeated me," she writes in the book. "Not only could I lose my home but I was about to become one more of the millions of middle-aged women who would get divorced that year. Who would have to get back out there, to once again look for a man who doesn't exist."
Candace wrote most of the book in her home in Sag Harbor, Long Island. (She also has an apartment on Manhattan's Upper East Side.) Over those two years, her father died and her best friend, publicist Jeanine Pepler, committed suicide. During that time she also started dating Jim Coleman, a tall and strapping real estate advisor whom she met the old-fashioned way, at a party, and to whom she dedicates her new book. They were introduced by Chris Noth, the actor who played Mr. Big on "Sex and the City."
"We live in a time when it seems like people have to keep starting over and over again," Candace said. "The reality is that there are losses. It's also a time when people feel like, 'It's now or never to change my life.' In your 50s, you start to run out of steam. You've been doing everything and going so hard, and you get numb, because you've got this routine and you're doing it over and over again. But then these losses hit you; there's divorce, death. They make you sad and they do change your idea of who you are in the world. They can set off a bout of middle-aged madness, where the core of it is, you're trying to figure out what to do to feel better about your life.
"One of the things that also happens to people is feeling like you are 12 again," she continued. "Women aren't menopausal forever. According to research I've done, you technically can only be menopausal for one year. And then you're postmenopausal.
"Some women have said -- and I had this experience too, when the hormones kind of go all of a sudden -- you feel like you're 12 again, the way you felt before you even had any damn hormones! Now I know it sounds kind of kooky. People do go a little bit crazy -- like there's a desire for running, a desire for dancing, for movement. The person may start hanging out with people who are much younger.
"If somebody is in the middle of this middle-aged madness -- for instance, they're dancing or they're drinking too much and they're behaving in a way that's not themselves -- don't try to stop them, because they also could be very angry, and they will no doubt yell at you."
If "Sex and the City" served as a blissfully unreliable narrator for women in their 20s and 30s, Bushnell's gimlet eye has swiveled toward women in their 50s and 60s who are grappling with a "hazy future."
"You end up getting divorced and you haven't been in the job market in a serious way for 20 years. You have no income and you're trying to get a job you had 30 years ago," she said. "It's really a feeling, 'Well, I came full circle.' It's not the fairy tale ending that women are promised.
"What's interesting is that doesn't seem to really matter, what choices you've made," she continued. "Although what ends up mattering the most is not love but money. And, you know, that's very, very harsh."
Candace said she loves what she's seeing in the work of younger women writers. "I'm very impressed," she said. "I think women writers right now are really at the forefront. There is a serious level of thinking and analysis that women weren't really allowed to do when I was in my 20s. I look at all these young women -- many of them seem to have gone to Ivy League schools and had quite a bit of education. They're not off-the-cuff, cowboy researchers like me."
She took a sip of her pink drink and laughed. "That's an edible flower," she said.

Texto completo: The former Texas congressman, who energized Democrats in a Senate race last year, began his White House run to great fanfare but failed to build significant support.
Former Representative Beto O'Rourke of Texas announced on Friday that he was dropping out of the presidential race, ending a campaign in which he struggled for months to recapture the energy of his insurgent 2018 Senate candidacy on a national stage full of other big personalities and liberal champions.
Mr. O'Rourke made the decision to quit the race in the middle of this week, on the eve of a gathering of Democratic presidential candidates in Iowa, according to people familiar with his thinking. He is not expected to run for any other office in 2020, despite persistent efforts by party leaders and political donors to coax him into another bid for the Senate.
His campaign has been under extreme financial strain, and Mr. O'Rourke's advisers concluded that proceeding in the race might have meant making deep cuts to his staff in order to pay for advertising and other measures to compete in the early primary and caucus state.
Mr. O'Rourke confirmed his withdrawal in a post on Medium and in an email message to his supporters. In that message, Mr. O'Rourke said he was proud of championing issues like guns and climate change but conceded that his campaign lacked "the means to move forward successfully."
"My service to the country will not be as a candidate or as the nominee," he said.
By leaving the race, Mr. O'Rourke completes the winding path from his early status as a potential front-runner to his drastic decision over the summer to reframe his candidacy as an activist crusader following the mass shooting targeting Latinos in his home city of El Paso.
Since then, Mr. O'Rourke has campaigned doggedly on issues related to guns and race, calling most notably for federal gun-control policies that would require owners of assault-style weapons to surrender them to the government. That's a far more aggressive stance than most Democratic presidential candidates have endorsed.
That last phase of his campaign has taken Mr. O'Rourke far beyond the early-state circuit, and included visits with prison inmates in California and an immigrant community in Mississippi. In an August interview following the El Paso massacre, Mr. O'Rourke said his focus would be "taking the fight to Donald Trump" and "being with those who have been denigrated and demeaned."
In recent weeks, he has also criticized other Democrats in newly strident terms, declaring in September that Senator Chuck Schumer, the New York Democrat and Senate minority leader, had accomplished "absolutely nothing" on gun control. Mr. Schumer, an architect of gun control legislation in the 1990s, said he saw no support in the party for Mr. O'Rourke's stance on requiring gun owners to surrender certain firearms.
At a rally in Des Moines on Friday evening, Mr. O'Rourke told supporters he made his decision "so recently and so reluctantly."
"We have to clearly see at this point that we do not now have the means" to continue, he said, adding: "Though this is the end of this campaign, we are right in the middle of this fight."
In a hallway outside the venue of an Iowa Democrats dinner, where Mr. O'Rourke had been scheduled to appear, a black-draped table for his campaign was abandoned Friday night.
Passers-by helped themselves from the roll of "Beto" stickers sitting on the table, near a cardboard box full of one-sheet guides to "our most common cheers."
"So sad!" a woman exclaimed as she walked by. "It's so sad."
Mr. O'Rourke entered the 2020 primary in the middle of March with the aura of a celebrity, cheered by rank-and-file Democrats and admired by no less a figure than former President Barack Obama for his near-miss challenge to Senator Ted Cruz in the nation's largest red state. He effectively unveiled his run for the White House in a cover story for Vanity Fair in which he declared he was "just born to be in it." He later described the cover, along with his choice of words, as a mistake.
In the earliest days of his campaign, Mr. O'Rourke was a fund-raising powerhouse, collecting more than $ 6 million in his first day as a candidate. But his fund-raising cratered almost immediately. He raised more in his first 48 hours than in the following 100 days, and steadily depleted his campaign treasury by spending more than he was taking in.
And despite the near-heroic status he achieved in the eyes of Democratic voters as a daring challenger to a Republican they loathed -- Mr. Cruz -- Mr. O'Rourke found it far more difficult to stand out from a crop of presidential candidates that included other young orators, like Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., and determined progressives like Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts.
Mr. O'Rourke also came under harsh attack in a June debate from Julián Castro, the former housing secretary and a fellow Texan, who blasted Mr. O'Rourke from the left on immigration. Mr. O'Rourke, who was not an especially strong debater in his Senate campaign, appeared badly caught off guard.
To Mr. O'Rourke and his allies, it has been evident for some time that he was confronting a vanishingly slim path forward. At the last Democratic debate, a pair of Mr. O'Rourke's donors flew to Ohio to meet with him about his campaign and the possibility of him quitting the race to run for Senate in Texas against John Cornyn, who is up for re-election. Mr. O'Rourke told them he was not running for Senate, according to people familiar with the matter.
A spokesman to Mr. O'Rourke reiterated that stance on Friday.
"Beto will not be a candidate for U.S. Senate in Texas in 2020," said Rob Friedlander, an aide to Mr. O'Rourke.
It is unclear whether Mr. O'Rourke's exit will have a significant impact on the larger shape of the Democratic primary race. In a New York Times/Siena College poll released on Friday, Mr. O'Rourke was supported by just 1 percent of likely Democratic caucusgoers in Iowa. He had not yet met the thresholds for participating in the upcoming primary debates in November and December.
Mr. O'Rourke may find -- as other former candidates have done -- that the good will of his fellow Democrats returns quickly once he is no longer a competitor for the nomination. He is 47 years old, leaving him plenty of time to consider a return to electoral politics. But in a recent interview with Politico, Mr. O'Rourke said that if he did not prevail in the 2020 presidential primary he would not become a candidate again.
"I cannot fathom a scenario where I would run for public office again if I'm not the nominee," Mr. O'Rourke said last month.

Friday rail headaches began with downed tree in West Haven

Texto completo: Connecticut’s commuting complications Friday were rooted in a downed tree that fell across the train tracks in West Haven.
“There was a big tree that came down on the line in West Haven,” Gov. Ned Lamont said during a press conference in New Haven. “An incoming freight train saw the signalization was down, saw the tree, and that’s what gave us the alert that we had to work on that.”
Officials throughout the state were prepared for power outages and commuting issues Friday after an overnight storm brought gusts of up to 80 mph. But once they learned of the rail blockage in West Haven, a “general deterioration” of rail service ensued, Department of Transportation Commissioner Joseph Giulietti said.
“To say that we had a very bad night is an understatement,” he said.
Hundreds of employees were called in to work early to clear the rails and get the trains running again.
“It’s extraordinary the work folks did coming in at 2 o’clock in the morning, hundreds of people on call, DOT, Amtrak,” said the governor.
Lamont mentioned that one Amtrak train, which had about 150 passengers, was stranded at New Haven Union Station for about seven hours.
Jason Abrams, spokesperson for Amtrak, said the train arrived in New Haven around 12:40 a.m. It was canceled at 5:48 a.m., meaning customers were on board for five hours. The train, which was scheduled to travel from Boston to Newport News, VA., did not leave the station until about 7:30 a.m.
Abrams said no alternative transportation was provided for the customers.
Service on Metro-North Railroad was shut down between New Haven and Westport for much of Friday morning before being restored at about 8 a.m.
Even then, there were still heavy residual delays.
It took until about 11:30 a.m. for trains to begin running on or close to schedule on the New Haven Line and until about 1 p.m. for the Waterbury line.
Jeff Maron, vice chairman of the Connecticut Commuter Rail Council, said his commute from Stamford to Grand Central was a mess Friday morning, with trains delayed multiple times and plenty of commuters standing in the aisles of the train once it left the station.
While he gives a lot of credit to engineers who went out to fix the problems, Maron remains critical and frustrated with Metro-North’s recurring issues with long delays.
“Why can’t we systemically fix these issues? I don’t want to hear that it’s debt,” he said.
Metro-North has said in the past that it has a “robust” tree trimming program. Maron is skeptical of its effectiveness.
“Either they’re doing a poor job or they’re not doing what they said,” Maron said.
About three months ago, fallen trees caused major delays on Metro-North trains, including one “nightmare” train ride that lasted seven hours from New York City to Fairfield.
New York Times reporter Neil Vigdor was stuck on one of those delayed trains in August, taking to Twitter to document his five-hour “train ride from hell.”
On Thursday night he again turned to social media, tweeting about the delays on a train he was traveling on from Grand Central to Greenwich Thursday night. This time around, the trip took two and a half hours.
At one point, the train Vigdor was traveling in picked up commuters on a disabled train, who were moved from one train to the other on a movable ramp.
Maron said that as such instances pile up, he’s noticed an ever-growing fatigue from riders.
“They’re tired of paying, they’re tired of standing the whole way. ... They’re tired of these types of incidents happening repeatedly,” he said.
And he said complaints tend to fall on deaf ears.
“The probability of a complaint achieving its desired goal is lower now than it ever was historically,” he said.
Giulietti, a former Metro-North president, said officials have to look at how to prevent outages like Friday’s from becoming too frequent.
Giulietti suggested drones could be used in the future to better inspect for storm damage, for example.
He said he would discuss more ideas with Lamont and other officials.
“One of the things we have to concentrate on is the fact that you can’t have things like this that are shutting down every transit system we have out there,” he said.

Don’t read David Brooks if you want to know what really happened with Trump and Ukraine

Texto completo: Most people have no idea what’s going on with impeachment and why it’s happening. That's largely because most people are getting their information from a terrible national news media.
To wit, here’s how New York Times columnist and psychology hobbyist David Brooks summed up the impeachment affair on Thursday: “The evidence against Trump is overwhelming. This Ukraine quid pro quo wasn’t just a single reckless phone call. It was a multiprong several-month campaign to use the levers of American power to destroy a political rival.”
All of that is not just wrong, it’s ignorant.
The evidence against Trump is “overwhelming” for Brooks only because he, like the rest of the general public, knows little about what’s going on. He knows that the impeachment has some vague relation to a “quid pro quo” and “abuse of power” and that President Trump apparently wanted to hurt Joe Biden, who has a nonzero but increasingly diminished chance at becoming the Democratic presidential nominee.
There was no “quid pro quo” because Trump, to all indications, received nothing in exchange. That’s not to say that he shouldn’t have received anything. I know that the permanent bureaucracy in Washington works under the assumption that it’s only OK for American taxpayers to bleed money abroad if they get nothing in return, but that’s not the way it has to be.
(There’s also the fact that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 election for the explicit purpose of hurting Trump’s campaign, but let’s not get sidetracked.)
We have seen absolutely no substantive evidence that Trump's delay in monetary aid for Ukraine was done with the intent “to destroy a political rival.”
Some of the career government employees who were on Trump’s phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky have testified behind closed doors that they got queasy about Trump’s call and that they worried that his request that Ukraine root out any corruption related to the 2016 election and Joe Biden might appear partisan.
Well, OK, it’s their right to feel queasy and raise any concerns that they have, but they weren’t elected to run the country. Besides, there are reasons for Trump’s request outside politics.
The call took place in July, half a year before what will be the first contest of the Democratic presidential primary. We have no more idea today who will be the party’s nominee than we had then. Just because Biden is in the contest and has a chance doesn’t make him immune to scrutiny. If anything, it means that he really, really deserves scrutiny. He himself has admitted he was nervous about what his middle-aged son was doing as a board member of a sketchy gas company in Ukraine.
Any idea that Trump attempted to deploy “the levers of American power to destroy a political rival” requires that you start with the assumption that no one in politics can ever be targeted for corruption or even criminal activity.
But we know that’s not true. If it were, then Trump’s 2016 campaign would have never been investigated by Obama’s FBI. And Democrats would be out of bounds in their pursuit of Trump’s tax returns.
Is anyone in the national media saying that? Of course not.
Don’t listen to them if you really want to know what’s going on here.

Texto completo: Varias calles son cerradas anualmente durante el Maratón de Nueva York, el más popular del mundo, que atraviesa los cinco condados hasta por lo menos la media tarde del domingo.
Adicionalmente este año, la anunciada visita del mandatario Donald Trump mañana sábado a la ciudad, quedándose hasta el domingo, perfilan una complicación aún mayor en el tráfico de autos y buses.
Trump tiene previsto asistir a una pelea en Madison Square Garden el sábado, según el diario New York Times.
Cada visita suya genera cierre de calles para desplegar su comitiva y controlar posibles protestas. La de mañana será su primera estancia en Nueva York, su ciudad natal, tras anunciar anoche que, al término de su gobierno, se mudará a Florida, alegando que los políticos locales “me han tratado muy mal”.
Durante el maratón de NYC, que se celebra el primer domingo de noviembre y coincide con la entrada del horario invernal, muchas rutas de autobuses son canceladas o redireccionadas y algunas accesos al Metro son cerrados, para garantizar la seguridad de los corredores y de los miles de seguidores que los siguen desde las calles.
En Manhattan, las zonas más restringidas el domingo serán el Upper East Side, Central Park South y West, incluyendo los accesos a la Torres Trump de la 5ta Avenida.
Como es tradición, NYPD ha anunciado su estrategia de seguridad tras la reciente muerte del líder del grupo Estado Islámico (ISIS), Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi durante una redada en Siria; y además las recurrentes balaceras causadas por civiles estadounidenses, aprovechando grandes concentraciones y la venta libre de armas y municiones en muchas regiones del país.
La información más actualizada sobre el transporte posible puede consultarse aquí.
Weekend Plans: Trump is tentatively scheduled to go to NYC to attend an MMA event at Madison Square Garden on Sat night, per sources.
Stay over at Trump Tower.
Great news for traffic on NYC Marathon Sunday.

RBG Deserves to Be Believed; A new tale from Bill Clinton implies that she misled the Senate.

Texto completo: Remarks by former President Bill Clinton this week appear to contradict a 1993 sworn statement from Ruth Bader Ginsburg about their discussions prior to her confirmation as a Supreme Court Justice. History suggests readers should be skeptical of the Clinton claim.
Justice Ginsburg was present when Mr. Clinton made the comments on Wednesday evening in Washington, but may not have expected the need to address details of a decades-old conversation as alleged by Mr. Clinton.
The former President and the current Justice were on stage along with former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton at Georgetown Law's second annual Ruth Bader Ginsburg lecture. The three were being interviewed by Georgetown law professors Wendy Williams and Mary Hartnett, who are the Justice's authorized biographers.
Adam Liptak of the New York Times notes that Mr. Clinton was discussing a 1993 interview with Ms. Ginsburg which occurred while he was considering nominating her to the Court:
"I knew after about 10 minutes that I was going to give her the job," he said.
They discussed abortion, Mr. Clinton said. Justice Ginsburg, then a federal appeals court judge, had been critical of aspects of Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court decision that established a constitutional right to abortion.
The Supreme Court had moved too fast, Justice Ginsburg wrote in 1992. It would have sufficed, she wrote, to strike down the extreme Texas law at issue in the case and then proceed in measured steps in later cases to consider other abortion restrictions.
Mr. Clinton said Judge Ginsburg talked freely about all of this. "She made a heck of a case," he said. "We were just two people alone, and she was telling me what she honestly thought."
In a video excerpt of the event from ABC News, Mr. Clinton prefaces the story by telling the assembled audience at Georgetown, "There was one thing that we did discuss and I feel that I should tell you because it will illustrate why I thought I should appoint her." He then explained how abortion had been "a big issue" in his 1992 election and that he had run as a pro-choice candidate. Then Mr. Clinton said:
She knew this perfectly well, that I was under a lot of pressure to make sure I appointed someone who was simon-pure, which I had said I thought was important.
Mr. Clinton then goes on to describe how the potential nominee described her thinking on the issue, which includes a belief that there's a strong case for abortion rights on equal protection grounds, not just privacy.
Ed Whelan writes in National Review:
By "someone who was simon-pure," Clinton clearly means someone who would surely support the proposition that the Constitution confers an expansive abortion right... Clinton's candid account of this conversation strikes me as rather difficult to reconcile with nominee Ginsburg's sworn testimony to the Senate in 1993. The Senate questionnaire that Ginsburg completed included this question:
Has anyone involved in the process of selecting you as a judicial nominee (including but not limited to a member of the White House staff, the Justice Department, or the Senate or its staff) discussed with you any specific case, legal issue or question in a manner that could reasonably be interpreted as seeking any express or implied assurances concerning your position on such case, issue, or question? If so, please explain fully.
In response ( see p. 108 of hearing record ), Ginsburg wrote:
It is inappropriate, in my judgment, to seek from any nominee for judicial office assurance on how that individual would rule in a future case. That judgment was shared by those involved in the process of selecting me. No such person discussed with me any specific case, legal issue or question in a manner that could reasonably be interpreted as seeking any express or implied assurances concerning my position on such case, issue, or question.
But Clinton has just stated publicly that he did discuss Roe with her precisely in order to get the assurances he needed on her position on abortion. And he has further stated that Ginsburg "knew this perfectly well."
Mr. Whelan concludes, "Clinton sure seems to be saying that Ginsburg lied to the Senate."
It's hard to argue on Justice Ginsburg's behalf if one believes that the witness reporting this alleged conversation is credible. But history gives ample reason for doubt. On Wednesday Mr. Clinton was talking about events early in his presidency but it's worth noting a few of the events that occurred at the very end.
In early 2001 Mr. Clinton admitted that his own sworn testimony had been false when he was attempting to thwart a sexual harassment lawsuit filed against him by Paula Jones, an Arkansas state employee during his time as governor of the state.
In January of 2001 Neil Lewis reported in the New York Times:
Mr. Clinton today agreed to a settlement in which he will avoid the possibility of indictment in exchange for admitting that he gave false testimony under oath and agreeing to surrender his law license for five years...
Mr. Clinton also agreed to pay a fine of $25,000 to the Arkansas Bar Association, which had been considering whether to have him disbarred... In Pulaski County Court in Arkansas, where Mr. Clinton was facing a trial after he left office on charges by a bar committee over his fitness to practice law, a judge today approved the resolution of a five-year suspension of his law license.
CNN reported at the time:
In the end, Mr. Clinton paid $850,000 to settle the Jones case, a $90,000 fine for contempt of court for giving misleading testimony, the new $25,000 fine to settle the disbarment proceedings.
Justice Ginsburg deserves every benefit of the doubt in responding to the new Clinton claim.

Texto completo: From "Trump, Zuckerberg & Pals Are Breaking America," Thomas Friedman, New York Times, Oct. 30:
Look at Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, who was questioned last Wednesday at a House hearing by Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. A.O.C. was trying to grasp why Zuckerberg thinks it's O.K. for politicians to run political ads that contain obvious lies . . . .
This is all about money for Zuckerberg, but he disguises his motives in some half-baked theory about freedom of the press.
---
From the New York Times "Advertising Acceptability Manual":
We believe that the broad principles of freedom of the press confer on us an obligation to keep our advertising columns open to all points of view. Therefore, The New York Times accepts advertisements in which groups or individuals comment on public or controversial issues. We make no judgments on an advertiser's arguments, factual assertions or conclusions . . . . We do not verify, nor do we vouch for, statements of purported fact in advocacy/opinion advertisements. We reserve the right, however, to require documentation of factual claims when it is deemed necessary . . . .
Our stance with regard to the acceptance of political advertisements is the same as it is for the acceptance of opinion advertisements.

TV 'Prosperity Gospel' Pastor Hired for a White House Role

Texto completo: Ms. White, a controversial figure even among evangelical Christians, will be overseeing a White House division that conducts outreach to key parts of the president's base.
Paula White, a televangelist based in Florida and personal pastor to President Trump whom he has known since 2002, has joined the Trump administration in an official capacity, according to a White House official.
Ms. White will work in the Office of Public Liaison, the official said, which is the division of the White House overseeing outreach to groups and coalitions organizing key parts of the president's base. Her role will be to advise the administration's Faith and Opportunity Initiative, which Mr. Trump established last year by executive order and which aims to give religious groups more of a voice in government programs devoted to issues like defending religious liberty and fighting poverty.
As Mr. Trump campaigns for a second term, he cannot afford to lose support from the religious conservatives who voted for him in 2016 in significant numbers. Without their backing, his path to re-election would be significantly narrower.
He has taken repeated steps to ensure they turn out for him again -- by issuing executive orders, making cabinet appointments and nominating federal judges that pass muster with the religious right. On a range of issues from abortion rights to tax exemptions for churches, Mr. Trump has tried to grant Christian conservatives their policy wish lists whenever legally and politically feasible.
But Ms. White cannot be easily categorized as either a political asset or a liability. She has a large following among Christians who believe in the "prosperity gospel," which teaches that God blesses people he deems to be of strong faith with wealth, good health and other gifts.
But many other Christians consider these beliefs to be heresy. And Ms. White's presence in the top tier of Mr. Trump's coterie of informal religious advisers has long been a source of contention with many evangelical Christians.
Despite this controversy, Ms. White has remained in good standing with Mr. Trump, who invited her to deliver an invocation at his inauguration and has hosted her as a guest at the White House numerous times. In a recent interview with The New York Post to promote her new book, she said she sometimes visits the White House several times a week.
In the interview, she spoke admiringly of the president's intellect. "He's in total control," she told The Post. "He's not at all impulsive -- he's so far ahead of everyone, very much a strategic thinker."

Texto completo: Our guide to the city's best classical music and opera happening this weekend and in the week ahead.
BRENTANO STRING QUARTET at Zankel Hall (Nov. 6, 7:30 p.m.). Matthew Aucoin's String Quartet, in its New York premiere, is the highlight of this solid foursome's Carnegie appearance. Also on the bill are Mozart's String Quartet in E flat and Ravel's String Quartet in F.
212-247-7800, carnegiehall.org
BRITTEN SINFONIA AND THE SIXTEEN at Alice Tully Hall (Nov. 7, 7:30 p.m.). James MacMillan's works are not often spotlighted in New York, but the Scottish composer has been a key figure in British music for some time. Here Harry Christophers leads an excellent chamber orchestra and his own chorus in the United States premieres of MacMillan's "Miserere" and "Stabat Mater." Other British music at Alice Tully Hall includes an extraordinarily rare performance of Harrison Birtwistle's "Silbury Air" with Jeffrey Milarsky on the podium for a free AXIOM concert on Friday.
212-721-6500, lincolncenter.org
CHAMBER MUSIC SOCIETY OF LINCOLN CENTER at the Rose Studio (Nov. 7, 7:30 p.m.). The society presents a series this season, New Milestones, that includes a good amount of contemporary music set in the context of chamber music from the last century or so. This first of four concerts features the premiere of John Corigliano's "The Food of Love" for oboe and cello, and includes selections from John Cage's "Sonatas and Interludes," played by Gilles Vonsattel, as well as music by Elliott Carter and Ruth Crawford.
212-875-5788, chambermusicsociety.org
[Read about the events that our other critics have chosen for the week ahead.]
ANGELA HEWITT at the 92nd Street Y (Nov. 2, 8 p.m.). Hewitt is nearing the end of her Bach Odyssey at the Y, a multiyear survey of the composer's complete keyboard works. Before her final recitals in April and May, she performs three of the English Suites and the Sonata in D. Also at the Y in the coming week, the Geneva Camerata plays Lully and Mozart in a program on Wednesday called "Dance of the Sun," featuring the dancer Martí Corbera and choreography by Juan Kruz Díaz de Garaio Esnaola that has the entire orchestra on the move.
212-415-5500, 92y.org
NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC at David Geffen Hall (Nov. 6, 7:30 p.m.; through Nov. 12). Esa-Pekka Salonen, the conductor who got away from the Philharmonic and is about to embark on what is sure to be an adventure as the new music director of the San Francisco Symphony, constructed this program around a composer who is still something of an acquired taste: Paul Hindemith. In addition to Hindemith's "Mathis der Maler" Symphony and his "Ragtime (Well-Tempered)," Salonen conducts two of Schoenberg's arrangements of chorale preludes by Bach, and a piece of his own, "Gemini."

Texto completo: As part of a series of programs to celebrate the approaching 50th anniversary of Medgår Evers College, the academic schools of the college hosted on Monday, Oct. 21, 2019, a special lecture featuring the acclaimed journalist Linda Villarosa, who is the director of journalism at City College of New York and an assistant professor of Media Communication Arts. She is also a contributing writer for the New York Times magazine's 1619 Project which examines the ongoing effects of the crime of slavery. Villarosa is the former executive editor for Essence magazine and is also the author of several books.
Villarosa's presentation centered on the critical role that race and inequality plays in determining health outcomes for Black people across the United States regardless of a person's income. Pointing to the fact that the most advanced medical technological equipment is in the U.S. and noting the reality that the greatest per capita wealth is in the U.S., her journalistic research poses the question of why African Americans experience such poor health status when compared to whites, specifically with infant mortality rates, overall life expectancy and the mortality rates of African American mothers soon after and/or during giving birth.
Villarosa explained, "The issue is really hiding in plain sight. That is race. If Black people here in the U.S. were in an African country.. .then our health outcomes would be equivalent to what many African countries indicate. So instead of us running to Africa we need to look at home. We need to first look at what's going on with Black Americans. Black men have the lowest life expectancy of all ethnic or gender groups.
"Black babies today are two to three times more likely to die than white babies. This gap is larger than it was in 1850 when B acks were still enslaved. Something is wrong and we need to change hew we are booking at the problem."
Viliarosa continued, "Hearing about statistics that revealed that a Black woman today, with a college degree and even an advanced college degree, is three to four times more likely to die during childbirth than a white women with a eighth grade education was the poin: at which I realized I had to listen. It led to me doing nine months of research on health disparities and formed the basis for my contribution to the 1619 Project that was published on the front page cf the New York Times magazine in August ofrhis year."
The lecture diared alarming details on how racism practically contributes to inhumane, insulting and very traumatizing medical treatment of Black women wheth эг it be during pregnancy, attempting to communicate illness to a doctor or even during labor and delivery of a baby.
Villamsa detailed :he stery of a Black women in New Or.eans who, during a couple of doctor visits, complained to her doctor about having serious head pains, and even an elevated temperature during one visi:, bur was repeatecly told by her doctor to just taxe more Tylenol. This woman was in fact experiencing Pre-eclampsia (high blood pressure caused oy protein in urinei. The doctor's racism and the health system's lack of a regulatory requirement for a standardized follow-up "protocol" for checking the medical status of the mother resulted in her baby dying and she almost dying.
Opened in 1970, Medgår Evers College has a mandate to meet the educational and social needs of Central Brooklyn. In honor of the late civti righrs leader Medgår Wiley Evers, after which the college is named, its mission is to inspire and prepare future generations of people to continue advancing the need for social and economic justee such as the heroic Mr. Evers did.

Texto completo: An old buddy of Adam Gase’s was on the air this week. The friend had been on record saying how much he enjoyed playing for the New York Jets, so when he followed up by saying how fond he was of Gase, there was no doubt which side of the aisle he was on.
“Adam Gase, you’re my guy,” retired receiver Brandon Marshall said on Showtime’s “Inside the NFL.” “I love you, but if this continues, he has to go. He has to go. This is bad. We’re not even competing out there.”
It’s a good thing, one
supposes, Gase has friends like these, because as brutal as Marshall was on a guy he played under in Denver, the rest of New York is torching Gase. Somebody should dial 911 and ask for Fireman Ed, because this man is on fire.
Anybody getting ripped this badly at home would logically be grateful to hit the road, but imagine how humbling it must be for Gase to be 1-6 as he returns Sunday to face his old team, the Dolphins.
Chances are, a segment of Dolphins fans are savoring the chance to jeer a coach who led a steady regression the past two years after making the playoffs in 2016. Chances also are there is nothing fans can say that hasn’t been topped by media critics in New York:
“A man who is not a leader in any way, shape or form.”
“Never seen anything this stupid.”
“Must be fired immediately.”
There’s plenty more. NFL coaches like to say they don’t open the paper to see what’s written about him. The New York Daily News made sure Gase doesn’t have to. Amid controversy over the handling of former Pro Bowl guard Kelechi Osemele, who ignored team doctors’ advice and underwent shoulder surgery, the paper ran Gase’s photo on its back cover with the headline “DR. DO-LITTLE.”
But it’s people inside the building who count, right? That’s the crutch NFL people — Gase included — subscribe to. Jets CEO Christopher Johnson was caught in a viral video telling a fan “hopefully the team will actually show up this week.”
It didn’t. Jaguars 29, Jets 15.
It’s no wonder, then, that when Gase participated in a conference call with the South Florida media Wednesday afternoon, the first question was, “You miss us?”
“I’m not going to comment,” Gase said, which could be construed two ways: 1) No or 2) Yes, but I don’t want to give these writers up here any more ammo.
“Those are things I can’t worry about,” Gase said. “I’ve got to worry about getting our guys ready.”
If only that’s all he has to worry about. Safety Jamal Adams — who’s 24 and a team captain — went on Twitter to deny asking to be traded. Then, after the trade deadline passed Tuesday, Adams tweeted that general manager Joe Douglas “went behind my back and shopped me around to teams.” Reports were that the Jets also shopped running back Le’Veon Bell, who in short order went from being the Jets’ free-agent prize to expendable, with a career-worst 3.2 yards per rush and ranking 28th in the NFL with 349 yards.
Jets fans woke up Monday morning to hear Boomer Esiason ranting on WFAN.
“This really has got Adam Gase’s fingerprints all over this now,” Esiason said. “He’s really controlling this franchise. I know there’s a general manager in name — and in name only — we haven’t seen nor heard from him at all. This is Adam Gase’s team. This is the mess that he’s created.”
Even the more-reserved New York Times ran a lengthy analysis of the Osemele situation under the headline, “Kelechi Osemele’s staredown with the Jets over a painful injury pulled back the curtain on the ugly reality of a league that views athletes as commodities.”
Gase admitted he hadn’t spoken to Osemele about the injury. Esiason said the “NFL Today” crew he works with at CBS on Sundays has hundreds of years of NFL experience and has “never seen anything this stupid in their lives.”
Gase need not turn on the radio or TV to know what’s being said about him. He comes face to face with it daily when questioned by reporters. An all-timer of a session occurred last week when one reporter grilled Gase.
1. Why would any player want to sign with the Jets and play for you?
2. What do you offer?
“I don’t have to sit here and answer these kind of questions from you,” Gase said.
Reporters might settle for quarterback Sam Darnold raising his passer rating above 66.2 (worse than Ryan Fitzpatrick’s 70.0) and the offense climbing out of the cellar, ranked even worse than Miami’s.
“Supposed quarterback whisperer,” frequent Gase critic Manish Mehta wrote in a Daily News column headlined, “Why should Jets fans trust or believe in Adam Gase?”
Perhaps surprisingly, on Wednesday, Gase rejected the idea he’s under the microscope in New York.
“No, that’s not how I feel about it,” he said. “I’m always focused on how can we go win a game that week.”

Texto completo: Evgeny A. Freidman, once known as New York's Taxi King, cooperated in the federal investigation of Mr. Cohen.
ALBANY, N.Y. -- When federal prosecutors unveiled charges last year against Michael Cohen, President Trump's former lawyer, they accused him of hiding more than $ 1.3 million in income he received from a man identified only as Taxi-Operator 2.
On Wednesday, that man, Evgeny A. Freidman, who was a business partner of Mr. Cohen and was once so powerful in the cab industry that he was known as New York's Taxi King, was sentenced to probation for engaging in his own tax fraud.
Mr. Freidman, 48, had been accused of failing to pay more than $ 5 million in surcharges collected in the cabs he managed. But in a deal with state prosecutors last year, he agreed to cooperate in the federal investigation into Mr. Cohen and to plead guilty to a lesser charge, as well as pay $ 1 million in restitution.
"I'm very humbled by what has happened," Mr. Freidman said in Albany County Court before he was sentenced. "I have started fresh."
The case turned Mr. Freidman, a Russian immigrant and the son of a New York cabdriver, into an unlikely peripheral figure in the investigations surrounding Mr. Trump.
Prosecutors had sought Mr. Freidman's cooperation to use as leverage against Mr. Cohen, who worked as Mr. Trump's fixer for nearly a decade and came under scrutiny as a result of the special counsel's inquiry into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.
Mr. Freidman once ran more than 1,000 taxis in New York, Chicago and Philadelphia, owning hundreds of his own medallions, the city-issued permits that allow taxis to take street hails, and managing medallions for other owners, including Mr. Cohen.
But in recent years, he became mired in a series of legal issues for underpaying his drivers, failing to pay child support and, ultimately, evading taxes.
In 2017, the New York attorney general's office accused him of illegally pocketing a 50-cent surcharge from millions of rides between 2012 and 2016. Cabs are supposed to collect the fee and send it to the state so it can be used for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which runs mass transit in the region. Instead, prosecutors said, Mr. Freidman kept the money and falsified tax returns.
He was indicted on five felonies that carried a maximum prison sentence of 25 years each.
Last year, he pleaded guilty to evading just $ 50,000 in taxes. In addition to the $ 1 million fine, he agreed to remain under probation for five years and signed a document giving the state authority to collect an additional $ 4 million in the future.
On Wednesday morning, Mr. Freidman spoke in a low voice as he apologized for his crimes in a mostly empty courtroom. His lawyers have said that the emergence of ride-hailing services such as Uber and Lyft had devastated Mr. Freidman's business and forced him into wrongdoing.
Mr. Freidman was once worth hundreds of millions of dollars, but he is now facing judgments on $ 400 million in debts, according to a memo filed as part of the sentencing. Once a lawyer, he also has been disbarred and prohibited from managing medallions. He is currently working as an independent sales representative, according to the memo.
"This case has brought him to his knees," Mr. Freidman's lawyer, Patrick J. Egan, said in court.
The sentencing in Albany County Court had been delayed three times because Mr. Freidman had not paid the full restitution, according to prosecutors. The state filed a memo earlier this month accusing Mr. Freidman of violating his agreement and overstating his cooperation in the case against Mr. Cohen; that memo said prosecutors would push for jail time if Mr. Freidman did not pay by this week.
Judge Peter A. Lynch applauded Mr. Freidman for paying the fine and cooperating with prosecutors. "To be quite blunt, given the crumbling of your business empire, your ability to pay the restitution is spectacular," he said.
Prosecutors also disclosed in court papers that Mr. Freidman has been helping the attorney general's office with its inquiry into the lending practices in the taxi medallion industry. Mr. Freidman has met with investigators three times about that inquiry, which was launched in response to a New York Times series.
For years, Mr. Cohen had entrusted Mr. Freidman with his 32 taxi medallions. Mr. Freidman paid Mr. Cohen a monthly fee for the medallions and, in return, he got to operate the cabs and earn revenue from them.
The two men also became personal friends; at one point, during Mr. Freidman's divorce, Mr. Cohen temporarily rented him an apartment in Trump Park Avenue.
Last year, Mr. Cohen pleaded guilty to eight charges, including some related to his medallions.
Among other issues, Mr. Cohen admitted to a tax-evasion scheme in which he failed to tell the government about more than $ 1.3 million in income from his partnership with Taxi-Operator 2, who was Mr. Freidman, according to a person familiar with the matter.
Mr. Cohen did not report a bonus of at least $ 870,000 that Mr. Freidman paid him to entice him to operate some of his medallions, prosecutors charged. Between 2012 and 2016, Mr. Freidman also arranged for some of Mr. Cohen's medallion income to be paid to him personally instead of to his businesses in order to evade taxes, the prosecutors said.
The case against Mr. Cohen, which originated in the office of the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, became public in the spring of 2018 when agents carried out search warrants at his home, office and hotel room. It focused in large part on the lawyer's work for Mr. Trump's campaign and in particular a $ 130,000 payment made to the pornographic film actress Stormy Daniels, who has said she had an affair with Mr. Trump. He has denied the relationship.
Mr. Cohen eventually pleaded guilty to making hush-money payments in violation of federal campaign finance laws. He was sentenced to three years in prison. Evgeny Freidman, outside an Albany courthouse on Oct. 17, had admitted dodging $ 50,000 in state taxes. (PHOTOGRAPH BY PATRICK DODSON FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES)

Texto completo: George Condo’s “Constellation of Voices.” Credit: Jonathan Ticher/Met Opera
For decades, George Condo has represented a sort of big-budget art world success that’s made him both an object of jealousy and slightly acerbic derision, which sometimes makes it hard to evaluate his work clearly. A star painter who kicked off his career in the East Village and who quickly became the modern representative of Old Master techniques, Condo has recently produced a piece that’s become something of a stamp of approval for established artists: his first work of public art. The work in question, which was unveiled on Tuesday of this week in Lincoln Center Plaza in front of the Metropolitan Opera, is a 13-foot-tall sculpture called Constellation of Voices.
Lincoln Center, of course, is known the world over as an iconic hub for the dramatic arts, but painting and sculpture have always been prominent parts of the institution’s programming as well. The Metropolitan Opera House has a small gallery devoted to rotating exhibitions that sometimes have to do with the operas being performed at that time; a memorable one featured the artist Brian Calvin’s take on Così fan tutte . In 2017, Lincoln Center also celebrated the 50th anniversary of the Metropolitan Opera’s massive, beloved murals by Marc Chagall: The Triumph of Music and The Sources of Music.

Now, Condo has stepped into this artistic tradition with a golden sculpture that somehow evokes deities, lowly human performers and the anxiety of life in 2019 simultaneously. The figure, which resembles a head that’s been deformed by conflicting desires, is also pockmarked and pitted as though it’s been riddled with projectiles. There’s a distinct majesty to it too. “I took it out of the realm of gods and wanted it to echo the feeling of our time, with this idea of a constellation of voices—when so many people have taken to the streets and want to be heard,” Condo told the New York Times .
Condo’s work is often luridly cartoonish and sexual, but this aluminum and gold sculpture works for him on an earnest level that he engages with perhaps more rarely. In September, star artist Kehinde Wiley also debuted his first work of public art with a huge monument-sculpture in Times Square called Rumors of War: before the year is over, perhaps still more artists will be bringing their talents to the general public as well.

Texto completo: Hastings-on-Hudson stands in for "upstate" in episode two of the Amazon Prime series "Modern Love," based on the New York Times column of the same name. (For the record, the village also served as the backdrop for "Update" in the 2016 HBO series "Girls," and has been a backdrop for HBO's "Divorce" with Sarah Jessica Parker.)
The eight-episode comedic anthology, from filmmaker John Carney, explores love in its multitude of forms, including sexual, romantic, familial, platonic and self-love.
Much of "When Cupid is a Prying Journalist" starring Catherine Keener, Dev Patel and Andy Garcia features Hastings in multiple shots.
The story centers on a journalist (Keener) doing a story about the CEO of a dating app (Patel). When she asks him whether he's ever been in love, it sparks a conversation about both of their love lives.
Long story short: The bookstore where Keener meets Andy Garcia (a former flame) is actually Galapagos Books (though it says riverrun in the show) and the spot where they have drinks is Boro6 Wine Bar.
Though it's not the first time Boro6 has been featured on the screen (both big and small) – they've been on "Law & Order," and in the movie "Luce" with Naomi Watts – owner Paul Molakides said he was "blown away" when Keener came in last October around 10 p.m. as she's one of his favorite independent actresses. She and Garcia were in and out in an hour and used minimal lighting and portable microphones, so it was never a disruption to the restaurant (though he did get a photo with both of them).
Scenes were also shot in the dining room at St. George Bistro where owner and general manager Jason Steinberg said they made some random plates for the scene featuring Keener and Garcia.
"Having the Modern Love team at Saint George was a lot of fun," he said. "It was interesting to see how a show gets made up close and some of our Hastings neighbors actually worked for the production company."
Fun was also had at Penny Lick Ice Cream where employees got to see Keener and Garcia up close and personal.
According to an October 2018 Instagram post by Penny Lick owner Ellen Sledge, Keener shouted, "Oh my god this is amazing!" when she sampled the store's raspberry lime ice cream.
"Modern Love," for the record, was just picked up for a second season thanks to a new deal with Carney, the writer, director and executive producer of the series.
Prime members can stream Season one via the Prime Video app for TVs, connected devices including Fire TV, mobile devices and online at www.amazon.com/modernlove.
And look for Westchester is no stranger to TV and movie backdrops. Jennifer Lopez filmed scenes for "Hustlers" at Wykagyl Golf Club in New Rochelle (she also filmed at the Palisades Center Mall in West Nyack) and was spotted last week shooting her latest movie, "Marry Me," at Purchase College, according to OnLocationVacations.com
Also spotted around town: Actor Bill Pullman shooting scenes for the USA Network series "The Sinner" at Hartsdale train station. Pullman shot scenes at Cobble Stone Restaurant in Purchase the year before.
Episode 2 of Season 1 of Amazon Prime's "Modern Love" series shot scenes at Boro6 in Hastings-on-Hudson.

Texto completo: Halloween night in Wilkes-Barre Twp. promises to be a killer.
Hip-hop artists Rick Ross, DaBaby and Lil Durk explode into Mohegan Sun Arena at Casey Plaza, 255 Highland Park Blvd., on Thursday, Oct. 31, at 7 p.m. for Halloween Massacre 2, presented by Cruz Control Entertainment.
Lil Durk (born Durk Derrick Banks) began his music career online, posting tracks and mixtapes to MySpace and YouTube. In 2013, his mixtape “Signed to the Streets” was named one of the top mixtapes by Rolling Stone. Lil Durk was selected as a member of the 2014 XXL Magazine’s Freshmen Class, which features the most promising up-and-coming hip-hop acts.
This past August, Lil Durk released his fourth mixtape, “Love Songs 4 the Streets 2,” with features from Nicki Minaj and 21 Savage, after its first incarnation in 2017.
“Just with a bigger audience and more to talk about,” Lil Durk told Genius.com. “I just felt like I needed to put it out there.”
A breakout of 2019, DaBaby dropped his debut mixtape in 2015 and steadily rose in popularity. He’s been featured on songs with Megan Thee Stallion and Post Malone, and “Kirk,” his most recent project, debuted at No. 1 on the U.S. Billboard 200. DaBaby (born Jonathan Kirk) gained attention for his bizarre, over-the-top videos as well as his rap flow.
“When I started coming on my music the way I was coming on freestyles - just relentless, at your neck, as soon as the beat starts, that’s when everything really clicked,” he told the New York Times.
Ross, a rapper and entrepreneur, released his debut album, “Port of Miami,” in 2006, debuting at the top spot on the U.S. Billboard 200 album chart. Over the years, Ross - whose real name is William Leonard Roberts II - went on to secure himself as a top player, including by founding his record label Maybach Music Group in 2009.
Ross’s latest album, “Port of Miami 2,” a sequel to his debut, came out Aug. 9 with features from Wale, Meek Mill, Drake, John Legend and the late Nipsey Hussle. Earlier this month, the Grammy-nominated Ross collaborated with Swizz Beats and DMX on the song “Just in Case,” from the soundtrack to EPIX crime drama series “Godfather of Harlem,” starring Forest Whitaker.
Also this year, Ross released a book, “Hurricanes: A Memoir,” which touches on his story growing up in Miami during the city’s crack epidemic, his controversies, health issues and his rise to fame.
“The things that I’ve seen, I wouldn’t believe it, because it really is hard to conceive. The era I came up in in Miami, it’s unbelievable,” Ross told Amazon Music. “So ‘Hurricanes’ is, once again, me approaching the beautiful days as well as the rough and just giving an unadulterated, clear view of what it was like coming up Rozay from when I was a youngster. … It’s gonna be a movie, trust me.”
Tickets for the arena show start at $40, plus fees, and are available online at ticketmaster.com and at the box office. There is a $10 fee to park in the arena’s lot.

Al Bianchi, Cigar-Chewing Basketball Fixture Who Lifted Knicks, Dies at 87

Texto completo: He made his N.B.A. debut as a player in 1956, oversaw a promising but short-lived revival of the Knicks in the 1980s and remained active into the 21st century. Al Bianchi, a pro basketball figure for more than half a century who returned to his New York roots in the late 1980s and oversaw a promising but short-lived revival of the Knicks as their general manager, died on Monday in Phoenix. He was 87.
His wife, Johnnie, said the cause was congestive heart failure.
Bianchi played for a decade in the National Basketball Association as a guard; he was a head coach and executive in two leagues; and he scouted as well.
He made his N.B.A. debut with the Syracuse Nationals in 1956, and he was chomping on a cigar as a silver-haired scout six decades later.
As he put it, "I'm a basketball guy."
After coaching stints with the Chicago Bulls and the Seattle SuperSonics in the late 1960s, Bianchi became the coach and general manager of the Virginia Squires of the American Basketball Association. The Squires signed Julius Erving out of the University of Massachusetts in 1971, and he became a sensation. But they sent him to the Nets two years later for what the Squires called "a lot of cash" and a forward, George Carter.
"We had to sell players just to survive," Bianchi told The Richmond Times Dispatch in 2006. Erving's departure, he remarked wryly, "made me a lousy coach."
The Squires fired Bianchi in November 1975 and went out of business the following May.
Bianchi worked as an assistant coach with the Phoenix Suns, under John MacLeod, from 1976 to 1987, then was hired as general manager of the Knicks.
The Knicks had won only 24 games in the 1986-87 season under Coach Hubie Brown and his successor, Bob Hill. Bianchi replaced Hill with Providence College's Rick Pitino, who installed a pressing defense and a run-and-gun offense with an emphasis on three-point shots.
Bianchi didn't attempt to keep Bernard King, the Knicks' once prolific scorer, from signing with the Washington Bullets at the outset of the 1987-88 season, when he was returning from a severe knee injury; Pitino felt that King wouldn't fit into his system.
King made a remarkable comeback with the Bullets. But the Knicks made progress in their own right, led by Patrick Ewing at center and the point guard Mark Jackson, whom Bianchi drafted out of St. John's. They won 38 games that season, though they were eliminated in the first round of the playoffs.
The Knicks won 52 games in Bianchi and Pitino's second season and again made the playoffs, this time reaching the second round. But Pitino quit afterward to become head coach at the University of Kentucky.
Bianchi and Pitino had been at odds. Bianchi, who later said he had wanted to hire a pro coach instead of Pitino only to be rebuffed by Knick ownership, favored a traditional pro style, at least in the playoffs, feeling that the Pitino system could exhaust players by the end of the regular season.
"In June, when you still want to be playing, you need a half-court offense and defense, like it or not," he told The New York Times after Pitino's resignation.
Speaking to The Times, Pitino said of his relationship with Bianchi, "There was a basic mistrust, both ways, from the start."
Bianchi hired Stu Jackson, a former Pitino assistant, to replace Pitino. He fired Jackson in December 1990 and gave the coaching job to his old Phoenix colleague MacLeod. Three months after that, Bianchi was fired and replaced by Dave Checketts.
Bianchi brought players like Charles Oakley, John Starks, Kiki Vandeweghe and Maurice Cheeks to the Knicks, but he was never able to get the team to an elite level.
Alfred Bianchi was born on March 26, 1932, in Queens, one of three children of Alfredo and Rose (Sciallo) Bianchi. His father was an Italian immigrant who tended coal furnaces; his mother was a homemaker.
Bianchi played basketball at Long Island City High School in Queens and became a high-scoring guard at Bowling Green State University in Ohio. He was selected by the Minneapolis Lakers in the second round of the 1954 N.B.A. draft.
After he spent two years in the Army, the Lakers sent him to the Nationals. He played for seven seasons in Syracuse, mostly behind the outstanding backcourt pairing of Hal Greer and Larry Costello.
Bianchi remained with the franchise when it became the Philadelphia 76ers in 1963. He retired after the 1965-66 season with a career scoring average of 8.1 points a game.
He was an assistant coach for one season with the expansion Bulls and head coach for two seasons with the SuperSonics, another new team, which won only 53 games over his two seasons in Seattle.
Moving to the A.B.A., he was named coach of the year for 1970-71. Then came Julius Erving's pro debut.
In addition to his wife, Johnnie (Orr) Bianchi, a real estate agent, Bianchi is survived by his sons, Al Jr., Luc and Mark; his daughters, Shireen Bianchi-Jones and Carol Bianchi-Perry; his stepdaughter, Jennie Orr de Lopez; a sister, Caroline; nine grandchildren; and three great-grandchildren.
In his later years, Bianchi was a scout for the Suns and the Golden State Warriors.
Bianchi was never part of a league championship team, but he did have a championship ring. It was silver with a turquoise stone and inscribed "Phoenix Suns, 1975-76 World Champs."
The Suns had, in fact, lost to the Boston Celtics in a six-game 1976 N.B.A. finals. Bianchi, then a first-year Suns assistant, had been incensed by Richie Powers's refereeing in the triple-overtime Game 5, which Boston won. Feeling that the Suns had been deprived of a chance to win the title, he commissioned the ring in 1977 and had an expletive directed at Powers inscribed on the inside of the band.
That championship series "was my only chance to win a ring," he told The Arizona Republic long afterward, "so I thought, I'll have one made for myself."

Texto completo: The impeachment inquiry into President Trump over his pressure on Ukraine to conduct an investigation into a political rival, former vice president Joe Biden, is moving rapidly, and developments are coming to light at all hours. Here's a summary of what you might have missed, and what's expected to happen next.
What happened overnight:
— Several publications obtained copies of the opening statement of Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Vindman, a current White House national security official, who plans to say Tuesday that he raised concerns over the president's conduct toward Ukraine twice out of a “sense of duty."
According to the New York Times, Vindman is the first official to testify who listened to the call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on July 25 that sparked a whistleblower complaint.
Read the opening statement here.
— President Trump appeared to preemptively react to Vindman's testimony on Tuesday morning:
— House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced on Monday afternoon that the House would hold a formal vote to “affirm" the impeachment inquiry, marking the first time since the formal inquiry began that the full House will go on record as supporting the inquiry or opposing it.
What's expected to happen next:
— Vindman is set to testify Tuesday morning at 9:30 a.m.
— Acting assistant secretary for International Security Affairs Kathryn Wheelbarger is scheduled to testify on Wednesday.
— The House vote to “affirm" the impeachment inquiry and set rules for which hearings and documents will be made public will be held Thursday.
— The National Security Council's senior director for Russian affairs, Timothy Morrison, is scheduled to testify on Thursday. Morrison is repeatedly referenced in the explosive opening statement from the State Department's top diplomat in Ukraine, Bill Taylor.

U.S. News: Official Who Heard Trump's Call Will Testify of Concern

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- A top official with the National Security Council plans to tell House impeachment investigators that he was concerned by President Trump's July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, saying that the president's request to have the Ukrainians investigate Joe Biden and his son may have been interpreted as a "partisan play."
Alexander Vindman, an Iraq war veteran who currently oversees Ukraine policy at the NSC, will be the first official with firsthand knowledge of the call at the heart of the impeachment inquiry to testify when he appears before House investigators on Tuesday.
According to a statement obtained by The Wall Street Journal, Mr. Vindman also plans to tell investigators that the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, Gordon Sondland, told a Ukrainian delegation that the Kyiv government needed to deliver specific investigations to secure a meeting with Mr. Trump. The statement says that the July 10 meeting was cut short by then-national security adviser John Bolton, corroborating what others have testified to.
"Following this meeting, there was a scheduled debriefing during which Amb. Sondland emphasized the importance that Ukraine deliver the investigations into the 2016 election, the Bidens, and Burisma," the statement says. Mr. Vindman says he told Mr. Sondland "his statements were inappropriate."
The statement was earlier obtained by the New York Times.
Mr. Vindman's statement notes that he listened in on the call in the Situation Room with colleagues from the NSC and the office of the vice president, adding, "I did not think it was proper to demand that a foreign government investigate a U.S. citizen, and I was worried about the implications for the U.S. government's support of Ukraine."
The role of former Vice President Biden's son Hunterat energy company Burisma Holdings has come under scrutiny after unsupported accusations by Mr. Trump that the Democratic front-runner for president tried to help his son's business interests in Ukraine.
Mr. Trump, in his call, asked Mr. Zelensky to "look into" Mr. Biden and his son and said he would direct Rudy Giuliani, the president's personal lawyer, and Attorney General William Barr to contact Mr. Zelensky to help him in a possible investigation, according to a rough transcript released by the White House. Before asking Ukraine to examine actions by Mr. Biden's son, Mr. Trump reminded Mr. Zelensky that the U.S. sends security aid to Ukraine.
Mr. Vindman says an investigation into the Biden family and Burisma "would likely be interpreted as a partisan play" which would result in Ukraine losing the bipartisan support it has thus far maintained.
Mr. Vindman also states that he isn't the whistleblower whose complaint triggered the impeachment inquiry.
Neither the White House nor Mr. Bolton responded to requests for comment Monday.

Texto completo: Boeing's chief executive, Dennis A. Muilenburg, will acknowledge some of the company's failings on Tuesday when he appears before a Senate committee investigating the crashes of two 737 Max jets that killed 346 people.
"We know we made mistakes and got some things wrong," Mr. Muilenburg plans to tell the lawmakers, according to Boeing. "We own that, and we are fixing them."
Mr. Muilenburg has made similar comments in speeches but his appearances this week will be the first time Boeing executives have publicly addressed Congress about the crashes, which have cost the company billions of dollars and raised new questions about government oversight of the aviation industry.
Mr. Muilenburg will face the Senate on the first anniversary of the crash of Lion Air Flight 610, which was the first Max to crash. On Wednesday, he will appear in front of a House committee.
For Mr. Muilenburg and Boeing, the stakes could not be higher. The Max remains grounded seven months after the second crash, Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 in March. The company is under scrutiny from all sides as it scrambles to contain the crisis following the crashes, and Mr. Muilenburg, who was recently stripped of his title as chairman of Boeing's board, is facing pressure for his handling of the situation.
Both flights crashed after a new system on the Max, known as MCAS, activated based on faulty data, a fact Mr. Muilenburg plans to acknowledge in his statement.
"We know that both accidents involved the repeated activation of a flight control software function called MCAS, which responded to erroneous signals from a sensor that measures the airplane's angle of attack," his prepared remarks say.
Mr. Muilenburg also will address criticism that Boeing did not inform airlines about the new system before the crashes. During the development of the plane, Boeing made the system more powerful, and a Boeing pilot working on the Max, Mark Forkner, requested that the Federal Aviation Administration remove mention of the system from the plane's training manual.
"Our airline customers and their pilots have told us they don't believe we communicated enough about MCAS -- and we've heard them," Mr. Muilenburg plans to say.
Boeing this month turned over to Congress messages showing that Mr. Forkner told another pilot about problems with the new system during tests on a simulator in 2016, before the Max was certified to fly. In messages to the other pilot, Mr. Forkner said he believed he had unknowingly lied to regulators. Mr. Muilenburg does not address Mr. Forkner in his opening statement.
Boeing has developed a software update for the Max, which will be installed in all new and existing planes before they carry passengers.
In his prepared remarks, Mr. Muilenburg stressed that Boeing was cooperating with the Federal Aviation Administration and other regulators, and has provided them with extensive documentation and time in Max simulators.
"All of their questions are being answered," Mr. Muilenburg plans to say. "This process has taken longer than we originally expected, but we're committed to getting it right, and return-to-service timing is completely dependent on answering each and every question from the F.A.A."
Boeing last week said it expected the F.A.A. to clear the Max to fly before the end of the year. But the company has pushed back its estimates on the plane's return to service several times now. Mr. Muilenburg did not give an update to that timing in his opening statement.
"Regulators around the world should approve the return of the Max to the skies only after they have applied the most rigorous scrutiny, and are completely satisfied as to the plane's safety," he plans to say. "The flying public deserves nothing less."
Nothing involving Boeing is without complications these days, and that includes the order of the hearings. The House, which is conducting an intensive investigation into Boeing, had originally asked Mr. Muilenburg to testify on Tuesday to coincide with the anniversary of the crash of the Lion Air jet in Indonesia.
But Boeing said Mr. Muilenburg was unavailable on that day, and the House agreed to hold its hearing on Wednesday. Only then did the Senate ask for Mr. Muilenburg to appear on Tuesday. This time, Boeing made Mr. Muilenburg available, according to three people with knowledge of the negotiations who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations.
The back and forth has irked many in the House, which had wanted to have the first session with Mr. Muilenburg given its work investigating the company. Instead, it will be the Senate commerce committee that gets that opportunity.
Last week, Representative Peter DeFazio, chairman of the House transportation committee, took a swipe at his colleagues in the Senate, accusing them of jumping in front of his hearing and "working off news reports" rather than conducting their own in-depth investigation.
On a conference call with reporters on Monday, Mr. DeFazio said he planned to press Mr. Muilenburg on Boeing's culture.
"We see a pattern at Boeing of extraordinary production pressures," he said, noting that the Max was hastily developed as the company sought to ward off a challenge from its European rival Airbus.

Mr. DeFazio also signaled that he and other lawmakers were looking at changing the rules concerning airplane certification.
As the 737 Max was developed, it was Boeing employees working on behalf of the F.A.A., not government inspectors, who signed off on many aspects of the plane. This system of so-called delegation, which lets manufacturers sign off on their own work, is under scrutiny after the crashes.
Investigations by The New York Times have revealed that Boeing employees sometimes felt pressure to play down safety concerns and meet deadlines, that key F.A.A. officials didn't fully understand MCAS and that the F.A.A. office in Seattle that oversees Boeing was seen inside the regulator as excessively deferential to the company.
Boeing and its allies in industry also waged a yearslong lobbying campaign to get the F.A.A. to delegate even more to the company, an effort that paid off with the passage of last year's F.A.A. reauthorization act. Now lawmakers are questioning whether the entire system of certifying airplanes needs an overhaul.
"It is inevitable that in the not-too-distant future we are going to be changing the way this system works," Mr. DeFazio said.

Texto completo: Mr. Walden is now the fourth lawmaker who serves as the top Republican on a prominent House committee to announce his retirement this year.
WASHINGTON -- Representative Greg Walden of Oregon, a senior Republican on an influential House committee, said on Monday that he would not seek re-election, joining the growing ranks of Republicans rushing for the exits as they take stock of a grim political landscape ahead of the 2020 election.
The only Republican in Oregon's congressional delegation, Mr. Walden, elected to the House in 1998, held leadership roles there for years, and as the chairman of the powerful Energy and Commerce committee helped draft and lead the failed effort to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. He also served as the chairman of Republicans' campaign arm in 2014 and 2016, leading the conference in back-to-back victories.
Mr. Walden, 62, said he had not come to his decision out of any concern for his own political survival or fatalism about his party's chances of winning the House after Democrats swept Republicans from power last year.
In a statement, he said that he was confident he could have won re-election in 2020, but, "for me, the time has come to pursue new challenges and opportunities."
Yet in announcing his retirement, Mr. Walden did not sound confident about his party's chances in the 2020 contests -- "a path exists for Republicans to recapture a majority in the House," he said -- and his decision to leave Congress underscored how reluctant many Republicans have grown, as the impeachment of President Trump gallops ahead, to sign up for another two years in the minority.
Weary of spending another Congress with little power in the majority-dominated House and the drama of having to answer daily for the president's provocative comments and actions, 20 other House Republicans have announced they would not seek re-election in 2020.
Representative Tom Emmer of Minnesota, the chairman of House Republicans' campaign arm, called Mr. Walden a "class act and political juggernaut who will be sorely missed." In a statement, Mr. Emmer also said that Mr. Walden had pledged to remain "heavily engaged" in ensuring his seat, a conservative stronghold in the center of the state, would stay in Republican control.
Mr. Walden is now the fourth lawmaker who serves as the top Republican on a prominent House committee to announce his retirement this year. The others are Representatives Mac Thornberry of Texas, the senior Republican on the Armed Services Committee; Rob Bishop of Utah on the Natural Resources Committee; and K. Michael Conaway of Texas on the Agriculture Committee.
If House Republicans recaptured the chamber in 2020, Mr. Walden could regain the chairmanship of the Energy and Commerce committee and hold it until 2022, according to House rules.
Mr. Walden's decision, first reported by Politico, adds to the anxiety privately discussed among House Republicans of an accelerating exodus of some of their most experienced, policy-savvy members.
"As a matter of electoral politics, I don't think House Rs have a real retirement problem at this point," Brendan Buck, a former counselor to Speakers Paul D. Ryan and John A. Boehner, wrote on Twitter. "My bigger concern is the quality and type of people who are leaving." Mr. Buck called Mr. Walden the "embodiment" of his fear that some of "the best members" were departing.
Mr. Walden got his start in congressional politics as the press secretary and chief of staff to Representative Denny Smith, Republican of Oregon, in 1981. He climbed the ranks under the leadership of Mr. Boehner, who called Mr. Walden "my go-to guy" and named him the chairman of Republican leadership in 2010.
Navigating a path in the conference under Mr. Trump's leadership, however, proved a more fraught task for Mr. Walden, who broke from the president on several high-profile votes, including joining Democrats to rebuke Mr. Trump's border wall. Earlier this year, he told Politico in a profile that he still had hopes of reclaiming the Energy and Commerce gavel.
"I'm a chairman in exile, dude," he said.

Texto completo: A White House national security official plans to tell House impeachment investigators about registering internal complaints about President Trump's treatment of Ukraine and how he believed it to be harmful to national security.
"I am a patriot," Lt. Col. Alexander S. Vindman will tell investigators, according to the New York Times, which obtained a draft of his opening statement. "It is my sacred duty and honor to advance and defend our country irrespective of party or politics."
"I did not think it was proper to demand that a foreign government investigate a U.S. citizen, and I was worried about the implications for the U.S. government’s support of Ukraine," Vindman said. "I realized that if Ukraine pursued an investigation into the Bidens and Burisma it would likely be interpreted as a partisan play which would undoubtedly result in Ukraine losing the bipartisan support it has thus far maintained."
He added he believed he had a "sense of duty" to tell about the phone call and he believed Trump's phone call at the time would "undermine U.S. national security." Vindman registered two internal complaints on Trump in connection to his handling of Ukraine.
"On many occasions I have been told I should express my views and share my concerns with my chain of command and proper authorities," he said.
His testimony will mark the first time a White House official will have testified who had listened to the phone call that prompted House Democrats to open an impeachment inquiry into the president.
Democrats contend that Trump offered Ukraine a quid pro quo on the call to investigate Joe Biden in exchange for military aid.

Facebook employees oppose company's political ad policy

Texto completo: Facebook’s policy not to fact-check ads from politicians isn't sitting well with the tech giant's employees.
In an open letter to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and other company leaders obtained by the New York Times, more than 250 Facebook workers took issue with the tech giant’s decision to hold politicians to fewer restrictions on the content they include in ads.
“Free speech and paid speech are not the same thing. Misinformation affects us all,” the workers said. “Our current policies on fact-checking people in political office, or those running for office, are a threat to what FB stands for.”
The text of the letter has been available through the company’s internal communications program for two weeks, the New York Times reported, and the group of employees joins Democratic lawmakers, 2020 presidential candidates, and civil rights groups in voicing their dissatisfaction with Facebook’s stance on fact-checking messages included in political ads.
The policy as it stands, they wrote, “doesn’t protect voices, but instead allows politicians to weaponize our platform by targeting people who believe that content posted by political figures is trustworthy.”
Facebook in recent weeks has come under fire for its policy, which it announced after President Trump’s re-election campaign ran an ad that included false information about Democratic presidential frontrunner and former Vice President Joe Biden.
Zuckerberg was grilled by Democrats on Capitol Hill last week about the decision, and Rep. Maxine Waters, who chairs the House Financial Services Committee, accused Zuckerberg of profiting off the false claims made by elected officials and candidates.
Others have sought to test the boundaries of the policy. On Thursday, a progressive political action committee posted an ad erroneously claiming South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham supported the Green New Deal. The ad was rated false by a third-party fact-checking site that works with Facebook and subsequently removed.
The Facebook chief, however, has defended the rules. In a speech at Georgetown University, Zuckerberg said he doesn’t believe a private company should “censor politicians or the news in a democracy.” Then, last week, he told Congress that in a democracy, “it is important that people can see for themselves what politicians are saying.”
Facebook’s employees warned of the dangers posed by the company’s decision not to fact-check ads from elected officials or candidates, including a rise in distrust in the platform and an unraveling of the work done by its integrity teams.
They also made suggestions for how Facebook should handle ad-related content, including subjecting political ads to the same standards as others on the platform, making it easier for users to differentiate between political ads and organic posts, restricting targeting for political ads, and implementing a spending cap for politicians.
“We are proud of the work that the integrity teams have done, and we don’t want to see that undermined by policy,” they wrote.
Facebook's new policy comes as the social media giant prepares for the 2020 election, though some are fearful the company is not prepared to combat the spread of disinformation on the platform.
Facebook revealed last week it removed four campaigns that traced back to Russia and Iran that targeted the United States and spread disinformation and divisive content on social media.

Texto completo: CHICAGO — President Trump took the occasion of an address to a national conference of police chiefs here to tee off on the city's police superintendent and highlight its ongoing challenges with crime, claiming that Afghanistan "is a safe place by comparison."
Ahead of Trump's appearance Monday at the gathering of the International Association of Chiefs of Police, Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson announced that he would not attend because he felt "it just doesn't line up with our city's core values."
Trump seized on those comments early in his remarks, telling the crowd: "There's one person who is not here today. This person should be here because maybe he could learn something."
He then identified Johnson by name and cited his remarks about "values."
"That's a very insulting statement after all I've done for the police," Trump said. "I've done more than any other president has done for the police."
"Here's a man who could not bother to show up for a meeting of police chiefs," he continued. "He's not doing his job."
Claiming that Chicago's violence is "embarrassing to us as a nation," Trump took aim at Johnson in remarkably personal terms, saying Chicago's police "are entitled to a police superintendent who has their backs and knows what he's doing."
Trump rattled off several statistics about crime in Chicago, the nation's third-largest city, which had 530 murders last year.
"Afghanistan is a safe place by comparison," Trump said.
In a news conference after Trump's remarks, Johnson said that "facts matter," highlighting the city's efforts to reduce violence and homicides in recent years.
"We've had double-digit reductions in crime for the last 3 years," Johnson said, adding that he disputed what he described as "the national narrative of Chicago as a city on fire."
The city's violence has drawn national attention and concern in recent years as it rose in 2016 to levels Chicago had not seen in two decades, though it has declined since that point. Since 2016 — when Chicago had more homicides than New York and Los Angeles combined — the number of homicides and shootings have both fallen.
According to statistics tracked by the Chicago Tribune, 436 people were killed in the city through Saturday, 46 fewer than a year earlier. More than 2,310 people were shot as of Sunday, according to the Tribune's database, down 223 from a year earlier.
Chicago, in particular, has been a recurring feature of Trump's remarks and Twitter feed.
During his speech Monday, Trump repeated a variation of a story he's told in the past, claiming that he spoke to "a really powerful, strong-looking" officer in the city years earlier who had told him police could fix the city's violence "in one day, sir."
Asked about this on Monday, Johnson said that the police department searched extensively for whoever this officer might be but "we were never able to identify him."
"We spent a lot of time trying to identify this person," Johnson said. "Because if there's somebody that can stop crime in a day, then I would bow down to them and say bring it on."
Writing on Twitter shortly after Trump spoke, Chicago's mayor, Lori E. Lightfoot, denounced his “insulting, ignorant buffoonery."
“Rather than belittle Chicago's communities with hateful and dishonest rhetoric, he needs to go back to D.C. and face his fate," Lightfoot wrote, adding that she stood by Johnson.

Trump's desire for Syrian oil fraught with legal problems
WASHINGTON — President Trump was persuaded to keep a number of troops in Syria partly so the United States could have some of its oil. But the idea of seizing petroleum in the war-torn country presents big barrel of problems.
Trump explained Sunday that one of the reasons he decided to keep a contingent of about 200 US troops in Syria was to prevent the oil fields in the eastern portion of the country from being retaken by the Islamic State, which had once used them as a source of income. The president made the about-face after enduring withering criticism from within his own party about pulling US troops from Syria's border with Turkey.
"We're protecting the oil, we're securing the oil," Trump said during a news conference about the death of Islamic State commander Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi during a US military operation in Syria.
But Trump's rationale did not stop there. The oil, he added, "can help us because we should be able to take some, also."
There are a number of legal and strategic challenges for the United States, or any US firm, to get that oil, according to a several experts. Trump's suggestion that the oil can be taken by the United States is the latest in a long list of legally dubious proclamations the president has made while in office.
To start, the United States has no legal claim to the oil in the first place. Pillaging the natural resources of another nation is a violation of the Geneva Conventions, according to Ryan Goodman, a professor at the New York University School of Law who once served as special counsel to the general counsel of the Defense Department.
Further complicating matters is the fact that the United States claims it is not in an armed conflict with the Syrian government. "So Syrian property is not enemy property that might be taken, even for military purposes, as spoils of war," said Sarah H. Cleveland, a professor of human and constitutional rights at Columbia Law School.Washington Post

Texto completo: The New York City subway turned 115 Sunday - and it didn't look a day older than 114.
The Metropolitan Transportation Authority celebrated the occasion by running subway cars that first went into service in 1917.
The train cars, formally called Standard Lo-Vs or low-voltage cars, were designed to run on the Interborough Rapid Transit system, one of several privately owned subway networks that were eventually unified into the system New Yorkers ride today.
Sunday's throwback trip took riders over some of the original IRT route along Broadway from Times Square-42nd St. to W. 96th St. When the subway opened, it ran from City Hall to Grand Central, where it turned west to Times Square and then north to 145th St.
The vintage ride came without delays - something the IRT couldn't accomplish on its first full day in service.
On Friday, Oct. 28, 1904, the day after the subway debuted to great fanfare, New York's earliest straphangers endured delays of up to 17 minutes because of electrical problems caused by "the newness of the equipment," The New York Times reported. Well over a century later, the MTA continues to work out some of those kinks.

Navy SEALs' have a crisis of character

Texto completo: The Navy SEAL commando force is the stuff of legend, lionized for the raid that killed Osama bin Laden, rescuing an American sea captain from Somali pirates and fighting to the death in the mountains of Afghanistan in the "Lone Survivor" story.
This summer, however, the commander of this vaunted band of war fighters warned about an ethical and professional crisis in the ranks. "We have a problem," Rear Adm. Collin Green wrote in a letter to the troops. "Some of our subordinate formations have failed to maintain good order and discipline and as a result and for good reason, our (Naval Special Warfare) culture is being questioned."
There was cocaine abuse in a SEAL team based in Virginia. Two SEALs were accused of killing a U.S. soldier in a hazing in North Africa. Another SEAL allegedly raped an American female service member during a drunken party in Iraq.
And then there was the case of Navy SEAL Edward Gallagher.
A combat veteran with the nickname Blade — who said he craved combat and the chance to "kill as many people as possible," according to The New York Times — Gallagher was accused by members of his platoon of battlefield atrocities in Iraq while fighting the Islamic State terrorist group in 2017.
The allegations included shooting Iraqi civilians from a sniper's nest, firing indiscriminately into neighborhoods with a heavy machine gun, and using a custom-made knife to stab a teenage captive to death before posing with the corpse for a photograph.
The Navy was slow to investigate, and the prosecution's case began falling apart even before trial amid concerns about witness intimidation. And Gallagher, who had become the darling of right-wing commentators, was acquitted in July on all charges except the one that involved posing with a dead body.
According to The Times report last week, after Green began worrying about an anti-authority "Gallagher effect" infecting his elite force, an Instagram account belonging to Gallagher and his wife offered T-shirts with the phrase "Gallagher effect" and decried Green and another top leader as "a bunch of morons."
Plans were drawn up to force Gallagher out of the SEALs based on new evidence of misconduct after unauthorized weapons, stolen equipment and illegal drugs were found in Gallagher's home and a work locker.
Then President Donald Trump entered the picture.
The commander in chief, who has advocated torture and taken a keen interest in pardoning troops convicted of war crimes, complained in a tweet this month that "we train our boys to be killing machines, then prosecute them when they kill!"
He followed Gallagher's case, even discussing it with senior Navy officials. The Navy was faced with a dilemma: It could kick Gallagher out of the SEALs to help restore good order and discipline, but risk a reversal by Trump that would effectively emasculate SEAL leadership.
So no action has been taken. And what Navy leaders most feared has likely come to pass: They've been shown powerless as the Gallagher effect undermines the unit's ethical code that "uncompromising integrity is my standard. My character and honor are steadfast. My word is my bond."
Last week, former Navy SEAL and retired Adm. William McRaven — the highly respected architect of the bin Laden raid — reflected in a column about America's military ethos.
"The Greatest Generation went to war because it believed that we were the good guys," he wrote. "We are the most powerful nation ... because we try to be the good guys."
But with Gallaghers in the ranks and a president in their corner, is the United States still the good guys?

An awkward friend request for the media

Texto completo: Ronald Reagan called these the nine most terrifying words in the English language: "I'm from the government and I'm here to help."
Enter the world's biggest social media company.
"We're from Facebook and we're here to help" was, essentially, the message that founder Mark Zuckerberg brought Friday to news organizations, whose business models have been trashed by the digital disruption of information and advertising while the tech platforms have reaped untold billions.
The instrument of this help, he explained to journalists and others in a mid-Manhattan auditorium, will be the Facebook News tab - a new offering on the platform that curates news and information, using both algorithms and human beings to make decisions.
And will also do something revolutionary: Pay some publishers (including The Washington Post) for their expensive-to-produce journalism.
Will it help the news industry survive and thrive?
The answer, probably, is that it will help some. And in time, it could help more.
"There is a real positive in this," said David Chavern, CEO of the News Media Alliance, which represents thousands of newspapers and other news publishers. Positive because this all-powerful tech player is "acknowledging the value of quality journalism and saying that they are willing to pay for it."
He worries, though, that the thousands of local newspapers suffering the worst - and struggling for mere survival - are being left out of the equation. Facebook's partners include a few large regional newspapers like the Los Angeles Times but leave out the vast majority.
"This won't end well," was the blunt forecast of Parker Molloy, an editor at the progressive media-watchdog group Media Matters.
Her specific concern? That Breitbart News is included in a list of trusted publishers despite being described by Steve Bannon, its former executive chairman, as "a platform for the alt-right" and often criticized as a font of disinformation.
Asked at the Friday event why Breitbart was in the mix, Zuckerberg sounded a familiar note: Facebook News "needs to have a diversity of views" and a "breadth of content."
And he noted that a news organization's being "eligible to show up" doesn't mean that its stories will be chosen.
Zuckerberg made his remarks at a "fireside chat" with Robert Thomson, the chief executive of News Corp. The Australian media executive gave his bosses - Rupert Murdoch and his son Lachlan - a shout-out during his opening remarks at the Paley Center for Media, where waiters circulated with canapes and attendees were offered water infused with cucumber, lavender and basil.
"What took you so long?" Thomson pointedly asked Zuckerberg about the plan to pay news organizations, including the Wall Street Journal, which is part of News Corp.
"I'll take that as a compliment," quipped the Facebook founder, who wore his trademark gray crew-neck sweater and dark jeans onstage.
It didn't really sound like a compliment, but then maybe that's a relative thing: It's been a contentious week or so for Zuckerberg, who is again under fire, including at a long congressional hearing Wednesday.
Facebook News will become available immediately to more than 200,000 people in the United States, with a broader rollout planned for early next year, The Post reported. Eventually, Zuckerberg said, he hopes it will be used by 20 million to 30 million people - a modest slice of Facebook's 2 billion or so users.
As with all things Facebook does, this one ought to be viewed skeptically. The company's record on policing blatant disinformation and hate speech, particularly during the 2016 election, is beyond dismal.
It has an unfortunate tendency not to follow its own rules or standards.
In this case, one thing it has going for it is the deep involvement and journalistic credibility of a former Washington Post deputy national editor, Anne Kornblut.
For many years, Facebook - as a major worldwide disseminator of news, one that constantly makes editorial-style decisions - refused to cop to the obvious: That it is a media company, not just a platform.
With this development, that argument goes away. And because that may force a sense of responsibility about decision-making, it's a good thing.
To the extent that Facebook is putting at least some money and other resources behind high-quality journalism, that's a step forward.
But it can't leave smaller, regional publishers in the lurch while placating the major influencers in the news business.
It can't promote and partner with purveyors of disinformation in the name of ideological diversity.
And it can't just talk the game of "We're from Facebook and we're here to help." (Zuckerberg's Friday op-ed in the New York Times states as much, headlined: "Facebook can help the news business.")
Let's say, cautiously, that there's potential here.
"I've been saying for a long time that these big tech players could be an answer rather than the problem," Chavern, of the News Media Alliance, told me.
We'll see.

Texto completo: Members of the Sackler family, owner of OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma, are living near Boca Raton in a sprawling mansion bought for $7.4 million.
The purchase is the second real estate investment by the Sacklers in Palm Beach County, a ground zero in the nationwide opioid crisis.
David Sackler, a third-generation family member, formerly served as a Purdue Pharma board member. He and his wife, Joss, live in the Boca Raton-area home.
Like the July purchase of a West Palm Beach office building, the Sacklers’ home purchase took place shortly before Purdue Pharma filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in a bid to resolve 2,600 opioid lawsuits pending against the company.
Three months ago, a separate company connected to the family paid $6.8 million for the downtown West Palm Beach building, which houses the firm being used to manage the Sackler family’s money. Combined, the
two deals poured $14.2 million of Sackler family money into Palm Beach County real estate.
David Sackler is chief executive of the family money management company, called Summer Road LLC.
The property purchases in Palm Beach County, the epicenter of the pill mill industry that helped spawn the national opioid crisis, stunned an attorney who represents the county.
two deals poured $14.2 million of Sackler family money into Palm Beach County real estate.
David Sackler is chief executive of the family money management company, called Summer Road LLC.
The property purchases in Palm Beach County, the epicenter of the pill mill industry that helped spawn the national opioid crisis, stunned an attorney who represents the county.
“Outrageous,” attorney Hunter Shkolnik said of the Sackler family’s move to Palm Beach County. Shkolnik represents the county in a lawsuit against Purdue Pharma and certain members of the Sackler family.
The opioid crisis has resulted in thousands of deaths and torment for families across the country. In Palm Beach County alone, the death toll is estimated at 2,417 since 2012, according to the Palm Beach County medical examiner.
Like many other municipalities, Palm Beach County is suing Purdue Pharma and members of the Sackler family over the opioid epidemic, claiming the Sackler family played an aggressive role marketing the highly addictive painkiller OxyContin.
In addition, various Palm Beach County hospitals, including West Boca Raton Medical Center, have sued Purda Pharma, too.
A reporter visited the Sacklers’ suburban Boca Raton home on Wednesday to ask about the family’s decision to buy the house.
Joss Sackler later responded in an email.
“I heard word that you showed up unannounced at our residence today,” Joss Sackler wrote. “You asked why we chose to live in Boca instead of Palm Beach. Is this really why you decided to become a reporter? What’s next, an article about my favorite color?”
“Boca Raton is the birthplace of the National Enquirer,” Joss Sackler added. (The Enquirer’s roots go back to New York. Former owner Generoso Pope brought it to Lantana in 1971 and it moved to Boca Raton in 1999. Pope’s widow sold the company in 1989. It moved to New York in 2014.)
“I can see with these questions that tabloid journalism is alive and well in South Florida.”
“P.S.,” Joss Sackler added. “My favourite color is blue.”
Florida law protects homeowners
The property purchases were made at a time when several states and municipalities were seeking permission from a bankruptcy court to proceed with lawsuits filed against individual Sackler family members.
The Florida Constitution provides for homestead protection for people who claim the property as their principal residence. The provision protects up to 160 acres of property outside of a municipality and up to half an acre within a municipality.
The office building was bought July 31 by a company managed by the Sacklers’ lawyers, county records show. The property formerly was the office of Glidden Spina + Architects.
In May, the New York Post reported that David and Joss Sackler planned to flee the negative attention they have received while living in New York and seek haven in Palm Beach. The Sacklers own a $6.5 million apartment on the Upper East Side, which the New York Post reported last month is under contract to be sold.
‘Rubbing salt’ in wounds
The decision to set up shop in Palm Beach County was blasted by attorney Shkolnik.
“It’s rubbing salt in the wounds. Thousands of people have been seriously injured or are dead by their products,” Shkolnik said.
Palm Beach and Broward counties were the epicenter of the nation’s prescription pill mill scourge, which funneled millions of doses of prescription opioids throughout the country.
OxyContin wasn’t the only drug peddled out of the clinics. But at the beginning of the opioid crisis in 2001, it was easily the most popular. And what the Drug Enforcement Agency would criticize as an unprecedented — and misleading — marketing campaign by Purdue led doctors and patients alike to believe OxyContin was less addictive and safer than other opioids.
It wasn’t.
OxyContin’s ingredient was oxycodone, a chemical cousin of heroin. And when the pill mills shut down, users and addicts in states on the receiving end of the Florida pill mill pipeline did what users and addicts in Florida did: They turned to heroin.
The heroin scourge coincided with a massive increase in local treatment centers and sober homes in Palm Beach County, long known as one of the drug treatment capitals of the country. Many of the newer ones, however, were unscrupulous, engaging in insurance fraud and patient brokering and leading to fatal overdoses, a series of high profile arrests and sharp criticism of what has become known as the “Florida Shuffle.”
Florida and Palm Beach County are among numerous states and municipalities nationwide suing Connecticut-based Purdue Pharma for its role in the opioid crisis.
County hospitals are also suing
Earlier this month, Good Samaritan Medical Center, Palm Beach Gardens Medical Center and St. Mary’s Medical Center joined a statewide lawsuit seeking to recover billions of dollars in uncompensated treatment related to the opioid epidemic.
West Boca Medical Center in suburban Boca Raton was among the first hospitals nationwide to argue in a lawsuit it should not have to “bear the costs” of the care they continue to provide as a result of the conduct of defendants such as Purdue Pharma.
Florida, in addition to being a former pill mill headquarters and a destination for the addiction recovery industry, also has a reputation for something else.
It is popular with people fleeing creditors because of the state’s homestead exemption, attorney Shkolnik said.
With skilled financial planners and lawyers advising the Sackler family, “it’s not surprising they would take steps to protect their money so that the people who have been hurt can’t get to it,” Shkolnik said. “It’s nice to be able to sit in your Boca Raton mansion and know you’re always protected.”
AG: Family oversaw ‘trail of death’
The Sackler family has said it is not to blame for the opioid crisis. In June, David Sackler told Vanity Fair that the family has had to endure “vitriolic hyperbole” and “endless castigation.”
But the founder of the Inside Philanthropy website has called the family’s charitable contributions “blood money.”
Attorneys general across the country also have had harsh words for the family.
“I allege that these people are among the most responsible for the trail of death and destruction the opioid epidemic has left in its wake,” North Carolina Attorney General Josh Stein recently told the New York Times.
The Sackler family home and office purchases in Palm Beach County took place before the New York attorney general’s office said it had tracked about $1 billion in wire transfers by the Sackler family, including through Swiss bank accounts.
A Wall Street Journal report said the wire transfers indicate the beleaguered family, worth an estimated $13 billion by Forbes, may be trying to shield its wealth.
The Sacklers went to great lengths to shroud their Palm Beach County real estate purchases. The properties were bought by a web of companies linked to the family. The companies did not disclose the family’s name or ownership.
It is not clear if Purdue Pharma’s September bankruptcy filing will protect the Sacklers from litigation.
$10B settlement in limbo
The settlement will provide more than $10 billion to help reimburse state and local governments and clean up the damage done by prescription painkillers and illegal opioids. The Sackler family would give up ownership of Purdue and contribute at least $3 billion toward the settlement.
Although 24 states, including Florida, have signed on to the bankruptcy to resolve claims, others have not.
Purdue Pharma’s lawyers have asked a judge to issue an injunction to halt efforts by state attorneys general who won’t sign on. The lawyers say they are seeking to shield the Sackler family from litigation.
But some states are fighting the effort to limit their ability to seek money from the family.
“The Sacklers want the bankruptcy court to stop our lawsuits so they can keep the billions of dollars they pocketed from OxyContin and walk away without ever being held accountable. That’s unacceptable,’’ Maura Healey, the Massachusetts attorney general, said in a statement earlier this month.
An attorney for several Palm Beach County hospitals was equally adamant.
“That bankruptcy is going to entail billions of dollars and we’re making claims in bankruptcy, of course, and we’re going to continue after the Sackler family,” said Fort Lauderdale attorney Bill Scherer. “Whatever fair share that’s available for the institutions that were harmed, that’s our job here.”
On Oct. 11, a bankruptcy judge issued a temporary halt to the litigation until Nov. 6, in a bid to encourage all parties to come up with a settlement.
William Tong, the attorney general of Connecticut, told the New York Times he planned to get access to the Sacklers’ financial information and be ready “to make our case to hold Purdue and the Sacklers accountable.”

Texto completo: READING THE NORTHWEST
Unsettled by his mother's deathbed words about her long-held beliefs, Timothy Egan, a New York Times winner of the Pulitzer Prize and bestselling author, packed his own lapsed faith, curiosity and Pacific Northwest travel wear and set out to explore his own spirituality in his new book, "A Pilgrimage to Eternity."
The journey took him from Canterbury to Rome along the Via Francigena (pronounced frahn-chee-jeh-na), a 1,300-mile pilgrimage through the medieval history of Christianity. Along the way, he wondered about our "malnutrition of the soul" and allowed himself to ponder the possibilities of faith that he has spent most of a lifetime neglecting.
"I'm still haunted by the last hours of my mom's life. She was a well-read, progressive Catholic, a mother of seven. "I'm not feeling it, Timmy,' she said, the color fading from her face, the strangling tendrils of her brain cancer closing in, that lethal glioblastoma. 'I'm not sure anymore. I don't know what to believe or what's ahead. I don't ... know.' "
Joan Patricia Egan died in 2012 after spending her retirement years with husband Harry Egan, in Sequim. Her remains were buried at sea in the Strait of Juan de Fuca.
Her son's book shares his hope to find "a stiff shot of no-bullshit spirituality." What he finds is something else, amazement and surprise in a way he'd never allowed before.
Egan confronts the child sex abuse crisis of the Catholic Church. He writes of the rage and its effect on his family. And he celebrates the words, humility and actions of Pope Francis, who is trying to hold together the 1.3 billion-member church.
"I had to open a vein to write this," Egan says. "My faith is very complicated."
Amid the sweeping themes of his book, Egan delivers a vivid history of Western Christianity and its collapse in a modern Europe that has grown increasingly secular. Some predict Christianity will be nearly extinct in Britain within 50 years.
Egan offers his own observations on Christianity through his personal triumphs, doubts and failures along the way. It is, after all, a pilgrimage, not just a physical trek. To achieve his goals, Egan says he embraced what his fellow pilgrims - by some estimates, 200 million people go on such journeys all over the world each year - call "deep walking," the practice of meditating while moving.
Among his early stops is Laon, France. A magical place dominated by the 12th century Gothic Cathedral of Notre-Dame de Laon, Egan reveals that his pilgrimage is more than a personal journey to Rome to test his spiritual and physical mettle. He has "an ulterior motive for investigating miracles."
His wife's sister, Margie Balter, has cancer. And it has spread to 11 organs.
"She's far too young, too vibrant, too full of fresh ideas, with too many songs still to teach her piano students," Egan writes.
In Laon, Egan describes the Seven Wonders within this small, fortified city rising above the Picardy plain. And he considers miracles with the help of St. Augustine's words: "Miracles are not contrary to nature, but only contrary to what we know about nature."
He recounts how Margie's doctors advised her to settle her affairs while his wife Joni will not give up. Specialists. Radiation treatment. Chemotherapy. Alternative medicine.
Nothing is working.
"And I find myself, as with so many pilgrims on this road over the last thousand years, in need of a miracle. If that sounds expedient, last minute, an opportunistic misuse of prayer, so be it. If it means suspending rational thought, consider it done. If there is a force that can produce the scientifically inexplicable, I will beg for it on bended knee."
While admiring the cathedral, Egan says he is compelled when he notices a priest hearing confessions. He summons his nerves and guilt and pulls the curtain closed.
"I gave it a good-faith effort," he says last week. "I'll have to wait another 30 years to try again."
While some might see this book as a departure from one of the Northwest's most-acclaimed writers, Egan says "Pilgrimage" is akin to his earlier works, including "The Good Rain," his 1990 exploration of the Pacific Northwest and his call for man to change his relationship with this rugged and fragile landscape.
Both books find Egan reporting amidst his topic.
"I love history," he says. "Not to go into the attics of academia. ... It's best to go out and feel it. Smell it."
"There's something about when you go to where Joan of Arc was burned at the stake," he says.
Egan says his travels, including the challenge of hiking through and over the Alps, and the glory of sun-drenched Tuscany en route to Rome, allowed him to share the details that transports readers to his side as he explores history.
Egan also plumbs his own family's complicated faith into his telling of the Via Francigena. This honesty rewards readers with a compelling and devastating narrative that pairs with his role serving as a 21st century witness to, and tour guide through, Catholic history.
The Egans lived across the street from Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary Parish along Indian Trail Road in northwest Spokane. He writes of the "monstrous crimes" against childhood friends at the local church and the consequences, including the death of his brother's best friend.
Asked if laicized priest Patrick O'Donnell can be forgiven for molesting 60 or more boys during his time in the clergy, Egan is direct: "No. I don't think so."
O'Donnell never went to prison and retired to a small community in Skagit County.
But Egan also writes that religion helped his sister heal after her 17-year-old son, a Shadle Park High School student, was shot and killed in 2005. Egan's sister said at the sentencing of her son's killer that she hoped he would devote his life to God and help people in her son's name.
Egan gives credit throughout his book to Pope Francis, who he calls the most fascinating religious leader in decades.
"He may be the most fascinating person on the planet just now," Egan says.
Early in the book, Egan shares his desire to meet the Pope. His efforts include correspondence with Vatican officials that offer bright bits of anticipation as Egan overcomes searing heat in the lowlands of France, a blizzard at 8,144-foot St. Bernard Pass in the Swiss Alps, an injured leg and bandaged feet walking through Italy and finally on to the Vatican.
"My drive to meet him, to understand him, to see if my family can forgive him for how that abuse affected us, is at the core of my pilgrimage," Egan says.

Farrow's tale of reporting, perseverance NBC portrayed as hostile workplace book review

Texto completo: At first, I wasn't sure I wanted to read Ronan Farrow's book.
I didn't want to spend hours with a revolving cast of powerful men accused of doing unspeakable things to women, with impunity or the next best thing. I know the world can be like this, but I didn't want to know the world can be like this.
Now I know, in painful detail, thanks to Farrow and "Catch and Kill: Lies, Spies, and a Conspiracy to Protect Predators." And you should too.
Farrow is the New Yorker magazine contributor who shared the 2018 Pulitzer Prize for public service with Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey of The New York Times. Their reporting is why disgraced movie mogul Harvey Weinstein is headed to trial on rape charges in New York City and could spend the rest of his life in prison if convicted.
Their work fueled the #MeToo movement and gave voice to scores of women who allege Weinstein harassed, groped, raped or otherwise forced himself on them and then brutalized them into silence. Their meticulous reporting allowed these women not just to be heard but to be listened to for the first time. And it brought to account men accused of sexual miscount and the industry that protected them.
But this is where the stories diverge.
Kantor and Twohey's new book, "She Said: Breaking the Sexual Harassment Story that Helped Ignite a Movement," details what it's like to be investigative journalists for a newspaper that gave them the time, resources and support to make a difference. Told in the third person, it has the cool, authoritative voice of The New York Times. It focuses on the women who broke their silence and the work that helped them do it; it's a primer on how to do deep-dive journalism.
"Catch and Kill," which was released Tuesday, is a far different work. It's equal parts memoir, spy story and portrait of perseverance - the women's and the author's - under terrible circumstances.
Farrow began exploring rumors of Weinstein's sexual misconduct as a reporter for NBC News. In "Catch and Kill," he describes what it's like to work for a media outlet that tried to quash the story. The New Yorker later published Farrow's series of articles on which this book is based.
The NBC that Farrow portrays in "Catch and Kill" is the definition of a hostile workplace. Farrow's more sensational allegations about the company have already made their way into the headlines.
He described MSNBC President Phil Griffin waving around an enlarged image of a television personality's genitalia during a work meeting. And Farrow leveled the bombshell allegation that former "Today" show co-anchor Matt Lauer anally raped a young colleague while they were covering the Sochi Olympics in 2014.
That colleague is Brooke Nevils, and her complaint led to Lauer's firing in 2017, but NBC News did not disclose the accusation at the time. Lauer denies the allegation; he says he and Nevils had a consensual affair. Nevils' allegations are lengthy, graphic and on the record in "Catch and Kill." Her account underscores the pain, damage and, in Farrow's telling, the complexity of sexual assault. After Sochi, Nevils and Lauer had several sexual encounters, at his home and in his office.
"Nevils told friends at the time that she felt trapped," Farrow wrote. "Lauer's position of authority - over both her and her boyfriend, whose brother worked for Lauer - made her feel unable to say no."
Lauer is the specter that hangs over much of Farrow's deeply reported book, with its largely on-the-record accusations.
A foundation of "Catch and Kill" is Farrow's contention that Weinstein had collected dirt on Lauer and that NBC killed Farrow's story on the producer's misdeeds to protect the star at the center of one of the network's most important franchises. NBC counters that Farrow's work was neither substantiated nor ready to run.
As the Los Angeles Times has reported, NBC has launched a counterassault against the book at the same time it is trying to quell the uproar Farrow's allegations have caused among its employees.
At the heart of "Catch and Kill" is Farrow's quest to get the story - and then get it published. All the while, Farrow alleges, NBC worked to shut down his efforts.
Throughout "Catch and Kill," the author maintains that Weinstein tried to bully them into silence, and to threaten, harass and buy off the women Weinstein had harmed. Farrow writes that Weinstein went so far as to have him followed by spies with ties to Mossad, the Israeli intelligence agency.
Actress Daryl Hannah, whose sexual harassment allegations against Weinstein are detailed in the book, said she previously had told anyone who would listen, but it didn't matter.
"I think it doesn't matter if you're a well-known actress," she told Farrow. "It doesn't matter if you're twenty or if you're forty. It doesn't matter if you report or if you don't because we are not believed.
"We are more than not believed - we are berated and criticized and blamed."
Someday, maybe, that will no longer be the case.

Texto completo: 'The Boy Wonder'
SENATORS
Stanley Raymond "Bucky" Harris
Dave Martinez, the Nationals' manager, is hoping to bring Washington its first World Series title in 95 years. This is Martinez's first managerial job in the majors after playing for nine teams over 16 seasons. The only manager to win in Washington to date was Bucky Harris, a second baseman who took over as player-manager at 27 -- the youngest in the majors -- in 1924 and led the team to the American League pennant. In the seven-game Series, he set records for chances accepted, double plays and putouts. He also hit .333 with two home runs. Nicknamed "The Boy Wonder," Harris took the Senators back to the Series a year later, but lost to the Pirates. He managed five teams in all, including one more title -- the 1947 Yankees against the Brooklyn Dodgers, led by Jackie Robinson. Harris was voted into the Hall of Fame by the Veterans Committee in 1975.
Artificial Turf: Love It or Hate It, It's Still Here
THE WIZARD OF OZ
Shortstop Ozzie Smith (right) started performing a back flip on the way to his position when he played for the San Diego Padres. Smith continued the tradition on the artificial surface in St. Louis as a Cardinal. Busch Stadium first had artificial turf in 1970. The Cardinals have played their home games on a grass field since 1996; their current stadium -- also called Busch -- has had a grass field since it opened in 2006.
......................................................................................................................
ASTROTURF COMES TO BASEBALL
The term AstroTurf became part of sports vocabulary in 1965 with the opening of the Astrodome, the first multipurpose, domed sports stadium. ......................................................................................................................
THE (SYNTHETIC) WORLD SERIES
In 1993, the Toronto Blue Jays and the Philadelphia Phillies played the fourth (and last) World Series to be decided entirely on artificial turf, following those in 1980 (Kansas City-Philadelphia), 1985 (Kansas City-St. Louis) and 1987 (Minnesota-St. Louis). The last World Series game to be played on artificial turf: 2008 at Tropicana Field in St. Petersburg, Fla. (Philadelphia-Tampa Bay). ......................................................................................................................
MAKING A COMEBACK
At its peak, 10 stadiums in the majors had artificial surfaces, but only three teams still play on them. The Arizona Diamondbacks have joined the Rays and the Blue Jays. Chase Field switched from grass this past season. The Texas Rangers will use an artificial surface in their new stadium next season. ......................................................................................................................
ONE PLAYER'S PREFERENCE
The Hall of Famer Andre Dawson played 11 seasons on artificial turf. After leaving Montreal for the Cubs, Dawson said, "I couldn't think of a better place -- Wrigley Field -- natural playing surface, grass." Retired since 1996, Dawson had his 15th knee operation in 2018.
Mr. Met's Competition
ASTROS
Orbit
The lime-green alien first landed in Houston for the 1990 season. He was later replaced by Junction Jack -- a 7-foot-tall rabbit. Irate fans started a "Bring Back Orbit" online campaign leading to his return in 2012. All has not gone well for the alien -- a fan is suing the Astros alleging Orbit's T-shirt cannon fired a shirt into the stands and broke her finger in a July 2018 game.
NATIONALS
Screech "Hatched"
in April 2005, Screech the bald eagle has been the Nationals' mascot since baseball returned to Washington. There are no known lawsuits pending against the eagle.
Big Number
1959
The largest attendance at a World Series game was 92,706 set during Game 5 of the 1959 World Series between the Los Angeles Dodgers and the Chicago White Sox at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. Smallest: 1908 -- 6,210.
How One Woman Changed Sports Reporting Forever
For the final games of the 1977 regular season, the Yankees granted Melissa Ludtke, a 26-year-old Sports Illustrated writer, permission to enter their clubhouse to interview players. When the World Series began in Yankee Stadium, the Los Angeles Dodgers' players voted to allow Ludtke to conduct interviews in their locker room. Major League Baseball overturned that decision, barring Ludtke (and all female reporters) from both locker rooms.
Ludtke (and Time Inc., Sports Illustrated's parent company) sued M.L.B., saying her 14th Amendment rights had been violated and arguing that baseball had deprived her "of covering the sport in the same way as her male colleagues."
On Sept. 25, 1978, District Judge Constance Baker Motley found in favor of Ludtke (at right with her daughter and Hillary Clinton in 1997). The N.B.A. and the N.H.L. had already allowed equal access for female reporters, but M.L.B. was resistant.
Claire Smith, a former columnist for The New York Times and the first woman to be recognized in the writers' wing of the Baseball Hall of Fame, summed up the decision. "It mattered what Jackie did," she said, referring to Jackie Robinson. "It mattered what Melissa did not just because of baseball, but because of what it meant to society. It transcended baseball. It transcended sports. Those were steps taken by very brave people, steps that advanced the society."
Ludtke's upcoming memoir is titled "Locker Room Talk: A Woman's Struggle to Get Inside."

Running Away From Home, and Finding Solace in Art

Texto completo: When George Nkrumah Meizah was growing up in Ghana, he would watch American movies and wonder what it would be like to live in the United States.
"I always wanted to come here," he said.
Mr. Meizah, 22, was raised by his mother. When he was 2, his father moved to the United States and barely kept in touch. Within a few years, he remarried and started a second family in the Bronx.
Despite their strained relationship, Mr. Meizah's father offered to help his son emigrate to New York to pursue a better education. When he was 17, Mr. Meizah bade his mother farewell and crossed the Atlantic to move in with his father and stepmother.
Mr. Meizah was excited, but it took him time to adjust. He had trust issues and did not make friends easily in high school. "I study people before I mingle with them," he said.
At home, he slept in the living room of his father's two-bedroom apartment. It was awkward, taking up space and living with a family that grew to include two half siblings and his stepmother's daughter from a previous marriage.
Within a few months of Mr. Meizah's arrival in the United States, his father started tracking his phone calls and text messages, and forbade him to get in touch with his mother in Ghana, Mr. Meizah said. He resorted to borrowing money from his friends and secretly buying phone cards to call her.
After nearly two years, Mr. Meizah opened up to his guidance counselor, Cedric Hawkins. Mr. Meizah wanted to run away from home. Together, they discussed his options, including youth shelters and other services to help keep him on a path toward college.
Mr. Meizah ran away in 2016 while his father was at a barber shop. He went to a men's shelter in Manhattan and then to a transitional living center near his school that offered educational and vocational counseling and workshops on life skills, such as budgeting and personal hygiene. He lived there for most of his senior year. "I really loved it," he said.
Over time, Mr. Hawkins noticed a change in Mr. Meizah. "I think that was the first time in his life that he was a kid," he said. "He just started to blossom as a person because he had confidence."
Mr. Meizah didn't let his troubles get in the way of his schoolwork: He was the valedictorian of his high school class when he graduated in 2017. He also received a scholarship and a slot in summer college prep classes from the Higher Education Opportunity Program, which provides academic support and financial assistance to disadvantaged students.
He earned six college credits before he aged out of the youth shelter and enrolled at St. Thomas Aquinas College in Sparkill, N.Y. Mr. Hawkins and his family picked Mr. Meizah up at the shelter and helped him move into his dorm room.
"He took me in as one of his own," Mr. Meizah said of Mr. Hawkins. "I felt like I was part of a real family, which I never really had."
He initially majored in medical technology but struggled to grasp the material and terminology. Instead, he decided to study art therapy, a form of psychotherapy in which mental health professionals use painting, drawing and other forms of art to encourage patients to explore feelings that may be hard to express in words.
When he was in high school, an art teacher had helped him sharpen his painting and drawing skills. Mr. Meizah looked forward to his feedback and wanted to become a better painter. He also found that pouring his emotions onto a blank canvas or a page in a sketchbook was soothing and therapeutic.
Now a junior, he is also pursuing a minor in communications. In his sophomore year, he joined the track-and-field team as a high jumper. His towering figure -- he is 6 feet 7 inches tall -- works to his advantage.
The scholarship from the Higher Education Opportunity Program has been covering his housing, meal plan, textbooks and a large portion of his tuition. It also granted him a work-study job in the campus mailroom.
Before his freshman year, Mr. Meizah received another scholarship from Children's Aid, one of the seven organizations supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. It has helped Mr. Meizah shoulder the remaining tuition costs. He now works a second part-time job at a Stop & Shop supermarket to pay off his student loan debt, which is currently about $ 10,000.
In April, Children's Aid used $ 505 from the Neediest Cases Fund to pay Mr. Meizah's phone bill and to buy him gift cards from Modell's and Stop & Shop. He used them to buy groceries, running shorts and T-shirts.
After he graduates, Mr. Meizah hopes to pursue a master's degree in art therapy. His long-term goal, he said, is to help children and older patients who have trauma to express themselves through painting, sketching or drawing.
Mr. Meizah does not brag about his artwork, but Mr. Hawkins said he has talent. After he showed Mr. Meizah a snapshot from a family vacation, Mr. Meizah painted it and gave it to him as a gesture of thanks for his support.
When Mr. Meizah graduated from high school, he presented his principal with a serene painting of mountains behind a waterfall cascading into a stream. It still hangs in her office.
His first, and favorite, painting is of himself: He is kneeling in a body of water under a starry sky as a woman pours golden liquid on his head. He painted it after he left his father's home. Its theme, he said, is emancipation or freedom. It symbolizes the moment he realized he could express himself without fear.
"Now I feel better," he said. "I feel free."

Texto completo: We’re off and running in the capital of professional basketball.
It’s not just local fans who think that way with the Lakers back … they hope … and the Clippers at unprecedented heights of expectation.
All NBA metrics point this way. So many media outlets have moved correspondents here, the Wall Street Journal’s Jason Gay called Los Angeles “the Hemingway’s Paris of NBA dorks.”
Meanwhile, StubHub listed the leaue’s most in-demand teams, which started with:
1. Lakers.
2. Clippers.
As it turned out when No. 1 played No. 2, it was no contest. The opener was a Clippers home game – and one of the most eagerly awaited in franchise history – but so many Lakers fans bought up the place, TNT’s Reggie Miller guessed they made up two-thirds of the crowd.
When the Clippers brought Kawhi Leonard out before tipoff to welcome the crowd, there were audible jeers.
Leonard already knew the deal here. When he was shown on the Jumbotron at a recent Rams game, he was booed a lot more loudly there.
Not that hurt feelings proved a problem. Kawhi outscored the supposed prince of the city, LeBron James, 30-18, as the Clippers eased to a 112-102 victory.
James sniffed afterward, “It’s not a rivalry,” which is correct. The teams are playing for an NBA title, not local bragging rights, which are soon forgotten, even if it wasn’t the most gracious thing Bron could have said under the circumstances.
Of course, it’s a good thing for the Lakers it’s not a rivalry because they’d be losing it, having gone 5-24 against their crosstown, uh, neighbors since the start of the 2012-13 season – so long ago that Kobe Bryant and Dwight Howard were here.
Last week’s handful of games is, of course, only that, offering no proofs.
Nevertheless, however mixed the portents, they sum up the local teams’ relative positions.
The Lakers have reason to hope again with Anthony Davis’ arrival confirming their status as a destination for stars.
They retain their place as local darlings after decades of excellence, above not only the ugly duckling Clippers but the market’s old-time faves, the Dodgers and Rams.
The Clippers have most of the advantages that have been earned lately, starting with a managerial mismatch.
From an afterthought run by Coach Doc Rivers doing double duty, the Clippers have built the NBA’s hottest front office with GM Lawrence Frank and consultant Jerry West, with a deep staff of highly regarded young officials like Michael Winger and Trent Redden who turned down offers from other teams.
Meanwhile, the Lakers have to show they’re past last spring’s meltdown when Magic Johnson fled and Jeanie Buss and her friends and family took over.
Lakers fans still wince at the thought of West yearning to return in 2017, being left out in the cold and going, instead, to the Clippers.
Suggesting that unrest continued to bubble last summer, Jerry’s son, Ryan, another highly regarded young Lakers staffer, joined the Clippers.
Oh, and Ty Lue, the Lakers’ top coaching candidate before turning them down, is now an assistant on Doc Rivers’ staff.
The Clippers are deeper than the Lakers … and perhaps everyone else … with everyone solid in their roles from Patrick Beverley, Landry Shamet and Ivica Zubac to Lou Williams and Montrezl Harrell.
Leonard slides seamlessly into his role as the starters’ missing No. 1 option, able to create shots out of nothing.
The injured Paul George, another two-way star, will add his own dimension upon his return with voluminous three-point shooting – he was No. 3 in makes last season, behind James Harden and Steph Curry – that will keep the floor spread wide open.
At the end of halves and fourth quarters, Kawhi and PG will meld with the crack second unit led by Sweet Lou and Trez.
Old dynamics are changing in the West. Five-time defending conference champion Golden State had dominated the Clippers, but that’s over as the Clips showed, routing the Warriors 141-122 in the opening of sparkling, stunned Chase Arena.
“This is not a one-off,” Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. “This is the reality.”
The Lakers, meanwhile, will need time with a new coaching staff and nine new players, experimenting with James at point guard while awaiting the return of key pieces Kyle Kuzma and Rajon Rondo.
This means showing the necessary poise, although they couldn’t have set the bar much lower.
It was a year ago at this time that they started 1-4 and Johnson called coach Luke Walton in for a loud reproach that the press reported, decibel by decibel, turning Luke into a lame duck.
We still don’t know the whole story, but LeBron’s agent, Rich Paul, was already criticizing Walton privately but widely, including to Commissioner Adam Silver, who acknowledged it (“I think he said something along the lines that ‘Luke Walton is not the right guy to coach LeBron.’”)
This almost certainly came from James and was conveyed to Johnson, which is presumably what tripped out Magic into airing out Luke, and there went their season.
In other words, Frank Vogel had better not take his time to get this working, or do stuff Bron doesn’t like.
Everywhere but here, the rise of the underdog Clippers is as big a story as the saga of the once-majestic Lakers – or bigger.
Eight New York Times writers, asked to make predictions, all picked the Clippers to come out of the West.
Four of the eight picked the Clippers to win the title, with three picking the 76ers.
Five picked Frank to be executive of the year.
Five picked Williams as sixth man of the year and one picked Harrell.
With all the local star power, the New York Times, Washington Post, USA Today, The Athletic, Fox and NBA.com have moved correspondents here. ESPN has an entire bureau on the beat.
“These days, almost every shoe meeting happens in L.A.,” The Ringer’s Bryan Curtis wrote. “Nearly every free-agent courtship is conducted in L.A., whether the team is based here or not. In June, the Timberwolves’ unsuccessful wooing of D’Angelo Russell included a helicopter flight over the city.”
For sure, this is where it’s happening.
Now, to see what “it” is.

What Are the Most Expensive Shows on TV and How Much Do They Cost?

It wasn’t so long ago when the idea of spending $10 million on an episode of television threw network executives into cardiac arrest. Lost ‘s two-part pilot in 2004 was the most expensive in TV history (at the time) at a reported cost of $14 million and spearheaded ABC’s return to dominance. But what you may not know is that Disney’s top brass were so infuriated at the cost that they forced Chairman of the ABC Entertainment Group Lloyd Braun out of the company. Spend wisely was the mantra of linear television for much of its existence. But those days are now as dead as Christian Shephard.
With the proliferation of streaming services backed by deep pocketed tech companies and well-resourced media conglomerates, the price of doing business in TV has vaporized all reasonable expectations. So we thought it would be fun to run through some of the most expensive television shows in the game and gawk like window shoppers at their gaudy, pearl-clutching price tags.
SEE ALSO: How Many Subscribers Will It Take to Make HBO Max a Success?
For starters, Apple emerged victorious in a heated bidding war for Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon’s splashy new drama The Morning Show , which will spearhead Apple TV+ as it launches November 1. Aniston and Witherspoon are both serving as executive producers and commanding north of $1 million per episode (cha, meet ching). Overall, Apple reportedly plunked down $300 million to produce two 10-episode seasons of The Morning Show , according Bloomberg. Each episode cost upwards of $15 million.
As if that weren’t enough, Apple—which boasts the largest market cap of all the conglomerates involved in original programming—is also spending between $15 million and $17 million per episode on Jason Momoa’s See . The tech giant doled out a full series order for one eight-episode season of the sci-fi dystopian drama. Apple is reportedly funding the third miniseries collaboration between Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks, Masters of the Air, for $20 million per episode, according to Variety .
HBO’s Game of Thrones grew into a mammoth worldwide hit and the premium cable network’s most popular series ever. It’s often regarded as one of the catalysts for the current blockbusterization of TV. Its eighth and final season cost around $16 million per episode with the final two episodes totaling somewhere in the “high eight figures,” per Variety .
In 2018, it was reported that the live-action Star Wars series The Mandalorian, forthcoming from Disney+, would cost $100 million over the course of its 10-episode run. As it turns out, the final price tag is much closer to $150 million as each episode ran up a tab of about $15 million. Along with the upcoming streamer’s blockbuster Marvel miniseries, which will cost up to $25 million an episode, it’s clear that the Mouse House isn’t messing around as it emphasizes direct-to-consumer business.
Not to be outdone, Netflix continues to spend aggressively. The market-leading streaming service shelled out $15 billion this year on content alone. Royal drama The Crown is said to have cost $130 million over its first two 10-episode seasons ($6.5 million per episode), but recent reports suggest that number is closer to $13 million per episode. In a New York Times profile last month, producer Ryan Murphy bragged that his new Netflix series The Politician was somehow even more expensive.
And finally, Amazon spent a staggering $250 million just for the rights to Lord of the Rings . Next up, they plan to invest $1 billion into the show over five seasons, making it the single-most expensive TV series in history.
Long story short: we all got into the wrong business.

Texto completo: "BoJack" embarks on its final season, and Chance the Rapper hosts and performs as the musical guest on "Saturday Night Live."
What's Streaming
BOJACK HORSEMAN Stream on Netflix. This talking horse has certainly had his ups and downs over the course of this series, often sabotaging his own success with drugs, alcohol and other destructive behaviors. But as the show enters its final season, BoJack (Will Arnett) seems to be on the path toward accepting responsibility by entering rehab. Elsewhere in Hollywoo, Diane (Alison Brie), Princess Carolyn (Amy Sedaris), Todd (Aaron Paul) and Mr. Peanutbutter (Paul F. Tompkins) grapple with their own definitions of happiness as their brightly colored animated world changes around them. The show, a sendup of Hollywood, will also tackle film franchises, mergers and unionization efforts. These eight episodes serve as Part 1 of the final sixth season, with Part 2 coming Jan. 31.
KILLING ZOE (1994) Stream on Amazon, Hulu, Vudu; Rent on iTunes, Google Play and YouTube. In her review for The New York Times, Janet Maslin summed up this film from the director Roger Avary as "fiercely ambitious but way out of control." Avary, who has worked as a writer with Quentin Tarantino on "Reservoir Dogs" and "Pulp Fiction," also penned the script for this film, which centers on a violent, bloody bank heist at the hands of a safecracker and his childhood friend. Ahead of the job, the two men have a night of debauchery in the Parisian underworld and then march into the bank the following day to collect their score. "In nasty episodes meant to make 'A Clockwork Orange' look like a day at nursery school, the robbers don party masks, revel in the terror they've created and kill their hostages with hair-trigger petulance," Maslin writes.
ROTHKO: PICTURES MUST BE MIRACULOUS Stream on PBS platforms. This American Masters documentary delves deeper into the career of the painter whose work covers the walls of museums and whose life inspired the Tony Award-winning play "Red." Mark Rothko's legacy and contribution to the Abstract Expressionism movement is explored in interviews with his children, Kate and Christopher, curators, art historians and conservators. Alfred Molina plays Rothko in re-enactments of the painter's life, using segments from his personal diaries as a guide.
What's on TV
SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE 11:30 p.m. on NBC. Chance the rapper joins Taylor Swift, Jennifer Lopez, Justin Timberlake and Britney Spears as one of the few celebrities to host the show and perform as the musical guest on the same night.
WOMEN OF IMPACT: CHANGING THE WORLD 10 p.m. on National Geographic. This month, National Geographic released a new book that compiles images from the magazine's archives to create a comprehensive visual record of the lives of women from across the world. The magazine's November issue, written and photographed exclusively by women, will also celebrate perspectives on modern womanhood. As a companion piece to those projects, this special features new and archival interviews with more than 40 history-making women, including the ocean explorer Sylvia Earle, the journalist and author Martha Raddatz, the photographer Ami Vitale and the scientist Jane Goodall.

Texto completo: I didn’t think it possible for AOC to say anything stupider but now she wants to abolish prisons. When is it going to happen that the rest of her squad members are going to realize how stupid she is? That is the dumbest thing I have heard yet out of her mouth. Sanctuary cities. Let’s abolish prisons, too. Great.
Pottsville

Way to go, Mayor Muldowney and the City of Pottsville. You didn’t revitalize downtown Pottsville. You just killed it with your new parking. I don’t see any indication of free handicap parking. We have elderly and handicap that frequent Pottsville where I work and we are really disadvantaging them. Kind of even a form of discrimination.
Saint Clair

The Washington Post, the New York Times, television stations ABC, NBC and CBS are all wrong. The only correct view comes from that Republican cable station run by a Republican billionaire called Fox News. Don’t make people laugh. Trump is nothing but a liar.
Frackville

Well, there you go again, Pottsville. You done it again. Now you are putting tickets on cars because you don’t have the app. Does anyone know how to use the app except those who are really familiar with the iPhone and so forth and this phone and that phone? That is bologna. You should have left the meters in. You are killing business in downtown Pottsville. How can you progress with something like that?
Pottsville

That was a cheap shot at U.S. Representative Dan Meu-ser by Schuylkill Indivisible. Those tactics are unacceptable, especially in the Pottsville library.

I see where Attorney General Barr is expanding his probe into the 2016 election interference. You wonder why all these Obama people on MSNBC are worried? I got news for you, they better be worried. They are all going to jail.

Texto completo: President Trump has called members of the press "enemies of the people," deemed critical coverage "fake," accused news organizations of treason and threatened to make it easier to sue journalists for libel.
But not until this week had Mr. Trump turned to the ultimate recourse of the unhappy reader: He canceled his subscription.
Officials in the West Wing on Thursday announced that copies of The Washington Post and The New York Times would no longer be delivered to the White House. The administration is moving to force other federal agencies to end their subscriptions to the papers, as well.
"Not renewing subscriptions across all federal agencies will be a significant cost saving -- hundreds of thousands of taxpayer dollars will be saved," the White House press secretary, Stephanie Grisham, said in a statement.
Representatives for The Post and The Times declined to comment.
The White House remains a significant customer of print journalism: Copies of The Wall Street Journal, USA Today, The Financial Times and other publications are delivered to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue every morning, along with Mr. Trump's preferred first read, The New York Post.
And the president remains a rabid absorber of the wider media landscape, frequently commenting on what he sees on cable news and sending handwritten notes to journalists, often scrawled on printouts of their articles.
Mr. Trump previewed his cancellation plans during an interview on Monday on Fox News, during which he called The Times "a fake newspaper" and told Sean Hannity that "we don't even want it in the White House anymore."
"We're going to probably terminate that and The Washington Post," Mr. Trump said in the interview. "They're fake."
Jonathan Karl, the president of the White House Correspondents' Association, said on Thursday, "I have no doubt the hardworking reporters of The New York Times and Washington Post will continue to do quality journalism, regardless of whether the president acknowledges he reads them. Pretending to ignore the work of a free press won't make the news go away or stop reporters from informing the public and holding those in power accountable."
There is some precedent for a presidential cancellation.
In 1962, John F. Kennedy, apparently fed up with the coverage of The New York Herald Tribune, decreed that copies of that newspaper would no longer be delivered to the White House. His press secretary, Pierre Salinger, after initially ignoring the president's repeated requests to cancel the paper, eventually acquiesced and announced that Kennedy would instead read The St. Louis Post-Dispatch.
The move was met with mockery. A New Jersey lawmaker ordered a year's gift subscription to The Herald Tribune sent to Kennedy. On the floor of Congress, Representative Steven Derounian, Republican of New York, called the decision "childlike."
"If all members of Congress followed the president's lead, we would find that we were reading no newspapers at all," Mr. Derounian said, according to an account in The Congressional Record. "It might be well to remind President Kennedy that on Jan. 20, 1961, he was inaugurated as president, not coronated as king."
Kennedy, it turned out, could not get along without his daily copy of The Herald Tribune. In his memoir, Mr. Salinger wrote that the staff was forced to "bootleg" copies of the paper to the president until it was formally allowed back in the White House.

Texto completo: Fifty-one years ago, a group of protesters calling themselves W.I.T.C.H. staged a Halloween "hex" on Wall Street. Dressed in all black, with long peaked hats, the women sneaked through the narrow streets of downtown Manhattan late into the night, making their way to the entrance to the New York Stock Exchange, where they oozed glue into the latches of its doors. The next morning, the male bankers couldn't get in -- and the Dow reportedly fell 13 points.
"We didn't consider ourselves real witches, but we used the moniker because of what it represented: a powerful woman," said the author Robin Morgan, one of the protest organizers, noting that the acronym -- which stood for "Women's International Terrorist Conspiracy From Hell" -- probably wouldn't go over so well today.
Today, there might be no need to sneak around. Real witches are roaming among us, and they're seemingly everywhere.
Haven't you noticed?
Witches are your millennial co-workers doing tarot card readings on their lunch breaks, and professional colleagues encouraging you to join them for a New Moon ceremony aimed at "career success." (This happened to me the other day.)
Witches are influencers who use the hashtag #witchesofinstagram to share horoscopes, spells and witchy memes, and they are anti-Trump resistance activists carrying signs that say "Hex the Patriarchy" (also the title of a new book of spells) and "We are the granddaughters of the witches you weren't able to burn."
Witches are panelists, they are podcasters, they are members of The Wing (which calls itself a "coven"), they are in-house residents at swanky Manhattan hotels and some might say that one is even a presidential candidate, Marianne Williamson. (Alyssa Milano, of "Charmed" fame, recently fund-raised for Williamson. Coincidence?)
[ Read more: We have some questions for the witch in residence at a Manhattan hotel ]
"I think everyone probably is the son or the daughter of a witch," said Augusten Burroughs, the best-selling memoirist, whose new book, "Toil & Trouble," tells the story of his own witchy coming out.
"'Witch' is a loaded word, but I do love it," he said, noting that his husband thinks it needs some P.R. help. "I mean, I didn't choose to write this book. It just came. And that tells me that something has been unlocked. It's time. It is the moment somehow for witches to come out -- in all their vibrant diversity."
Indeed, this fall, at least a dozen new witch books have or will hit the market -- so many that Publishers Weekly has declared it "season of the witch."
The books span personal narrative, including that of Burroughs, as well as "Initiated: Memoir of a Witch," by the first-time author and practicing witch Amanda Yates Garcia. (She calls herself the "oracle of Los Angeles.")
Some of the books are political, such as Lindy West's "The Witches Are Coming" (based on a similarly titled Times column), which is not actually about witchcraft but misogyny in the #MeToo era. There is "Modern Witchcraft," by the Wiccan high priestess Deborah Blake, which argues for witchcraft as a female-focused religion, and "Revolutionary Witchcraft," by Sarah Lyons, a guide to the history and practice of politically motivated magic.
There is fictional witchery in "Hex Life," a collection of witch stories written by female fantasy authors, and also plenty of self-help. "Bitchcraft: Simple Spells for Everyday Annoyances and Sweet Revenge" is pretty much what it sounds like; "Wild Witch: A Guide to Earth Magic" focuses on magic through plants and herbs. And for those who feel they may need some basics in horticulture to make use of those spells, not to worry: There's "The Modern Witchcraft Guide to Magickal Herbs" by Judy Ann Nock, the founder of a goddess spirituality group, and "The Witch's Herbal Apothecary," by the master herbalist Marysia Miernowska.
"I initially was nervous to publicly call myself a witch," said Yates Garcia, who performs energetic healings and conducts magic workshops in Los Angeles. "I was brought up practicing witchcraft -- my mother was a witch -- and even though it does have a lineage in my family, even recently, you couldn't really say you were a witch."
And yet it seems the time has come to come out of the so-called broom closet.
There is no perfect way of tracking witches in America, but we do know that Wicca -- the religion that has its roots, at least partially, in 1950s England, with a retired civil servant named Gerald Gardner who once tried to hex Hitler -- is more popular than ever, according to a number of studies.
[ Meet the "Terry Gross of witches. ]
Not all witches are Wiccan (some are pagan), and not all Wiccans or pagans practice witchcraft, but you get the point.
Additionally, Americans of all ages and genders are more spiritual than ever: According to a 2017 survey from the Pew Research Center that examined New Age beliefs, 60 percent of Americans believe in one or more of the following: psychics, astrology, the presence of spiritual energy in inanimate objects (like mountains or trees) or reincarnation. More than a quarter of adults in the United States say they think of themselves as spiritual but not religious.
Perhaps it should come as no surprise that witchcraft is attracting people, particularly millennial women: Interest in spirituality tends to increase in periods of upheaval, said Helen Berger, a sociologist at Brandeis University and the author of "Solitary Pagans: Contemporary Witches, Wiccans, and Others Who Practice Alone," which came out in August.
"We're in a period of great transition, we're all very aware of it: There's an increase of globalization, an enormous amount of polarization, and for many of these young people, this spirituality is speaking to them," she said. "It's giving them autonomy."
And, of course, witches have long been linked to women's issues, which are front and center in the present political moment.
"I often say, show me your witches and I'll show you your feelings about women," said Pam Grossman, the author of "Waking the Witch: Reflections on Women, Power and Magic," and the host of the "Witch Wave" podcast. "Witches reflect our fears and our fantasies about women with power."
Indeed, many believe that midwives were persecuted for being witches. Women who liked sex were called witches. In the 2008 election, Hillary Clinton was called a witch. Women who proclaimed #MeToo were, as the president himself has put it, on a "witch hunt."
There are less political forces at play as well: 1990s nostalgia in the form of leather chokers, Lilith Fair retrospectives (Lilith, before she was a symbol of female independence, was what you might call a witch) and reboots of TV shows like "Bewitched" and "Sabrina the Teenage Witch" and films like "Practical Magic" and "The Craft."
For more than 40 years, W.I.T.C.H. has been more or less dormant. Yet over the last couple of years, Morgan said, she has received inquiries from young activists wanting to start their own groups.
Two years ago, a group of witches in San Francisco hexed City Hall in favor of a "healthier future"; last October, a Brooklyn occult shop called Catland held a public ritual to hex Brett Kavanaugh, at the time a Supreme Court nominee. Who knows what this Halloween will hold.
"I think the same way some women took to wearing 'Nasty Woman' T-shirts after Trump used that label on Hillary Clinton, women have embraced the 'witch' label," said Nell Scovell, a television writer who was the creator of ABC's "Sabrina the Teenage Witch" and an executive producer on "Charmed." "These days, so many women feel powerless that it's fun to think about flinging Bill Barr into a wall with the flick of a finger."

The Day The Trump Boom Died

Texto completo: Why has business confidence collapsed?
Last spring Donald Trump and the people around him probably thought they had a relatively clear path to re-election.
On one side, it looked as if Trump had weathered the threat of politically fatal scandal. The much-awaited Mueller report on Russian election intervention had landed with a dull thud; the details were damning, but it had basically no political impact.
At the same time, Trump was convinced that he could run on the basis of a booming economy. Never mind that his claims to have run up the best economic record in human history were easily refuted; the reality seemed good enough to sell as a big success story.
What a difference a few months make.
Everyone is following the impeachment story, and I don't have much to add, except a warning: At every stage of this process, Republicans have proved willing to engage in stunningly bad behavior. Did anyone foresee Wednesday's physical attempt to disrupt the House inquiry? The point is that as the net closes in, the G.O.P. response is likely to be uglier than you can possibly imagine.
What's getting less attention, understandably, is the way the Trump economic narrative is falling apart.
To be fair, the overall state of the economy is still pretty good. Unemployment is very low and job growth is continuing. And while there will eventually be a nationwide recession -- the business cycle has not been abolished -- it's not at all clear that we'll have one before next year's election.
However, important parts of the economy are lagging. Manufacturing production is down over the past year; combined with weakness in shipping and very hard times in agriculture, around a fifth of the economy is effectively in recession. In particular, manufacturing employment has been falling in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, states that chose Trump by tiny margins in 2016, giving him a win in the Electoral College despite losing the popular vote.
And overall growth, while still positive, is definitely slowing: "nowcasts," which use partial data to estimate what official economic data will say when it's eventually released, suggest an economy growing at an unimpressive annual rate of less than 2 percent. Since elections turn more on the economy's growth rate than on things like the level of unemployment -- unemployment was still more than 7 percent when Ronald Reagan won his 1984 landslide -- this is not good news for Republicans.
[For an even deeper look at what's on Paul Krugman's mind, sign up for his weekly newsletter.]
Probably even more significant, there has been a dramatic decline, almost a collapse, in business confidence.
You can see this collapse several ways. One is through surveys of business executives, who spent Trump's first two years being very bullish, but have now become remarkably pessimistic.
You can also see it in the bond market, a much better indicator of economic expectations than the stock market. Long-term interest rates tend to be high when investors expect a booming economy, in which the Fed will tighten money to head off inflation; they tend to be low when investors expect protracted economic weakness and easy money as far as the eye can see.
And 10-year bond rates have plunged, from more than 3 percent last year to 1.75 percent as I write this. The last time we saw this kind of plunge was 2010-11, when investors finally realized that recovery from the Great Recession was going to be slow and painful, not a repeat of "morning in America."
So what happened to the Trump boom? The collapse in confidence began late last year, when it became clear that Trump was serious about waging trade war on China; it continued as evidence accumulated that the 2017 tax cut was a big fizzle, doing basically nothing to boost business investment and providing at most a brief sugar high to overall growth.
But the truth is that even pessimists expected the tax cut to do more good, and the trade war less harm, than they did. Why have things turned out so poorly? One answer, to which I've subscribed, is that in addition to its direct impacts on U.S. exports and businesses that rely on Chinese suppliers, the trade war has created damaging uncertainty. Businesses that rely on global supply chains won't invest for fear that the trade war will get even worse; but businesses that might move in to replace imports also won't invest for fear that Trump will eventually back down.
I suspect, however, that there's even more to the story. Business interests spent a long time in denial, but now even they are facing up to the reality that Trump and his team are very strange people who have no idea what they're doing -- and the uncertainty that reality implies.
I mean, considering that trade confrontation with China is the centerpiece of Trump's economic policy, it's not reassuring to learn that his trade war czar, Peter Navarro, has an imaginary friend -- a source named "Ron Vara" whom he has repeatedly cited in his books, but who doesn't exist, and whose name is in fact just an anagram of "Navarro."
Next year's election should be about Trump's betrayal of his oath of office. Realistically, however, it also matters that the economy probably won't be his friend.

Texto completo: The company will celebrate its 80th anniversary in spring with some of its oldest and most recent repertory, and Alexei Ratmansky's "Of Love and Rage."
"Of Love and Rage," a new evening-length ballet by Alexei Ratmansky, will have its New York premiere during American Ballet Theater's spring season, the company announced on Thursday.
The ballet -- the latest installment of the company's multiyear (and multimillion-dollar) Ratmansky Project -- is an adaptation of Chariton's "Callirhoe," an ancient Greek love story, set to music by Khachaturian arranged by Philip Feeney. Its New York premiere is planned for June 2; the world premiere is to be in March at the Segerstrom Center for the Arts in Orange County, Calif.
Ballet Theater's New York season, May 11 through July 4 at the Metropolitan Opera House, will mark the company's 80th anniversary. To celebrate, it will open with two programs called "ABT Then and Now." The first, "Then," will feature some of the oldest dances in Ballet Theater's repertory: George Balanchine's "Theme and Variations" (1947); Antony Tudor's "Jardin aux Lilas" (1940); and Jerome Robbins's "Fancy Free" (1944). And the second, "Now," will draw from recent premieres: Jessica Lang's "Garden Blue," Twyla Tharp's "A Gathering of Ghosts" and Mr. Ratmansky's "The Seasons."
The three ballets of the "Then" program were also presented during Ballet Theater's 75th anniversary season. Kevin McKenzie, the company's artistic director, said they were brought back because they give a snapshot of Ballet Theater's earliest years.
"That's what you would have seen onstage, nine times out of 10," he said. "Those three choreographers, and those ballets in particular, were a launching pad for the identity of the company."
In recent seasons, Ballet Theater retreated from its custom of bringing in starry guest dancers, instead highlighting its homegrown talent. But three will join the company for spring: Olga Smirnova, of the Bolshoi; Kimin Kim, of the Mariinsky; and Natalia Osipova, of the Royal Ballet in London.
Ms. Smirnova and Mr. Kim are cast in "La Bayadère" -- Natalia Makarova's staging, which will celebrate its 40th anniversary with this revival. And Ms. Osipova is to dance in revivals of Kenneth MacMillan's "Romeo and Juliet" (opposite David Hallberg) and "Giselle" (with Mr. Hallberg again).
The performance of "Giselle" on June 13, as the company announced this week, will be the farewell of Stella Abrera, who was promoted to principal dancer in 2015 after a star turn in the ballet that season.
Other story ballets returning to the repertory include Cathy Marston's "Jane Eyre," as well as two Tchaikovsky-set classics: "The Sleeping Beauty," Mr. Ratmansky's opulent reconstruction of the original by Marius Petipa, and "Swan Lake," a staging by Mr. McKenzie after Petipa.

Texto completo: The president won't be at the first World Series game in D.C. since 1933. But he said he would go to Sunday's game, if there is one, though he has no plans to throw out a ball.
WASHINGTON -- All of red-shirt-wearing, baby-shark-clapping Washington will be at Nationals Park on Friday night as the nation's capital hosts its first World Series in 86 years, or at least as much of the city as can squeeze into the stadium. But missing the action will be Washington's most famous transplant resident.
President Trump, who has kept a conspicuous distance from baseball since taking office, plans to skip Game 3 between the Washington Nationals and the Houston Astros as the series comes to town. He said he would go on Sunday if the best-of-seven contest reaches a fifth game but even then would not throw the first pitch because he would look fat in the Kevlar vest he would have to wear.
"I don't know. They're going to have to dress me up in a lot of heavy armor," he told reporters on Thursday. "I'll look too heavy. I don't like that."
Until now, Mr. Trump has never attended a Major League Baseball game while living in the White House, the first president since 1910 to dispense with an apple-pie tradition that has provided unifying moments even in divisive times. While the rest of the town has reveled in the stunning triumphs of Juan Soto, Howie Kendrick and the once-left-for-dead Nats, as they lead the series, 2-0, Mr. Trump has stayed uncharacteristically quiet.
Mr. Trump surely realizes that Nationals Park may not be the most hospitable territory for a president who drew just 4 percent of the vote in the District of Columbia in 2016 and describes its permanent residents as "the Swamp." No president likes to be booed. When this one heads to a stadium, he prefers it filled with supporters for campaign rallies.
"He would do much better if he threw out a pitch in Houston," given his electoral success in Texas, said Tom Davis, a Republican former congressman from Virginia who worked for years to bring baseball back to Washington.
Democrats were less charitable. "I think it only says something about Trump," said Joe Lockhart, who served as White House press secretary for President Bill Clinton and later a top executive for the National Football League. "He only enjoys events that are about him. He doesn't enjoy or really recognize something that's bigger than him."
Even without the president, who will be at Camp David, Friday night's game stands as a landmark moment for a city cursed by the baseball gods for generations. The last time baseball's championship was played in Washington was in 1933, when President Franklin D. Roosevelt threw out the ceremonial first pitch. Roosevelt "made an imposing entry" and was given "a boisterous reception," as The New York Times recorded, although "the president of course maintained an attitude of strict neutrality."
The Washington Senators, also commonly called the Nationals at the time, went on to beat the New York Giants at Griffith Stadium, 4-0, on that rainy day but lost the series. After that, the town fell on hard baseball times, so much so that "Damn Yankees" featured a desperate Senators fan willing to sell his soul to the devil for just one long-ball hitter.
The first-in-war, first-in-peace, last-in-the-American-League Senators eventually decamped to Minnesota to become the Twins and then the expansion club that took its place left for Texas to become the Rangers.
After more than three decades without baseball, the Montreal Expos moved to Washington in 2005 rebranded as the Nationals, becoming perhaps the only bipartisan agreement in a capital rived by tribalism as Republicans and Democrats flocked to games. The team's miserable start last spring followed by its remarkable surge over the summer and now a two-game lead in the World Series have been the stuff of Hollywood scripts.
But while senators and representatives and cabinet officers exult over the team, Mr. Trump has exhibited no public interest, perhaps a little surprising for a man who still relishes his time playing first base and serving as team captain on the baseball squad at New York Military Academy.
In 2013, he boasted that he was "said to be the best" player in the state, adding, "Ask coach Ted Dobias-said best he ever coached." (Mr. Dobias put it a little differently in 2015, describing Mr. Trump as "very coachable," which "made him a good baseball player.")
Mr. Trump has rarely shied away from offering his opinions about baseball before. He has tweeted admiration for Yogi Berra, Derek Jeter and Carlos Beltran while repeatedly urging Major League Baseball to induct Pete Rose into its Hall of Fame despite his gambling scandal. He has also trashed Alex Rodriguez relentlessly ("A-Rod is a joke!" and "the biggest sports embarrassment of all time").
Mr. Trump has presented himself as a good-luck talisman. "I'm going to the @Yankees game tonight to root them on -- they always win when I am there," he wrote in 2012. But he criticized the Nationals for sitting their star pitcher Stephen Strasburg during the playoffs that year when he was still recovering from Tommy John surgery.
"When Strasburg leaves @Nationals for another team for more money, will Washington still like the decision to shut him down for his good?" Mr. Trump wrote at the time.
There is a long tradition of presidents embracing baseball, going all the way back to Benjamin Harrison, who in 1892 became the first sitting commander in chief to attend a major league game. William Howard Taft loved the sport so much he inaugurated the tradition of throwing the opening day pitch in 1910.
Other presidents had genuine affinity for the game. Dwight D. Eisenhower played semiprofessional baseball under an assumed name before heading to West Point. Ronald Reagan broadcast play-by-play radio accounts of Chicago Cubs games recreated from a telegraph wire. George Bush was the captain of the Yale baseball team, played in two national college championships and kept his mitt in his drawer in the Oval Office. His son George W. Bush was an owner and managing partner of the Texas Rangers.
While many of Mr. Trump's predecessors relished going to the ballpark, he would not be the first to be booed or to worry about being booed. The younger Mr. Bush decided to throw out the first pitch in Game 3 of the World Series in New York in October 2001 shortly after the Sept. 11 attacks as a potent symbol of national resolve but fretted that he would toss it in the dirt as he had done earlier in the year in Milwaukee.
The pressure in Yankee Stadium mounted when Jeter teasingly warned him beforehand: "Don't bounce it! They'll boo you!" To his enormous relief, Mr. Bush, with a Kevlar vest under his New York Fire Department jacket, hurled the ball 60½ feet cleanly over the plate and right into the catcher's mitt, as the crowd chanted, "U-S-A, U-S-A!" It was "the most nervous moment of my presidency," Mr. Bush said later.
And no wonder. "It's always potentially hazardous for politicians to appear at a sporting event and expose themselves to the verbal ravages of the crowd," said David Axelrod, who was a senior adviser to President Barack Obama, whose own opening day pitch at Nationals Park in 2010 went a little farther astray. "It may be particularly so for Donald Trump in D.C."
Curt Smith, a former speechwriter for the elder Mr. Bush and the author of "The Presidents and the Pastime: The History of Baseball and the White House," published last year, said Mr. Trump should have continued the tradition before now, noting that, before becoming president, he threw out first pitches at Yankee Stadium, Fenway Park and Wrigley Field.
"He would be booed," Mr. Smith agreed. "However, every president is booed at baseball games. It's part of the job. He should put on a Nationals jacket, wear an Astros cap, grab an old glove, and throw out the first ball. Let him keep the first-ball tradition great -- an institution and a unifying influence in a nation which is rapidly losing both."

Texto completo: A reader calls on the newspaper to apologize. Also: Rudolph Giuliani and President Trump; America's foreign wars; life in a Queens basement.
To the Editor:
"But Her Emails ..." (editorial, Oct. 23):
I am disappointed that The Times did not use the opportunity to apologize for its obsessive coverage of this Hillary Clinton nonscandal in 2016. According to an article in the Columbia Journalism Review, "in just six days, The New York Times ran as many cover stories about Hillary Clinton's emails as they did about all policy issues combined in the 69 days leading up to the election."
Mrs. Clinton lost the election for myriad reasons, but it did not help that The Times's coverage of this issue reinforced many voters' suspicions that she was untrustworthy. Jeffrey Toobin, chief legal analyst for CNN, apologized this week for hyping the email story during that crucial moment. If The Times wants to regain the trust of its readers heading into 2020, it should do the same.

Don't Call Giuliani the President's Lawyer
To the Editor:
It is obvious why Rudolph W. Giuliani and President Trump want to call Mr. Giuliani the president's personal lawyer, as the press routinely does but shouldn't. Communications between a lawyer and a client are privileged, which means that Mr. Giuliani would be able to stonewall congressional committees and the courts without risking contempt.
But the privilege will apply only in those instances when Mr. Giuliani can prove that he was in fact giving Mr. Trump legal advice. There is no privilege for other work he does for Mr. Trump, including shadow diplomacy in Ukraine and public relations, the two areas where he seems to spend most of his time. Whatever we call these other tasks, they are not the practice of law.

Another Side of 'Endless War'
To the Editor:
Re "When Trump Invokes War's Human Toll to Defend His Policies" (White House Memo, Oct. 20):
Your reflection on President Trump's expressions of anguish over the loss of American troops killed or wounded in combat doesn't mention the glaring omission in the president's acknowledgment of the human costs of war: that U.S. bombs and bullets have killed thousands of civilians under his watch, a large increase since this president took office.
A four-month battle in Raqqa, Syria, alone in 2017 cost some 1,600 civilian lives, not to mention destruction of 80 percent of the city. In Somalia, too, Mr. Trump's policies gave the green light to triple the number of airstrikes against Al Shabaab, resulting in at least 17 civilian killings that Amnesty International has documented and that the United States still refuses to acknowledge.
And in Afghanistan, in the first quarter of 2019, for the first time ever, more civilians were killed by forces allied with the Afghan government, including the U.S. military, than by the Taliban and other insurgents combined.
Ending "endless war" is a laudable goal, but the president should be honest about the costs of his wars on civilians and far more careful in ensuring that U.S. actions protect civilians rather than lead to their slaughter.

Immigrants Who Struggle and Succeed
To the Editor:
Re "Life Below: The Sunless World of Immigrants in Queens" (special section, Oct. 24):
I didn't expect the article about the basements in Queens to make me teary-eyed. My family and I used to live in a basementnear Roosevelt Avenue in the 1990s. I grew up in this two-bedroom basement along with many of my aunts and uncles who had just come from Mexico.
My parents always made room for anyone who needed a space to sleep while they learned the ropes on surviving in this country.
The basement is my childhood home. My memories are full of laughter, surrounded by family, but I still remember the struggle my parents endured, which I admire all these years later.
The struggle eventually paid off; my parents are now American citizens, and I work full time in one of New York City's agencies. I feel for those going through that struggle, but I know that things will work out for them!

Police officers are rejecting Beto O’Rourke’s gun control authoritarianism

Texto completo: If the federal government were to attempt an overtly unconstitutional gun control overreach, which side would the police take? We just got our answer loud and clear — and it's music to the ears of liberty-lovers across this country.
The police are an integral part of the communities they serve. They represent both the community and the government, a duality unknown in almost any other institution. Their role is simple: protect rights and keep the peace. This vital duty, one of the few true core functions of government, derives its effectiveness from the trust of the community, which sees police officers as their protectors. And that’s how it should be.
In a Tuesday morning appearance on Fox and Friends, the Fraternal Order of Police National Vice President Joe Gamaldi illustrated this in a stunning rebuke of Beto O’Rourke’s plan to use law enforcement to confiscate lawfully-purchased firearms. Gamaldi stated “At a time when everyone is asking us to bridge the gap with the community, his brilliant idea to connect with our citizens is to go door to door and seize their property? It’s completely ridiculous.”
He also called for a real discussion on gun crimes, including calling out activist district attorneys for failing to prosecute existing gun laws in some of our major cities.
I was a member of the Fraternal Order of Police for many years before retiring from law enforcement. Many times, I was concerned when the union sometimes did not share my view on politics and policy. But the union has proved its value in the tough times, and has been on the right side of many issues as of late — including support for the First Step Act — when it saw that the law would positively affect both police and the communities its they serve.
Gamaldi’s comments, however, threw down the gauntlet for what our local police officers really represent: protectors of their communities in every way, including protection from an overzealous federal government.
Gamaldi made it clear: Don’t ask our officers to violate the Constitution for your political goals, they simply won’t have it. Law enforcement has a proud tradition of considering itself the thin blue line between order and chaos, between good and evil. It was a proud moment for the largest and most powerful police union in the nation to say unequivocally “this is what we stand for.”
Police officers have always felt that they are the protectors of their communities, meaning that they are a part of those communities. The common reference to police officers as their city’s “finest” reflects that view.
We have seen this kind of reflexive push back by law enforcement against infringing on citizens’ rights occur with increasing regularity surrounding gun laws. Most notably, we’ve seen several sheriffs — the law-enforcement officers most accountable to the community through elections — refuse to enforce state laws that violate the Constitution. New Mexico, Colorado, Oregon, and Washington offer a few examples of this phenomenon.
These instances should be indicators to lawmakers everywhere that the police are not simply a mercenary army to be used against an unassuming populace. Quite to the contrary, they are the community — and represent the biggest obstacle to those who would violate the rights of their community.
Randy Petersen is a senior researcher for the policing initiative at the Texas Public Policy Foundation. Petersen spent 21 years as a police officer working in the patrol, investigations, training, and administrative divisions before retiring in 2014 and becoming a director of a police academy in Texas.

Soprano Alyson Cambridge
FRYEBURG — For the first time in over a decade, the Portland Symphony Orchestra is returning to the Mt. Washington Valley for one night only on Thursday, October 24 at 7 p.m. In celebration of the Leura Hill Eastman Performing Arts Center’s 10th Anniversary, the ‘PSO’ will be performing a very special concert with Broadway and Metropolitan Opera soprano Alyson Cambridge. Founded in 1923, the PSO is widely regarded as one of the top symphony orchestras of its size in the country. Led by Music Director, Eckart Preu, the orchestra is comprised of 82 professional musicians from all across New England. The October 24th concert at the LHE/PAC provides a rare opportunity to see the PSO perform away from their residence at Merrill Auditorium in Portland, Maine.
American Soprano Alyson Cambridge has performed at some of the world’s most recognized performance venues (Carnegie Hall, Los Angeles Opera, and London’s Royal Albert Hall, to name a few). She is currently starring in Rocktopia on Broadway and has sung multiple lead roles with the Metropolitan Opera. Hailed by critics as “radiant, vocally assured, and artistically imaginative” (Washington Post) and noted for her “powerful, clear voice” (New York Times), Alyson Cambridge has become “one of the most diverse and compelling vocal artists on the scene today.” The October 24th concert will also feature guest conductor Erin Freeman.
Tickets are $40 for adults, $35 for seniors (65+), and $20 for students. Order online at www.fryeburgacademy.org/pac, or call the box office at 207-935-9232. The October 24th concert is funded in part by the generosity of the Robert & Dorothy Goldberg Charitable Foundation. The LHE/PAC is located at 18 Bradley Street in Fryeburg, Maine on the Fryeburg Academy campus.

Texto completo: The lawsuit says David Boies and Lisa Bloom used underhanded tactics to stop the actress from publicizing her sexual assault allegations against the producer.
The actress Rose McGowan on Wednesday sued Harvey Weinstein and the lawyers David Boies and Lisa Bloom, accusing them of directing a campaign of covert and illegal measures meant to discredit her and prevent her from going public with her rape accusation against him.
The lawsuit includes Ms. McGowan's account of attempts to interfere with her plan to publish a memoir, "Brave," including sending an undercover agent to befriend her and then steal a copy of the manuscript. It also describes efforts to derail the reporting by The New York Times and The New Yorker that ultimately exposed decades of accusations against Mr. Weinstein and helped ignite the #MeToo movement.
The lawsuit, filed in Federal District Court in Los Angeles, said that Mr. Weinstein tapped into a team of professionals whose goal was to "ensure that Ms. McGowan's story never saw the light of day, and -- if it did -- that no one would believe her."
Besides Mr. Weinstein, Mr. Boies and Ms. Bloom, the lawsuit names the lawyers' firms as defendants, as well as Black Cube, a private intelligence firm that used undercover agents to approach women who had accused Mr. Weinstein of sexual misconduct.
In her lawsuit, Ms. McGowan, 46, accused Mr. Weinstein of raping her at the Sundance Film Festival in 1997. She reached a $ 100,000 settlement with Mr. Weinstein that year. Since 2017, when The New York Times and The New Yorker published their first articles, Ms. McGowan has been vocal in her support of women who stepped forward to accuse the producer of sexually harassing them or worse. Mr. Weinstein has been criminally charged in Manhattan with sexually assaulting two women and has pleaded not guilty.
In a statement on Wednesday, Phyllis Kupferstein, a lawyer for Mr. Weinstein, said that "Rose McGowan will be shown to be what she is: a publicity seeker looking for money."
Ms. McGowan's lawsuit says Mr. Weinstein offered her $ 1 million to stay quiet and drop the publication of her book. Ms. Kupferstein said Ms. McGowan asked for $ 6 million.
"From the moment she sought a multimillion dollar payout in return for not making these baseless allegations, which we rejected, we knew that she was waiting for an opportune time to begin this," Ms. Kupferstein's statement said. "We will demonstrate that this case has no legal merit."
Ms. Bloom has said she made a mistake in agreeing to work for Mr. Weinstein in 2016 and 2017, but has refused to comment on the specific role she played, citing attorney-client privilege. Mr. Boies has defended his work for Mr. Weinstein, which stretched from 2002 to 2017, saying the only thing he would have done differently was to more closely monitor Mr. Weinstein's use of the firm Black Cube.
Edward Evans, a spokesman for Mr. Boies's firm, Boies Schiller Flexner, said in a statement that the "progress of the #MeToo movement is essential" but that Ms. McGowan's lawsuit "inappropriately includes our firm and we have no choice but to defend ourselves against allegations that are simply untrue."
A lawyer for Ms. Bloom, Eric George, said in a statement that it was "inexcusable" that Ms. McGowan included Ms. Bloom as a defendant. "There is simply no credible factual or legal basis for her claims against my client," he said.
Representatives for Black Cube did not respond to requests for comment on Wednesday.
More than a year before the first articles appeared, Ms. McGowan made it publicly known that she was writing a memoir and in Hollywood, it was widely rumored that the book would include accusations against Mr. Weinstein. According to the lawsuit, that is when Mr. Weinstein and his lawyers began springing into action.
In late 2016, Mr. Weinstein hired Black Cube, a private investigative firm founded by former Israeli intelligence officials, to help him, a contract that was executed by Mr. Boies's firm. In 2017, the suit says, an undercover agent employed by Black Cube started posing as an executive from a London-based wealth management firm interested in paying Ms. McGowan for speaking engagements related to women's rights. The undercover agent gained Ms. McGowan's trust and then covertly recorded Ms. McGowan reading the agent excerpts from her book, which the firm later shared with Mr. Weinstein and his lawyers, the lawsuit said. Ms. McGowan said she believes the agent stole her unpublished manuscript during a meeting between the two during which the agent had access to her laptop.
According to the lawsuit, a British freelance journalist working for Black Cube was directed to interview Ms. McGowan under the guise of writing a story about men in Hollywood, when he was actually trying to glean information about the memoir she was writing. Ms. McGowan's book was published in January 2018, and in it she described the alleged rape by Mr. Weinstein in detail.
The lawsuit bases some of its factual allegations on reporting in the recently published books "She Said," by the Times reporters Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey, as well as "Catch and Kill" by Ronan Farrow, the New Yorker writer. The three shared in the 2018 Pulitzer Prize for public service for their reporting. Mr. Farrow has extensively reported on Black Cube's work and "She Said" describes Mr. Boies's work for Mr. Weinstein and how Ms. Bloom, a prominent victims' rights attorney, was working behind the scenes with the producer to thwart his accusers and quash the journalists' investigation.
The lawsuit accuses the defendants of racketeering, fraudulent deceit, and inflicting emotional distress. It said Mr. Weinstein and his team engaged in a "diabolical and illegal" effort to silence Ms. McGowan that had negative impacts on her life.
"Her book sales suffered; her expenses mounted; her job opportunities vanished; and her emotional health cratered," the lawsuit said. "She has experienced trauma and depression from defendants' actions, and the deep betrayal will have lifelong effects."

Texto completo: After an off-season in which it seemed like the N.B.A. never took a break, The New York Times talked to a few of the league's stars about some of the other important things in their lives -- anything but basketball.
Portland Trail Blazers guard C.J. McCollum is a seven-year veteran and one half of perhaps the league's most underrated backcourt.
PORTLAND, Ore. -- C.J. McCollum, the Portland Trail Blazers shooting guard, studies his performances, probing for areas where he can improve.
"I hear the awkward pauses," he said. "I hear it when I breathe too hard."
McCollum, 28, is always breaking down tape -- of his weekly podcast. He takes his craft seriously. He has a studio in his home office and portable equipment that he brings with him on the road to record episodes of "Pull Up with C.J. McCollum," which he co-hosts with Jordan Schultz, an analyst for ESPN.
McCollum interviews guests, dissects news from around the N.B.A., touches on world affairs -- though one is now off limits -- and laments the perennial plight of his beloved Cleveland Browns. He now considers it one of his "healthy habits" as he enters his seventh season in the league.
McCollum meditates. He does hot yoga. He sips fine wine. And he hosts a podcast.
"It gives me an escape," he said.
In the process, McCollum has fashioned himself into one of the N.B.A.'s ultimate insiders: a player who shares insight from behind the curtain. He is not the only player who doubles as host -- J.J. Redick of the New Orleans Pelicans and Danny Green of the Los Angeles Lakers also have podcasts, which have become something of a cottage industry for professional athletes -- but McCollum is the only one who majored in journalism at Lehigh.
Now, after more than 80 episodes and nearly as many guests, McCollum is still working to hone his reportage. He listens to a playback of each episode, often in the cold tub after workouts, with the same sort of cold-eyed discipline that has shaped him into an elite scorer. He has several thousand listeners who are willing to help with his development, too.
"People were pointing out that I used the phrase, 'You hit the nail right on the head,' in like six straight episodes," he said. "You really find out what your filler words are."
Growing up in Ohio, McCollum would skim the Canton Repository at breakfast before heading to school. Reading the newspaper, he said, became a morning ritual.
"I think as a kid, it made you feel older," he said.
At Lehigh, McCollum thought he would study business, but it was a drag. ("Too much math," he said.) He much preferred writing papers and interacting with people, he said. After switching his major, he wrote for the school newspaper and covered a bit of everything: football, tennis, swimming. He recalled interviewing coaches after tough losses. He recalled bundling up with his notepad for field hockey games. He also recalled an important lesson about professionalism.
"Preparation is everything," McCollum said. "You don't like being interviewed by someone who hasn't done their research."
With that in mind, McCollum reads up on his guests, most of whom are fellow athletes, before their appearances on his show: their childhoods, their interests, their accolades, their hobbies.
"And then the conversation usually just flows," he said. "I want to get inside their lives: what they do in their spare time, their story, their journey."
One of his most recent guests was Kent Bazemore, a swingman whom the Trail Blazers acquired in an off-season trade.
"It was an opportunity to share my story with his audience and for him to hear about some of the things I've been through," Bazemore said. "Any time you can open up and be kind of vulnerable to the public, people seem to appreciate it."
Bazemore was no stranger to the medium: With the Atlanta Hawks last season, he co-hosted a podcast alongside Vince Carter.
It may be an obvious point, but McCollum has found that players are willing to open up to him because he is a player, too. There is mutual respect. But he also wants their conversations to be authentic. He does not traffic in public relations, he said, and he does not want his interviews to feel scripted.
"Like, if I'm assessing someone's game and they can't shoot, they can't shoot," he said. "And they know they can't shoot. It's not like I'm making fun of them."
He added: "I just keep it real, man. We're all peers."
McCollum made his newsiest splash when he welcomed Kevin Durant to his podcast last year. The two had an entertaining back-and-forth that started when McCollum obliquely criticized Durant for jumping to a ready-made contender when he signed with the Golden State Warriors in 2016. Later in the interview, Durant laughed at McCollum's suggestion that Portland could vie for a championship. It all seemed fairly lighthearted -- until it spilled onto social media, with the two exchanging barbs on Twitter.
The truth, McCollum said, is that they were both playing up their purported feud in the middle of a dull off-season. It may not have been the most objective journalism, but ...
"We're friends, so it was funny," McCollum said, "and it was really good for the ratings. I got us some really nice wine."
McCollum was asked whether he would be interested in stirring up some controversy for the sake of this article.
"Nah" he said, "I can't do that. Not before the season starts."
One topic that McCollum does not plan on addressing in upcoming episodes is China, and the N.B.A.'s suddenly fraught relationship with that country after an executive with the Houston Rockets expressed support for Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement. McCollum has a sneaker endorsement with the Chinese brand Li-Ning.
"That's something I'm going to stay away from," he said.
But McCollum has big plans for the pod, with a list of dream guests he said he would love to interview that includes Sue Bird, Michael Jordan, Malcolm Gladwell, Barack Obama.
"A lot of it is getting listeners to relate to us, to understand that we have doubts, we have struggles, we have anxieties, we have stress -- that there are times when we may have doubted ourselves, but we still overcame it," he said.

Texto completo: Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin will participate in the Riyadh conference a year after the U.S. shunned it in the wake of Jamal Khashoggi's killing.
The top echelon of Washington and Wall Street will return to an opulent investment conference in Saudi Arabia next week, a year after American officials and prominent business leaders shunned the gathering amid backlash surrounding the killing of Jamal Khashoggi, a dissident Saudi journalist.
The Treasury Department confirmed on Tuesday that Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin would participate in the Future Investment Initiative gathering in Riyadh. Jared Kushner, President Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser, will also attend the conference, alongside Brian H. Hook, the State Department's special envoy overseeing Iran policy, and Avi Berkowitz, an aide to Mr. Kushner, according to people familiar with the matter.
Senior finance-industry executives, who publicly withdrew from the conference as global outrage mounted over the murder of Mr. Khashoggi, a Washington Post columnist, are also heading back. Among those planning to participate are Stephen A. Schwarzman, the chief executive of the Blackstone Group; Dina Powell McCormick, a member of the management committee of Goldman Sachs; and Larry Fink, chief executive of BlackRock. John Waldron, who was named Goldman's president and chief operating officer in 2018, will attend the conference as well.
Saudi agents killed and dismembered Mr. Khashoggi in the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman emerged as a primary suspect; Western intelligence agencies think he was at least complicit in the killing, if he did not order it.
During the furor that followed the murder, Mr. Schwarzman, Ms. McCormick and Mr. Fink backed out of the event, along with an array of other financiers and prominent media-industry figures.
Since then, many executives have pledged to continue their partnerships with Saudi Arabia, which range from joint investments in entities like Blackstone's multibillion-dollar infrastructure fund to client relationships with companies like BlackRock, which opened an office in Riyadh this year. JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs are advising the Saudi oil company Aramco on its planned public stock offering.
In a nod to their continuing relationships, Carlos Hernandez, the global head of corporate and investment banking at JPMorgan, and Franck Petitgas, head of Morgan Stanley's international arm, will attend the investment gathering this year.
"People in the business world want to do business with Saudi Arabia. They never really stopped; they just kept a low profile," said Steven Cook of the Council on Foreign Relations. "The crown prince clearly remains toxic for some people, but my sense is that business leaders want to move on."
Saudi Arabia has been a dealmaking machine in recent years, dangling the prospect of hundreds of millions of dollars in fees to banking advisers on Wall Street and in London. The kingdom's $ 320 billion sovereign-wealth fund, the Public Investment Fund, holds significant positions and board seats in companies like the ride-sharing service Uber and the Japanese media and technology conglomerate SoftBank. The initial public offering of Saudi Arabia's huge oil company, Saudi Aramco, is expected to be the largest deal of its kind.
This year's Future Investment Initiative begins next Tuesday at Riyadh's lavish Ritz-Carlton hotel with discussions of the global economy and issues of work force inclusion. But some executives plan to arrive earlier and attend private events with Yasir al-Rumayyan, the governor of the Public Investment Fund and the recently appointed chairman of Aramco, and other officials.
Mr. Mnuchin is expected to participate in a moderated discussion during the main portion of the conference. He initially planned to attend last year, but reversed that decision as international anger grew over the killing.
Some business leaders have signaled their hopes for a better human-rights record in Saudi Arabia, whose government also imprisoned hundreds of elites in the Ritz-Carlton as part of a purported crackdown on corruption in November 2017. During months of captivity at the luxury hotel, some were subjected to coercion and physical abuse, a New York Times investigation found.
In a LinkedIn post this year, Mr. Fink pledged to help continue BlackRock's dialogue with Saudi leaders in hopes that economic diversification would help the country modernize its economy and society. Still, his statement carried a tacit warning: "As I have said repeatedly to Saudi leaders," he wrote, "for Saudi Arabia to be on the world stage, it must act like a world leader."
Other executives have been less charitable about their relationships with Saudi Arabia. Earlier this year, the talent and media company Endeavor severed its relationship, returning $ 400 million Saudi Arabia had invested in it as a protest of Mr. Khashoggi's murder.
The Trump administration, which has counted Saudi Arabia as a critical ally in the Middle East, has walked a fine line in reacting to human-rights issues. While Mr. Mnuchin did not attend last year's conference, for instance, he still traveled to Riyadh and met with Prince Mohammed, where they discussed economic ties and counterterrorism initiatives, as well as the investigation into Mr. Khashoggi's death.
Mr. Mnuchin's participation in the conference this year will come as part of a broader international trip that includes stops in Israel and India.
Other leaders of international institutions that shunned Saudi Arabia in 2018 are also planning to return. David Malpass, the new president of the World Bank, is expected to be in attendance. Last year, Jim Yong Kim, his predecessor, withdrew from the conference, where he was supposed to be a speaker.
A year ago, Christine Lagarde, then the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, also defected from the conference. This year, her successor, Kristalina Georgiva, will be traveling to Thailand instead of Saudi Arabia, but Jihad Azour, director of the Middle East and Central Asia Department at the fund, plans to speak on a panel at the conference. The fund said a scheduling conflict was the reason for Ms. Georgiva's absence.
Other past conference attendees will not go back, including Lawrence Summers, the Harvard economist and former Treasury secretary, who attended the conference in 2017. Mr. Summers said in an email that "teaching and other commitments caused me not to consider."
And although Saudi's Public Investment Fund is one of Uber's biggest shareholders, the company's chief executive, Dara Khosrowshahi, will not attend the conference.

Texto completo: Mr. Wong, who had Tourette's syndrome and depression, drew wide acclaim for his first solo show in New York just last year.
Matthew Wong, a promising self-taught painter whose vibrant landscapes, forest scenes and still lifes were just beginning to command attention and critical acclaim, died on Oct. 2 in Edmonton, Alberta. He was 35.
The New York gallery Karma, which represented him, said the cause was suicide. His mother, Monita (Cheng) Wong, said Mr. Wong was on the autism spectrum, had Tourette's syndrome and had grappled with depression since childhood.
Mr. Wong's story was unconventional, even remarkable, in the art world. He had been painting and drawing seriously only since 2013, but his striking canvases led critics to invoke Jean-Baptiste-Siméon Chardin, Milton Avery, Vincent van Gogh and other familiar painters as they assessed his work and tried to describe its visual impact. A solo show at Karma on East Second Street in Manhattan in 2018 drew raves.
"Wong can be considered a kind of nouveau Nabi," Eric Sutphin wrote of the Karma show for the website and magazine Art in America, referring to a group of late-19th-century French artists, "a descendant of Post-Impressionist painters like Édouard Vuillard and Paul Sérusier. Like his forebears, he synthesizes stylized representations, bright colors and mystical themes to create rich, evocative scenes. His works, despite their ebullient palette, are frequently tinged with a melancholic yearning."
His mother, in a telephone interview, spoke of his sense of isolation, and of his struggles with depression. "He would just tell me, 'You know, Mom, my mind, I'm fighting with the Devil every single day, every waking moment of my life,"' she said.
Will Heinrich, reviewing the Karma exhibition in The New York Times, commented on a singular feature of several of the landscapes in the show: a lone figure, sometimes hard to spot in a vast, vivid scene.
"At first I thought these complicated constructs of color and pattern were spoiled by the single tiny person Mr. Wong drops into most of them," he wrote. "The figures' rough, rudimentary drawing upsets the intoxicating ambiguity of the larger shapes like a false note, and their drastic difference in scale makes them hard to focus on.
"But in fact they're both psychologically and formally crucial. It's only the little gray man at a wishing well who turns 'The Realm of Appearances' from an exotic but contained garden into the endless expanse of the unconscious. And it's only the sketchy gray man paddling a canoe across 'The Beginning' who, by keeping the painting anchored however tenuously in figuration, gives its psychedelic pointillism the power to shock."
Mr. Wong was born on March 8, 1984, in Toronto. Ms. Wong and her husband, Raymond, both had business careers, and the family relocated to Hong Kong when Matthew was 7. When he was 15 they moved back to Toronto, in part because of his medical needs, and Mr. Wong graduated from high school there.
In 2007 he earned a bachelor's degree in cultural anthropology at the University of Michigan, then he held several desk jobs.
"Somewhere around 2009 I took a photograph of a still life in my grandfather's bedroom with my Nokia E87," he told the online magazine Neoteric Art in 2014. "It was the first thing I remember doing out of my own creative volition."
In 2010 he enrolled in the School of Creative Media at the City University of Hong Kong, receiving a master's degree in photography there in 2013. But by then he had grown disenchanted with photography and had begun to draw.
"At first I just bought a cheap sketch pad along with a bottle of ink," he said, "and made a mess every day in my bathroom randomly pouring ink onto pages -- smashing them together -- hoping something interesting was going to come out of it."
Painting proved more fruitful, and he plunged into Facebook discussions among artists, absorbing techniques and influences, and finding other ways to educate himself.
"He would go to libraries and study all the masters -- Picasso, van Gogh, Matisse," his mother said.
He had his first breakthrough in 2015, a small solo exhibition at the Hong Kong Visual Arts Center, and images of his work online were starting to get attention. In 2016 the curator Matthew Higgs included Mr. Wong's works in "Outside," an exhibition for Karma in Amagansett, N.Y. It opened on Labor Day weekend, just as his mother turned 60.
"I said, 'Matthew, this is the best birthday gift,"' Ms. Wong said.
He sold one painting there immediately, she said, and other customers began finding him.
"He was so proud of himself," Ms. Wong said, "because he'd always been dependent on his parents."
Though he still lived with his parents, who had moved to Edmonton in 2016, he was finding some financial stability, handling most of his growing business himself.
"I'd just help Matthew with the logistics," Ms. Wong said, "like when he needed to ship something."
The 2018 show at Karma was his first solo exhibition in New York.
"The reaction to his work and exhibition is something that we hadn't experienced before with a young artist or a first show," Brendan Dugan, the gallery owner, said by email. "It was quite astounding. And the reaction was the same from critics, colleagues and collectors."
Mr. Wong didn't start out selling his paintings for small amounts like some artists; Mr. Dugan said he was commanding prices in the thousands and above right off. "The highest levels of collectors were immediately interested," he said. Before his death, Mr. Wong had prepared a second solo show with Karma, to be titled "Blue." It opens next month.
In addition to his mother, Mr. Wong, an only child, is survived by his father.
Ms. Wong recalled being constantly surprised at the art her son was producing in the studio he had set up in Edmonton.
"Every time I'd go to the studio with my husband to tidy up," she said, "we'd always see something."

Texto completo: Un reporte de The New York Times hecho por la periodista Paulina Villegas afirma que los residentes de Culiacán apoyaron la decisión del presidente Andrés Manuel López Obrador de liberar a Ovidio Guzmán López, alias “El Ratón” .
El texto destaca que aunque analistas y medios nacionales y extranjeros cuestionaron la liberación del hijo de Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán Loera , quienes vivieron la violencia desatada en Culiacán, Sinaloa, consideran que fue la mejor opción.
“Los residentes de Culiacán, la capital del estado de Sinaloa y el lugar de nacimiento del cártel, no comparten esos sentimientos. Dicen que la decisión salvó vidas” , indica la autora del texto, quien realizó una crónica de los días posteriores a los hechos violentos.
La historia expone los resultados del enfrentamiento y el miedo generalizado entre la población.
“Las huellas de la violencia estaban en todas partes. Los agujeros de bala golpearon edificios gubernamentales, restaurantes y hogares, e innumerables residentes llevaron consigo el trauma de lo que habían vivido ”, indica.
Las acciones del Cártel de Sinaloa provocaron terror entre los residentes de la capital.
“En los días posteriores al asedio de la ciudad de Culiacán por el Cártel de Sinaloa, los residentes se sintieron aliviados: alivio de que el terror haya terminado”, indica el Times. “Que más personas no murieron”.
La postura de los “culichis” coincide con la del presidente López Obrador, quien ha defendido la decisión de liberar a Guzmán López, a fin de de evitar más muertes.
“Ningún criminal vale más que una vida” , habría dicho el mandatario, quien este martes reconoció que desconocía que había un operativo para detener a “El Ratón”, aunque un día después de los enfrentamientos había dicho que respaldó la liberación del hijo de Guzmán Loera.

Texto completo: He was chief counsel to the New York commission formed after Frank Serpico's revelations about systemic graft and the department's lax response.
Michael F. Armstrong, whose dogged pursuit and exposure of crooked cops as chief counsel to the Knapp Commission in the early 1970s was credited with smothering an ingrained culture of corruption in the New York City Police Department, died on Thursday at his home in Manhattan. He was 86.
The cause was uveal melanoma, a cancer of the eye, his daughter Joanne Brandwood said.
Mr. Armstrong, and the investigators and prosecutors he enlisted to root out police corruption, succeeded by penetrating the previously inviolable blue wall of silence that had concealed systemic bribe-taking in police ranks. That code had led officers to overlook or even join in illegal activities -- including the theft of cash and narcotics seized in drug raids -- while impotent or complicit department brass saw no evil. Elected officials, too, ignored warnings, fearing a political backlash from police unions.
"The point is, everybody knew what was happening, and nobody would admit that it was happening," Mr. Armstrong said in 2009 in an oral history interview for the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in Manhattan. "You know, kind of just looked the other way. What we did is, we took the rotten fish and dropped it on the table and said, 'All right, deal with it."'
The commission was appointed by Mayor John V. Lindsay after The New York Times published a series of articles by David Burnham that had been prompted in large part by two police whistle-blowers, Frank Serpico and David Durk. The two reached out to The Times after neither high-ranking police officials nor City Hall had responded satisfactorily to their complaints.

Led by Whitman Knapp, who in 1972 was appointed a United States District Court judge, the panel revealed that corruption was by no means limited to the rotten apples Mr. Armstrong and his colleagues had caught in the act and persuaded to testify.
"We found that the barrel was completely tainted," Mr. Armstrong said in the oral history.
Among the commission's star witnesses was William R. Phillips, an officer who was caught taking payoffs from Xaviera Hollander, the madam who wrote the best-selling book "The Happy Hooker." (Recognized by a detective during his televised testimony, Mr. Phillips was charged in the 1968 murders of a pimp and a prostitute and was imprisoned for 32 years.)
"Frank Serpico had this statement," Mr. Armstrong said, "which was '10 percent of the department is absolutely corrupt, 10 percent is absolutely honest and the other 80 percent, they wish they were honest."'
Mr. Armstrong borrowed the last part of that quotation for the title of his 2012 book, "They Wished They Were Honest: The Knapp Commission and New York City Police Corruption."
Mr. Armstrong's interrogations led to the public shaming and in some cases punishment of corrupt officers. He acknowledged that his work did not suddenly instill scruples in the entire police force; but that 80 percent, he said, largely "turned around and became honest."
"The line I have used is that you can still be corrupt, but now you have to lie about it," he said. "You don't brag about it."
A tenacious prosecutor and a fierce advocate for his clients as a white-collar defense lawyer, Mr. Armstrong was both a law-and-order lawyer and a card-carrying member of the American Civil Liberties Union.
"He pulled no punches in exposing the depth of corruption with a dramatic flair, and was unbowed in his attempt to determine the facts," the former New York City police commissioner Raymond W. Kelly said in an email.
District Judge John F. Keenan, a former Armstrong colleague and special anticorruption prosecutor, said, also by an email, "What Mike did really made the Knapp Commission, and the commission made the Police Department more honest."
Michael Francis Armstrong was born on Dec. 14, 1932, in Manhattan to Joseph and Mary (Cassidy) Armstrong. His father was an advertising executive, his mother a homemaker.
After graduating from Bronxville High School in nearby Westchester County and considering a career in advertising, he earned a bachelor's degree in English from Yale and was admitted to Harvard Law School. He interrupted his law studies to serve in the Air Force and, after being discharged as a first lieutenant, graduated in 1960.
He married Catherine Joan Brennan, who died in 1998.
In addition to their daughter Joanne, he is survived by two other daughters, Deirdre Armstrong and Margaret Weiner; 11 grandchildren; three great-grandchildren; two sisters, Elizabeth Streeter and Mary Spitzer; and his partner, Gretchen Siebel. Two children, Catherine and Michael, died earlier.
As chief of the United States Attorney's securities fraud unit in New York in 1967, Mr. Armstrong successfully prosecuted the government's case against Louis E. Wolfson, who was among the first corporate raiders. Mr. Wolfson and a business partner had been accused of selling unregistered shares in a company they controlled. The investigation implicated Justice Abe Fortas of the United States Supreme Court, and he resigned two years later.
In 1973, after serving for two years as chief counsel to the Knapp Commission, Mr. Armstrong was named interim Queens district attorney by Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller following the indictment of the incumbent, Thomas J. Mackell, in a corruption scandal.
From the outset, Mr. Armstrong was disinclined to seek election for a full term. After getting a whiff of clubhouse cronyism, he became reluctant to engage in politics -- so reluctant, he said, that he proclaimed to a reporter:
"You're authorized to use this quote if I decide to run for public office. 'No. 1, I believe there's a Mafia and it's all full of Italians. No. 2, I think it was a disgrace for the Irish to remain neutral in World War II. And No. 3, I sympathize with the Palestinians in the Middle East."'
He added: "If I ever decide to run or think about running, I will know that you're out there, with this quote. That will end it, for sure."
In the 1980s Mr. Armstrong represented the children of Martha von Bülow in a civil suit against her husband, Claus von Bülow, who had been convicted of trying to murder her. They asked that he be barred from inheriting her multimillion-dollar fortune. They settled their suit in 1987 when Mr. von Bulow gave up his claim to their mother's estate. (Sunny von Bülow, as she was known, remained in an irreversible coma from 1980 until her death in 2008.)
In other cases, Mr. Armstrong negotiated the surrender in 1974 of Jane L. Alpert, a fugitive leftist radical who had been sentenced in a wave of bombings in New York; represented Donald R. Manes, the Queens borough president, who later committed suicide in a municipal corruption scandal; and supported the plea of Martin Tankeleff, whose conviction of murdering his parents when he was 17 in 1988 was vacated two decades later.
In 1995, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani appointed Mr. Armstrong chairman of the Commission to Combat Police Corruption, which was recommended by a Knapp Commission-style inquiry headed by Milton Mollen, a former state judge and deputy mayor. Most recently, Mr. Armstrong was of counsel to McLaughlin & Stern, a Manhattan-based firm.
Through films and books, the Serpico episode and the Knapp Commission have endured for decades as benchmarks in the city's fight against police misconduct, much to the surprise of some police critics -- and of Mr. Armstrong himself.
"This whole thing was like a World War I airplane," he once said. "You get a lot of baling wire and Scotch tape and you patch and patch and patch.
"Everyone kept saying we couldn't do it, particularly with what little we had. Maybe we were able to do it just because we didn't know it couldn't be done."

Texto completo: Authorities have blamed vaping for a rash of recent lung injuries and deaths thought to be linked to products that contain tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the primary psychoactive ingredient in marijuana. At the same time, use of nicotine-based e-cigarettes, such as Juul, has skyrocketed among middle and high school students, placing them at risk of addiction and potential health harms. In response, states including Michigan, Massachusetts, Oregon and Montana have initiated bans on flavored vaping products or all e-cigarettes. These distinct public health issues are often conflated, causing widespread confusion about e-cigarettes and their risks.
Myth No. 1 E-cigarettes are not regulated. Experts and activists urging government action on vaping sometimes imply that the industry has completely eluded oversight. "We must not stand by while e-cigarettes continue to go unregulated," said the president of the American Medical Association. "E-cigarettes are unregulated, which means that we don't know what's in them," a Kansas state health official stated in a news release.
E-cigarettes are, in fact, regulated by the Food and Drug Administration. In 2016, a "deeming rule" granted the FDA regulatory authority over the products, and the agency immediately prohibited selling e-cigarettes to people under 18. E-cigarettes currently on the market are required to display a warning label stating that they contain nicotine, and their makers must submit ingredient lists to the FDA (though these lists are not available publicly).
It's true that e-cigarettes are not well -regulated: Unauthorized products regularly enter the market, and underage sales too frequently occur in stores and online. Moreover, the government treats e-cigarettes like tobacco products, not pharmaceutical devices, so they escape the FDA's "safe and effective" standard. The products containing THC thought to be responsible for the lung injury outbreak are not regulated by federal agencies, since marijuana is considered a Schedule I drug.
Myth No. 2 Vaping is as harmful as smoking cigarettes. A growing number of Americans believe that vaping is as unhealthy as smoking, according to a Reuters poll last month. This impression is probably reinforced by the actions of retailers like Rite Aid, Walgreens, Walmart and Kroger, which have halted sales of e-cigarettes while continuing to sell traditional cigarettes and other tobacco products. And the New York Post warned that "Vaping might be more dangerous than smoking" while reporting on a 2018 study in the American Journal of Physiology.
That study's investigators, though, concluded that their data "aligned with the evidence of the less toxic effect of e-cig vapor compared with tobacco smoke." E-cigarettes are undeniably harmful, exposing users to numerous toxic and carcinogenic substances that may lead to adverse health effects. But they virtually eliminate exposure to carbon monoxide, tar and many of the 7,000 chemicals that contribute to cigarettes' lethality. In the most comprehensive review of the health effects of e-cigarettes to date, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine found that completely switching from cigarettes to e-cigarettes lessens exposure to numerous toxins and carcinogens and probably reduces adverse health outcomes in several organ systems. This evidence was supported by a large national study finding that exclusive e-cigarette users had substantially fewer biomarkers of toxicant exposure, compared with smokers and users of both types of products. In short, e-cigarettes are less harmful than smoking, but they are by no means safe.
In the recent THC-linked outbreak, every state but Alaska reported cases of acute injuries and even deaths from vaping. But smoking and exposure to secondhand smoke still cause 480,000 deaths in the United States each year, and according to the World Health Organization, tobacco kills almost half of all long-term users.

Myth No. 3 Vaping causes 'popcorn lung.' The myth that e-cigarettes cause "popcorn lung" - a rare condition that can cause irreversible airway obstruction, resulting from severe damage to the bronchioles - originates from a 2016 Harvard study in which researchers detected the chemical diacetyl in a sample of vaping products. (The nickname stems from an outbreak among workers in a microwave-popcorn factory who were exposed to high levels of vaporized diacetyl, which is sometimes used to create butter-like flavors and is a known cause of the disease.) The authors did not explicitly link e-cigarette use to popcorn lung, but the possible connection has been highlighted by health organizations such as the American Lung Association (which published an article titled "Popcorn Lung: A Dangerous Risk of Flavored E-Cigarettes") and by outlets from Good Housekeeping to the New York Times. A former chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics Tobacco Consortium told the New Yorker that vaping can cause the disease.
Inhaled diacetyl and other chemical flavorants may certainly pose respiratory risks to e-cigarette users, but to date, vaping has not been linked to popcorn lung. Moreover, diacetyl is present in cigarette smoke at levels substantially higher than those measured in the Harvard study, but smoking has never been considered a risk factor for popcorn lung, making it extremely unlikely that e-cigarettes cause the disease.
Myth No. 4 E-cigarettes do not help people quit smoking. American public health organizations generally discourage smokers from using e-cigarettes to help them quit. Smokefree.gov, run by the National Cancer Institute, nudges visitors toward other, FDA-approved methods for quitting smoking. California's smoking-cessation website puts it more directly: "E-Cigarettes: Not a Quit Tool!" In March, a team of economists wrote in Barron's that there was no evidence that "e-cigarettes were any better than self-help pamphlets" in helping people quit conventional cigarettes.
In Britain, however, nearly 900 smokers who wanted to quit participated in a recent randomized trial to determine the effectiveness of e-cigarettes compared with other nicotine replacement products, such as patches and gum. One year later, 18 percent of the e-cigarette users were not smoking, compared with 10 percent of the other nicotine replacement group. It is true that most smokers who try e-cigarettes continue to smoke, but that does not mean that e-cigarettes are an ineffective cessation aid: Most smokers who try FDA-approved nicotine replacement therapies also continue to smoke, but such products are still officially deemed "effective."
We are still learning about the product features and behavioral factors that may contribute to successfully quitting with e-cigarettes. One national study found that more than 50 percent of adult, daily e-cigarette users had quit smoking within the past five years, suggesting that the frequency of e-cigarette use may play a role in cessation.
Myth No. 5 E-cigarettes are a gateway to youth smoking. After several longitudinal studies documented that youth who first used e-cigarettes were more likely to try cigarettes, publications such as Fortune claimed that there was a "gateway" effect. The FDA recently released a promotional video featuring magician Julius Dein transforming a vaping device into a cigarette and saying: "It's not magic. It's statistics."
Despite their rigor, studies cannot fully account for "common liability" - the idea that certain people are simply more likely than others to engage in risky behaviors. Some youth may have tried smoking anyway; they just happened to use e-cigarettes first. It's possible that e-cigarette addiction may cause some young people to migrate to cigarettes, but the order of product use does not alone prove cause. In ascertaining whether vaping has a "gateway effect," it's also important to consider magnitude: If e-cigarettes are strongly associated with subsequent smoking among youth, we might expect to see an uptick in smoking at the national level. But despite a 78 percent increase in e-cigarette use among U.S. high school students between 2017 and 2018, there was no statistically significant increase in the high school smoking rate, which this year has dropped to a projected historic low of 5.8 percent. One BMJ study that examined multiple sets of data on American youth tobacco use demonstrated that the decline in youth smoking rates actually accelerated as vaping became more widespread. Make no mistake, though: While E-cigarettes do not seem to be leading large numbers of youth into smoking, the strikingly high rates of teenage vaping alone are alarming.

Texto completo: The FBI ruled out poisoned alcohol as the cause of two American tourists’ deaths in the Dominican Republic in May, bolstering the country’s findings that a spate of tourist deaths this year were not the result of foul play, a State Department spokesperson said Friday.
The Dominican Republic’s economy relies in part on drawing visitors to its beach resorts, and the country became engulfed in a crisis this summer when the families of multiple American tourists said their loved ones had died under suspicious circumstances. Several had sipped alcohol before their deaths, leading to one theory that tainted drinks were to blame.
The revelation Friday seemed to lend some support to what the Dominican authorities, despite a flood of negative news coverage, had argued: that the deaths, while tragic, were not occurring at an usual rate. Tourists die on vacation every year, and the State Department has maintained that there has not been an uptick in reported deaths.
FBI investigators did not give their own assessment of the cause of the deaths. They assisted the Dominican Republic National Police by conducting toxicology tests for three cases, including what to many seemed the most suspicious deaths: a couple from Maryland, Nathaniel Holmes and Cynthia Day, who died overnight in the same hotel room in La Romana.
The FBI ruled out methanol poisoning from alcohol for the deaths, the State Department spokesperson said.
The Dominican authorities had earlier found no evidence of foul play or violence and said the cause of the deaths was respiratory failure brought on by fluid in the lungs, known as pulmonary edema.
Steven Bullock, a lawyer for the couple’s family, said in response to the FBI results that his clients’ deaths still warranted further review.
“You had a couple that died of the same ailment at the same time, and they want to say that it’s natural causes,” Bullock said with a scoff. “I think there’s something for us to continue to look into.”
A relative of Miranda Schaup-Werner, 41, of Allentown, Pennsylvania, whose death in La Romana the FBI also assisted with investigating, referred questions to a lawyer who did not respond to a request for comment Friday.
More than 2.7 million Americans visit the Dominican Republic each year.

An Amusement Park That Brought Smiles And Chipped Teeth

Texto completo: Amusement parks are designed to deliver thrills. They are places for splashing and screaming and laughing, often on rides that defy common sense, not to mention the laws of physics.
But a park in New Jersey routinely delivered a lot worse -- bloody noses, bruises, broken teeth and bones, concussions and even death. People who spent a day at Action Park in its prime, in the 1980s and 1990s, often left with something to show for it: scars.
"People were bleeding all over the place," said Susie McKeown, who is now 52 and remembers going to Action Park after she graduated from high school more than 30 years ago. "People were walking around the park with scraped elbows or knees."
She went home with her own badge of honor, having broken one of her front teeth on a ride that ended with a 15- or 20-foot plunge into a chilly pond. "You went so fast that if your chin hit the water at the wrong angle, you chipped your teeth," she said.
She is hardly alone, as far injuries go -- or memories. Sports Illustrated recently published a 3,300-word article under the headline, "Remembering Action Park, America's Most Dangerous, Daring Water Park."
And in 2014, Cory Booker, a United States senator from New Jersey and a Democratic presidential candidate, wrote on Twitter, "I've got stories 2 tell."
Now a documentary is on the way. Its title is "Class Action Park," a reference to one of the many nicknames for Action Park. The park, about 50 miles northwest of New York City in Vernon, N.J., was long ago replaced by a far tamer destination, with different owners and a new name, Mountain Creek Water Park.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Action Park "was funny, it was weird, it was hysterical, but there was a darkness to it," said Seth Porges, who made the documentary with Chris Charles Scott.
"People got hurt there. The hardest part of making this movie was: How do you portray that? A lot of people look back fondly on it as a coming-of-age experience. How do you reconcile the fun of it with the human toll?"
Mr. Porges's parents put Action Park on their vacation itinerary when he was a teenager growing up in Bethesda, Md. "I have these memories of impossible machines, water slides that seemed like they came from a Looney Tunes cartoon and this crazed atmosphere of chaos," he said.
He also remembers the way Action Park promoted itself in the 80s and 90s. "The ads portrayed the place as a family-friendly, wholesome, great place to bring your kids," he said. "You'd get there and realize the reality of the situation was anything but."
The website WeirdNJ said two of the touchstones of growing up in New Jersey were being able to name all the places in the opening montage of "The Sopranos" and being seriously injured at Action Park. At least 14 broken bones and 26 head injuries were reported in 1984 and 1985. Action Park eventually bought the town new ambulances to handle trips to hospitals.
"Even the Action Park employees jokingly refer to the place as 'Traction Park,"' as in broken bones, The New York Times said in 1983.
But there were deaths at Action Park: six between 1978, when it opened, and 1996, when it closed. (It reopened under different owners a few years later, only to close and reopen again.) Two deaths occurred within a single week in 1982. One victim was a 15-year-old boy who drowned in the notorious Tidal Wave Pool. The other was a 27-year-old man who was electrocuted on a ride called Kayak Experience.
"There was virtually no action taken against" Action Park, said Mr. Porges, the filmmaker. "Eventually it shut down, not because of some regulator who said 'You're through.' But because it went bankrupt." (The state Labor Department found no violations in the kayak case, but said that electric current from an underwater fan could have caused serious bodily injury.)
Mr. Porges, a former editor at Maxim and Popular Mechanics magazines who has a degree in journalism, saw Action Park as a good story. "I'm a journalist by trade," he said. "I realized this is a great opportunity to apply my trade, so we began to dig. The true story of Action Park -- it's weirder and crazier than the legend."
But it is the nostalgia-tinted legend that remains in people's memories. Alison Becker, 42, an actress and writer best known for a recurring role on the sitcom "Parks and Recreation," said the risks at Action Park were part of the appeal. She said she had gone to Six Flags Great Adventure, which is also in New Jersey, and nothing equaled the fear factor at Action Park.
"You know the scene in 'Footloose' where they're playing a game of chicken with tractors and going at each other?" said Ms. Becker, who grew up about 30 miles from Action Park in Allamuchy Township. "Most people look at that and say, 'What dumb kids.' I look at it and say, 'That's like a day at Action Park. They could've charged an extra five for that, and we would have paid it."
Action Park was so notorious that there are stories about a test dummy that was sent through a ride before it opened. The dummy came out missing something -- its head, in some versions; a leg or an arm in others.
Andy Mulvihill, 56, the son of Action Park's longtime owner, said the tale about the dummy's head was true. He said he knows this because he was there. He was the first person to go on that ride, he said, after the dummy came out decapitated.
"I was wearing my hockey equipment when I did it," he said. Speed was essential. "If you didn't have enough speed," Mr. Mulvihill said, "you'd fall and smash your face, and if you smashed hard enough, you could break your nose or knock out some teeth."
He said that ride was open for only a few weeks at a time. "Generally, the rides were very tame," he said. "But there were some where you controlled the speed and the action, and if you were reckless, you could get hurt."
Action Park was created by Andy Mulvihill's father Eugene, whom Mr. Porges described as a "showman-huckster businessman, a mixture of P.T. Barnum and Walt Disney, with a little bit of Trump."
Andy Mulvihill said "the intent certainly was not to make it dangerous."
He also said the deaths did not deter his father, who pleaded guilty to fraud charges related to insurance policies in the 1984 and whom the Securities and Exchange Commission banned from the securities business in 1986.
"He didn't build Action Park just to make money," Mr. Porges said.
Nor did he "build Action Park just to break rules," he said. "He really wanted to create an incredibly fun place. He had a vision for the most fun place in the world, unhindered by common sense or safety. A lot of people romanticize it about him and the park. They say there are too many rules now, too much regulation, stuff used to be fun. Yeah, stuff used to be fun -- if you survived."
Andy Mulvihill called the deaths at Action Park "devastating to me."
But he added, "three of those deaths were drownings. We pulled out thousands and thousands of people who were people who had no business in the water."
And yet, it was exhilarating. For some, the conversation in the car on the way there "was about who's going to do this, who's going to do that, who do you think is going to get hurt," recalled Kris Brennan, who is now 45 and lives in Westfield. "It wasn't 'If someone gets hurt,' it was 'Who's going to get hurt?"'
Mr. Brennan had "a chunk of skin taken out of my hip" on the 2,700-foot-long Alpine Slide.
"Class Action Park" will probably bring on a flood of memories. But Andy Mulvihill is looking to tell the story his way, and next summer Penguin Books will publish "Action Park: Fast Times, Wild Rides and the Untold Story of America's Most Dangerous Amusement Park."
He said it was "nonfiction for sure," even if it read like fiction.
"When you do something as crazy, as cutting-edge" as Action Park, he said, "and you put it in the metro New York area, where New Yorkers are pretty much crazy anyway, you have stories."

Texto completo: After years of stage roles, Mr. Macy became a TV star in the 1970s as Walter, the harried husband of Bea Arthur's larger-than-life title character. Bill Macy, an actor best known for his role as Walter Findlay, Bea Arthur's harried husband, on the popular 1970s sitcom "Maude," died on Thursday night at his home in Los Angeles. He was 97.
The death was confirmed by his wife, Samantha Harper Macy.
Mr. Macy's acting career took off after he turned 40 and peaked with his role on "Maude." He played Walter for the show's entire run, from 1972 to 1978.
"Maude" pushed sitcom boundaries. Its lead character was an outspoken middle-aged feminist whose atypical household consisted of her husband, her daughter from an earlier marriage and the daughter's son. The show, seen on CBS, addressed complex social issues like abortion, alcoholism and racial and sexual relations. Some episodes generated thousands of complaints.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
"We took very serious things," Mr. Macy said in a phone interview for this obituary in 2010. "We didn't lampoon them, we lived them."
Mr. Macy's blue-collar background -- he grew up in Brooklyn and had driven a taxi -- made him a good fit for the character of Walter, the owner of a struggling appliance store who had some memorable clashes with Maude, an idealistic liberal firebrand. More often than not, Maude had the last word.
Fans were sometimes taken aback by Walter's subordinate position. "People come up to you in the street and say, 'How can you take that stuff from her?"' Mr. Macy said.
The show began as a spinoff of the pioneering producer Norman Lear's breakthrough hit series "All in the Family," in which Ms. Arthur appeared occasionally as a cousin of Edith Bunker's who stood up to Edith's bigoted husband, Archie.
Mr. Macy's favorite episode of "Maude," he said, was the one in which he did not appear: "Bea Arthur did a solo, and I was paid without having to go to work that week."
Bill Macy was born Wolf Marvin Garber on May 18, 1922, in Revere, Mass., to Mollie and Michael Garber. (His neighbors persuaded his parents to Americanize his first name to William, he said.) When he was 9 months old, the family moved to the East Flatbush section of Brooklyn. His father worked in the garment industry in Brooklyn.
After graduating from Samuel J. Tilden High School, Mr. Macy served in the Army from 1942 to 1946 with the 594th Engineer Boat and Shore Regiment, stationed in the Philippines, Japan and New Guinea.
After years of working odd jobs and attending acting classes, he enrolled in New York University's School of Education and earned a bachelor's degree in dramatic arts in 1954. While there, he married Sandra Sprinkling. They soon divorced.
While driving a taxi, Mr. Macy began booking small parts onstage. He chose the name Bill Macy to distinguish himself from another actor named William Garber.
In reviewing an Off Broadway revival of Clifford Odets's "Awake and Sing" in 1970, Walter Kerr wrote in The New York Times that "Bill Macy's Uncle Morty, confident that the system will work just so long as you tip it politely and don't make rude noises, is drawn with a steel nib, fine and hard."
Mr. Macy was finally able to give up driving a cab for good in 1966, after landing roles in two of the three one-act plays that made up Jean-Claude van Itallie's dark Off Broadway satire "America Hurrah."
Mr. Macy said that Mr. Lear saw his performance and invited him to California for a brief appearance as a police officer on "All in the Family." He later thought of him while casting "Maude."
In 1957, Mr. Macy met Judith Janus, a dancer with the Martha Graham Dance Company. They married a few years later and divorced in the 1960s. He met Samantha Harper when she auditioned as a replacement in "Oh! Calcutta!," the erotic revue in which the actors performed nude, in 1969. She passed the audition, and they married in 1975. She is his only survivor.
After "Maude," Mr. Macy starred as a university president on Mr. Lear's short-lived CBS sitcom "Hanging In." He also appeared on television shows like "The Love Boat," "Murder, She Wrote," "Seinfeld" and "My Name Is Earl," and in movies like "The Producers" (1967), the film adaptation of "Oh! Calcutta!" (1972) and "Analyze This" (1999).
He played a small but pivotal part in Carl Reiner's 1979 comedy "The Jerk," Steve Martin's first movie. Mr. Macy's character's glasses keep slipping off his nose, and Mr. Martin's character, working as an enthusiastic gas station attendant, invents a device to keep them in place. Mr. Macy's character markets the device and makes Mr. Martin's character rich.
Mr. Macy was an inveterate joker, even when discussing his career. He recalled being approached by a man who said his performance in a Broadway play was the worst he had seen in 20 years.
His reply, he said, was "Sir, sir, I'm a terrible actor, but it's the only thing I do well."

Baby Powder Is Recalled For Asbestos

Texto completo: Johnson & Johnson, which has spent years insisting that its baby powder is safe, recalled 33,000 bottles of the product on Friday after the Food and Drug Administration discovered evidence of asbestos, a known carcinogen, in one of the bottles.
The recall, the first time Johnson & Johnson has pulled baby powder from store shelves over asbestos concerns, could undercut its defense against a swarm of allegations that its talc-based products caused cancer. It comes as the company, which reaches into the lives of millions of people through brands such as Tylenol, Band-Aid and Rogaine and reported nearly $ 82 billion in sales last year, is entangled in numerous legal battles over the safety of its products.
The company has settled some claims -- and is still fighting others -- involving its role in the nationwide opioid crisis. On Thursday, Johnson & Johnson agreed to pay $ 117 million in a settlement over the deceptive marketing of transvaginal pelvic mesh implants, and a jury this month ordered it to pay $ 8 billion to a Maryland man who accused the company of playing down the risks associated with the antipsychotic drug Risperdal. In total, the company faces more than 100,000 lawsuits over its products.
More than 15,000 of those are from people who say baby powder and other talc-based products caused them to develop cancer. Some have mesothelioma, an aggressive cancer that is considered the signature disease of asbestos exposure, while others have ovarian cancer.
The decision to pull the baby powder, sourced from China and distributed last year, is a "whopper" for a company as dependent on consumer trust as Johnson & Johnson, said David Noll, a law professor at Rutgers University.
"I can't imagine an attorney for Johnson & Johnson standing up in front of a jury now and saying with a straight face that the product is safe," Mr. Noll said. He added that "if people come to associate the company's signature product with deadly diseases, there will be huge spillover effects for its ability to market other products."
The recall was prompted by the FD.A.'s discovery of trace levels of chrysotile asbestos in samples from a bottle of baby powder bought from an online retailer. The company said it was informed of the results on Thursday and recalled bottles from lot number 22318RB out of an "abundance of caution," though the F.D.A. advised consumers with baby powder from the affected lot to "stop using it immediately."
But Johnson & Johnson also repeated its longstanding defense against cancer claims, saying that "thousands of tests over the past 40 years repeatedly confirm that our consumer talc products do not contain asbestos." The company appeared to question the testing process, saying in a statement that it is working with the F.D.A. to "determine the integrity of the tested sample and the validity of the test results."
Dr. Susan Nicholson, Johnson & Johnson's vice president of women's health, said during a short conference call with investors on Friday that the F.D.A.'s report showed "an extremely unusual finding" that was "inconsistent with our testing to date."
In response, an agency spokeswoman, Gloria Sánchez-Contreras, said, "The F.D.A. stands by the quality of its testing and results."
Analysts estimate the baby powder lawsuits could cost Johnson & Johnson $ 5 billion to $ 10 billion. The recall could lead to the company's having to pay more in damages or to settle cases, said Erik Gordon, a University of Michigan business professor who studies corporate governance. Shares of the company closed down more than 6 percent on Friday.
Plaintiffs in the talc cases have accused Johnson & Johnson of failing to warn customers of the risks of asbestos contamination, despite being aware of concerns for decades. A New York Times investigation last year found internal memos and reports made public during litigation that document executives' concerns about potential contamination that date back 50 years.
[Read our investigation into claims about asbestos in baby powder .]
Johnson & Johnson disclosed this year that it was being investigated by the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission over concerns about possible asbestos contamination of its talc-based products.
Johnson & Johnson is awaiting a major decision that could tilt the talc litigation in its favor. As part of pretrial proceedings for thousands of talc lawsuits consolidated in New Jersey, a federal judge is mulling whether to block testimony from expert witnesses hired by plaintiffs, a move that could cause many talc cases to be dismissed or dropped.
[Thousands of people who trusted Johnson & Johnson's baby powder for decades are suing the company after developing cancer. "The Weekly," our new TV show, investigates their allegations .]
Baby powder represents a tiny fraction of Johnson & Johnson sales but an outsize threat to its reputation.
Johnson & Johnson's name is "so synonymous with their line of baby products," said Alla Valente, an analyst with Forrester. But recently, she said, the company has started a "damage control campaign" that casts it as bigger than its baby powder, focusing on its slate of other products.
"It's about trust: If a mother could trust a Johnson & Johnson product for their children, then that product must be safe," Ms. Valente said. "But now, the dam is finally breaking, where consumers are saying that enough is enough."
Talc is a natural mineral, formed in underground deposits under the same geological conditions as asbestos. In mines, veins of asbestos can intermingle with talc, geologists say.
Johnson & Johnson officials emphasized on Friday that the level of asbestos detected was very low, just a fraction of 1 percent of the sample. United States health agencies, however, say there is no known safe level of exposure to asbestos.
While health risks increase with heavier and longer exposure to asbestos, the overall evidence suggests no level of asbestos exposure is safe, and disease has been found in people with only brief exposures, according to the National Cancer Institute.
Several earlier F.D.A. tests, including one in the past year and another about a decade ago, did not detect any asbestos in samples of baby powder.
The F.D.A. does not require safety testing for personal-care products and cosmetics before they are marketed, and tests products only occasionally, usually after complaints by consumers or advocacy groups.
The agency considered -- and soon abandoned -- a plan to monitor talcum products for asbestos in the 1970s, when concern about asbestos in household products captured the public's attention. The F.D.A. commissioned tests of Johnson & Johnson powders back then, and the company successfully challenged their validity.
This year, after consumer tests found asbestos in makeup kits for children sold at Claire's, the F.D.A. followed up with its own tests. It detected the carcinogen in half of 20 products, including Claire's eye shadow and compact powder, JoJo Siwa makeup sold at Claire's, and bronzers, blush and other makeup made by Beauty Plus Global City Color Cosmetics and sold in retail outlets. The products were eventually recalled.
The agency plans to test 30 more products containing talcum powder, including those popular on social media and others marketed to children, Ms. Sánchez-Contreras said. The products are a tiny percentage of the thousands of personal-care products available for sale.

Texto completo: Peoples' Symphony Concerts quietly offers Carnegie Hall-quality artists for less than a Manhattan movie ticket. Or even a large popcorn.
It is no secret that classical music faces strong headwinds, but one challenge has been reaching gale-force proportions in recent years: high ticket prices.
The top ticket costs $ 495 at the Metropolitan Opera, $ 295 at Carnegie Hall and $ 165 at the New York Philharmonic. And while their average prices are much lower -- and each offers inexpensive, sometimes free outreach programs -- fans and newcomers can feel priced out of performances that often seem more like luxury goods than staples.
All of which makes Peoples' Symphony Concerts a holdout -- one of the best deals in New York, a city not exactly known for bargains.
The organization, which offers performances by some of the best artists in the world for as little as $ 8.33 a concert, will open its 120th season on Saturday evening with the Juilliard String Quartet playing Mozart, Britten and Brahms in the auditorium of Washington Irving High School in Manhattan.
"We're primarily able to do it due to the generosity of the musicians, who come and play for a fraction of their normal fees," said Frank Salomon, 83, who has managed the series for nearly half a century. "The artists believe in the mission. And many say it's one of their favorite audiences anywhere in the world."
Founded during New York's earlier Gilded Age by Franz X. Arens, a conductor with a vision of making the finest music available to students, workers and immigrants, the series has continued to offer Rolex-quality performances at Timex prices.
By using less opulent venues (Washington Irving's auditorium has good acoustics, but hard wooden seats), forgoing advertising, and attracting philanthropy and well-timed bequests, Peoples' Symphony has been able to present an impressive roster of artists over the years, including Joshua Bell, Yefim Bronfman, the Emerson String Quartet, the Guarneri Quartet, Leonidas Kavakos, Gidon Kremer, Lang Lang and Radu Lupu.
Everything is expensive in New York these days: rent, groceries, restaurants, taxis, movies, pop concerts, ball games. But rising costs pose a special threat to classical music, raising barriers at a fragile moment when the field must fight to keep existing fans and lure new ones.
Michael M. Kaiser, the former president of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, said that after years of bumping up ticket prices to offset spiraling costs, many presenters were hitting a point of diminishing returns: Some people are deciding they cannot afford live performances and are opting instead for home entertainment alternatives.
"This is a problem in the field," said Mr. Kaiser, who is now the chairman of the DeVos Institute of Arts Management at the University of Maryland.
Peoples' Symphony Concerts have been aimed, from the start, at the 99 percent -- giving regular New Yorkers a chance to enjoy the best the city has to offer.
This season is no exception. The great lieder singer Mark Padmore has performed Schubert's anguished "Winterreise" song cycle at Carnegie Hall and Lincoln Center, and has made more than one celebrated recording of it. This May he will sing it at Town Hall with the jazz pianist Ethan Iverson as the finale of a six-concert Peoples' Symphony series that can be bought for $ 80 (or $ 13.33 a concert) or $ 52 ( $ 8.66 a concert). Other artists in the series include the pianist Benjamin Grosvenor and the violinist Augustin Hadelich, who appeared this month with the New York Philharmonic.
The top price for a single ticket? $ 24.
Mr. Salomon, who is also an artist manager and a senior administrator at the Marlboro Music Festival in Vermont, said that he had been chasing Mr. Padmore since hearing his astonishing performance as the Evangelist in Bach's "St. Matthew Passion" with the Berlin Philharmonic at the Park Avenue Armory in 2014.
"He just blew me away, and I started lobbying to try to get him," Mr. Salomon said, recalling stalking Mr. Padmore in 2016, when the tenor received the vocalist of the year award from Musical America. "And after five years of bugging him, we finally got him."
Mr. Padmore said that he had been intrigued by the organization's goal of making music affordable.
"I was really delighted to hear about it," Mr. Padmore said in a telephone interview, noting that he also serves as the artistic director of the St. Endellion summer festival in Britain, where artists donate their services to keep costs down. "I think what they do with these concerts is completely admirable."
From the start, the concerts have drawn discerning audiences. A 1902 review in The New York Times of a program at Cooper Union, the series' first home, said that the audience's "attention and manifest understanding are such as to put pretentious up-town audiences to shame."
The organization still draws engaged, knowledgeable crowds to hear its chamber music and recitals. The pianist Garrick Ohlsson, who has performed several times, said he had found the subscribers "a passionate and well-informed audience -- and beautifully behaved."
In addition to the Town Hall series, Peoples' Symphony has two six-concert series at Washington Irving, which has general admission seating, and subscriptions cost $ 50 (or $ 8.33 a concert). Mr. Salomon said many subscribers arrive early to make sure they can get the best seats, or sit with large groups of friends or relatives. The slightly more expensive Town Hall series has assigned seats. To attract younger listeners, subscribers to any series can now bring up to two children for free, and $ 25 student passes allow access to all 18 concerts, which would let completists hear them for just $ 1.39 apiece.
And all those prices include processing fees.
The city's big presenters -- which increasingly rely on philanthropy, not ticket prices, to meet their expenses -- are aware of the dangers of making tickets too costly, and offer a variety of alternatives for bargain hunters.
The Met, whose average ticket price is $ 141, offers $ 25 rush tickets for every performance; standing room tickets that start at $ 25; and discounts for students and those under 40. The Philharmonic, whose average ticket price is $ 70, offers $ 18 student and senior rush tickets to select concerts; free tickets to some Friday evening concerts for people between 13 and 26; and will give a special $ 5 Phil the Hall concert in April.
Carnegie, whose average ticket price was $ 78 last season, offers free concerts around the city and free family days; $ 10 rush tickets; $ 20 tickets to people 40 and under who join its Notables program; and limited $ 10 student tickets. And Lincoln Center, whose average ticket price for the Mostly Mozart Festival was $ 70.33 this summer and is lower at its White Light Festival and Great Performers series, offers free events as part of each series.
But there are no expensive seats at Peoples' Symphony Concerts, giving it a decidedly egalitarian cast.
Mr. Salomon noted that this will be his 48th season managing the organization, and that his predecessor, Joseph Mann, managed it for 59 years. "Together we've run it for 106 of its 120 years," he said. "This is probably a Guinness World Record."

This Crystal Ball Was at Times Clear But Had Its Cracks

Texto completo: A Times reporter says it is time to hold him accountable for his errant N.B.A. takes. Carmelo Anthony for Sixth Man of the Year?
I am known around the office for bad takes. Or, rather, my co-workers claim that I have bad takes. Maybe it's the Dave Matthews Band fan in me. Maybe it's my affection for "Everybody Loves Raymond." Or maybe it's because I believe that the retired power forward Antoine Walker would easily be a top-10 player today.
It's time to hold me accountable for my takes, particularly my basketball ones. And I've had some doozies in the past few years. One year, I predicted that Anthony Davis would have more 40-point games than Russell Westbrook would have triple-doubles. Westbrook would go on to average a triple-double. Another year, I thought Sebastian Telfair was the best point guard on the Boston Celtics. That year was 2006. Rajon Rondo was also on the team.
Some of those predictions made it into The New York Times last year. In an effort to keep me honest, on the doorstep of a new season, I thought I would take a gander at what I said would happen last year.
Most Valuable Player
Prediction: Anthony Davis (New Orleans Pelicans)
Actual: Giannis Antetokounmpo (Milwaukee Bucks)
Mea Culpa: Not totally indefensible but a weird pick in hindsight. Trade speculation was already swirling around Davis before the season, and he wasn't doing much to tamp it down. The Pelicans had a decent roster, with the underrated Jrue Holiday helping anchor the offense. But this was never a top-tier team, and M.V.P.'s typically come from top-tier teams. Davis did have an M.V.P. year, though, putting up 26 points a game along with career highs in rebounds and assists.
Rookie of the Year
Prediction: Luka Doncic (Dallas Mavericks)
Actual: Luka Doncic (Dallas Mavericks)
Mea Culpa: None necessary. Because I am a smart basketball mind.
Coach of the Year
Prediction: Mike Budenholzer (Milwaukee Bucks)
Actual: Mike Budenholzer (Milwaukee Bucks)
Mea Culpa: None necessary, but I'll take this opportunity to say that this award is silly and shouldn't exist. Coaching is extremely difficult to quantify, and there's a reason several people who have won the award have been fired soon after collecting it.
Most Improved Player
Prediction: D'Angelo Russell (Nets)
Actual: Pascal Siakam (Toronto Raptors)
Mea Culpa: Not a bad pick on my end, and a risky one at the time. But Russell went on to average career highs in points, assists and efficiency. He unexpectedly led the Nets to the playoffs, while also doing society a favor and making the Los Angeles Lakers look bad. (Remember when Magic Johnson said Russell wasn't a leader, then traded him?) There were several nights when Russell single-handedly electrified the crowd with a buffet of pull-up 3-pointers. He didn't win the award, but I'll count this as a check in my column.
Let's take a look at the next category.
Oh no.
Sixth Man of the Year
Oh no. No, no, no, no, no. Don't do this.
Prediction: Carmelo Anthony (Houston Rockets)
Actual: Not Carmelo Anthony
Mea Culpa: I genuinely thought a steady flow of midrange jumpers coming off a jab step would help the Rockets replace Trevor Ariza. In my defense, I still believe that Anthony would have, on balance, helped over the course of the whole season if he had been allowed to stay.
Executive of the Year
Prediction: Rob Pelinka (Los Angeles Lakers)
Actual: Jon Horst (Milwaukee Bucks)
Mea Culpa: A mixed bag here, and you have to wonder how much can be blamed on Magic Johnson, but at the end of the day, the Lakers signed LeBron James and other teams did not. Then they surrounded him with castoff veterans like Rondo, Lance Stephenson and Michael Beasley. And let's not forget the botched trade deadline shenanigans with Davis. So, let's chalk this up to another bad pick by me.
Best Record in the League
Prediction: Golden State Warriors
Actual: Milwaukee Bucks
Mea Culpa: This wasn't a controversial pick, and most people went with the Celtics. (Yikes to those of you that did that; I'm looking at you, co-workers.) The Warriors were probably the most talented team in N.B.A. history, but injuries and complacency brought them to only third in the league.
Worst Record in the League
Prediction: Sacramento Kings
Actual: New York Knicks
Mea Culpa: I didn't see the De'Aaron Fox explosion coming, but I should have. And more important, I didn't subscribe to a tried-and-true rule that, I believe, was first codified by Aristotle: "When predicting a team to be bad, always go with the Knicks."
Breakout Star
Prediction: Jamal Murray (Denver Nuggets)
Mea Culpa: Murray didn't quite make the leap I thought he could, but he did average a career high in points (barely). He has the talent to be a bona fide All-Star -- but not with a 54 percent true shooting percentage. I should've gone with Siakam.
Wild Personal Prediction
My Prediction:
"Lakers and Spurs won't make the playoffs. It's not even a wild prediction. It's a brutal conference, and LeBron will have to do more work than he did with last year's Cleveland team. At some point, that has to catch up with you. This will be the year. As for the Spurs, the run had to end sometime. The top-shelf talent isn't there, and injuries aren't helping out of the gate."
Mea Culpa: Hey now! The Lakers did miss the playoffs, but they were an upper-echelon team while James was healthy. I'll take the win on this. And the San Antonio Spurs made the playoffs, so I was wrong about that. Aristotle also said, "Never bet against Pop."

Quiet Ending For Inquiry Into Emails And Server

Texto completo: The report appears to bookend a controversy that dogged Ms. Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign.
WASHINGTON -- A yearslong State Department investigation into former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's private email server found that while the use of the system for official business increased the risk of compromising classified information, there was no systemic or deliberate mishandling of classified information.
The inquiry, started more than three years ago, found that 38 current or former State Department officials were "culpable" of violating security procedures in a review of about 33,000 individual emails sent to or from the server that Ms. Clinton turned over to investigators.
The nine-page unclassified report, completed last month and shared with Congress this week, appears to bookend a controversy that dogged Ms. Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign against Donald J. Trump. Ms. Clinton blamed the F.B.I.'s handling of the inquiry for crippling her campaign after James B. Comey, then the bureau's director, reopened his investigation into the server days before the general election after initially declining to bring charges.
"While there were some instances of classified information being inappropriately introduced into an unclassified system in furtherance of expedience," the report said, "by and large, the individuals interviewed were aware of security policies and did their best to implement them in their operations."
The report concluded, "There was no persuasive evidence of systemic, deliberate mishandling of classified information."
A representative for Ms. Clinton declined on Friday to comment on the report.
State Department investigators reviewed thousands of pages of documents, sent from 2009 to 2013, when Ms. Clinton served in the Obama administration. The emails were on subjects that were not considered classified at the time, but that have been or were retroactively marked as classified. Investigators also took statements from hundreds of past and present department officials, and interviewed dozens more, according to the report.
The focus of the investigation, according to the report, was to determine if any of the emails "represented a failure to properly safeguard classified information," and if so, if any specific individuals could be determined to bear responsibility.
It is unclear whether any of the 38 officials the report found culpable of violating security procedures still work at the State Department. The office overseeing diplomatic security would make a note in the file of employees or former employees found to have violated those procedures, and those who have left government could have a harder time receiving security clearances if they apply for a government job again.
The use of a private email system "did not necessarily" increase the likelihood of classified information being transmitted on unclassified systems, investigators concluded, but it did add "an increased degree of risk of compromise."
The report was released this week by Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, who began investigating Ms. Clinton's use of a private email server in 2017, when he served as the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Not included in the review were emails deleted by Ms. Clinton after her lawyers advised that they were private and not related to official business.
House Republicans discovered the use of the private server, which Ms. Clinton said she used out of convenience, as part of an investigation into the deaths of Americans in Benghazi, Libya. It prompted Congress, the F.B.I. and the State Department to initiate separate investigations.
Some Republicans, led by Mr. Trump, have continued to use the issue to attack Ms. Clinton and Democrats, even though the F.B.I. closed a previous investigation without bringing charges against Ms. Clinton, Critics have accused State Department officials who took up the investigation of political bias.
Mr. Trump's own administration officials -- including his daughter Ivanka Trump and son-in-law Jared Kushner -- have admitted to using private messaging services to conduct official work. House Democrats' impeachment inquiry has revealed that Trump administration diplomats used private phones to message each other about their efforts to pressure Ukrainian officials to investigate the president's American political rivals, including the Bidens.

Texto completo: Los Angeles vs. Los Angeles, Part One … of many.
Yes, it’s finally on. Ever since the Clippers moved here in 1984, people have pushed the notion of an intracity rivalry, but between owner Donald Sterling’s farcical bumbling and the Lakers’ majesty, there never was one.
Now there is. You could argue there has been one for years with the Clippers going 23-5 against the Lakers the past seven seasons, but it’s not about winning games in the regular season. It’s about which team(s) can go deep into the playoffs, the only thing that counts here … and it could wind up being “both of them.”
In any case, I expect to write about 20 or so Lakers-Clippers updates.
I know, why so few?
Hey, the season is only 25 weeks long or I would do more.
It’s not just the local teams, fans and press girding for excitement.
Until recent years, New York was the capital of NBA writers, with access to league officials leading to scoops for media heavyweights, starting with the New York Post’s Pete Vecsey, who invented the breezy notion of NBA columns with his slashing, news-hound style.
Vecsey retired to be replaced by … no one. Instead of capitalizing on the opportunity, the Post’s struggling rival, the New York Daily News, laid off NBA columnist Mitch Lawrence, as well as star Knicks beat writer Frank Isola, who tripped adroitly into an on-air role at ESPN.
Now with the Knicks as squalid as the Sterling-era Clippers, East Coast media outlets are sending flights of NBA correspondents west.
The Ringer’s Bryan Curtis notes a line of newly minted, L.A.-based NBA writers. The New York Times and Washington Post each have one, as do NBA.com and Fox.com. The Athletic has six writers and podcasters based here. ESPN has a veritable bureau focused on the NBA with Rachel Nichols, Ramona Shelburne, Dave McMenamin, Baxter Holmes, Kevin Arnovitz and Ohm Youngmisuk.
Los Angeles, the Wall Street Journal’s Jason Gay told Curtis, has become “Hemingway’s Paris of NBA media dorks.”
As for wrinkles, the dorks will have plenty to keep themselves occupied.
The Lakers want to go back to being the Lakers of Old … which they haven’t been in this decade, missing the playoffs the past six seasons while averaging 55 losses.
Their immediate challenge is securing Anthony Davis, who refused to commit himself beyond this season upon arrival. (“I have one year here, so I’m going make the best of this year. And when that time comes around in the summer or, you know, whenever the season’s over – hopefully, around, you know, mid-June, after we just had a parade and I need a couple days to think – then we can talk about that.”)
At 26 to Kawhi Leonard’s 28 and Paul George’s 29, Davis was the prize of the summer – or would have been with any assurance of keeping him – representing a bridge to a future that would enable the Lakers to recruit more stars to join him, as LeBron James recruited A.D. to join him.
So, Lakers fans wouldn’t want to see anything go too wrong this season.
You know, the way things went despite the arrival of James last season.
The Clippers conquered respectability, averaging 52 wins over the past seven seasons. Their challenge is legitimacy in a market in which the Lakers long ago raised the standard to championship-or-bust.
Now the Clippers directory starts with owner Steve Ballmer, GM Lawrence Frank and consultant Jerry West, heading a staff of young officials whom other teams keep trying to steal.
Their Blake Griffin-Chris Paul-DeAndre Jordan trio that unraveled two seasons ago was a star-studded show, just not good enough to reach the Western Conference finals.
It remains to be seen how far the less glamorous, more efficient Kawhi-PG-Lou Williams-Montrezl Harrell nucleus gets, but they look like legitimate contenders (and NBA GMs appear to agree).
It also remains to be seen if the Clippers can peel off Lakers fans.
It never has happened, but there has never been an opportunity like this.
Harry Bluebond, a die-hard Lakers fan, notes he will have more interest in the Clippers with “so many pieces in place and with a great infrastructure from Ballmer to Frank to (Coach) Doc (Rivers) to Kahwi, George, Lou, Montrezl.”
On the other hand, Bluebond has seen Lakers owner Jeanie Buss “passing on Jerry West when I knew he wanted back in with the Lakers as a consultant,” to Magic Johnson quitting, to LeBron’s denouncing Daryl Morey’s use of freedom of speech regarding the Hong Kong protestors, noting, “It will take a little time to settle back with the Lakers.”
Now to see if this will again be their town. It’s a tale of one city, but whose?

Why the Protests in Hong Kong May Persist Indefinitely

Texto completo: HONG KONG -- Resolving the increasingly violent protests in Hong Kong will most likely fall to an influential group of Beijing's local allies.
The trouble: They don't agree on much.
The fissures raise the likelihood that unrest in Hong Kong could fester for months or even years. That could further hurt the city's economy, create a constant headache for Beijing and aggravate an already sore point between the United States and China.
Some of Beijing's local allies are populists who want to break up local monopolies, seize private land and build public housing. Some are tycoons who are happy to support the local government and Beijing as long as no one touches their businesses.
The differences within the pro-Beijing camp are even deeper on the protesters' biggest demand, for greater democracy.
A moderate camp led by the city's embattled chief executive, Carrie Lam, would like to see gradual progress toward freer elections, at least within Beijing's predefined limits. The city's hard-liners loathe the idea, and are deeply frustrated by what they perceive as Mrs. Lam's desire to negotiate with democracy advocates and her wariness of ordering a harsher police crackdown.
The divisions were visible on Wednesday when Mrs. Lam gave her annual policy address, Hong Kong's equivalent of the State of the Union speech in the United States. After months of internal meetings, she delivered a fairly narrow set of initiatives on issues like housing and did not even try to address broad political tensions.
Mrs. Lam said at a news conference afterward that avoiding the question of democracy in her annual address was "not a responsible act." But she said she couldn't tackle the subject, criticizing opposition lawmakers for having blocked the last election proposal from Beijing in 2014.
For the pro-Beijing camp, the disagreements add to the growing weakness among the various political parties. The pro-Beijing coalition has slumped to record-low support in independent opinion surveys in recent weeks, and such parties face the potential for heavy losses in neighborhood district elections in November and again in legislative elections next September.
Politicians in the pro-Beijing coalition in Hong Kong are "like birds in a forest -- when things are good, they stay together, but when things are bad, they fly in all directions," said Jasper Tsang Yok-sing, the main founder of the biggest pro-Beijing political party in Hong Kong, who was the president of the legislature until 2016.
"Our biggest worry now is Nov. 24; we are thinking how we can minimize our loss," he added.
Mrs. Lam has tried repeatedly, if ineffectively, to reach what she sees as compromises with the pro-democracy opposition, most notably by first suspending and then agreeing to withdraw the extradition bill that sparked the protests. She has tried to set up public and private dialogues with her opponents, only to have an unflattering audio recording leak from one event and democracy advocates picket at another.
To the pro-democracy side, she is a figurehead for a government increasingly beholden to Beijing. She had to release her policy address on Wednesday as a video after pro-democracy lawmakers shouted her down in the legislative chamber.
Any effort by Mrs. Lam to begin a dialogue with democracy activists, though, has just intensified criticism among Beijing's most outspoken allies.
"The Carrie Lam government is still trying to curry favor with the opposition, thinking that she has the support of the pro-Beijing people," said Lau Siu-kai, who was a top Hong Kong official until 2012 and is now one of Beijing's top advisers on Hong Kong policy. Beijing sees the opposition "as hard-line opponents and as a die-hard, anti-communist element willing to collude with foreign forces, above all the United States."
About all that Beijing's allies agree on these days is their strong support for the Hong Kong police.
"The government ought to have gotten tougher, taking firmer action sooner," said Regina Ip, a member of Mrs. Lam's cabinet and a lawmaker who leads a pro-Beijing political party that supports strict adherence to law and order.
Yet such an approach could trigger further protests. Demonstrators have already complained of police brutality, calling for an amnesty for those accused of rioting and for the creation of a commission of inquiry into the actions of the police force.
The chance of compromise on the issue of democracy seems remote -- from all sides.
Moderates in the pro-Beijing camp want to revive a plan offered by the Chinese government to protesters in 2014 and rejected as inadequate. Mrs. Lam reminisced about the plan on Wednesday. But hard-liners say that recent turbulence in the streets of Hong Kong shows that further steps toward democracy are too risky, and oppose making the plan available again.
The proposal would have allowed all Hong Kong adults to vote. But the names on the ballot would have been selected by a 1,200-member committee. The same committee currently chooses chief executives without putting them to a general vote of the population.
The members of the committee are selected mainly by sectors of the Hong Kong public that have traditionally aligned with Beijing. These include neighborhood district councilors, accountants and real estate lawyers.
The paradox of Hong Kong politics today is that the committee might not be so reliably under Beijing's control. Cornerstones of mainland influence in Hong Kong are eroding.
Many solicitors -- lawyers who mainly handle real estate transactions -- and accountants have unexpectedly emerged as critics of the Hong Kong government and Beijing over the extradition issue. The largest bloc of committee members is chosen by Hong Kong's district councils, which makes pro-Beijing parties even more nervous about losing council seats in next month's elections.
Democracy activists have been cautious about their chances of gaining seats in the coming elections, since the city government has the legal power to disqualify candidates who have advocated independence.
There have also been worries about violent attacks on candidates and voters, and possibly even the postponement of the elections. Jimmy Sham, the leader of the main pro-democracy protest group, the Civil Human Rights Front, was hospitalized on Wednesday after men beat him with hammers.
Regardless of the outcome of the elections, democracy advocates say they cannot endorse the democracy plan now, having rejected it in 2014. "No one ever dares to say 'think about it' or 'accept it' -- anyone who does so will be severely attacked," said Joseph Cheng, who led a broad coalition of pro-democracy groups in 2014. "We come to a consensus, we stick to that position and we cannot shift."
The main wild card in all of this is Beijing. The pro-Beijing parties have a history of quashing disagreements and coming together when the Chinese government issues instructions.
Some pro-Beijing politicians in Hong Kong argued bitterly in 2005 that the next chief executive should not be Donald Tsang, a longtime civil servant who had been knighted by Prince Charles for his service to Britain. But when Beijing ordered support for Mr. Tsang, he was quickly endorsed even by vehement critics like Ma Lik, the chairman then of the biggest pro-Beijing party.
"He won the trust of Beijing, and we support whoever Beijing trusts," Mr. Ma said in a telephone interview at the time. "That's why we are called pro-Beijing."

Facebook co-founder and critic launches $10 million 'anti-monopoly' fund

Texto completo: For months, Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes has warned about the dangers of corporate consolidation, even advocating for a breakup of the social media giant where he started his career.
Now Hughes and his allies are putting money behind their calls for action, hoping to harness the heightened interest around big tech into a broader movement to analyze, regulate or dismantle behemoths in agriculture, health care, finance and other industries where he says a lack of competition is hurting consumers.
Hughes and the organization he co-chairs, the Economic Security Project, announced the launch Thursday of a $10 million "anti-monopoly fund." Backed by high-profile philanthropies including the George Soros-financed Open Society Foundations and the Omidyar Network, created by the founder of eBay, the effort aims to shine a spotlight on competition and "move the issue from the margins to the mainstream," Hughes said in an interview.
"You don't need a degree in economics to know corporations and the wealthy have had a heavy hand in setting a lot of economic [policy] over the past several decades," he added.
The fund, which will invest in projects until March 2021, aims to provide financial support to a wide array of organizations. That includes academic researchers studying mergers and market power, policy advocates pursuing new rules to rein in tech and other industries, and grass-roots groups that have battled bigness on the ground. The investments could serve as an early counterweight to the millions of dollars that Facebook, Google and other big businesses spend annually to finance research in their favor and stave off regulation.
"Americans understand corporate power has gotten out of control," Hughes said, "and a lot of [groups] are interested in organizing to push back against them."
The launch of the anti-monopoly fund reflects an evolution in Hughes's personal engagement on antitrust roughly five months after he issued his first public call to break up and regulate Facebook. In an essay for the New York Times, Hughes said Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg's influence exceeded "anyone else in the private sector or government," granting him the power to gobble up rivals, crowd out investment and stifle innovation, threatening consumers and democracy itself.
Such concerns have resonated with U.S. regulators, who have embarked on a slew of antitrust investigations targeting big tech in recent months.
Hughes has played an early role in those investigations, working with well-known competition experts and former government officials to make the case to regulators that Facebook, in particular, needs to be broken up.
In practice, the new $10 million fund could invest in organizations that craft or advance privacy legislation, Hughes said, or activist groups akin to those that fought against Amazon as it sought to expand its headquarters in New York City. He did not name the initial set of funding recipients. (Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)
But he said the new research, advocacy and grass-roots investments will go beyond tech - to focus on other areas where corporate giants have wielded their dominance in damaging ways.
"There was a sense concentration in the economy has gotten completely out of control, and we need to do something about it," he said. "It felt like the right next step would be creating a fund that would be catalytic, and time bound, to invest in a cross section of groups - to include groups fighting tech but also in the agriculture and pharmaceutical spaces."
"The increased awareness and interest in this issue [among] the American people, as well as American lawmakers, has been 20 years of growth in two years," said Tom Perriello, executive director for domestic programs at the Open Society Foundation, which has committed funding. "We need to meet that moment, meet that demand from Americans that are very concerned about this."
In addition to Open Society and the Omidyar Network, initial donors include the Ford Foundation, the Nathan Cummings Foundation, and the Knight Foundation. Some, like Soros, have funded some of tech's most potent antagonists in the past.

Gordon Sondland claims he was unaware of Rudy Giuliani’s widely publicized Ukraine-Biden efforts

Texto completo: U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland testified Thursday he was unaware of Rudy Giuliani’s efforts to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Joe and Hunter Biden.
But Giuliani's public advocacy of a Ukrainian investigation into the Bidens had been widely reported before May 23, the date of a White House meeting with Sondland, Energy Secretary Rick Perry, and former U.S. special envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker where President Trump directed the officials to work with Giuliani, his personal attorney.
In the opening statement for his closed-door congressional testimony, text of which was released ahead of his appearance Thursday, Sondland said he was “disappointed by the president’s direction that we involve Mr. Giuliani” at that meeting but went along with it to accomplish “strengthening U.S.-Ukrainian ties.”
“But I did not understand, until much later, that Mr. Giuliani’s agenda might have also included an effort to prompt the Ukrainians to investigate Vice President Biden or his son or to involve Ukrainians, directly or indirectly, in the president’s 2020 reelection campaign,” Sondland testified.
Giuliani publicly advocated for Ukraine to investigate allegations of corruption related to the Bidens for months, including in May, both on Twitter and in numerous television appearances and news articles, with a focus on Hunter Biden’s $50,000-per-month position on the board of Burisma Holdings, a Ukrainian energy company. Conservative outlets published stories on the Bidens and Burisma as early as April, and Giuliani’s proposed trip became national news in early May, with the New York Times reporting Giuliani was pushing the Ukrainian government to investigate Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and the Bidens and Burisma.
At the time, Giuliani said, “We’re not meddling in an election, we’re meddling in an investigation.” Dozens of articles and television segments made it clear Giuliani was part of an effort to push Ukraine to investigate the Bidens.
Tweet Tweet
Giuliani's public calls for Ukraine to investigate the Bidens continued throughout the summer and the fall.
Sondland also testified that while Giuliani did mention Burisma, he only knew it was "one of many examples of Ukrainian companies run by oligarchs.”
“I did not know until more recent press reports that Hunter Biden was on the board of Burisma,” Sondland said, adding he did not take part in any effort to encourage an investigation into the Bidens.
But Giuliani previously told the Washington Examiner “it was certainly understood” that Giuliani wanted Burisma to be investigated in connection with Hunter Biden’s position with Burisma and because of Joe Biden’s actions in Ukraine threatening to withhold $1 billion in loans while pushing for then-Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko to fire Ukrainian prosecutor Viktor Shokin. Shokin was widely seen by the United States, Europe, and the International Monetary Fund — and inside Ukraine — as a hindrance to fighting corruption, and Ukraine’s Parliament removed him in 2016.

Text messages provided by Volker, who made similarly unlikely claims of ignorance about Giuliani's actions, include an August discussion where Sondland makes it clear the U.S. was pushing Zelensky to make a statement promising to investigate issues related to 2016 and to claims of Biden corruption.
In his testimony, Sondland distanced himself from the controversial July phone call between Trump and Zelensky in which Trump asked for a "favor" from Ukraine, urged Zelensky to look into a CrowdStrike conspiracy theory and any Ukrainian involvement in the 2016 election, and suggested the Ukrainians investigate allegations of corruption related to the Bidens. Sondland said he didn’t see the transcript of the call until its public release in September.

Recibe una sentencia de 15 años tras declararse culpable de posesión de cocaína…era leche en polvo

Texto completo: Un hombre sin hogar atravesaba un vecindario industrial en el centro de Oklahoma City el 12 de agosto cuando la policía lo vio. Pasaba de las 10 p.m. y los oficiales observaron que el desaliñado hombre sin camisa y una mochila al hombro no tenía luces traseras en su bicicleta.
Cuando intentaron detenerlo, Cody Gregg aceleró más para luego tirar la bicicleta unas cuadras adelante e intentar huir a pie. Los policías lo alcanzaron e inspeccionaron su mochila. Dentro encontraron un sospechoso polvo blanco en una lata de café, según documentos judiciales consultados por el diario The Oklahoman.
“Dentro del bolso había una gran cantidad de substancia blanca en polvo que basado en mi experiencia y mi entrenamiento creí que se trataba de cocaína”, dijo el oficial que hizo la revisión, según el diario citado. “Más tarde, el polvo blanco dentro del bolso dio resultado positivo para cocaína y era un paquete que pesaba en total 45.91 gramos de cocaína”, añadió.
Gregg fue acusado de posesión de cocaína con intención de distribución y fue enviado a la cárcel del condado de Oklahoma mientras aguardaba su juicio. Él se declaró inocente. Pero la semana pasada, tras dos meses, su arresto fue en agosto, se cansó de esperar y se declaró culpable. Fue sentenciado a 15 años en prisión.
La cárcel del condado de Oklahoma ha estado plagada de problemas durante años, como goteras, moho, sobrepoblación y una tasa de suicidios y muertes mayor a la del promedio nacional, según The Oklahoman.
El jueves pasado, sólo dos días después de recibir su prolongada sentencia, resultados de laboratorio demostraron que el polvo blanco no era cocaína, sino leche en polvo. Gregg le dijo al juez que había conseguido la leche de un dispensario de alimentos, según el diario citado.
Al día siguiente, Gregg solicitó a la corte que le permitieran retirar su declaración de culpabilidad, a la luz de la nueva evidencia. El juez de distrito Timothy R. Henderson concedió su petición y además desechó los cargos en su contra.
Gregg estaba bajo libertad condicional al momento de su arresto. Según documentos de la corte consultados por el diario The Washington Post, había sido arrestado por cargos relacionados con narcóticos al menos unas tres veces desde 2014.
El viernes salió en libertad.
El Washington Post reporta que no es la primera vez que un resultado de laboratorio equivocado termina en la convicción de una persona inocente. Las pruebas químicas que utilizan las policías alrededor de todo el país para determinar si una substancia es ilícita fallan frecuentemente.
En 2016, una investigación del diario The New York Times y la organización de periodistas sin fines de lucro ProPublica, revelaron que hay miles de personas en la cárcel por pruebas que tienen un amplio margen de error.
Una lista de los artículos que han dado un falso positivo a cocaína, recogida por el Washington Post, incluyó cosas como galletas de chocolate, el glaseado de una dona Krispy Cream y tabletas de menta. Algunos estudios citados por este diario indican que un quinto o hasta un tercio de las pruebas están erradas. Sin embargo, las policías las siguen utilizando como una herramienta cotidiana.
La historia de Gregg ilustra otro problema: muchas personas prefieren declararse culpables para no tener que esperar meses o incluso años para tener un juicio. Más de la mitad de las personas acusadas de delitos de drogas con base en una prueba de laboratorio errada se declararon culpables a la primera oportunidad, según el estudio del New York Times y ProPublica.

Warren draws scrutiny for Medicare for All, but her opponents are no wiser on healthcare

Texto completo: Whenever anyone, especially a politician, starts a sentence with, “Let’s be clear,” you know they’re on the defensive.
Moderators knew it at Tuesday night’s CNN Democratic presidential debate, when they repeatedly pressed Elizabeth Warren to answer a yes or no question regarding her support for Medicare for All. They simply asked the Massachusetts senator whether her proposed big government takeover of the healthcare industry would raise taxes on the middle class. Naturally, Warren failed to answer the basic question.
Warren may have been the one on the defensive in this week's debate, but her opponents’ proposals for taking control of the American healthcare system are no better.
At least Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders was honest — he knows that Medicare for All will result in higher taxes for the middle class, and is willing to admit it. But in Sanders’ Marxist view, he would rather see everyone grow equally as poor than allow anyone to achieve prosperity in the free market. That’s the truth when it comes to socialism, and it was openly apparent during the most recent Democratic presidential debate in Ohio.
South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg was not much better than Warren when he floated the idea of providing a public option to deliver healthcare coverage. Any public option would undercut the private sector, which is capable of providing better healthcare than any bureaucrat ever could, and instead put costs back on the taxpayer.
And who would foot the bill under Buttigieg’s plan? The very same people Warren doesn’t want to admit would pay for her plan — the middle class.
Meanwhile, presidential contender Joe Biden did himself no favors when he tried to take credit for the “public option” plan, what Democrats call “Medicare for All who want it,” that everyone on stage was talking about. Is Uncle Joe for real? Based on the Affordable Care Act’s abysmal track record, I’m not sure why Biden would want to rhetorically tie his plan to an even worse proposal, “Medicare for All who want it.”
All the candidates are playing with fire: Americans don’t want to see their private plans taken away, the eventual end result of Medicare for All. Nor do they want to see their neighborhood hospital close because it can’t compete with the absurd mandates and regulations that come with socialized healthcare.
Still, Americans are generous, caring people, so of course we want everyone to have healthcare. Unfortunately, most of the Democratic candidates were all too happy to endorse variants of a plan that would limit healthcare access and decrease the level of care for almost everyone.
The candidates’ reference to widespread support for their healthcare plans was a perverse caricature of the caring nature of Americans. They know their plans would be worse for everyone, but they instead cloak their big government takeover under the guise of “healthcare for all.”

Texto completo: President Trump responded to the fourth Democratic presidential primary debate by saying all the candidates looked weak and claiming that is why they are pursuing impeachment.
"You would think there is NO WAY that any of the Democrat Candidates that we witnessed last night could possibly become President of the United States," Trump said Wednesday on Twitter. "Now you see why they have no choice but to push a totally illegal & absurd Impeachment of one of the most successful Presidents!"
Tweet
The president followed up with another tweet urging impeachment for Rep. Adam Schiff and Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi.

The fourth Democratic debate took place on Tuesday night with 12 candidates taking the stage. The first question of the event, sponsored by CNN and the New York Times, was on impeachment, which every Democratic candidate who answered the question said they supported.
Trump wrote that the election of any one of the Democrats would spark another depression.
Tweet
Pelosi announced last month she was backing an impeachment inquiry into Trump after it was revealed he made a call with Ukraine's president where he asked them to investigate Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden.
Biden, 76, addressed a question about his son's business dealings in Ukraine during the debate. The former vice president said he was "proud of the judgment" of his son.
Hunter Biden was on the board of a Ukrainian gas company while his father was vice president, and Trump has used the issue to level charges of corruption against the Bidens. Hunter Biden did an interview Tuesday before the debate saying he would not have been on corporate boards unless his name was Biden and that it was "poor judgment" to be on the board of the Ukrainian gas company.

Texto completo: Fourteen minutes and 50 seconds — by my count, that’s about how long the Democratic presidential candidates have spent talking about K-12 education over the last four debates.
Fourteen minutes and 50 seconds out of more than 12 hours of debates is not enough time to spend on a subject that affects 55 million students. Although our education system largely relies on decisions made at the state and local level, the president sets the tone and agenda for their party and wields significant influence over state leaders. With so many public schools that cannot keep up with our children’s needs, education reform deserves more time and attention on the national stage.
During the debates, most of the candidates’ ideas have centered on money: higher teachers’ salaries, more money for low-income schools, free college, and canceling student loan debts. But the kids they are trying to help won’t make it through high school if they are struggling to read and write in middle school.
Every student, no matter their race, ethnicity, or income level, should have access to a good education. But this isn’t only a money issue. The current debates are missing transformative ideas needed to help children learn. Where do candidates stand on universal vouchers, not tying school funding to property taxes, or reducing barriers to school choice and access to education?
School choice and innovation has made a dramatic impact on the lives of the children I work with: the low-income, minority students that many of the candidates claim their policies will help. It’s frustrating to hear one of the leading Democratic presidential candidates, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, say, “Money for public schools should stay in public schools, not go anywhere else.”
I disagree.
But it is even more frustrating to watch Sen. Cory Booker, who has previously been a staunch supporter of school choice and vouchers as the mayor of Newark and was a board member of the Alliance for School Choice, remain silent.
In 2004, I created an all-refugee soccer team outside Atlanta. After one practice, I was helping one of my players, Lewis, a Sudanese refugee, with his homework. He had a headache and asked me to read to him to help him complete a project. This happened again and again. After the third time, I told him I had a headache and asked him to read. He looked up and said, “Coach, I can’t read.”
Lewis had been in this country for five years. He got As and Bs in school, but he couldn’t read. He was in the sixth grade. At first, I tried to work within the broken system to help him. When that didn’t work, I opened my own school for refugee students: Fugees Academy. It’s a zero-tuition private school with campuses in Ohio and Georgia that has helped hundreds of refugee kids change the course of their lives.
Some of our students arrive in this country functionally illiterate. Some arrive traumatized by the experience of fleeing their homes — I experienced this when I fled my native Jordan. Our students always arrive ready and willing to learn, we just needed to find the right way to teach them.
I have found that the best way to teach begins, and continues, outside the classroom. From day one, the center of Fugees Academy has been soccer. It’s a common language for our students, a way to learn teamwork and collaboration, and a way to work through the trauma they have experienced. We are also committed to helping families heal, integrate, and thrive. We do that by assisting with immigration paperwork, job applications, and access to healthcare.
In their first year at Fugees Academy, our students’ proficiency in math rose by 137%, and in reading, it rose 187%. When students feel safe and can focus on homework instead of hunger, great things can happen. Every one of our high school graduates has been accepted by into college.
Our school isn’t necessarily a template for every other, but it works for our students (who come from 22 ethnic groups). With the freedom to innovate and philanthropic support, we created a model to meet the needs of our students by learning from where their public schools failed. We spend less money to educate our students than our counterparts.
The Fugees Academy campus in Columbus, Ohio, is about 14 minutes from Otterbein University, where the Democratic debate was held this week. I invite any presidential candidate who wants to see first-hand the transformative model we use to teach our students and prepare them for success. If my kids were their kids, I think they would agree that traditional public schools don’t work for everyone, and we need bolder solutions, better leadership, and more choice to ensure all of our 55 million children have access to a good education.

Thomas L. Friedman: Loyal civil servants, not Democrats, launched drive to impeach

Texto completo: Last Thursday and Friday, two important Americans bore witness to the state of our nation. One was President Donald Trump, addressing political rallies. The other was Marie Yovanovitch, the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine until suddenly told to get “on the next plane” — because Trump wanted her removed — without explanation.
Every American should contemplate their remarks, which I excerpt later, and then ask two questions: Whose speech would you want to read to your children’s civics class and which speaker do you think represents the America you want to see evolve and leave to your kids?
This exercise is vital because this impeachment process was not set in motion by the Democratic Party. It was set in motion by civil servants — whistleblowers from the intelligence community, now supported by National Security Council staffers and diplomats. These public servants also took an oath to serve the country and protect the Constitution, and they have shown remarkable courage to risk their careers, and maybe more, to call out the president for violating his oath.
They are like antibodies fighting the cancer in our political system. John Bolton spoke for all of them when, while national security adviser, he reportedly instructed Fiona Hill, the NSC Russia expert, to tell White House lawyers that he wanted no part “of whatever drug deal” the president’s cronies were cooking up as part of an off-the-books diplomatic effort being led by Rudy Giuliani to get Ukraine to dig up dirt on Joe Biden.
It is breathtaking that virtually no Republican lawmakers have manifested similar courage — when all they have to lose is $174,000 in salary and free parking at Reagan Washington National Airport.
This point can’t be stressed enough. Because if Trump is removed from office and the country is healed afterward, it will only be because a majority of Americans understand that this is, at its core, a fight between these noncorrupt, apolitical civil servants — whose norms and institutions make America’s government so envied and respected around the world — and Giuliani and Trump and their pals, who care only about serving themselves and their conspiracy theories.
Trump and his enablers at the state-directed Fox News want to portray this as just another partisan fight — between Trump and his Democratic rivals — in the hope that the public will shrug and say, “There they go again.” They don’t want Americans to understand that this fight is about guarding the most cherished norms and institutions that define us as a nation.
We can’t let that happen. In service of that goal, I repeat some of Trump’s and Yovanovitch’s remarks.
Here’s Trump in Louisiana: “The radical Democrats’ policies are crazy. Their politicians are corrupt. Their candidates are terrible. And they know they can’t win on Election Day, so they’re pursuing an illegal, invalid and unconstitutional bull---- impeachment.”
And here’s Trump in Minneapolis about Joe Biden: “He was only a good vice president because he understood how to kiss Barack Obama’s ass.”
And here’s Yovanovitch in her opening statement to the House impeachment investigators: “For the last 33 years, it has been my great honor to serve the American people as a Foreign Service officer, over six administrations — four Republican, and two Democratic. I have served in seven different countries, five of them hardship posts, and was appointed to serve as an ambassador three times — twice by a Republican president and once by a Democrat. Throughout my career, I have stayed true to the oath that Foreign Service officers take and observe every day: ‘that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic,’ and ‘that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same.’”
She added: “My parents fled communist and Nazi regimes. Having seen, firsthand, the war, poverty and displacement common to totalitarian regimes, they valued the freedom and democracy the U.S. represents. And they raised me to cherish these values as well.”
She continued: “From August 2016 until May 2019, I served as the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine. Our policy, fully embraced by Democrats and Republicans alike, was to help Ukraine become a stable and independent democratic state, with a market economy integrated into Europe.”
Then Yovanovitch added: “I have heard the allegation in the media that I supposedly told the embassy team to ignore the president’s orders ‘since he was going to be impeached.’ That allegation is false. I have never said such a thing, to my embassy colleagues or to anyone else. … With respect to Mayor Giuliani, I have had only minimal contacts with him. … I do not know Mr. Giuliani’s motives for attacking me. But individuals who have been named in the press as contacts of Mr. Giuliani may well have believed that their personal financial ambitions were stymied by our anti-corruption policy in Ukraine.”
And then she explained that after being asked in early March “to extend my tour until 2020, I was then abruptly told in late April to come back to Washington from Ukraine ‘on the next plane.’ You will understandably want to ask why my posting ended so suddenly. I wanted to learn that, too, and I tried to find out. I met with the deputy secretary of state, who informed me of the curtailment of my term.
“He said that the president had lost confidence in me and no longer wished me to serve as his ambassador. He added that there had been a concerted campaign against me, and that the department had been under pressure from the president to remove me since the summer of 2018. He also said that I had done nothing wrong and that this was not like other situations where he had recalled ambassadors for cause.”
Alas, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo did nothing to protect her.
Yovanovitch continued: “Although I understand that I served at the pleasure of the president, I was nevertheless incredulous that the U.S. government chose to remove an ambassador based, as best as I can tell, on unfounded and false claims by people with clearly questionable motives.
“I have served this nation honorably for more than 30 years. … Throughout that time, I — like my colleagues at the State Department — have always believed that we enjoyed a sacred trust with our government. … We repeatedly uproot our lives, and we frequently put ourselves in harm’s way to serve this nation. And we do that willingly, because we believe in America and its special role in the world. We also believe that, in return, our government will have our backs and protect us if we come under attack from foreign interests. That basic understanding no longer holds true.”
If this is how our government will now act, great long-term harm will be done to “our nation’s interest, perhaps irreparably,” Yovanovitch concluded. We will lose “many of this nation’s most loyal and talented public servants,” and “bad actors” in countries beyond Ukraine will “see how easy it is to use fiction and innuendo to manipulate our system. In such circumstances, the only interests that will be served are those of our strategic adversaries, like Russia, that spread chaos and attack the institutions and norms that the U.S. helped create and which we have benefited from for the last 75 years.”
In both Minnesota and Louisiana, Trump supporters chanted “USA, USA, USA” at his red-meat lines. Read these two transcripts and then ask yourself, who’s really protecting and honoring “USA, USA, USA”?

La crisis militar desatada por Trump en Siria deja 50 bombas atómicas en manos de Turquía

Texto completo: El presidente turco, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan , se ha negado a frenar su ofensiva militar en el norte de Siria pese a la presión de Estados Unidos y otros miembros de la Alianza Atlántica (NATO, en inglés).
El vicepresidente, Mike Pence, viaja este miércoles a Turquía para reunirse con Erdogan, mientras el presidente, Donald Trump, aseguraba desde la Casa Blanca que la ofensiva militar “no es entre Turquía y Estados Unidos”. Sin embargo, el conflicto se inició a consecuencia de una decisión suya, y esta crisis tiene como rehenes a 50 bombas nucleares estadounidenses.
Un reporte periodístico había indicado que Erdogan no se reuniría en persona con la delegación diplomática encabezada por Pence: “No voy a hablar con ellos. Van a hablar con sus homólogos. Cuando Trump venga, hablaré”.
Sin embargo, fuentes oficiales citadas por la prensa local precisaron horas después que el presidente turco sí recibiría a Pence, que viaja junto al secretario de Estado, Mike Pompeo, para convencerle de que frene su ofensiva militar.
El ataque turco es consecuencia directa de la decisión anunciada el 6 de octubre por Trump de retirar las tropas estadounidenses de Siria, un país en guerra civil desde 2011.
Hasta entonces, Estados Unidos había prestado apoyo aéreo a los kurdos en su batalla contra el dictador Bashar Al-Assad, a su vez ayudado por Rusia. La retirada estadounidense permitió a los turcos atacar a los kurdos, un pueblo sin estado que reclama territorios en Turquía y es considerado como terrorista por este país. Los kurdos se aliaron entonces con Al-Assad, Rusia ocupó el puesto estratégico que antes tenía Estados Unidos, y, en los combates, decenas de presos del Ejército Islámico (ISIS), enemigo de todos, quedaron en libertad.
Tras el rechazo internacional provocado por la decisión de Trump, y con la fuerte presión del Congreso en su contra incluso por parte de los republicanos, el presidente anunció un fuerte castigo económico contra Turquía por su ofensiva militar. Sin embargo, este miércoles ha vuelto a insistir en que la confrontación “no es entre Turquía y Estados Unidos”.
Turquía, miembro de la Alianza Atlántica, tiene en su territorio bases militares estadounidenses con armas atómicas, según ha informado el diario The New York Times.
En concreto, 50 bombas termonucleares, almacenadas en la instalación de las Fuerzas Aéreas en Incirlik, a 100 millas de la frontera con Siria.
Preguntado hoy al respecto, Trump ha expresado hoy su “confianza”, sin aclarar en qué, añadiendo que la base aérea es “poderosa”, y Turquía es miembro de la Alianza Atlántica: “Se supone que tenemos que llevarnos bien con ellos, qué quiere la gente, que les disparemos, sería la primera vez”.
Un oficial estadounidense de alto rango ha dicho al citado diario que Erdogan básicamente tiene las armas como “rehenes” . Sacarlas por vía aérea marcaría el final de la alianza de facto entre Turquía y Estados Unidos, pero dejarlas allí sería perpetuar una vulnerabilidad nuclear que debió desaparecer hace años.
La meta de Pence es convencer a Erdogan de un cese al fuego inmediato, pero también reiterará que las sanciones impuestas este lunes en contra de Turquía se mantendrán hasta que se llegue a un acuerdo para evitar el conflicto en la región, ha informado la cadena NBC News.
Erdogan ha afirmado que nadie podrá detener la ofensiva turca en Siria y que esta solo llegará a su fin una vez su Gobierno establezca una “zona segura” que vaya desde Manbij, en territorio sirio, hasta la frontera con Irak.
“Para la solución más rápida al problema en Siria, le proponemos a todos los terroristas que dejen sus armas y equipos , destruyan las trampas que prepararon y salgan de la zona segura esta noche”, le dijo a los periodistas.
Las declaraciones se dan luego de que el ejército de Al-Assad llegará a zonas del norte del país donde previamente operaba Estados Unidos.
Las tropas sirias habían sido expulsadas del norte del país con la ayuda de los milicianos kurdos, que además habían batallado contra el grupo terrorista ISIS, arrinconado en esa área tras ser derrotado por Estados Unidos en Irak.

Texto completo: "The ache for home lives in all of us, the safe place where we can go as we are and not be questioned." - Maya Angelou
Salinas Valley farmworkers drive the area's multi-billion dollar agriculture industry, yet struggle to find adequate places to live among the fields where they work.
Home isn't just where you sleep and eat. It's a sense of community, where memories are created, relationships solidified, refuge found, and values reinforced.
Beginning this month, independent visual journalist Sebastián Hidalgo has partnered up with Kate Cimini, a reporter at The Salinas Californian. They will examine what 'home' is for thousands of farmworkers and measure the social, cultural and political elements that go into homemaking and "affordable housing." They will also study the current housing landscape and affordable housing plans, and how Salinas got to this point.
This partnership was made possible through collaboration with Catchlight Local, a new visual storytelling initiative in partnership with The GroundTruth Project––an initiative seeking to reseed journalism at the local level, and bring community engagement practices into newsrooms.
Hidalgo is a Mexican-American visual journalist, digital producer, and educator. He comes from a civic-journalism background and was named among "12 Emerging Photographers You Should Know" by The New York Times - Lens.
We and our partners at Catchlight chose him from more than 50 applicants to bring nuanced and empathetic photography to the newsroom as a Catchlight fellow. Data from the News Leaders Association indicates that visual journalists have declined by 52% while overall newsroom staff declined 40% over the last 20 years.
This means it has become harder to visualize community stories in the Salinas Valley. Over the next couple months, he will report, but will also engage with community and host community events to receive feedback from those most impacted by the housing issue.
Cimini is an award-winning journalist who recently received her master's in journalism from the Medill School of Journalism at Northwestern University. Before joining The Californian in October 2018, she worked as an editorial fellow at the Washingtonian and as a national security journalist for Medill Reports.
We'd like to hear from you. What concerns or questions do you have about Salinas' housing landscape, the process of home ownership or potential solutions to the housing crisis? We may be able to address some of them in this project.

Texto completo: The filmmaker's intervention in a mayoral race, part of an effort to block a housing plan, was unheard-of in a country where money and fame are usually wielded lightly.
WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- Peter Jackson, the film director behind the "Lord of the Rings" series, is a towering figure in his native New Zealand, admired as both a down-to-earth titan of the box office and a one-man income generator for the country's moviemaking and tourism industries.
But Mr. Jackson now finds himself at the center of a debate over how he has exerted that influence. This week, he helped catapult to victory a mayoral candidate who shared his opposition to a proposed development project near his studios, an unheard-of local political intervention in a country where money, fame and power are most often wielded lightly.
Mr. Jackson had been embroiled for months in a fight with Justin Lester, the first-term mayor of Wellington, the capital of New Zealand, over plans to build houses on a rugged peninsula in the city's harbor. His opponent, Andy Foster, who had polled only in the single digits in previous mayor's races, beat Mr. Lester by 503 votes on Saturday after receiving Mr. Jackson's political and financial backing.
Local government elections in New Zealand are usually sleepy affairs, with low voter turnout, small budgets and an absence of celebrity glamour. But the result in Mr. Jackson's home city led to accusations that money had tilted the field.
"It's unfortunate in New Zealand that an election can be bought," said Mr. Lester, who spent about $ 13,000 on his campaign, compared with Mr. Foster's $ 35,000 -- $ 27,000 of which came from donations, including Mr. Jackson's. The share of the total linked to Mr. Jackson was believed to be large, though the exact amount was unclear.
Mr. Lester said he had been willing to listen to Mr. Jackson's views on the housing development -- the director's objections had been interpreted by many as an effort to keep high-density housing out of his part of town -- but no more than he would to anyone else's.
"Just because someone has more money or influence doesn't mean they should have a greater say," Mr. Lester said.
Mr. Jackson called the election a victory against shadowy forces pushing the housing plan. In a statement emailed by his company, WingNut Films, he said that he, "along with the thousands of Wellingtonians" who voted Mr. Foster and other candidates into office, "shared their aims of bringing greater transparency and accountability to local government."
Although Mr. Jackson may have broken new political ground in the mayor's race, it was not the first time he has exercised his power with the country's politicians.
In March, The New Zealand Herald reported that Mr. Jackson had called a meeting with Jacinda Ardern, New Zealand's prime minister, after he heard that she was considering cutting government subsidies for the film industry.
Although officials had said that the subsidies did not provide value for the money to taxpayers, Ms. Ardern's center-left government ultimately decided to leave them untouched. The government said the move was not related to Mr. Jackson.
In 2010, he was at the heart of a dispute in which Warner Bros. threatened to move production of his "Hobbit" films away from New Zealand unless the government supported changes to employment laws. The fight pitted Mr. Jackson against the actors' unions, which said the changes would revoke performers' rights.
The center-right government at the time sided with Warner Bros. and Mr. Jackson.
Mr. Jackson, a soft-spoken man with a relaxed appearance -- he is known to go barefoot, like the hobbits of J.R.R. Tolkien's books -- has won three Academy Awards, and his films have grossed more than $ 2 billion. His movies set in New Zealand are credited with luring visitors to see the country's natural beauty for themselves, a boon that tourism officials said was worth tens of millions of dollars a year.
"Peter is a very, very big fish in quite a small tank," a former prime minister, John Key, told The New York Times in 2012.
Mr. Jackson has accumulated particular clout in Wellington, where he has invested in philanthropic projects and hosted world premieres of his films.
A filmmaking empire has sprung up in his wealthy, leafy suburb of Miramar, where the production and special effects companies he founded are based -- and where Mr. Foster's billboards were prominent before the election.
"People do talk about it as a company town," said Bryce Edwards, a veteran political commentator and lecturer at Victoria University in Wellington. "The business has a lot of control over the infrastructure and how the town operates."
Filmmakers, Dr. Edwards added, "have become the strongest lobbyists in New Zealand. They have immense power."
Wellington, like much of New Zealand, is in the grip of a housing shortage, and increasing the supply was a central point of Mr. Lester's agenda.
But Mr. Jackson so strongly opposed the planned housing development that he took to his Facebook page -- which has more than two million fans -- to criticize the project, including on one occasion in a post of nearly 5,000 words.
Workers from Mr. Jackson's companies also attended Mr. Foster's campaign launch. Dr. Edwards said the attention Mr. Jackson had generated for Mr. Foster -- a center-right politician in a liberal city -- "carried a lot more weight" than any donation.
Mr. Foster, like Mr. Jackson, did not respond to requests for an interview. But Mr. Foster told The Herald that he would recuse himself from any council votes on matters in which Mr. Jackson had a financial interest. That did not include the contested housing project, he said.
He said he hoped to reignite discussion on the council about a proposed movie museum and convention center for Wellington -- a project of Mr. Jackson's that was shelved in 2018.
Mr. Lester, the ousted incumbent, said the new mayor would have to deal with Mr. Jackson's expectations.
"Their outcomes might be aligned, but it won't make it easier for him, it'll make it more difficult," he said of his rival. "It's for Andy to determine how he'll handle that."

Warren steps up her fight with Facebook via ad on Facebook

Texto completo: Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren has escalated her tiff with Facebook by running an ad — on Facebook — taking aim at its chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg. It's the latest example of growing resentment of Big Tech by Republicans and Democrats alike.
The list of grievances is long: Companies like Google, Facebook, and Amazon are too big and powerful. They're bad for privacy, public discourse, democracy, and small business. They're spying on us, contributing to economic inequality, and hooking us and our children on addictive, useless services. The companies, of course, object to these characterizations.
Warren, who in March proposed breaking up big tech companies, began running a text ad on Facebook last Thursday to take aim at Zuckerberg.
"Breaking news: Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook just endorsed Donald Trump for re-election," the ad reads. It then goes on to say that while this isn't true, Zuckerberg has "given Donald Trump free rein to lie" on Facebook.
Warren's ad is taking issue with Facebook's policy of not fact-checking politicians' speech or ads, the way it has outside parties fact-check news stories and other posts. Facebook has refused to remove a misleading video ad from President Trump's campaign targeting Democrat Joe Biden.
Facebook responded to Warren's move by tweeting Saturday that the Federal Communications Commission "doesn't want broadcast companies censoring candidates' speech. We agree it's better to let voters — not companies — decide."

Census Bureau seeks state data, citizenship information
The US Census Bureau is asking states for drivers' license records that typically include citizenship data and has made a new request for information on recipients of government assistance, alarming some civil rights advocates.
The two approaches come amid President Trump's efforts to make citizenship a key aspect of federal information-gathering in the runup to the 2020 Census, despite this year's Supreme Court ruling that a specific citizenship question can't be included.
Civil rights advocates worry that the wider net being cast by the Trump administration for such information could chill Latino participation in the population count, which will determine how many congressional seats each state gets and guide the allocation of federal funding. The census results also will be used to redraw state and local electoral maps.
Specialists caution that inaccuracies in state motor vehicle records also make them a poor choice for tracking citizenship, if that is the bureau's goal.
After the Supreme Court ruling, Trump signed an executive order in July requiring the Commerce Department, which oversees the Census Bureau, to collect records on citizenship from federal agencies and increase efforts "to obtain State administrative records concerning citizenship."
The American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators said most, if not all, states recently received requests for information including citizenship status, race, birthdates, and addresses. The association has advised members to consult their privacy officers, and "each state is making their own determination how to respond," spokeswoman Claire Jeffrey said in an e-mail.
Associated Press
Russia pounces on US missteps in Syria
These have been disastrous weeks for American foreign policy, a popular presenter on Russia's state television told viewers on Sunday night.
The United States essentially turned its back on Ukraine amid the impeachment inquiry, TV host Dmitry Kiselyov said in his weekly show. Then, Washington abandoned the Syrian Kurds. “The Kurds themselves again picked the wrong patron," Kiselyov said. “The United States, of course, is an unreliable partner."
As the Middle East reels from President Trump's erratic foreign policy, Russia is savoring a fresh chance to build its status as a resurgent world power and cast itself as a force for stability. The withdrawal of US troops from northeastern Syria, coupled with Turkey's incursion, is allowing Russia to play the part of responsible peacemaker.
It's too soon to tell whether Russia will be able to manage the new volatility in Syria, just as it's not clear if the impeachment furor over Ukraine will help the Kremlin's interests in Eastern Europe. But as Russian President Vladimir Putin landed in Saudi Arabia Monday for a state visit to one of America's most important allies, it appeared clear that Trump's moves in recent months were helping him make the case that Moscow, not Washington, was the more dependable actor on the world stage.
Putin appears to be betting that he can boost Russia's global standing by playing to other countries' individual interests in a world in which the Trump administration's moves have left many traditional US allies in dismay.
“Russia will never be friends with one country against another," Putin said in an interview with two Arab news networks and the Kremlin-controlled channel RT Arabic that aired Sunday. “We build bilateral relations that rely on positive trends generated by our contacts; we do not build alliances against anyone."

Trump says he'll look into case after Fox appearance
President Trump says he'll "be looking into" the case of a US financial adviser charged with killing a hotel worker while on a family vacation in Anguilla after the man's wife appeared on the "Fox & Friends" morning show and urged Trump to intervene.
Trump tweeted shortly after the segment that, "Something looks and sounds very wrong."
He says: "I know Anguilla will want to see this case be properly and justly resolved!"
Scott Hapgood and his family were on vacation when they say a hotel worker showed up at their room unannounced and demanded money before attacking them on April 13.
An autopsy report shows the victim, 27-year-old Kenny Mitchel of Dominica, died of positional asphyxia and received blunt force injuries to his torso and other areas.

‘Based on respect’: Tulsi Gabbard singles out Trey Gowdy as a friend in DC

Texto completo: Rep. Tulsi Gabbard touted her friendship with a high-profile Republican during the final moments of the Democratic presidential debate on Tuesday.
The candidates were asked to discuss a friendship that would surprise the audience. Gabbard, a congresswoman from Hawaii, named former Republican South Carolina Rep. Trey Gowdy.
"I’ve developed friendships that some people may be surprised about within the Washington circles, especially with Republicans — like Trey Gowdy, for example," Gabbard said. "He and I disagree a lot and very strongly on a lot of political issues. We’ve developed a friendship that’s based on respect, and he’s been there for me during some personally challenging times."
Gabbard then tied that openness to make friends across the aisle to defeating President Trump.
"The challenge before us today is that our country is very divided. Donald Trump must be defeated, but we must do more than just defeat Donald Trump. We need to deliver a win for the American people," she said.

Sen. Kamala Harris also named a Republican politician, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, in response to the question.
Gowdy, 55, retired from Congress on Jan. 3 after representing the 4th Congressional District of South Carolina for four terms. During his tenure, Gowdy took leading roles in divisive investigations, including the one on the Benghazi scandal.
After leaving Capitol Hill, Gowdy rejoined his old white-collar law firm, Nelson Mullins Riley & Scarborough and joined Fox News as a contributor where he consistently critiques the Democrats' efforts to impeach Trump.
Jay Sekulow, counsel to the president, announced last week that Gowdy had joined the team to assist with the response to the impeachment inquiry. Fox News even cut ties with Gowdy in anticipation of his new role. But within one day, Trump announced that "lobbying rules" prevented Gowdy from joining the team until January.

Texto completo: Andrew Yang disagreed with almost every other candidate during the Democratic presidential debate Tuesday, saying he didn’t support a wealth tax because countries in Europe have already tried it and it didn't worked.
"A wealth tax makes a lot of sense in principle," Yang said when asked whether he supported a wealth tax like those proposed by Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders. "The problem is that it's been tried in Germany, France, Denmark, Sweden, and all those countries ended up repealing it, because it had massive implementation problems and did not generate the revenue that they'd projected."
"If we can't learn from the failed experiences of other countries, what can we learn from?" he asked. "We should not be looking to other countries' mistakes. Instead, we should look at what Germany, France, Denmark, and Sweden still have, which is a value-added tax."
So far, at least 15 European countries have tried wealth taxes. All but four, though, have repealed them so far.
Instead, the value-added tax Yang supports is a form of sales tax on products and services. He wants to use the revenue from the tax to give every American adult a universal basic income of $1,000 a month, which he calls a “freedom dividend.”
Fellow Democratic presidential candidates Sanders and Warren want to tackle wealth inequality by raising trillions of dollars in revenue from taxing the wealth — in addition to the income — of millionaires and billionaires and use that money to fund their various government social programs.
Sanders' wealth tax plan would raise an estimated $4.35 trillion over 10 years, to pay for programs such as "Medicare for all" and universal child care. It would apply to households with a net worth above $32 million, which is about 180,000 households — the top 0.1% — starting at a 1% tax rate and rising to 8% for married couples with more than $10 billion in wealth.
In contrast, Warren’s plan would raise approximately $2.75 trillion over a decade by levying a 2% wealth tax on assets worth more than $50 million and a 3% tax on fortunes worth more than $1 billion. The tax would hit approximately 75,000 families.
N. Gregory Mankiw, a professor of economics at Harvard University, said that both Warren and Yang had "proposed bold plans for redistributing economic resources" but "only Mr. Yang's is practical" and "is more likely to succeed."
Many economists say that it would be difficult for the government to accurately assess the value of the assets of the rich, given the ability of wealthy families to hire tax lawyers to engage in complicated planning to avoid levies.

Texto completo: Fiona Hill, antigua asesora del gobierno de Donald Trump en Rusia, declaró este lunes que vio “irregularidades” en las relaciones diplomáticas de Estados Unidos con Ucrania . En el marco del proceso de investigación previo a un posible impeachment del presidente, Hill desveló la información a los legisladores demócratas y aseguró que ella se opuso enérgicamente y en varias ocasiones a la expulsión a principios de este 2019 a la embajadora en Ucrania Marie Yovanovitch .
Tal y como adelantó el diario The New York Times, un fuente anónima familiarizada con la investigación de los demócratas dijo que, durante las 10 horas que duró su testimonio, la exasesora afirmó haber notificado en su momento las “irregularidades” que vio . Por su parte, la embajadora Yovanovitch había declarado previamente que Trump presionó al Departamento de Estado para que la despidiera.
El testimonio de Hill forma parte de los intentos de la Cámara de Representantes por descubrir si Trump presionó a funcionarios ucranianos para que investigaran al hijo de su rival político Joe Biden y la supuesta injerencia de este país en las elecciones presidenciales 2016. Para esta semana hay otras cinco entrevistas previstas, la mayoría de ellas con funcionarios del Departamento de Estado. Sin embargo, no está claro quienes se presentarán después de que Trump se negara a cooperar la investigación.
Según la agencia Associated Press, la investigación podría extenderse hasta la semana que viene para tratar de determinar si la retención de la ayuda militar a Ucrania era una manera de presionar a este país para que iniciara las investigaciones contra Hunter Biden.

Texto completo: Yee-haw! The full lineup for the 2020 Stagecoach: California’s Country Music Festival is in.
Headlining the Indio, California, festival, which runs the weekend of April 24, will be Thomas Rhett, Carrie Underwood and Eric Church. Other festival highlights include ​​Lil Nas X and Billy Ray Cyrus, ZZ Top, and Alan Jackson.
Notably, the 2020 lineup features two LGBTQ trailblazers in country music: Lil Nas X and Orville Peck. Earlier this year, Lil Nas X — a gay, black rapper and singer — caused controversy with his single "Old Town Road," which snagged No. 1 spots on both Billboard's Hot Country Songs chart and Hot R&B/Hip-Hop at the same time. Billboard ultimately pulled the hit from the country chart, claiming it didn't embody enough country music elements.
Orville Peck is the stage name of an up-and-coming Canadian country star who wears a mask to hide his identity. He's been vocal in the press about his crossover from punk, and the desire for diversity within country music.
"There has always been people of color making country music, and there has always been queer cowboys and cowgirls, like K. D. Lang,” Peck recently told the New York Times.

Of course, the 2020 Stagecoach lineup also includes long-standing veterans, like two-time Grammy Award-winner Jackson, Neal McCoy and '60s roots rock band ZZ Top.
Unlike last year, the lineup doesn't feel saturated in the "bro country" that dominates today's charts, though it's represented with acts like Chris Lane and Riley Green.
Underwood, who also topped the 2016 bill along with Church, is the first solo female headliner since Shania Twain kicked off her comeback at the festival in 2017 (Trisha Yearwood joined husband Garth Brooks in his Mane Stage slot a year later).
This year, other notable female performers include 61-year-old Tanya Tucker, Nashville rebel Nikki Lane, who will again curate a Stage Stop Marketplace on the festival grounds, and The Haden Triplets, whose father is jazz legend Charlie Haden.
In 2020, celebrity chef Guy Fieri also returns with his Stagecoach Smokehouse featuring barbecue vendors, and DJ Diplo will perform another late Sunday night set in the Palamino tent. Last year, the DJ brought out Cyrus and Lil Nas X to perform their remix of "Old Town Road. "

Trump Imposes Sanctions On Turkey for Syria Attack

Texto completo: President Trump said on Monday that he was imposing sanctions on Turkish government agencies and officials in response to Turkey's incursion into Syria, an invasion that he himself had cleared the way for by withdrawing American troops.
Mr. Trump, under mounting political pressure to retreat from his earlier suggestions that the United States should remain uninvolved, also said he was halting negotiations over a $ 100 billion trade deal and doubling tariffs on imports of Turkish steel.
"The United States will aggressively use economic sanctions to target those who enable, facilitate and finance these heinous acts in Syria," Mr. Trump said in a statement. "I am fully prepared to swiftly destroy Turkey's economy if Turkish leaders continue down this dangerous and destructive path."
The Treasury Department announced that it was placing sanctions on Turkey's Ministry of National Defense and Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources, along with the minister of national defense, minister of energy and natural resources, and minister of the interior. The sanctions effectively cut them off from the global financial system. The sanctions did not appear to include the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, but the Treasury Department warned of additional sanctions against Turkish government officials if Turkey did not change course in Syria.
Mr. Trump spoke with Mr. Erdogan on Monday, urging him to "stop the invasion" and agree to enact a cease-fire, Vice President Mike Pence said. Mr. Pence also announced that Mr. Trump had asked him to lead a delegation to Turkey.
But the actions were, in the minds of many American diplomats, a week late: The time to threaten sanctions was when Mr. Trump spoke with Mr. Erdogan by phone on Oct. 6, just before the invasion, in an effort to dissuade him from proceeding with the attack on Kurdish forces allied with the United States. Now, the invasion has resulted not only in the deaths of Kurdish allies, but also signs that it is benefiting Russia, Iran and the Islamic State.
Exactly what Turkey would need to do to end the sanctions was also unclear. Mr. Trump said nothing about bringing its troops back home. In a statement on Monday night, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was somewhat more specific, warning Turkish officials that "to avoid suffering further sanctions imposed under this new executive order Turkey must immediately cease its unilateral offensive in northeast Syria and return to a dialogue with the United States on security in northeast Syria." That sounded more like a cease-fire than a retreat from Kurdish-controlled territory.
Three top Senate Democrats -- Senators Chuck Schumer of New York, Robert Menendez of New Jersey and Jack Reed of Rhode Island -- warned in a joint statement that "strong sanctions, while good and justified," would not be enough to reverse the damage. They called on Republicans to join them in a resolution that would force Mr. Trump to reverse his decision to withdraw American forces from Syria.
"President Trump should use this moment to step up, do the right thing and correct course," they said. "He can listen to his national security and military advisers, and to the chorus of bipartisan voices in Congress and across the world who made it clear that this was a grave mistake worth reversing."
They appeared to have significant Republican support. Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, reiterated his concern on Monday that the withdrawal would create "a catastrophic outcome for the United States' strategic interests."
Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California and Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, spoke by phone on Monday and agreed that a bipartisan, bicameral joint resolution to overturn the president's decision was their "first order of business," Ms. Pelosi said.
Mr. Trump himself had cleared the way for the Turkish invasion and attacks on Kurdish forces allied with the United States by ordering the withdrawal of some American forces in northern Syria a week ago.
Some analysts of the United States-Turkey relationship cast Mr. Trump's move as a half-measure, perhaps intended to forestall more aggressive action by an angry Congress.
"Trump's 'sanctions package' against Turkey regarding the latter's Syria offensive isn't surprising," Soner Cagaptay, a fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, wrote on Twitter. Mr. Trump, he said, "wasn't really going to sanction Turkey for a move for which he had green lighted Erdogan in the first place."
Mr. Trump said the steel tariffs on Turkey would rise to 50 percent from 25 percent. The United States had previously imposed a 50 percent steel tariff on Turkey last year after the Turkish government refused to release an American pastor who was being held on espionage charges. His decision to impose the tariffs in 2018 spooked markets and sent Turkey's currency, the lira, tumbling.
Turkey was America's sixth-largest foreign supplier of steel before the United States doubled the tariffs last year. Steel imports from Turkey fell sharply, dropping by 76 percent, after the tariff increase. Mr. Trump moved in May to pull the tariffs back to 25 percent, which is in line with duties that he imposed globally for national security reasons.
Mr. Trump's statement made no mention of the potentially awkward fact that Mr. Erdogan is scheduled to visit Mr. Trump at the White House on Nov. 13, as Mr. Trump announced on Twitter last week. Nor did it mention possible sanctions that senators from both parties have insisted for months are required by law to punish Ankara's purchase of an advanced Russian antimissile system.

Epstein's Estate Takes Up Fight Against His Accusers

Texto completo: The federal criminal case against Jeffrey Epstein ended with his death two months ago, but the legal battles by his estate are poised to go on for months to come.
Last week, lawyers for Mr. Epstein's estate asked a judge in the Virgin Islands to allow the payment of $ 90,000 in fees to a New York law firm that is defending it against a half-dozen lawsuits filed by some of the financier's alleged victims. The week before, it sent lawyers from another firm to court against the State of New Mexico over public grazing rights for livestock at Zorro Ranch, the nearly 10,000-acre property Mr. Epstein owned outside Santa Fe.
Legal maneuvering is not unusual when wealthy estates are involved -- Mr. Epstein's assets were estimated at more than $ 577 million -- but the complicated court actions may have only just begun. Lawyers for some accusers have named dozens of companies Mr. Epstein was associated with as defendants.
The firm defending the estate against Mr. Epstein's accusers, Troutman Sanders, billed for one conversation on Aug. 10, after Mr. Epstein was found dead in a Manhattan jail cell while he awaited trial on sex-trafficking charges. The month's worth of legal fees also includes work for a continuing "federal regulatory matter" that began before Mr. Epstein's death, although the filing did not offer details.
Mr. Epstein's other enterprises are still up and running, too. Employees continue to go to work at the offices of Southern Trust, his main company in the Virgin Islands, which operates out of a marina and office complex on St. Thomas. And boats he owned are still shuttling people to the two private islands he owned nearby.
Mr. Epstein's will, filed in the Virgin Islands and signed two days before he killed himself, put his estate into a trust, which would most likely cloak the eventual disbursements in secrecy. The mix of real estate and companies in the estate reflects the closely held nature of the operations Mr. Epstein ran over the past two decades.
The New York Times previously reported that Southern Trust made at least $ 200 million in net profits from 2013 to 2017, a financial rebound that began five years after Mr. Epstein's conviction in Florida for soliciting sex from an underage girl. Unaudited financial statements, obtained from the island territory's Division of Corporations and Trademarks, revealed that Southern Trust had begun making money after Mr. Epstein's former money management firm, Financial Trust, posted years of losses beginning with the financial crisis.
Alan D. Jagolinzer, director of the Cambridge Center for Financial Reporting & Accountability at the University of Cambridge in England, said the statements raised "way too many questions."
Mr. Jagolinzer said it was hard to understand how Financial Trust reported losses at a time when the stock market was rallying strongly after the 2008 financial crisis. He also did not understand why Southern Trust would seek a $ 30.5 million loan from an undisclosed source in 2017, when the firm appears to have been flush with cash.
Parts of those filings were signed, at times, by two close associates of Mr. Epstein: Darren K. Indyke, a lawyer, and Richard D. Kahn, an accountant. Both are executors of Mr. Epstein's will, and they authorized Troutman Sanders to continue litigating on behalf of the estate.
Bennet Moskowitz, the lead lawyer at Troutman Sanders, did not respond to a request for comment.
A court filing in New Mexico contains a copy of a check signed by Mr. Kahn to pay for the renewal of leases that granted Zorro Ranch access to more than 1,200 acres of nearby public land for livestock grazing. The check, dated Sept. 6, was drawn from an account with TD Bank.
The New Mexico State Land Office refused to accept the check, in part prompting the court action. A statement from the land office said the leases never should have been awarded and chided Mr. Epstein's estate for wasting state resources on a court fight.
Clifford Atkinson, a lawyer representing the Zorro Ranch, declined to comment.
William LaPiana, an associate dean at New York Law School and a trust and estates expert, said it was not surprising that the executors of the estate were protecting its assets. "They have an obligation to carry out the expressed wishes in the will and owe a duty to the beneficiaries," he said.
Mr. Epstein's only known living relative is a brother.
The federal authorities have said they were continuing their investigation of Mr. Epstein's alleged sex-trafficking activities. It is not clear to what extent Southern Trust and Financial Trust, both of which received lucrative tax incentives from the Virgin Island authorities, factor into that investigation.
Southern Trust, which purports to operate a DNA database business, remains eligible for that tax break. Representatives for the government agency that approved the tax incentives did not comment on whether they would be revoked in light of Mr. Epstein's death and the active investigation.

Texto completo: BEHIND THE BYLINE
Meet Marc Lacey, the Times Editor Who Will Moderate Tuesday's Democratic Debate
Interview by Lara Takenaga
______
The Reader Center has started an interview series, Behind the Byline , to introduce you to Times journalists. Is there a reporter, photographer or editor whom you would like to get to know? Tell us in the form below.
Over his 20 years at The New York Times, Marc Lacey has worn many hats: a White House correspondent, a foreign correspondent who has reported from dozens of countries, the editor of the weekend news report and, now, the National editor.
But on Tuesday, he'll try on a very different one. Alongside the CNN anchors Anderson Cooper and Erin Burnett, Marc will moderate the fourth Democratic debate -- the first that The Times has hosted in more than a decade.
[See our visual guide to the debate.]
Here, Marc shares how he learned about his latest gig, the career path he almost chose and his surprising hobby.
What was your path to becoming the National editor?
I still remember when I got the call from New York in 2011 asking whether I wanted to be an editor. I was the first-ever Phoenix bureau chief for The Times and was in my home office gazing out at the man-made lake I lived on. My pontoon boat was docked nearby, with my fishing rod at the ready.
After more than a decade of adventurous reporting posts, I thought editing would be another adventure. I have not been wrong. I have edited some of our finest foreign correspondents, run The Times over the weekend and, since 2016, overseen coverage of the country. Regrettably, though, I no longer catch fish in the middle of the day.
What do you enjoy most about the role? What is most challenging about it?
I'm part conductor, part coach. I no longer pick up the French horn and blow out notes. But I can tell when someone is off key. And if I wave my arms the right way, beautiful music will result.
As for the coaching part, I have an amazing team of correspondents scattered throughout the country. I call plays, together with my top-notch editing staff, and we watch from the sidelines as they carry them out. I put people in the positions that bring out the best in them and help us win, journalistically speaking.
As for the challenges, the hours are long but nothing like those in the field.
What did you learn as a former correspondent -- in Kenya, Mexico and the United States -- that has informed your work as an editor?
I learned how to go from a deep sleep to a state just alert enough to understand that the editor on the other end of the phone was sending me to a coup attempt in a place called N'Djamena, which is the capital of Chad.
"Were you asleep?" I used to be asked back then. If I had had the vocabulary at the time, I would have responded: "Bruh." Now that I'm making the calls, I apologize to correspondents for waking them at ungodly hours and then mention someplace they never thought they'd go.
How did you find out that you would be co-moderating the next Democratic debate? What was your reaction?
My phone rang one recent night. I ignored it. It rang again. I ignored it again. The same call and no response continued a few more times right in the middle of the last presidential debate, which I was watching from home.
It turned out that it was Patrick Healy, our political editor, who had just learned that The New York Times would be co-sponsoring the next debate with CNN. Apparently there had been a meeting among the top Times brass in which various people were proposed for the Times moderator role.
When Pat asked me, I chuckled. It turns out he wasn't joking.
What's something that readers would be surprised to learn about you?
I ride a motorcycle -- not a particularly mean one, but a motorcycle nonetheless. This is very much counter to my image, which is why I don't sell it.
If you had to choose another job, in journalism or not, what would it be?
I majored in biology at Cornell and believe that if the stars had aligned differently, I might have made a fine surgeon.
Journalism can be messy work just like medicine, but we, much like those in operating rooms, try to suture all the wounds and wipe away any mess before we finish.
How do you spend your time when you're off duty?
I have a dog named Sandy who greets me at the end of each workday with so much enthusiasm that I forget all the hostile tweets I might have received that day. The debate's going to be great, I have no doubt, especially to my labradoodle. To her, no matter what happens onstage, I will have won.

For Giuliani, third time wasn't the charm

Texto completo: Trump lawyer's bitter divorce in headlines as inquiry plays out
In the "What on earth happened to Rudy Giuliani?" sweepstakes, there are plenty of entries but no winners. Everyone wants to know why "America's Mayor" became President Trump's favorite consigliere.
Here's one factor: He's in the midst a very bitter, very expensive, very public divorce. (A moment of silence, please, for the death of romance - especially when there's no prenuptial.) Perhaps the contentious end of his third marriage is a distraction?
Absolutely not, Rudolph W. Giuliani tweeted last week, writing that The Washington Post stooped "so low as to actually ask me about my pending divorce, to see if it affects my work. It doesn't."
Giuliani's private life has been splashed across New York tabloids for decades, and the lawyer representing his estranged wife thinks Giuliani is concealing money while working pro bono for President Trump. As a central figure in the Ukraine impeachment scandal, the exact nature of Giuliani's clients and income is of interest to more than divorce lawyers.
Not that he wants to talk about any of it.
"My divorce is my personal business," Giuliani texted me last week. "Anyway my opinion on it is the least objective as is my soon to be ex-wife. This is third divorce for both of us and thank goodness no children. If you can figure out the truth in a divorce proceeding, you should be on the High Court, the one above the Supreme Court."
It's hard to explain why a marriage falls apart, or why two crazy kids once madly in love end up going at each other's throats.
"I feel betrayed by a man that I supported in every way for more than 20 years," Judith Giuliani told the New York Times last month. "I'm sad to know that the hero of 9/11 has become a liar."
There's never a good time for a nasty split, but perhaps this is the very worst of times for Giuliani.
"He's going through a divorce at the same time he's in the most precarious legal and professional situation of his life - and it's all happening on live TV," says Rebecca Katz, a New York political consultant. "And there doesn't seem to be anyone left in Trump's orbit with the inclination or authority to stop him."

Giuliani, 75, is leaving this marriage the same way he entered it: with blaring headlines, tabloid updates and so much drama.
"He digs it," says Ken Frydman, spokesman for his 1993 mayoral campaign. "He loves the attention. It's sport for him - and a lack of judgment."
In May 2000, New York's two-term mayor called a news conference and announced a separation from his second wife, television anchor Donna Hanover. It was also a public acknowledgment of his year-long relationship with Judith Nathan, whom he praised as a "very, very fine woman." The separation, however, was allegedly a surprise to his wife, who said she found out her 16-year marriage was ending by watching television.
A surprise, but also not surprising: Hanover started dating Giuliani when he was married to his first wife, Regina Peruggi. An eternal mystery: When the mistress becomes the wife, why is she shocked when another mistress enters the scene? ("Job opening," goes the old joke.) The New York papers alluded to other indiscretions, but nothing serious became public until the infamous news conference.
Nathan and Giuliani met in 1999 at Club Macanudo, an East Side cigar bar. Nathan, divorced from her second husband, was a hospital sales rep and a trained nurse. Across the room: Mayor Giuliani. Sparks flew.
"It was the thunderbolt,'' he told the New York Times. "Our attraction was instantaneous. There was almost something mystical about the feeling.''
Soon, the two were inseparable, except for the quality time he spent with his wife and two children.
The affair was not, shall we say, discreet. Nathan accompanied the mayor to a number of official functions and stayed at his side during his treatment for prostate cancer, which led to his divorce lawyer's TMI revelation in 2001 that the cancer had rendered Giuliani impotent and the two had not had sex for a year. They were not ones to let the marriage of true minds admit impediments, so love flourished.
Giuliani and Hanover divorced in July 2002, and he married Nathan the following May in a ceremony at Gracie Mansion fit for royalty: The bride wore off-white and a tiara; the 400 guests included Yogi Berra, Henry Kissinger, Barbara Walters and Trump.
By this time, Giuliani had been crowned "America's Mayor" and Time's 2001 Man of the Year, following his heroic response to the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. He received a knighthood from Queen Elizabeth II. Prevented by law from seeking a third term as New York's mayor, he settled into life with Nathan as a celebrated power couple.
For the first time in his life, Giuliani was really rich. He was merely rich before - the divorce settlement gave Hanover more than $6 million - but now he was raking in serious bucks, commanding $100,000 per speech and private jets to fly in style. His bride accompanied him on all his trips; they required extra accommodations for staff - and an extra airplane seat for Judith Giuliani's designer purse, which she was unwilling to put on the floor, according to news reports. Old friends of the former mayor allege they were pushed aside when his new wife turned Giuliani into a country club kind of guy.
"They were absolutely a good match," says Frydman, who says that Giuliani is not the same man he knew 25 years ago. "They're equally unsympathetic: People hate Judith and people hate Rudy."
And they were equally ambitious: For a brief shining moment, Giuliani was the Republican front-runner for the 2008 presidential nomination. There were glowing profiles of the couple, complete with musings in New York magazine about what they would be like as president and first lady.
His presidential bid was thwarted by Sen. John McCain, and the Giulianis resumed life as Republican VIPs, buying properties - an elegant apartment on East 66th Street, homes in Palm Beach, Fla., and the Hamptons - and portfolios. There were box seats for the Yankees and the opera, private jets, Cuban cigars. Along the way, he amassed a fortune estimated at $45 million, according to several media reports.
When it came to politics, Giuliani hung around in the background, until 2016, when he endorsed Trump because of their longtime New York connections and popped up as a featured speaker at the Republican convention.
In April 2018, he was named one of the president's personal lawyers, the same month Judith Giuliani filed for divorce in Manhattan Supreme Court.
"I don't know that we can blame Rudy's current meltdown on the divorce," says Katz. "It seems more likely that Rudy's meltdown led to the breakdown of his marriage, rather than the other way around."

What happened in the marriage? And when did it happen?
"It was an ongoing process that began when he lost the presidential campaign," Judith Giuliani told New York magazine last year. And then the coup de grace: "For a variety of reasons that I know as a spouse and a nurse he has become a different man."
(As a nurse? Low blow.)
Through her lawyer, Judith Giuliani declined to be interviewed for this article. But she was more chatty last year amid rumors that her husband was dating Maria Rosa Ryan, a hospital administrator whom he took to the White House state dinner just weeks ago. The two have traveled abroad extensively and shared a night last year in a New Hampshire hotel, where he claims they were watching "The Godfather." Giuliani and Ryan say the relationship is not romantic.
Shortly after the New Hampshire screening, Judith Giuliani released a statement to the New York Post saying, "My husband's denial of the affair with the married Mrs. Ryan is as false as his claim that we were separated when he took up with her."
Divorce filings in New York are not public documents, but enough has come out in news reports from the open hearings, which are vigorously covered by the New York tabloids.
Judith Giuliani, 64, receives $42,000 a month in alimony, an amount she claims is peanuts compared with the $230,000 per month they spent as a couple, according to the New York Times. Her lawyer, Bernard Clair, reported that Giuliani earned millions working at the law firm Greenberg Traurig: Almost $8 million in 2016 and $9 million in 2017. He also claims that by working pro bono for Trump, his client's husband is deliberately concealing income and working with people who will have to "reimburse him" at a later date.
Giuliani, on the other hand, is pleading poverty. Because he is working for free and paying his own expenses, his lawyer says he can't afford to support his wife in the lifestyle to which she became accustomed and had to borrow money to pay taxes.
"My reason for working for President Trump for free is wholly and entirely patriotic, and also because he is my friend," he told the New York Post.
Meanwhile, they're reportedly fighting over everything: money, Christmas decorations, remote controls and who gets to hang out in which of the private clubs to which they belong.
Judge Michael Katz told the couple: "It is beyond me why either party in this case would have an interest in having all of this done publicly." Settling, he said, "would treat their relationship and marriage with more respect than divulging all our dirty laundry out for public consumption."
That's not happening. There is some chatter in New York that Judith Giuliani is writing a book - or it might be a savvy negotiating tactic for someone with no prenuptial and a good memory.
The Giulianis' next court date is scheduled for January.

NBC’s culture of corruption and sexual abuse may be even worse than anyone thought

Texto completo: As it turns out, NBC's investigation of NBC showing there is no evidence of a “culture of sexual harassment” at NBC may not have been so thorough as the network would have you believe.
MSNBC president Phil Griffin, for example, grew so comfortable in whatever culture produced disgraced former host Matt Lauer that he once touted photos of NBC star Maria Menounos’ vagina during a meeting with colleagues, according to journalist Ronan Farrow.
Farrow reports in his forthcoming book, Catch & Kill:
Four colleagues said Griffin was known for making lewd or crass remarks in work emails. In one meeting I'd be in after the television personality Maria Menounos's vagina had been photographed in a bathing suit wardrobe malfunction, Griffin waved around a printed page bearing a zoomed-in image, smirking.
"Would you look at that? Not bad, not bad," Griffin reportedly remarked.
Remember: This is the president of a major cable news network. He reportedly said this of an NBC employee's vagina in a meeting with other NBC employees. That Griffin apparently felt comfortable enough to do something like this in front of colleagues should tell you a little something about how Lauer was able to get away with his alleged sexual depredations for as long as he did.
Speaking of the former NBC host: This anecdote about Griffin sharing illicit photos of Menounos comes on the heels of a separate excerpt from Farrow’s book alleging Lauer anally raped an NBC News colleague in a Sochi hotel in 2014. Lauer denies the allegation, though he concedes he did indeed cheat on his then-wife Annette Roque with the young NBC staffer.
Nearly as vile as the reported act itself is that the alleged victim informed her superiors in two separate NBC divisions about what supposedly happened to her in Sochi, and they did nothing.
“This was no secret,” Farrow writes.
For good measure, here are excerpts from the New York Times’ 2017 reporting on additional allegations leveled against Lauer:
In 2001, the woman said, Mr. Lauer, who is married, asked her to his office to discuss a story during a workday. When she sat down, she said, he locked the door, which he could do by pressing a button while sitting at his desk. (People who worked at NBC said the button was a regular security measure installed for high-profile employees.) The woman said Mr. Lauer asked her to unbutton her blouse, which she did. She said the anchor then stepped out from behind his desk, pulled down her pants, bent her over a chair and had intercourse with her. At some point, she said, she passed out with her pants pulled halfway down. She woke up on the floor of his office, and Mr. Lauer had his assistant take her to a nurse.
You may ask yourself: “How would Lauer be able to get away for so long with this sort of behavior?" For an answer to that question, we may have to look at his superiors, including NBC and MSNBC chairman Andy Lack, who reportedly has a reputation within the company for preying on female subordinates.
CBS news anchor Jane Wallace, for example, tells Farrow that Lack was "almost unrelenting" in asking her out "every day for almost a month," and that she “didn't just get flirted with” but that she “got worked over."
“If your boss does that, what are you gonna say?” said Wallace, who clarified that her sexual interactions with Lack were consensual. “You know if you say ‘I don’t want to celebrate with you,’ you’re asking for trouble.”
Farrow adds that after Wallace "left the show, she recalled [Lack] yelling, ‘You will never get credit.’ Then the network deployed a tactic that the public was barely conscious of at the time: it offered her a substantial payout to sign a binding nondisclosure agreement.”
I feel like now is an appropriate time to remind you that NBC is certainly no stranger to burying allegations of sexual misconduct. Nearly three years ago, in 2016, the network tried to squash Farrow’s reporting on the Harvey Weinstein scandal.
That same year, NBC allowed itself to get scooped by the Washington Post somehow on a major election year story involving a certain former NBC host boasting that he can do whatever he wants, including grabbing women "by the pussy."
Earlier than that even, in 1999, the network sat on its exclusive interview of Juanita Broaddrick, who claims Bill Clinton raped her in the 1970s, until after the president had been acquitted on two articles of impeachment.
For people like Lauer to operate in the way he did, and for the network to get into the habit of killing major but potentially damaging news stories, it would require a substantial network of enablers.
The story now is no longer about just Matt Lauer. It is about NBC itself and the culture that allowed someone like the disgraced morning host to operate freely for so long. As the saying goes, a fish rots from the head down.
Photo Caption:FILE - In this April 21, 2016, file photo, Matt Lauer, co-host of the NBC "Today" television program, appears on set in Rockefeller Plaza, in New York. A new book by Ronan Farrow, a former NBC News employee who now works at The New Yorker, names the accuser whose story that Lauer raped her in a Sochi hotel room led to his dismissal. Lauer denied the charges in an angry and defiant letter released by his lawyer Wednesday, Oct. 9, 2019, and said that his public silence since his firing had been a mistake.

Texto completo: To get a sense of just how desperately liberals in the media are trying to lend cover to Joe Biden and his 49-year-old son Hunter Biden, you need only have watched 90 seconds of MSNBC’s Chuck Todd on Friday.
That’s how long it took Todd to declare that the curious and weirdly lucrative financial deals Hunter landed while his dad was vice president are off-limits because, as Todd put it, Hunter is “not a public figure.”
This is how you know you can’t trust so much of what the national media say. If Hunter Biden isn’t a public figure, deserving of fair comment and criticism, then no one is, not even the sitting president.
Three months ago, Hunter literally flexed for a photographic spread in the New Yorker. He gave the magazine an extensive interview for a very lengthy profile that asked in the headline, “Will Hunter Biden Jeopardize His Father’s Campaign?”
And that was voluntary.
Here are two headlines from national newspapers:
“The Hunter Biden story is a troubling tale of privilege,” Washington Post, Oct. 4, 2019.
“Tiptoeing Around Hunter Biden,” New York Times, Oct. 10, 2019.
On Saturday, one day after Todd’s ignorant commentary on journalistic ethics, Hunter appeared for an on-camera interview with ABC News.
Never in history has there been a more public non-public figure than Hunter Biden, except maybe every single journalist who begins a news package with, “I never sought to be part of the story…”
What Todd meant was: I don’t like that President Trump has had an effective political attack on Joe Biden, which happens to implicate his own profiteering, drug-addled son.
Yes, there’s a there there. Nobody can honestly say that Joe Biden, while he was vice president, wasn’t aware of or passively participating in Hunter's self-enrichment. Hunter's sweet business interests conveniently coincided with his father’s political engagement with Ukraine and China.
Trump was brilliant in his remarks about it last week during a campaign rally in Minneapolis, and it got people really upset. “Joe’s son Hunter got thrown out of the Navy and then he became a genius on Wall Street in about two days,” Trump said. “By the way, whatever happened to Hunter? Where the hell is he?”
Well, there he is! He’s having a sit-down on network television, just like so many non-public figures do!
“Where is Hunter?” Trump continued. “I want to see Hunter asked this question: Hunter, you know nothing about energy. You know nothing about China. You know nothing about anything, frankly. Hunter, you’re a loser. Why did you get $1.5 billion, Hunter?”
The $1.5 billion figure, according to a report last week in the New York Post, is a reference to a funding goal that Hunter’s business, in partnership with a Chinese company, had set in 2013, the same year that he had flown to China with his dad aboard Air Force Two and met with business associates. A photograph from the trip shows both Bidens posing with the Chinese businessmen on a golf course.
Normal person: Hmm, interesting. Can I hear more about that from the most powerful person in the world?
Chuck Todd: Nah, no need! Hunter Biden isn’t a public figure! You don't need to know about this.
It’s always a trip when the national media try to save their audiences from Trump by refusing to quote him or air his rallies. That's invariably a hint that they’re hiding something very good.
Remember when Washington Post columnist Karen Tumulty said earlier this year that she would “pledge” that she would “never again quote, repeat or otherwise dignify any of the asinine nicknames that President Trump gives his adversaries”? Remember when Fox News refused to air a fantastic and factually accurate ad about immigrant-related crime in the heat of the 2018 midterm election? Remember when the liberal HuffPost in 2015 said it was relegating all coverage of Donald Trump to the “entertainment” section?
On his show Friday, Chuck Todd said that Trump’s “attack” on Hunter was “remarkable” but that he couldn’t “in good conscience amplify those attacks” because they “seemed to cross a line.” We know what that means. It means that Trump hit a little too close to home. All of Todd’s viewers should want to find out what he said.

The Wall Street Journal reports that Hunter Biden failed the drug test last year and was discharged in February. In a statement issued Thursday, Oct. 16, Biden doesn't say why he was discharged. He says he's embarrassed that his actions led to his discharge and that he respects the Navy's decision.(AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais, File)

Texto completo: The White House says President Donald Trump hasn't seen the violent video edited to depict him carrying out a massacre of news organizations and political opponents, but he does condemn the contents being reported.
The statement comes as questions about the video and its use continue to swirl and as the people "killed" in the video continue to react.
The fake video was played at a conference hosted by a pro-Trump group at his Miami resort last week, according to a report in The New York Times. It includes the logo for Trump's 2020 reelection campaign.
In the edited scene from the film "Kingsman: The Secret Service," Trump as the face of Colin Firth's character enters a "Church of Fake News" and opens fire on members of the congregation.
The churchgoers have various news organizations' logos or the faces of Democratic lawmakers and other critics superimposed onto their bodies.
White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said Monday morning that the president has not yet viewed the video, but condemns its contents based on reports. She said he will see it shortly. Trump has not directly responded.
Trump's character shoots, stabs and sets fire to the late Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz. ; 2020 presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. ; Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif. ; and 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton and former President Barack Obama, among others.
Reports describing a violent video played at a Trump Campaign event in which images of reporters & @JohnMcCain are being slain by Pres Trump violate every norm our society expects from its leaders& the institutions that bare their names. I stand w/ @whca in registering my outrage
— Cindy McCain (@cindymccain) October 14, 2019
The video also shows House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif. , who is currently involved in pursuing the impeachment inquiry into Trump.
More: Public opinion inching closer toward Trump impeachment inquiry
Several news outlets are depicted being killed in the rampage, including Politico, NPR, HuffPost, The Washington Post, Slate and CNN.
The White House Correspondents' Association and CNN called on Trump to denounce the video.
"We have previously told the President his rhetoric would incite violence. Now we call on him and everybody associated with this conference to denounce this video and affirm that violence has no place in our society," Jonathan Karl, the president of WHCA, said in a statement.
"The President and his family, the White House, and the Trump campaign need to denounce it immediately in the strongest possible terms. Anything less equates to a tacit endorsement of violence and should not be tolerated by anyone," a CNN statement reads.
Democratic presidential candidate Beto O'Rourke said Sunday evening, "Last year, a Trump supporter sent bombs to CNN – and a shooter entered a church yesterday. This video isn’t funny. It will get people killed.
I cannot repost the "Trump as mass murderer" video. How low are we going to go? How much lower can we bear?
— Carol Leonnig (@CarolLeonnig) October 14, 2019
The video reportedly played this weekend at a conference organized by the President’s supporters at Trump National Doral is vile and dangerous. Here is my statement on behalf of @whca pic. twitter. com/fOZLMhsi7P
— Jonathan Karl (@jonkarl) October 14, 2019
This is about so much more than a single video. It's about what happens when you plant seeds of hatred and division. It's about what happens when you give your supporters permission to hate and dehumanize critics. https://t. co/X77yPhn8JG
— Brian Stelter (@brianstelter) October 14, 2019
An organizer for the conference confirmed that the video was shown but denounced its showing as part of a "meme exhibit" with content submitted by third parties, according to The New York Times. "This matter is under review," said the organizer Alex Phillips.
Phillips also said on the conference's website it was "shocking" that the Times did not report on other portions of the conference, "Including our panel conversation LITERALLY condemning political violence while claiming to be upset over a meme that was not sanctioned, shown on stage, or approved. "
The video appears to have been created by an organization called TheGeekzTeam, which tweeted it out and uploaded it to YouTube on July 3, 2018. The group has posted many videos of Trump inflicting violence on his perceived enemies, particularly members of the media. This particular video was entitled "The Trumpsman (The Kingsman Parody). "
In posting the video, the group said: "Fake News is very real and very present. Even through all the hate thats thrown at Trump daily, he still wants to help this nation back on it's feet and make it great again!"
Former White House press secretary Sarah Sanders and Donald Trump Jr. were reportedly scheduled to speak at the same three-day conference where the video was played. According to the Times, representatives for the two said they did not see the video.
A spokesperson for the Trump campaign told The New York Times that the campaign was not involved in the creation of the video, and "we do not condone violence. "
Trump has repeatedly referred to members of the American news media as the "enemy of the people," and attacked members of the news media at his campaign rallies.

Federal, state probes say most sex trafficking originates in Flushing, N.Y.

Texto completo: If there is a common thread linking the sex trafficking industry between Mount Pleasant, Pennsylvania, and the Florida panhandle, it is Flushing, New York.
Although roughly a thousand miles separate ongoing criminal cases in Florida and Westmoreland County of massage parlor operators accused of running their businesses as brothels, court documents in both states are filled with mentions of Flushing, the New York City neighborhood in Queens, that prosecutors say serves as the epicenter of America's modern-day forced-sex trade.
It is stitched to prostitution and human trafficking through an estimated 9,000 massage parlors across the nation that generate nearly $2.5 billion annually in illicit revenue, according to Polaris, the nonprofit behind the National Human Trafficking Hotline (888-373-7888).
That includes the much-publicized Jupiter, Florida, massage parlor sting operation that brought sex crime charges against New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft in February.
Lawyers for Kraft, 78, on Tuesday sued the Florida attorney general's office, claiming it violated an open records law by not turning over certain materials in the case. Prosecutors claim video evidence shows Kraft paying for sex acts at Orchids of Asia Day Spa on consecutive days in January. He was one of hundreds of people charged in the investigation of four businesses.
Many of the women working at the Orchids spa came from China via Flushing as part of a human trafficking network which allegedly forced them to perform sex acts with customers, investigators said. The same has been said for a number of Western Pennsylvania massage parlors.
"Yes, that appears to be the case," said Katherine A. Wymard, the Pennsylvania senior deputy attorney general who is leading the prosecution of four people arrested in March in the operation of five massage parlors in Monroeville and Murrysville.
Hui Xu, 44, of Mount Pleasant owned and operated four Tokyo Massage parlors.
Also accused are Chang Yu Chen, 51, of Monroeville, who was described as a handyman and manager; Huicun Wei, 47, of Flushing, owner and manager at Judy's Oriental Massage Parlor in Murrysville; and Robert Delano Yerick, 83, of Delmont, described as an administrator and handyman.
In August, federal prosecutors in Florida accused David C. Williams, 41, of Pensacola of running a network of massage parlors from the Sunshine State to Pennsylvania - including ones in Bridgeville, Carnegie, Hempfield and Turtle Creek - that exploited undocumented women and underage girls to perform sex acts for money.
Many of them flew from China to New York, where they made their way to Flushing before being sent to his various businesses, the FBI reported in court filings.
Two anonymous calls to the National Human Trafficking Hotline prompted the investigation, agents said.
Williams is charged with using interstate facilities for purposes of racketeering, conspiracy to commit money laundering and the harboring of illegal aliens for commercial advantage or private financial gain.
Last month, U.S. Magistrate Judge Hope T. Cannon in Pensacola denied a request from Williams to be released from jail before trial, agreeing with prosecutors that he was a risk of flight because of his many trips to China, Honduras and Vietnam, and that he would "likely continue to engage in human trafficking if released."
Cannon also mentioned in her September opinion Williams' many connections to Flushing, holding driver's licenses of several workers at his parlors that reported residences in Flushing.
"[FBI] Agent John Canning testified for the government, describing [Flushing] as a hotbed of Chinese nationals and portal for human trafficking," Cannon wrote.
Flushing pipeline
The Flushing connection comes as no surprise to Dennis McCarty, who teaches courses on human trafficking at the State University of New York at Albany.
A long-established underground pipeline of workers "mostly Asian to all 50 states" has been around for many decades, he said.
"They come to the U.S. from Asia, including China, under many different circumstances. Some are even sold by their own families against their will. Some come to work in the U.S. to pay off family debt or with the promise of better futures, and then after they get here they discover they're going to work in massage parlors," said McCarty, a criminal justice instructor in the College of Emergency Preparedness, Homeland Security and Cybersecurity.
Longtime traffickers in Flushing often take workers' passports, so many of them still use a New York address when they go to work in other states, McCarty said.
"And once they get to a location where they work, they keep the workers very isolated," he said. "There are language barriers, many don't speak English, the threat of harm against their families back home, which also make prosecutions in these cases very, very difficult as well."
Along with China, human trafficking victims come from Korea, Thailand and Eastern Europe, the New York Times reported this year in an article that focused on the Flushing connection to the network of illicit sex parlors nationwide and their "deep roots" to Flushing and "big-city Chinatowns."
These parlors - which often promote services such as hourlong or hot stone massage, shiatsu and even acupuncture - also force "tens of thousands of mostly foreign women" to provide sex services that often are advertised and/or reviewed online, including on sites such as Rubmaps, The New York Times reported.
Crime rings in New York and Chicago have peddled children and young women since at least 1910 - "and that's only as far back as I documented," said Linda Smith, who seeks to stamp out sex trafficking through her nonprofit, Shared Hope International.
Smith, a former congresswoman from Washington state, formed the organization after leaving office in 1998. A trip to Mumbai, India, left her "appalled" at the sight of women and children kept in small stalls and sold for sex each day.
"I've found that the traffickers are looking for the most vulnerable. Many are young women, that's what men are shopping for," she said. "The customers at these parlors are looking for someone young, submissive and vulnerable enough not to have a voice because of language, and circumstances."
Local cases
The investigation into the alleged criminal activity at the Monroeville and Murrysville massage parlors took more than a year. During that time, investigators said, they watched numerous women workers arrive by bus from Flushing.
Yerick picked up young women at local bus stops. He delivered them to parlors and "shuffled" them between parlors, Wymard said. He even "housed some of the young women, requiring them to have sex with him," she said.
Many workers often lived in the parlors, some sleeping in closets with their belongings, Wymard said.
Pennsylvania ranks fifth in the U.S. for active federal criminal human trafficking cases, with 42 in 2018, as tracked by the Human Trafficking Institute, a nonprofit headquartered in Fairfax, Virginia. Of those, 38 involved sex trafficking. Labor trafficking accounted for four.
Federal prosecutions in Pennsylvania fell from 79 in 2017, but there have been a lot of strides in recent years, said Kyleigh Feehs, an attorney with the institute.
"Although the number of new federal human trafficking prosecutions dropped from 2017 to 2018, the data does show that the total number of federal prosecutions has increased dramatically since the enactment of the federal human trafficking statute in 2000, particularly in regard to the prosecution of sex traffickers," she said.
The crackdown is welcomed, said Smith, the former congresswoman.
"But if you really want to curb [sex trafficking], I think they've got to go after the buyers of these services, too," she said. "The buyers are just as complicit as the sellers and the facilitators."

Texto completo: NEW YORK - "For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide/When the Rainbow Is Enuf" is not a play. Or that's not what the breakthrough work was called by its author, Ntozake Shange. Her word was "choreopoem," and any production of "For Colored Girls," like the major revival now in previews at the Public Theater, has to figure out what the term means.
To the revival's director, Leah C. Gardiner, the definition is not that complicated. "A choreopoem," she said, "is a combination of all forms of theater storytelling." Which isn't to say that it's simple to realize. In the carefully chosen words of the revival's in-demand choreographer, Camille A. Brown, "combining text with movement is very complex."
For Paula Moss, the choreographer of the original 1976 production at the Public, "choreopoem" summons a memory of San Francisco in 1973. Shange, who died last year, had just met Moss in a dance class and invited her to a poetry reading.
"She stood up and started to read a few of her poems," Moss recalled in a telephone interview from her home in Rome. "Normally, poets stand there very stiff, but as she read, she starting dancing. Everyone was shocked."
"When she sat down," Moss continued, "she turned to me and said, 'I can't do this anymore.' I thought she was talking about writing. But she was talking about standing still."
From then on, whenever Shange recited her poetry, she moved. Often, Moss would be beside her, improvising in dance. "She told me to listen to her words and the sound of her voice and interpret them," Moss recalled. "She had the flow of a musician, and she could communicate the most intimate and secret feelings that women were going through. And movement and words came from the same breath. There could be no separation."
Both in their 20s, they were quickly joined by other young women, and sometimes by musicians, as they performed the choreopoetry that would become "For Colored Girls" in women's bars, cafes and Fillmore District clubs. After Shange and Moss drove to New York City, the work acquired a director and a more fixed shape. Eventually, at the Public Theater and then on Broadway, it became a landmark production of American theater, its script a classic of African American literature. But it is not always remembered that it all started with a poet dancing.
Shange, for her part, persistently emphasized the importance of dance in her life and work, the way it connected her to her body and her African American heritage. "It's how we remember what cannot be said," she once wrote.
In her essay-poem "Why I Had to Dance," she recalled how, in the years she was developing "For Colored Girls," dance became as important to her as writing. She acquired the habit of going directly from dance class to a coffee shop with her journal, as "the endorphin high" helped her "get to the truth." More broadly, "movements propelled the language and/or the language propelled the dance."
After Shange relocated to New York, her favorite dance classes were those she took as a scholarship student at Sounds in Motion, the Harlem studio of choreographer Dianne McInytre. Over the phone from Cleveland, McIntyre recalled "the beautiful flow" and flexibility of Shange in class: "She cut through space like a gazelle."
For the rest of Shange's life, Mclntyre often worked with her as a choreographer and a dancer. What Shange wanted from her, she said, was not literal translation: "You respond to the energy of her words, the meaning. You're going deep to the place where she's coming from." There was "total collaboration," she said, among Shange, a choreographer and a director. Similarly, it was "sometimes not easy to tell the difference between dancer, actor, singer. Everybody does everything. Everybody is thinking motion."
Aku Kadogo, another Mclntyre student, joined Shange's crew, improvising in bars, then becoming an original cast member of "For Colored Girls." Now the chair of theater and performance at Spelman College, she remembers how dance was "more public" back then: "Dance was around us, integral to our culture, and Ntozake captured that. She caught it with language."
References to dance abound in the text of "For Colored Girls," in both the poetry ("we gotta dance to keep from cryin/we gotta dance to keep from dyin") and the stage directions. Yet some audience members, Moss recalled, wondered where the choreography was. "That wasn't the point," she said. "This was a whole new form of theater. The choreography was within the poem and the performer. We worked hard to be free in our bodies as we recited the words."
It was a form of theater that Shange often had to defend. Calling herself a poet rather than a playwright, she railed against theater conventions, arguing that for black artists, plays without dancers and musicians were a waste of an "interdisciplinary culture." Explaining her collaborations with choreographers and musicians, she wrote how in her work, as in traditional theater, "everyone's efforts are directed toward the exploration and integrity of the text." The difference in her collaborations: "The text grows."
Therein lies the promise and some of the perils facing the "For Colored Girls" revival. Brown knows something about the borderline between theater and dance. She is one of very few choreographers to maintain a successful contemporary dance troupe (hers performs at the Joyce Theater Nov. 9-10) and a thriving career in theater. (She choreographed the current Metropolitan Opera production of "Porgy and Bess" and her work on "Choir Boy" was nominated for a Tony Award earlier this year.)
Interviewed before a recent rehearsal, Brown said that choreographing a choreopoem wasn't so different from her usual practice. Much of her work is rooted in social dance and gesture. The children's games - hand clapping, double Dutch - important to both the original production and to Gardiner's vision, are a facet of African American culture that Brown has already explored in her own "Black Girl: Linguistic Play."
It's a connection that Shange recognized. Before her death, Shange interviewed Brown for a book she was writing about dance. ("I should be interviewing you," Brown recalls thinking.) Planning the "For Colored Girls" revival, she told Gardiner that Brown was her choice for choreographer.
Brown admits some difficulties, like the danger of falling into cliches of spoken-word performance. "How can we honor that tradition but still challenge people to think differently?" she asked. "How far can we stretch the abstraction and leave things a little more ambiguous?"
But, especially as a choreographer working in theater, Brown said that she is grateful for the precedent set by Shange: "What's beautiful about Ntozake's work is that movement is not seen as a distraction. It's part of the story. When I'm given the space to serve the story through movement, that feels good."
From her director's perspective, Gardiner described the making of this choreopoem as a process of unusually pervasive collaboration. "You need everybody in the room at all times," she said. "Even when I've directed musicals, everyone had a set role," she added, whereas in "For Colored Girls" rehearsals, the team of black women - she and Brown and the composer, Martha Redbone - were "all in the pot, cooking it up together."
Working that way is costly, Gardiner noted. But it was Shange's way, and Gardiner sees a connection between Shange's example, a current upswing in dance and music in plays and a surge in black playwrights "working and writing out of our tradition." It is, she said, "an exciting time in American theater."
A time that recalls an earlier time. Moss, thinking of the beginning in San Francisco, remembered a painful feeling, as she danced to Shange's poems, of something holding her back, like being at the edge of a cliff unable to jump. "Until one day, I jumped," she said, "and I felt this rush of freedom, and we drove that car across the country, saying to ourselves, "We have something.'"

From Boys to Men. THE MIDTOWN MEN reunites Stars From The Original Cast of Broadway’s Jersey Boys, making them the first vocal group ever formed by the principal cast of a high-profile Broadway show. After sharing the stage for over a thousand performances, Tony® Award winner Christian Hoff, Michael Longoria, Daniel Reichard and Tony® Award nominee J. Robert Spencer decided to take their signature sound and chemistry to audiences everywhere, bringing to life their favorite 1960s hits.
The New York Times says, “Sidling up to the microphone, the singers had the air of the Rat Pack, Motown and a nightclub act rolled into one,” while the New York Daily News proclaims, “The Midtown Men sound as crisp as their Rat Pack-inspired suits. Their voices blend together so flawlessly on stage.” After a recent performance with the Oklahoma City Philharmonic, The Oklahoman praised the Midtown Men for “a joyous and nostalgic trip through the music of the 1960s with terrific orchestral charts,” adding, “this high-spirited evening kicked the audience’s adrenaline into overdrive.”

New York Times columnist says ‘white guilt’ is shaping 2020 Democratic battle

Texto completo: A New York Times columnist outlined the ways in which race and "white guilt" are playing a role in the 2020 Democratic primary.
In a Sunday op-ed for the publication, Astead W. Herndon argued that white liberals are "thinking more explicitly about race than they did even a decade ago," pointing to recent research that shows white Americans becoming more "woke" on racial issues. Because of the shift, he said candidates in the Democratic primary "have an incentive to talk to white voters explicitly about race."
"For years, prospective Democratic nominees came to Iowa to talk ethanol and pork subsidies and saved any rhetoric about the injustice of racial profiling for crowds in South Carolina and Nevada," he wrote. "But in the era of Mr. Trump ... it’s white Democrats in Iowa and New Hampshire — not black ones in South Carolina — who, to this point, are embracing the candidates who promise to upend society in the name of racial equity."
Herndon explained that while former Vice President Joe Biden has "held a commanding lead in national polls with nonwhite Democrats," white liberals have been more inclined to support candidates who are pushing "policies addressing racial inequalities." For example, white Democrat Julie Neff, 57, who started paying attention to race issues when her daughter got engaged to an Asian man, now calls diversity "very important to me."
"I should’ve been paying attention to this stuff sooner. But when Trump is making these decisions, I just realized it would be bad for my son-in-law and my grandchildren," she told Herndon.
Herndon also pointed to research by Georgia State University doctoral student Zach Goldberg finding that Trump's presidency, combined with the digital age, has "pushed white liberals into adopting new positions" and to attempt to "be the exact opposite of racist."
"They go adopt positions to prove they’re different than the morally tainted collective," he said.
However, Herndon and Goldberg noted that the strategy of appealing to white liberals in early voting states could backfire, as voters in the general election "do not share the liberal views about race that white Democrats do."
“When you think about it, this is why blacks may be supporting Biden the way they do,” Goldberg said. “They know this may not sell to the rest of white America come general election time.”
Touching on former President Barack Obama's 2008 "playbook" of winning over white voters in Iowa and New Hampshire before locking down the support of minority voters in other states, Herndon said similar efforts by 2020 candidates may be ignoring the fact that many black voters are "fueled by their pragmatic desire to see Mr. Trump replaced."
"Black voters are sticking with Mr. Biden not because they are unaware of his past, but because they see defeating Mr. Trump as an urgent priority," he said.
Twelve of the current contenders for the Democratic nomination will go head-to-head in the party's next debate on Oct. 15.

What's a Wealth Tax Worth? Warren and Sanders's plans to pilfer savings would hurt investment with little benefit.

Texto completo: Why do liberals think rich people have money just lying around, like Scrooge McDuck swimming in a giant pool of gold coins? That's the myth behind plans to tax Americans' wealth, as Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders both propose.
Ms. Warren wants an annual asset tax of 2% on households worth more than $50 million, and 3% if you're worth more than $1 billion. Mr. Sanders would tax "extreme wealth" starting at 1% on households worth $32 million and topping out at 8% on those worth $10 billion or more. Whereas the Soviets confiscated wealth virtually overnight, at least Bernie will take a dozen or so years to pilfer most of your savings.
University of California, Berkeley professors Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman estimate that Mr. Sanders's tax would raise $4.35 trillion over 10 years, while Ms. Warren's would raise $2.75 trillion. But something seems fishy—oh, Messrs. Saez and Zucman advise both campaigns on their wealth-tax plans. I doubt they account properly for how levies on wealth would shrink the tax base. Can we get some outside audits please?
Even setting comical revenue projections aside, the wealth-tax idea doesn't stand up to scrutiny. Never mind that it's likely unconstitutional. Or that a wealth tax is triple taxation, heaped on top of a 21% corporate tax plus 20% capital-gains tax when someone sells shares to pay it. (I concede that it definitely would provide lifetime employment for tax lawyers.)
The most preposterous part of the wealth-tax plans is their supporters' insistence that they would be good for the economy. Only in an upside-down world could anyone think "a wealth tax is pro-growth," as a New York Times columnist has claimed.
Start with the spending side. If the Democrats gain the presidency and Senate, the wealth tax would help fund a phantasmagoria of new mandates, like the Medicare free-for-all and the blingy Green New Deal. The candidates will say most of the revenue would go toward education and infrastructure—both areas in which unions have overwhelming control over employment. C'mon, Liz and Bernie, we're not that dumb.
The revenue side is even worse, as a wealth tax would suck money away from productive investments. Of course liberals in favor of taxation always trot out the tired trope that the poor drive growth by spending their money while the rich hoard it, tossing gold coins in the air in their basement vaults. As the Times put it, wealthy Americans supposedly have "more money than they know what to do with." So just tax the rich and government spending will create great jobs for the poor and middle class.
This couldn't be more wrong. As anyone with $1 billion—or $1,000—knows, people don't stuff their mattresses with Benjamins. They invest them. Sure, you might have some in a checking account that doesn't pay interest; you don't even get a toaster anymore! But if money's in an account, it's being invested.
Maybe it's in a bank making local mortgage loans. Maybe in a money-market account that provides short-term funding to companies and municipalities. Maybe even in corporate or government debt. But most likely it's in stocks or invested directly in job-creating companies that are doing new things and destroying the old.
A wealth tax takes money out of the hands of some of the most productive members of society and directs it toward the least productive uses. Sure, roads and bridges used to be productive—more than half a century ago, when Eisenhower's interstate highway system was built. Education was also a fruitful investment back then, helping build an industrial workforce. But these causes are already funded by existing taxes on gasoline and property. Rather than drawing new revenue, the gaps in funding for infrastructure and education should be narrowed by cutting waste—like ever-growing teacher pensions and layers of administration.
Today the productivity is further up the value chain. To knock down the roadblocks to a more efficient economy, America needs investments in its 5G and fiber-optic networks and enterprise software and artificial intelligence. But wait, there are already people willing to invest in these areas, independent of the government—the same people the wealth taxes target.
So really, with no rational economic use, a wealth tax is big-government punitive class warfare. It's obvious. Ms. Warren rails against Wall Street "looting" and considers private-equity firms "vampires." Mr. Sanders's website keeps a list of his "anti-endorsements," from Jamie Dimon to Andy Puzder—a practical Who's Who of successful job creators.
So what's the right way to tax wealthy people? Robert Hall and Alvin Rabushka proposed a flat tax on income from employment, with no deductions save for a personal allowance. In fact they did it on these pages in 1981. The government would replace all taxes on corporate and personal income with a simple levy on total compensation. The op-ed even showed a postcard-size mock tax form.
The point is that existing taxes on interest, dividends and capital gains discourage the healthy savings that create jobs in the economy. These are effectively taxes on wealth—and we don't need another one.

Texto completo: "Fight for freedom. Stand with Hong Kong."
Daryl Morey, the general manager of the Houston Rockets, tweeted that message on Friday. It's a sentiment that should command broad support in the United States, and throughout the free world.
But the reaction from China, which does not number free expression among its cherished values, was swift and painful for the N.B.A. The shoe company Li Ning and the Shanghai Pudong Development Bank ended sponsorship deals with the Rockets; Chinese broadcasters said they would not show Rockets games; the Chinese Basketball Association — led by the former Rockets star Yao Ming — suspended ties with the team.
"There is no doubt, the economic impact is already clear," said Adam Silver, the league's commissioner.
Silver went on to add that he supported Morey, but "what I am supporting is his freedom of political expression in this situation."
The billionaires who control the lucrative basketball league, however, nearly tripped over themselves in their haste to abjure Morey's remarks. The N.B.A., like many large American businesses, is besotted by the opportunity to make money in China's expanding market. And the league once again made clear it is willing to obey China's rules to preserve that chance.
The owner of the Rockets, Tilman Fertitta, raced for the traditional refuge of international capitalists — the insistence that business can be segregated from political considerations. "We're here to play basketball and not to offend anybody," Fertitta told ESPN.
But it should be perfectly clear that playing basketball in China is political.
Last year, the N.B.A. staged a game in South Africa for the explicit purpose of celebrating the life of Nelson Mandela. When the N.B.A. goes to China, that's a statement, too.
It means that the N.B.A. has weighed China's human rights abuses against China's potential as a source of revenue, and it has decided that it can live with state policies like the detention of hundreds of thousands of Chinese Muslims in the northwestern province of Xinjiang.
The owner of the Brooklyn Nets, the Chinese billionaire Joe Tsai, took the opportunity to publish an open letter scolding Americans for talking about the affairs of other nations. He also mischaracterized the Hong Kong protests as a "separatist movement."
Tsai's suggestion that people should avoid "third rail" issues may well be good manners when visiting a foreign country, but Morey posted his tweet while visiting Japan — and on a website that is not accessible to the general public in mainland China.
The face of the Rockets, the point guard James Harden, issued a public apology on Monday.
"We apologize," he said.
For what, exactly, remained unclear.
Do the N.B.A.'s owners appreciate that their wealth is a product of the freedoms they enjoy in this country? Does Mr. Harden, the owner of a famous beard, know that Muslims in Xinjiang are not allowed to grow beards like his?
The N.B.A. has an undoubted right to set rules for its work force, but it cannot simultaneously claim to champion free expression — the value of which consists entirely in the right to say what others don't want to hear.
American executives and policymakers initially reconciled themselves to following China's rules by arguing that China's turn toward capitalism, and its exposure to the United States, would gradually lead toward democracy and a greater respect for human rights. They argued, in effect, that silence was the most productive form of criticism.
It should now be clear that silence is merely complicity, no more or less.
It is the moral price the N.B.A. and other businesses are paying for making money in China.

Texto completo: APPLETON – While attending Appleton West High School, Brad Smith never imagined he'd work for a big company. He thought he'd be a lawyer, a politician or a diplomat.
"I sometimes joke that, in fact, my job involves all three," Smith told the USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin in a phone interview to promote an upcoming book-release event at Lawrence University.
Now 60, Smith is president of a little outfit — you might have heard of it — called Microsoft.
He's been described by The New York Times as the tech giant's "elder statesman" and "a de facto ambassador for the technology industry at large." He oversees more than 1,400 executive staff in 56 countries, and has testified before Congress.
But it all started, he said, with the lessons and experiences he collected as an idealistic Appleton teenager.
"I've always felt that way," said Smith, a student body president, newspaper editor and school-play pig wrangler at Appleton West, who moved from Racine in eighth grade.
"I always thought of Appleton as my hometown."
Agitating and advocating The teenage Smith took a keen interest in the issues facing Appleton, Wisconsin and the wider world, and he debated everything — who should be president or what state policy should be on the ballot — with his mom, Barbara.
"My younger brother in particular ... would always say, 'Stop arguing with mom!'" he said. "And mother would say, 'We're not arguing. We're debating.'"
He brought that love for policy with him to school at Appleton West, where he was co-editor-in-chief of the newspaper, The Talisman, and student body president in his junior and senior years.
As a sophomore running to become student body president as a junior, Smith's chances seemed slim. His parents were "very, very supportive of everything I did," he said, but they "were really downplaying the whole election," because they didn't want to get his hopes up.
The evening the votes were counted, in spring 1975, Smith stayed out at the YMCA until 8 p.m. When he got home and told his parents he won — "I still remember, I got 61 percent of the vote," he said — they asked why he hadn't called them earlier with the good news.
"And I said, 'Gee I didn't think that you were that interested in the election,'" he said.
Smith was also part of a student-faculty council that included five faculty members and an administrator, working to improve school policies like the way the National Honor Society selected students or who had access to the hallway.
"I was always agitating or advocating for some kind of change in the local high school," he said.
Smith worked three evenings a week at Shopko his junior year, and later at Fleet Farm in the summer after his senior year. There, "I managed to drive a forklift into a ditch," he said, "but happily survived."
During his junior year, he made what he jokes was his "great theatrical debut" as the props director for the play "Li'l Abner."
"My job was to — among other things — drive to a farm near Hortonville and pick up a little piglet and bring it to the high school theater every evening, so it could appear in the play."
'Values that I grew up with' Part of growing up in Appleton, Smith said, was that you could hop on your bike and get anywhere in town.
"Your parents never worried about you," he said. "That was sort of the slice of middle America that Appleton embodied in the 1970s."
He remembers, as an eighth-grader, a summer of pedaling off to catch Appleton Foxes baseball games. In high school, the social scene was the Friday night basketball game and the dance afterward in the Appleton West gym.
If it was warm, you'd end up at Dairy Queen. If it was cold, Burger King.
"Maybe McDonald's, if you wanted diversity and you wanted to go to a third place," he joked. "But that was pretty much the range of places that we would go."
Smith said he's delighted by how much Appleton has grown, with restaurants and retail by the riverfront — which was "not ... a place where people went for anything." And he's happily noticed how much more ethnically and racially diverse it's become.
His parents moved away the summer after he graduated high school, he said, but he gets back about once a year for Microsoft's TechSpark program, which includes job skills training and computer science education in Brown and Outagamie County schools. Microsoft also partnered with the Green Bay Packers for TitletownTech, a startup and tech innovation lab.
And Smith has donated money to the Appleton Education Foundation and a fund for special projects at Appleton West. Part of his donations were used last year to enable the witch to fly in the "Wizard of Oz" musical production by Appleton West and Wilson Middle School.
"There's little things like that that I like to get back and see," he said.
He still keeps in touch, 42 years after graduating, with two of his former teachers at Appleton West: English teacher Vira Stoner and history teacher Thomas Fanning.
He credits Stoner's contemporary composition class for helping him place among the 10 percent of incoming freshmen at Princeton who tested out of the English requirement. And Fanning, who taught Smith constitutional and diplomatic history and was co-executive secretary of the student-faculty council Smith's senior year, "really encouraged all of us to think very broadly about what was going on around the world and learn from history," Smith said.
Stoner recalled to USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin that Smith was a force within the student body, "immediately very successful" in student government and debate club.
Fanning described Smith as intellectually curious and "very much student-minded, as far as the rights of students," he said.
"I taught for 32 years. Over a lifetime of teaching, you're blessed when you have students that just stand out," he said.
Smith's ongoing support of Appleton is "a small repayment on such a large debt," Smith said, to the place where he was exposed to the idea that you could accomplish anything if you were ethically grounded and worked hard enough.
"When I think of Midwestern values the way I was exposed to them in Appleton, I think of being friendly and outgoing. I think about being honest above all else. I think about showing respect for other people. I think of being plainspoken. And I think you find those values in other places too, but they are all values — those were the values that I grew up with."
'Tools and Weapons' Although Smith might have never imagined himself working for one of the most valuable companies in the world by stock market value, his life at Microsoft isn't too far from what he dreamed of as a kid: lawyer, politician or diplomat.
He quite literally is a lawyer, serving as Microsoft's chief legal officer, in addition to being president, since his appointment by CEO Satya Nadella in September 2015.
And Smith also travels around the world as a kind of politician or diplomat for Microsoft on the world stage, like attending the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, or meeting with government leaders to advocate for changes or defend Microsoft.
Smith recounts those experiences as a lawyer, politician and diplomat in the book he co-authored with Microsoft Director of Executive Communications Carol Ann Browne, "Tools and Weapons."
It's about the tech industry's responsibility to make sure technology like social media and AI is regulated and fostered to benefit people, instead of just pursuing growth at all costs.
Each chapter is rooted in a story — not just stories from Smith and Browne's advocacy around the world, but from history, as well.
"I think I learned at a relatively young age that people don't necessarily like to listen to a lecture but they love to listen to a story," Smith said. "I think this is something I learned in school. I think it's something that I learned going to church as a teenager. You could just watch the reactions of people around you, and you could see when people would sit up straight, perk up, and actually follow what you're saying."
You can see Smith speak about "Tools and Weapons" at the Lawrence University Music-Drama Center, 420 E. College Ave., from 9 to 10 a.m. Friday. Admission is free.

A trendy term, 'inflection point' seeing resurgence

Texto completo: When it comes to the use - and overuse - of "inflection point," we're clearly at an inflection point.
"Cellphones were a significant inflection point. They made it possible for us to be available at virtually any moment," wrote Jeff Giles in the New York Times last July.
"With the Raiders moving to Las Vegas next season, this year is an inflection point," wrote sports reporter Mitchell Gladstone on S.I.com last August.
"If we're at an inflection point in climate policy, then this issue of tailpipe emissions . . . is the game-changer," California Gov. Gavin Newsom told The New Yorker last month.
Most people seem to be using the term as a synonym for "turning point" or "tipping point" - a point of significant change. But where did this trendy term originate?
The noun "inflection," derived from the Latin "flexere" (to bend), entered English in the 1530s with the meaning "the act or result of curving or bending." Two hundred years later the term "inflection point" emerged in the field of differential calculus meaning "a point on a continuous curve at which a change in the direction of curvature occurs."
Say what?
Picture a roller coaster car descending a steep slope as it heads toward an upcoming steep ascent. The inflection point on the descending car's curve is not, as you might expect, the point at the bottom where it starts to ascend.
Instead, it's located halfway down the slope when its angle of descent starts to decrease as it approaches the upward slope. The roller coaster car is still descending; it's just not descending as steeply.
So the original mathematical term refers, not to a point of dramatic turnaround, but instead to the point where the angle or rate of descent or ascent on an arc starts to change.
Appropriately enough, the popularity of "inflection point" has been on a roller coaster. A google ngram search reveals that its use surged from 1920 to the early 1960s, perhaps propelled by references to parabolic trajectories in the growing fields of rocketry and space exploration. But its frequency faded during the 1990s and 2000s, only to rise again as its metaphoric use increased during the past few years.
Because "inflection point" denotes the beginning of change rather than a sudden or complete change, some mathematicians cringe when they hear "inflection" point used as a synonym for "turning point" or "tipping point."
But let's face it. "Inflection point" sounds cerebral, sophisticated and cool. Brace yourself for an "inflection" affliction.

Texto completo: The composer broke out with his touching musical "Ordinary Days." He's back with his biggest show yet, the '70s-set tale of a treacherous burger cook with more than a resemblance to Macbeth.
Ten years ago, the composer Adam Gwon emerged.
Roundabout Underground, a new venue for young writers, had chosen Mr. Gwon's "Ordinary Days," a four-character chamber piece about adrift New Yorkers, as its first musical. The New York Times called him "a promising newcomer to our talent-hungry musical theater." Goodbye chrysalis, hello butterfly.
Professional and amateur companies clamored for the rights, Audra McDonald added the musical's song "I'll Be Here" to her repertory, saying that it had "grabbed my heart, ripped it out and showed it to me bleeding in front of my face." Commissions kept coming. New York's talent-hungry musical theater slavered for a follow-up. No follow-up came.
Mr. Gwon, 39, who lives with his boyfriend, the actor John Wascavage, in an apartment in Sunnyside, Queens, never went anywhere. Or to put it another way, he went everywhere. He wrote half a dozen new musicals ("The Boy Detective Fails," "Cloudlands," and "Cake Off," among others) and saw most of them staged at regional theaters, though they didn't attract many subsequent productions. Former colleagues made it to Broadway or near enough. He didn't. He was pretty sure he didn't mind.
"All of those people illustrate that it's possible," he said.
That seemed so healthy. I asked him if he went to therapy. He tried it, he said. But he didn't like it. "Writing is my therapy," he explained.
Mr. Gwon was speaking on a recent weekday afternoon in a lounge at the Roundabout's Laura Pels Theater. His drab shirt and crinkled jeans matched the tattered couch. Like his songs, he is funny, urbane, with a sweetness that doesn't cloy. He has a fizzy, artless laugh and a maximal smile that makes him look like a kid who has somehow grown a beard.
He was in previews for "Scotland, PA," a bleak and lusty musical comedy about the perils of ambition, which opens at the Pels on Oct. 23. It's the most ambitious show of his career.
Raised in Baltimore, he started writing musicals almost accidentally, when an acting teacher at New York University heard him messing around at the piano and suggested that his talents might lie there. After college, he spent a few years working as an assistant in Roundabout's development office (his first day of work: Sept. 11, 2001) and won a Dramatists Guild Fellowship that allowed him to study with the "Ragtime" writers Lynn Ahrens and Stephen Flaherty.
Ms. Ahrens was impressed, she wrote in an email, with "his incredible melodic gift and his great technique. It was coupled with some of the most honest, droll and touching lyrics I had heard in a long time."
During that fellowship he began "Ordinary Days," the show that set a template for his next several projects. He sometimes thought about trying something grander, something that would get him back to New York. (It's not the only place to make a career as a musical theater composer, but if you're hoping to make a living on rights and royalties, it helps.)
But commissions kept him afloat and "every month that went by that I could pay my rent because I was writing musicals was exciting to me," he said, apologizing for how "incredibly cheesy" that sounded.
Five years ago, Mr. Gwon decided that he should fulfill his Roundabout commission, which he had accepted during "Ordinary Days." He speed-dated potential book writers, including the playwright Michael Mitnick, who pitched him an adaptation of the 2001 cult film "Scotland, PA." A black comedy riff on "Macbeth," with a side of fries, it tells the story of Mac, a 1970s fast-food worker, and his ruthless wife, Pat.
After a decade mired at minimum wage, Mac meets three stoners who predict a glorious future for him. He and Pat murder their boss and take over his burger joint. Success? He's lovin' it. Until tragedy places an order.
Something in Mr. Gwon's gut insisted that this was a story he needed to tell. The premise was clever, the plot juicy, the '70s setting inviting to a classic rock fan like him. But that wasn't it. A week ago, watching a preview, he finally figured out the pull. "Oh my gosh," he realized, "this is about characters who are stuck in one place and how are they going to climb up to the next level." That is his story, too.
"I've been very happy and felt very successful," he said. "At the same time, there might be three stoner voices in my head saying, 'Hey, you're doing great, but Broadway's right there. What are you going to do about it?' And I think it is a question, and a struggle that I don't necessarily have an answer to, other than to write a rock musical about it."
I asked Mr. Gwon, whom several colleagues described as the nicest man they have ever met, if he had ever considered murdering his rivals as an option. He laughed. He didn't say no.
He conceived "Scotland, PA," he said, as an opportunity to "show the New York theater community that I could do something on a bigger scale." But during previews he worried that maybe he went too far.
"There's a fear that I put something bigger and bolder out there, and everyone goes, 'Why don't you keep writing the quiet little musicals in the basement?"' he said. He was afraid enough that throughout our conversation he would only refer to "Macbeth" as the Scottish play.
The "Scotland, PA" songs are mostly '70s pastiche, groovier, rootsier, more rockish tunes than the American-songbook-inspired numbers of "Ordinary Days." Which makes Mr. Gwon's style difficult to pin down.
The director Lonny Price, who helped to develop "Scotland, PA," put it this way: "When you listen to an Adam song in a score, you think, 'Oh, that's a lovely song,' but you don't think, 'God what a genius.' He's serving the piece. He gets out of the way, he gives it to you and he allows the performer to shine."
Mr. Price called his music "catchy in a good way." Todd Haimes, the artistic director of the Roundabout, described it as commercial, then walked that back. "His music is just enjoyable," he said.
"He knows what he does best, and he's doing it," Ms. Ahrens told me. "The world will catch up."
Mr. Gwon isn't sure it when. It might take another 10 years. Or more. He hopes not, but he can imagine it, his hair a little grayer, his eyes a little worse, probably still drinking his usual skinny vanilla latte. For now, his ambitions are modest, not homicidal.
"I plan to just keep myself busy writing musicals," he said. "That seems to be the thing that gets me through."

Texto completo: The Nubians of ancient Sudan left behind artwork as fine as the Egyptians'. Now it's on view at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston.
Art: The Glory of the Nubians
Through Jan. 20; mfa.org .
South of Egypt, in what is what is now the Sudanese Nile Valley, lay the ancient kingdom of Nubia, a cultural rival and one-time conqueror of the pharaohs. World renowned for their gold, fine jewelry, and extensive trading networks, the Nubians left behind cities and statuary as fine as those of the Egyptians -- but not nearly as much writing.
In part because of this absence of testimony, Nubia hasn't gotten its due in the American imagination. But the Museum of Fine Arts Boston has the largest collection of Nubian artifacts outside of Khartoum, and with the overwhelming esthetic wealth of "Ancient Nubia Now," it's starting to set the record straight.

Film: Church and Sexual Abuse, This Time in France
Oct. 18.
In 2014, Alexandre Dussot-Hezez, a 40-year-old Frenchman and devout Roman Catholic, discovered that the Rev. Bernard Preynat, the priest who had sexually abused him as a boy, was still working with children. Horrified, he wrote to the Diocese of Lyon and was brought face to face with his attacker, who did not deny his actions and acknowledged molesting others -- and eventually revealed that the church's hierarchy knew about his pedophilia.
In "By the Grace of God," the director François Ozon ("Swimming Pool") reportedly worked in secret to create a kind of French "Spotlight," the Oscar winner about the Boston archdiocese's cover-up of sexual abuse. Melvil Poupaud, Denis Ménochet and Swann Arlaud portray three of the real-life victims, now adults, eager to expose the complicity of both the church and their loved ones, and to salve the wounds that have, to varying degrees, hurt their lives.
In July, after the film's release in France, a church tribunal defrocked Preynat, finding him guilty of the sexual abuse of minors. He will face trial in a French court next year.
"By the Grace of God" opens on Oct. 18 in New York and on Oct. 25 in Los Angeles. KATHRYN SHATTUCK
Classical Music: 'Viola Visions' in Miami Beach
Oct. 15-19; nws.edu.
The brunt of many classical music in-jokes, the viola has long been relegated to second-class citizen of the string section. That might change this week, when the instrument's fans will descend on Miami Beach for "Viola Visions," a five-day festival sponsored by the New World Symphony and the conductor Michael Tilson Thomas.
Along with master classes led by undersung stars -- such as the soloist Kim Kashkashian and the New York Philharmonic principal player Cynthia Phelps -- chamber and orchestral concerts highlight instrument's range, from Jennifer Higdon's serene viola concerto to Nico Muhly's rapturous "Keep in Touch." Must-sees include the premiere of Steven Mackey's reimagining of Berlioz's "Harold in Italy," and a rendition of Andrew Norman's frenetic "Gran Turismo" performed by eight violists at once.

Dance: The Audience Is the Work
Oct. 16-20; newyorklivearts.org.
Over the past few years, the choreographer Yanira Castro has been looking closely at what constitutes live performance, as if pausing to ask, "What is this thing we call theater?" In her trilogy "Cast/Stage/Author," she examined the process of casting performers, the mechanical trappings of the stage and the question of who authors a work, taking apart familiar structures and protocols to see them in a new light.
With her latest project, at New York Live Arts in Manhattan's Chelsea neighborhood, she turns her attention to another vital component of performance: the viewer. In "Last Audience," the cast is every person in attendance. Guided by a set of scores that change each night, the unpredictable work explores themes of agency and democracy as well as the relationship between the individual and the collective. The event is free, and in the spirit of building community, each performance begins with a public meal, featuring stories, poetry, food and dance from guest artists. SIOBHAN BURKE
Theater: 'Forbidden Broadway' Snarks Again
Through Nov. 30, forbiddenbroadway.com .
Savvy enough for theater obsessives, but not so esoteric that casual fans feel left out. That's the tricky goal that Gerard Alessandrini sets for himself in his spoofing tribute-takedown show, "Forbidden Broadway," which arrives in its latest incarnation (subtitled "The Next Generation!") after a five-year absence from the stage.
Giddily affectionate one moment, gleefully savage the next, it's like a comedy roast set to music. On the tiny proscenium stage of the Triad Theater on Manhattan's Upper West Side, a cast of five sends up Broadway hits including "Moulin Rouge" and "Oklahoma!"; tweaks the Yiddish-language "Fiddler on the Roof" Off Broadway; then dances into T.V. territory for "Fosse/Verdon." Or it did at the preview I saw. But "Forbidden Broadway" follows the merciless out-of-town-tryout model of show-shaping: If a number doesn't work, it's out. In the lead-up to opening night, which is Wednesday, Oct. 16, everything's in flux. LAURA COLLINS-HUGHES

Pop: Vagabon in Brooklyn
Oct. 15; eventbrite.com .
Once you've heard Laetitia Tamko sing, you would know her voice anywhere. Booming, warbly, delicate and throaty in various combinations, it's one of the most distinctive sounds in indie rock today. As Vagabon, Tamko -- a former computer engineer -- made a minor splash in 2017 with "Infinite Worlds," a collection of guitar-forward songs that parse ideas of home, community and self-image. Later this week, she'll deliver her self-titled sophomore album, which operates in a similar thematic space but explores new sonic territory.
Tamko wrote "Vagabon" while touring and produced it entirely on her own. In doing so, she backed away from conventional rock instrumentation and embraced new digital textures. The results, as heard on the album's lead single, "Flood," are lusher than Tamko's previous work, but retain much of its tenderness and intimacy. Expect Tamko to play this song, and others from the record, during her Tuesday performance at Brooklyn's National Sawdust. OLIVIA HORNE

TV: Romance for Everyone in 'Modern Love'
Oct. 18; amazon.com .
Even the most hardened cynics have surely found something to soften their hearts since the unveiling of The New York Times's "Modern Love" column 15 years ago. And now Amazon Prime Video has brought eight of those essays on navigating the tangled web of contemporary relationships -- and living to tell the tale, or not -- to the screen.
The lineup, debuting Oct. 18, includes four episodes directed by John Carney ("Once") and starring Cristin Milioti as a single Brooklynite whose personal life is monitored a little too closely by her doorman (Laurentiu Possa); Catherine Keener as a journalist who helps a dating-site tech mogul (Dev Patel) rekindle a lost love; Anne Hathaway as a lawyer whose bipolar disorder derails her every attempt at romance; and Andrew Scott and Brandon Kyle Goodman as a couple struggling to adopt the baby of a free spirit (Olivia Cooke). And Tina Fey and John Slattery team up as old marrieds waging war against their festering troubles on the tennis court in a tale directed by Sharon Horgan ("Catastrophe"). KATHRYN SHATTUCK

Showing Support, Trump Talks to Giuliani Over Lunch

Texto completo: The president's multiple shows of support for his personal lawyer on Saturday seemed meant to tamp down questions about Mr. Giuliani's standing.
WASHINGTON -- President Trump had lunch on Saturday with Rudolph W. Giuliani amid revelations that prosecutors were investigating Mr. Giuliani for possible lobbying violations, and speculation that his position as the president's personal lawyer was in jeopardy.
The lunch, at Mr. Trump's golf course in Sterling, Va., was among several shows of the president's support for Mr. Giuliani on Saturday. They seemed meant to tamp down questions about Mr. Giuliani's status with a client famous for distancing himself from advisers when they encounter legal problems of their own.
Mr. Trump, during a Saturday night appearance on Fox News, called Mr. Giuliani "a great gentleman" and said he is still his lawyer. "I know nothing about him being under investigation. I can't imagine it," he told the host Jeanine Pirro.
Before the lunch, Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Trump spoke on the phone, according to two people familiar with the discussions. Also beforehand, Mr. Trump praised Mr. Giuliani on Twitter as a "legendary 'crime buster' and greatest Mayor in the history of NYC."
Mr. Giuliani "may seem a little rough around the edges sometimes, but he is also a great guy and wonderful lawyer," the president's tweet continued.
And Mr. Trump dismissed the investigation into Mr. Giuliani as a "a one sided Witch Hunt" carried out by the "Deep State."
The president echoed language he had used to minimize the special counsel's investigation into whether he or his campaign worked with Russians who interfered in the 2016 election to try to help him win the presidency.
Mr. Giuliani, a former federal prosecutor and New York mayor, was retained last year to help defend the president in the special counsel's investigation.
But his efforts to undermine the investigation's origins and its conclusions helped lead Mr. Trump into an impeachment inquiry. The inquiry focuses on whether Mr. Trump, with assistance from Mr. Giuliani, abused the presidency to pressure Ukraine to pursue investigations for his political benefit, including into whether Ukrainians played a role in spurring the inquiry of the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III.
Federal prosecutors in Manhattan are now investigating whether Mr. Giuliani's efforts in Ukraine may have run afoul of the Foreign Agents Registration Act, or FARA, The New York Times reported on Friday.
Mr. Giuliani has defended his work in Ukraine and said it did not require him to register under FARA.
Mr. Trump was not enamored with the negative publicity around Mr. Giuliani, people close to the president said, but he remains loyal because of his lawyer's willingness to aggressively defend him during the special counsel's inquiry.
It is not clear what was discussed at the lunch.
The lunch is unlikely to end speculation over whether the president will ultimately consider Mr. Giuliani a liability. Another of Mr. Trump's personal lawyers, Michael D. Cohen, met privately with the president in Florida in March 2018, a month before the F.B.I. searched his home, hotel room and office. Mr. Trump publicly embraced Mr. Cohen, until it became clear he might speak against the president.
A White House spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Asked over text message about the significance of the lunch, Mr. Giuliani directed a reporter to Mr. Trump's show of support on Twitter.
He said his relationship with Mr. Trump was "the same as ever," but declined to answer additional questions, explaining he was watching the New York Yankees' playoff baseball game against the Houston Astros.
The two people familiar with the discussions between Mr. Trump and Mr. Giuliani said they believed it would be difficult to prove that Mr. Giuliani violated FARA.
The law requires American citizens to disclose to the Justice Department any contacts with the government or media in the United States at the direction or request of foreign politicians or government officials, regardless of whether they paid for the representation.
Mr. Giuliani has acknowledged that he and two of his associates, who were arrested on campaign finance charges on Wednesday, worked with Ukrainian prosecutors to collect potentially damaging information about targets of Mr. Trump and his allies, including a former American ambassador to Ukraine and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his younger son, Hunter Biden.
Mr. Giuliani shared that material this year with American government officials and a Trump-friendly columnist in an effort to undermine the ambassador and other Trump targets.
But Mr. Giuliani said that he had undertaken that work on behalf of Mr. Trump, not the Ukrainian prosecutors. He said he had in fact turned down an offer to represent one of the prosecutors because it would have posed a conflict with his work for the president.
What concerns some of Mr. Trump's advisers more than a possible FARA prosecution related to his Ukraine work is that Mr. Giuliani, who has been representing the president pro bono, is facing a contentious and potentially costly divorce from his third wife, Judith Nathan, and that he may have taken on clients overseas who could be problematic for him with prosecutors.
While Mr. Trump has been reluctant to separate from Mr. Giuliani, some of his advisers hope he will. They remain concerned about Mr. Giuliani's public commentary about the president and the Ukraine issue.
Kenneth P. Vogel reported from Washington, and Maggie Haberman from New York. Annie Karni contributed reporting from Washington.

As the N.B.A. Season Approaches, All Eyes Turn to China

Texto completo: Games that count are days away, but the political and financial fallout of a preseason clash with China threatens to reshape the league's future.
Want more basketball in your inbox? Sign up for Marc Stein's weekly N.B.A. newsletter here .
This embryonic N.B.A. season has already given us Trae Young dribbling through J.J. Redick's legs, Ben Simmons swishing a 3-pointer as if he always makes them and Zion Williamson rumbling for 29 points in his second pro game -- with only one miss in 13 shots.
The problem with preseason basketball, of course, is that none of it actually counts. The problem with this preseason, in particular, is that the tension and chaos emanating from China all week very much counts.
It won't show up anywhere in the standings once the N.B.A.'s highly anticipated regular season begins Oct. 22, but the fallout from the league's sudden conflict with its second-most important market is sure to linger. The pros and cons of doing business in China are a matter of public debate like never before, with cultural, political and potential multimillion-dollar financial implications and far too much heft to fade as quickly as gaudy preseason statistics.
Perhaps under different circumstances, a Twitter post supporting Hong Kong's pro-democracy protesters wouldn't have sparked such fury. But the message from the Houston Rockets general manager, Daryl Morey, to "fight for freedom" and "stand with Hong Kong" landed amid the animus of a monthslong trade war between the United States and China. Morey also decided to press send right before the Brooklyn Nets, the Los Angeles Lakers and a cadre of league officials, led by Commissioner Adam Silver, headed to China for the league's annual exhibition series there.
An extensive sponsor and media boycott of the Rockets soon spiraled. China's punitive response could cost the Rockets around $ 25 million in sponsorship losses this season, according to one person with knowledge of the situation who was not authorized to discuss it publicly. It didn't take long for a number of rival teams to start besieging the league for estimates of how much they stand to lose, too. Yahoo Sports reported Wednesday that at least five unnamed teams fear that the $ 116 million salary cap projected for the 2020-21 season could drop by as much as 10 to 15 percent.
The league, hopeful as it is that the conflict is indeed thawing, understands all too well how fragile its relations with China are after nearly 40 years of harmony. That was evident on Thursday, when local officials let the Lakers and the Nets play an exhibition in Shanghai -- but only after scrubbing all Chinese sponsors from the event and removing the broadcast from state-run television.
The Rockets, largely because of Yao Ming, were essentially China's team throughout the Hall of Fame center's career. Various factions in China, in response to Morey's tweet, initially sought two conciliatory gestures they appear increasingly unlikely to get: a public apology from Silver and/or Morey's ouster (or resignation).
Yet there were some signs, leading into the Nets-Lakers rematch on Saturday in Shenzhen, that outrage from the Chinese government had begun to soften. The Chinese authorities, typically relentless in coercing American businesses to publicly apologize in such disputes, no longer appear quite so determined to make the N.B.A. grovel and squirm in fear of losing what has been conservatively estimated at $ 500 million in annual revenue.
As The New York Times' Keith Bradsher and Javier C. Hernandez reported Thursday, government officials in China had begun to "tamp down public anger" aimed at the N.B.A. "after three days of fanning nationalistic outrage." Chinese officials apparently fear that too much rhetoric could damage the country's image ahead of the 2022 Winter Olympics outside Beijing. The dispute has spread awareness in the United States of the ongoing Hong Kong protests; one player on the China tour who requested anonymity estimated that "90 percent of the league didn't even know what was going on a week ago."
The whole league is aware now. But deciding how to handle questions about China is merely one matter for players to contemplate.
While front offices fret over potential lost revenue, star players inevitably wonder how the N.B.A.'s fraught relationship with China will affect shoe sales and promotional summer tours there that the likes of Stephen Curry (Under Armour), LeBron James (Nike) and James Harden (Adidas) are known to make. Curry said that he was not yet sure, after six consecutive off-season trips, how soon he will return -- while further uncertainty surrounded the handful of players who endorse Chinese shoe manufacturers.
That group includes Curry's teammate Klay Thompson, who earns an estimated $ 9 million per season from the Chinese brand Anta. Several players command between $ 2 million and $ 10 million annually from Chinese companies such as Anta, Li-Ning and Peak, according to two people familiar with shoe contract negotiations who were not authorized to discuss them publicly.
"The presumption that there's been an immediate loss -- I think that number is much lower than the crazy numbers that have been thrown around," said Rick Burton, a professor of sports management at Syracuse University's Falk College. "The fact that a preseason game was pulled from being on air in China, or the fact that some sponsors have temporarily pulled out, I think that amount is relatively small. The bigger question is what's the long-term ripple effect here."
How soon Chinese media outlets will resume their blanket (and lucrative) coverage of the league is a primary issue diverting attention from on-court matters. Discourse about widespread silence in a league that prides itself on its social activism and awareness is another.
Curry and Warriors Coach Steve Kerr are among the high-profile N.B.A. personalities who have absorbed considerable domestic criticism for curbing their usual willingness to speak out on social issues -- prompting cries that they are doing so to avoid further damage to the league's business interests.
The National Basketball Players Association has likewise opted for silence since the controversy unspooled. Notably quiet are the shoe company giants Nike and Adidas, who rely on robust sales in China for a healthy chunk of revenue.
"Our presence in China is a different conversation than Coach talking about gun violence or gender equality or things that for us are being spokespeople for people who can't speak for themselves," Curry said when asked about Kerr's reluctance to discuss the China controversy in depth. "Within our communities, that makes a huge impact.
"This situation has a huge weight and gravity to it and so many things that need to be sorted out, but I just don't know enough about Chinese history and how that's influenced modern society enough to speak on it. That's where we're at today. I'm sure this is not going away, so we'll come back to it."
Burton, more than most, may understand the complicated factors at play, and the diplomatic needle Silver is trying to thread. Burton was the commissioner of Australia's National Basketball League for four years and the chief marketing officer for the U.S. Olympic Committee at the 2008 Summer Games in Beijing.
"Somebody at the highest levels of the Chinese government is angry with the N.B.A., so this is not like dealing with an owner, where you've got to deal with Mark Cuban or Steve Ballmer," Burton said. "This is having to figure out: 'Can I reach the people in charge of the country and assure them that this will never happen again?"'
These are the sorts of questions suddenly smothering this league. Opening night is less than two weeks away, but Simmons's quest for his first official N.B.A. 3-pointer and the Zion phenomenon are not yet primary sources of curiosity. Neither is the most wide-open championship chase in years -- not even after the wildest off-season of roster upheaval ever.
As close as we are to the games that do count, geopolitical questions dominate the floor.

Texto completo: We've got trade wars, spectacular start-ups, scandals, and mad, stomach-churning swings in the stock market.
Do you feel the excitement?
It's almost like the good old days -- the kind of heart-pounding financial ride that led to the dot-com crash of early 2000 and, yet again, to the calamitous economy of the mid-2000s.
Everybody needs a distraction from the unending hellscape that is the news from Washington. I recommend the business world: For that vertiginous feeling of riding a roller coaster, the stock market is better than ever.
Companies that combine technology, convenience and bewitching backstories have been shouldering their way to fame. These are the fabled "unicorns" -- the tech start-ups that investment firms pumped up to a valuation of a billion dollars or more.
Lately, though, some of the unicorns look more like dogs. They don't earn profits but have a knack for making headlines.
Take WeWork, a company that, basically, leases office space, and loses a lot of money doing it. That's not very glamorous, in itself. Yet that dull-sounding business became "disruptive," in Silicon Valley jargon.
The most disruptive thing about it may have been the antics of its hard-partying co-founder, Adam Neumann. As The Wall Street Journal reported, Mr. Neumann transported marijuana stuffed in a cereal box across international boundaries in a private jet.
What is the WeWork business plan, anyway? They basically offer open office space, Wi-Fi and coffee. They invented ... Starbucks?
I'm writing this in a Starbucks, which didn't need pot-stuffed cereal boxes to prosper. Though who knows? Something convinced Howard Schultz, the former Starbucks chief, that he should run for president.
But this isn't about politics. Business is diverting enough.
The mess at WeWork continues to simmer. Mr. Neumann stepped down as chief executive in September, but the company has had to put off its initial public offering of stock, and it continues to lose enormous sums of money.
I can hardly wait to read the book about WeWork, once somebody writes it. Disruptive companies make great reads. "Super Pumped," the new book about Uber, the ride hailing giant, written by my colleague Mike Isaac, has become one of my favorites. He described Uber's corporate excesses, including a private multimillion dollar Las Vegas party featuring the superstar Beyoncé, as well as numerous incidents of lawbreaking and a toxic culture for women.
Uber bid its founder, Travis Kalanick, goodbye as chief executive in 2017 (he remains on the board of directors), and it has been on a more stable management footing. But the company continues to be a money loser. In August, it posted a quarterly loss of $ 5.2 billion.
For a terrific read about a company that flew high, then crashed and burned in scandal, don't miss "Bad Blood" by John Carreyrou. It is about Theranos, the blood test company, a stock market wonder not so long ago, and now, an example of enormous fraud.
Books like these have found a proud place on my virtual bookshelf (I'm an audiobook guy), and provide wholesome diversion from the political news.
There is one major problem, though: This kind of excitement makes for riveting entertainment, but it isn't necessarily what you want in an investment portfolio. Going over Niagara Falls in a barrel is exhilarating. Compound interest is not, yet it is more likely to float you safely to retirement.
I'll concede that a conservative approach isn't for everyone. A handful of companies make it colossally big while taking outsize risks, and some investment firms -- and individuals -- get rich when these companies turn out to be world beaters.
The Japanese giant SoftBank, for example, invests regularly in highly disruptive start-ups. It made a fortune as an early investor in Alibaba, the Chinese internet company. SoftBank has funneled enormous amounts of money to Uber and WeWork, investments that have suffered lately.
Investing genius turns up in unexpected places. The punk rock legend Iggy Pop recently told The New Yorker that he credits his independence from the whims of the music industry to an early investment in Apple stock.
The singer-songwriter, who gave us gems like "Lust for Life," had so many wildly self-destructive moments onstage -- slashing his chest with glass, throwing himself into the audience, stripping, vomiting on cue -- that he has made even the wildest C.E.O.s look like sleepy Florida retirees. But as an investor, apparently, Mr. Pop is a sober, risk-averse, calculating machine.
Picking individual stocks is iffy. I know for a fact that I'm no Warren Buffett or Iggy Pop. At times like these -- that political hellscape is impossible to disregard entirely -- it seems wise to play it safe, and park your money where the smart advisers tell you to: in low-fee index funds that track the broad stock market.
If you're worried (and what rational person isn't?), you can buffer your portfolio with conservative choices, bulking up on funds with bonds and money-market securities. I have to admit that when my own future is involved, I am fully committed to being boring. Boring is the new sexy.
(It pains me to admit that this argument got me nowhere when it came to high school and dating.)
While I've taken risks for work, I am not a fan of thrills for their own sake. Once, I waited more than an hour with my son for a ride on one of Six Flags' roller coasters in New Jersey. When it was finally our turn, we slipped into the seats, but at the last moment, I hopped back out. "See you in three minutes, Sammy," I said. I enjoyed his enjoyment. But I did not want to throw up.
I still don't. I'm no Iggy Pop.
Making other people sick to their stomachs is more my style. I'd love to start a company so disruptive that nobody understands what is. Scott Galloway, a marketing professor at New York University, calls the language of visionary start-ups "yoga babble," explaining to my colleague David Gelles: "It's as if my yoga instructor went into investor relations."
Ka-ching! If I can come up with an idea that is nutty enough, I might even be able to get SoftBank to put money into it.
Beyond these pipe dreams, my own money is safely stashed away. But, Mr. Pop, if you want to give me some investing advice, I'm listening.

Texto completo: The performers were removed from this weekend's Rolling Loud festival at Citi Field after the N.Y.P.D. said they had "been affiliated with recent acts of violence citywide."
Five rappers with New York roots were removed from the local edition of the traveling hip-hop festival Rolling Loud, scheduled for this weekend in Queens, at the behest of the New York Police Department, representatives for the concert said on Saturday.
The move came after Martin Morales, an assistant chief at the Police Department, sent the festival organizers a letter on Wednesday requesting the removal of five artists -- 22Gz, Casanova, Pop Smoke, Sheff G and Don Q -- citing safety concerns.
The performers, who were among several dozen scheduled to join blockbuster acts like Travis Scott, Wu-Tang Clan and Meek Mill at Citi Field, "have been affiliated with recent acts of violence citywide," the department said in its letter. "The New York City Police Department believes if these individuals are allowed to perform, there will be a higher risk of violence."
Rolling Loud confirmed receipt of the letter and said that the artists had been taken off the lineup. The festival declined to comment further.
Representatives for Casanova, Don Q, Sheff G and Pop Smoke confirmed they had been removed from the bill. 22Gz could not immediately be reached for comment.
Each of the artists cited by the Police Department has had encounters with law enforcement.
Casanova, who served prison time in New York on a robbery charge, was recently named in federal testimony by the rapper 6ix9ine, who described a shooting between the artists' rival crews and named both groups as members of the Bloods gang. 22Gz was charged with murder in Florida in 2017, but the charges were dropped after police identified another man as the gunman. Sheff G, Don Q and Pop Smoke have each faced weapons charges.
In a statement on Instagram, Don Q blamed "misinformation" from the Police Department. "I love my city and I never been in any gang activities or had issues at any of my previous shows," he wrote. "I hope the city will wake up and see that canceling me and my fellow NY artists isn't the solution, we just love what we do and want to perform for our fans." Casanova added in the comments that the decision "really hurts."
Tariq Cherif, a founder and owner of Rolling Loud, suggested in a message on Twitter that the festival, which requires city permits, would not be allowed to return to New York City if it did not go along with the police request.
Mr. Cherif also wrote that the canceled artists would be paid their full booking fees and invited to perform at future iterations of the festival.
The police department did not immediately respond to questions about its request to remove the artists.
Rolling Loud events have been connected to arrests and violence in the past. Earlier this year in Miami, shootings during the weekend of the festival left two people dead and four wounded, The Associated Press reported. That included an incident in which the artist YoungBoy Never Broke Again (or NBA Youngboy) and his entourage were targeted in a shooting outside of a hotel that left the rapper's girlfriend and a 5-year-old bystander wounded. A 43-year-old man was killed by crossfire. The rapper Kodak Black was also arrested at the festival on weapons charges.
Some artists have also balked at the security attached to the festival. Lil Wayne, a scheduled headliner at the Miami event, declined to perform after being subjected to a search. "The Festival Police (not Rolling Loud) made it mandatory that I had to be policed and checked to get on the stadium grounds," he wrote on Twitter. "I do not and will not ever settle for being policed to do my job."
Rappers in New York have long complained about being targeted by law enforcement at their concerts and elsewhere. Over the years, extensive New York Police Department dossiers on rap acts have been made public, while the department has acknowledged tracking the local music scene for potential criminal activity. "You really have to listen to the songs because they're talking about ongoing violence," one anti-gang officer told The New York Times in 2014. Jon Caramanica contributed reporting.

Mike Pence

Texto completo: In the very unlikely event that the impeachment inquiry underway in the House leads to President Trump's removal from office by the Senate, Vice President Pence would ascend to the Oval Office. Pence remains one of the least-understood figures of the Trump administration - even as he quietly lays the groundwork for his own future presidential bid. Pence has long been a master at stealth campaigning. Here are five myths that have helped enshroud him.
Myth No. 1 He's a theocratic ideologue. Pence has called himself "a Christian, a conservative and a Republican - in that order" since his radio show started to take off a quarter-century ago. That, in conjunction with his ardent and persistent focus on issues like abortion and same-sex marriage, has led some detractors to dub him a theocrat: someone who lets religion dictate his decision-making.
But his most reliable political dogma isn't about God; it's about winning - and the latter trumps the former. In 2011, when he returned to Indiana for his successful race for governor, he dropped his image as a Washington culture warrior and tea party ally and pitched himself as the continuation of then-Gov. Mitch Daniels, a technocratic Republican who eschewed hot-button social battles, at least in public. Four years later, when critics painted Pence as the national face of anti-gay bigotry after he signed a law allowing businesses to cite religious objections to discriminate against LGBTQ customers, he faced a decision. Moderates and business leaders wanted him to veto the bill for fear it would crush Indiana's nascent tech economy. Pence stood firmly with his Christian-right supporters - until Republican billionaire and megadonor Paul Singer phoned Pence and threatened to withhold financial support unless he backed down. Pence's team had been courting Singer (who would go on to bankroll Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida in the 2016 GOP presidential primaries) for five years. Faced with the prospect of losing a huge cash boost in the future, the governor reversed himself and supported a "fix" that explained that the state would not allow discrimination. The fix passed, and he signed it into law.
Myth No. 2 He's the shadow president (or a glorified coat rack). Some Pence observers suspect that he secretly controls vast swaths of the administration. A Politico article this year argued that he essentially runs an entire agency, the Department of Health and Human Services, staffed to the brim with powerful Hoosiers. Newt Gingrich called Pence, early in the administration, more influential than senior aides like Jared Kushner (the president's son-in-law) and then-economic adviser Gary Cohn. Or there's the opposite caricature: According to Bob Woodward's recent book, Cohn wanted Pence to oppose tariffs pushed by Trump, but the vice president largely avoided the fight. He was lampooned as an "elf on the shelf" during a White House showdown between Trump and top congressional Democrats last December.
Both depictions are exaggerations. If Pence were the secret steward, Trump would be pushing free-trade measures, limiting spending and taking a hard line on traditional U.S. adversaries like Russia. Instead, the president has sent Pence to sell a reworked version of NAFTA, left him to defend trillion-dollar budget deficits and forced him to carry messages to Ukraine's president, apparently threatening to withhold aid meant to protect against Russia's incursions. But Pence is not always a bystander, either: In one attempt to change Trump's mind without angering him, Pence invited former senators Dick Lugar (R-Ind.) and Sam Nunn (D-Ga.) to his office to discuss nuclear disarmament before Trump's 2018 trip to negotiate with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un in Singapore, Lugar told me. (Trump listened for 20 minutes but didn't appear to pay much attention, Lugar said.)
Myth No. 3 He's ready to push Trump off the cliff. In the heat of Robert Mueller's investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election, some Trump advisers believed that Pence was trying to get the president ousted. Trump himself questioned whether he could trust his vice president, according to a New York Times report. When an anonymous aide wrote an unsigned op-ed in the Times last year claiming to be part of a "resistance" in the administration, speculation turned to Pence because the author had used one of the vice president's favorite words, "lodestar," throughout the piece. (Pence fiercely denied any involvement.)
But Pence has already faced the perfect opportunity to ditch Trump and grab the crown, and he didn't do it. After The Washington Post published the "Access Hollywood" video in October 2016, Pence's chief political aide, Marty Obst, was flooded with calls: The Republican National Committee was prepared to replace Trump as the nominee with Pence. Obst didn't even need to think about it; Pence was supporting Trump no matter what. Pence and his team knew that Trump had an iron grip on the GOP base, and killing the king would not have been a good setup for 2020, when Pence planned to run against President Hillary Clinton after a Trump loss in 2016. Trump's upset victory a month later didn't change the Pence team's thinking about his future. To win in 2024, Pence needs the support of the president and his base, which is why pushing Trump out would be career suicide.
Myth No. 4 He believes he's predestined to be president. The authors of one biography argued that Pence believes God has lit a path for him that ends in the Oval Office, citing Pence's favorite verse, Jeremiah 29:11, as evidence of his surety. "For I know the plans I have for you," God tells the prophet. "Plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future." A detailed profile in the Atlantic cited the same verse to show that Pence believes God is clearing a path for his ascension to the presidency.
But the key to understanding the line in Pence's life story came in 1999, when Karen Pence had it framed for him. They were about to uproot their family to relocate to a different House district and start living on debt so he could make a third run for Congress after two previous losses. The verse isn't a guarantee that Pence will make it to the White House; it's a promise that if he and his family remain faithful, keep their heads down and do the work, God will provide for them.
Yes, Pence talked about becoming president in grade school. But by adulthood, that dream had been tempered into something more practical: making it to Congress. His focus on the White House didn't start until after the 2008 election, when he was brought under John Boehner's wing in the House Republican leadership and was actively courted by movement conservatives to run in 2012. This was when Pence's actions started taking on a more strategic and decidedly political tone, with the presidency as the end goal.
Myth No. 5 He hates gay people. Pence is often seen as the face of anti-gay bigotry. John Oliver parodied a children's book about bunny rabbits by Pence's daughter Charlotte with a version about two male bunnies in love. A gay U.S. Olympian refused to meet with Pence at the Winter Olympics last year. LGBTQ activists decried Karen Pence after she began teaching art at a conservative Christian school that bans LGBTQ people from working there. (The Pences responded by saying they were being targeted for discrimination based on their faith.)
Pence may indeed overlook the way his policies affect gay people - as indicated by his righteousness on the issue of religious freedom, where he decries discrimination not against LGBTQ folks but against Christian-right activists. Veteran Indiana LGBTQ activist Rick Sutton noted that Pence's conservative Christian friends have never committed suicide because of their religion. Sutton cried as he remembered his friends who took their lives in the 1990s, a time when Mike and Karen Pence were actively fighting gay rights and supporting groups that described homosexuality as a sin. One veteran Indiana Republican who is a fellow Christian conservative described Pence's stance on gay rights this way: "Love the sinner, hate the sin."
But does all that mean he is personally anti-gay? His friends and advisers say no. To prove the point, the U.S. ambassador to Germany, Ric Grenell, a gay conservative Republican, said he and his partner have been warmly accepted by the Pences in person: "Mike and Karen are great people, they're godly people, they're followers of Christ. They don't have hate in their heart for anyone. They know my partner. They have accepted us." A White House spokesman argued that Pence was not "anti-gay" because of a cordial meeting he had with Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar and his gay partner last month.

NEW YORK | Gunfire broke out inside an illegal gambling club in Brooklyn early Saturday, police said, leaving four people dead, three wounded, and investigators trying to piece together what prompted the bloodshed.
The shooting inside the small, nondescript club started just before 7 a.m. as around 15 people were gambling with dice and cards, police said.
At a news conference hours later, Chief of Detectives Dermot Shea said investigators were trying to determine if a gambling dispute, a robbery, or something else was to blame for the violence.
“A bit of a chaotic scene,” Shea said.
Two handguns were recovered. Multiple shots were fired and police didn’t immediately say how many people might have been shooting.
The victims, who have not been identified, ranged in age from 32 to 49, Shea said. Two may have lived out of state and the rest were from neighborhoods throughout Brooklyn.
All of the people shot were men, save for one wounded woman. The injured were expected to survive. One additional person was hurt fleeing.
No one was immediately charged in the shooting, but police were questioning survivors and reviewing security camera footage.
“We have some individuals back at the 77th Precinct and we’re trying to piece together exactly what transpired in that location,” Shea said.
The unlicensed club, adorned with a sign identifying it as the “Triple A Aces Private & Social Event Space,” was operating on the first floor of an older wood-frame townhouse on a block with some empty storefronts and boarded-up buildings.
Isaac Mickens, a community organizer, described the place as a “hole-in-the-wall gambling den” in an interview with The New York Times. “It was real tight, real small, casual, low-key,” Mickens said. “A little hangout spot.”
Mickens said that when he headed toward the club after the shooting he saw people running and screaming, “Oh God! Oh God!”
The local police precinct headquarters is two blocks away. Officers had not previously received any complaints about the location, Chief of Patrol Rodney Harrison said.
Shea said there was no immediate sign that the shootings had any connection to gangs, which have been a problem in that part of Brooklyn.
Crime scene tape surrounded the building Saturday morning and investigators in white jumpsuits could be seen going in and out.
The shooting was the second mass killing in New York in a week. Four homeless men were beaten to death , allegedly by another homeless man, on Oct. 5 in Manhattan’s Chinatown.
Until those killings, the city had been on pace to challenge its post-World War II record for the fewest homicides. Last year it had fewer than 300 in a city of more than 8.5 million people.
Mayor Bill de Blasio, a Democrat, said on Twitter that the city “awoke to senseless gun violence.”
“I’ve said it before and I’ll say it until I can’t anymore: we have an epidemic of gun violence that spares no community — and it won’t stop until we get guns off our streets once and for all,” he said.

Texto completo: It has often been noted that President Trump holds a vision of his job more befitting a Latin American caudillo than the leader of the world's oldest democracy. His geopolitical idols trend toward the autocratic -- Kim Jong-un, Rodrigo Duterte, Mohammed bin Salman, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Vladimir Putin. He suffers delusions of grandeur, proclaiming himself "the Chosen One" and having "great and unmatched wisdom." He accuses those who challenge him of treason, and he regularly wipes his feet on the constitutional principle of checks and balances.
Witness the over-the-top letter his White House counsel, Pat Cipollone, sent House Democrats this week, the gist of which was: Your impeachment investigation is illegitimate, and we will not participate. As if this were the president's prerogative. Legal experts mostly dismissed the letter as a political stunt. Gregg Nunziata, a former counsel to Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, called it "bananas." Walter Shaub, who resigned as head of the Office of Government Ethics in 2017 over the administration's glaring lack of ethics, said that it "mistakes Trump for a king."
Fortunately, Mr. Trump's dreams of dominance tend to bump up against the hard realities of incompetence -- his and that of his cronies. It has long been apparent that the president has a peculiar eye for talent. The repercussions of this were on display this week as the Ukraine scandal at the heart of the impeachment inquiry continued to unspool, spotlighting a fresh batch of colorful characters and questionable behavior.
In one of the more bizarre impeachment twists to date, two businessmen involved in the president's efforts to dig up dirt on former Vice President Joe Biden were arrested on campaign finance violation charges as they were trying to leave the country on Wednesday. Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman are Soviet-born naturalized Americans who have been working closely with Rudy Giuliani, the president's personal lawyer, to investigate Mr. Biden, one of the president's chief political rivals, and his son Hunter, who had business dealings in Ukraine. The men were also helping search for evidence to support a (debunked) conspiracy theory blaming Ukraine for the 2016 hacking of the Democratic National Committee.
Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman were scheduled to testify before Congress this week about their work with Mr. Giuliani. In addition to hooking up Mr. Giuliani with Ukrainian prosecutors, the pair allegedly supported an effort that proved successful to recall Marie Yovanovitch, the ambassador to Ukraine, who they claimed was bad-mouthing Mr. Trump.
Looking to influence American officials, the men arranged for large donations to, among other political causes, the 2018 campaign of Representative Pete Sessions, the Texas Republican who lost his seat last year and is now pondering a comeback. The pair reportedly pressed Mr. Sessions to help remove Ms. Yovanovitch. In May of last year, Mr. Sessions sent a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo calling for the ambassador's dismissal. (Mr. Sessions has denied being influenced by the men.) Mr. Trump recalled Ms. Yovanovitch this spring, several months before her assignment was scheduled to end, without explanation.
According to the federal indictment unsealed on Thursday, Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman "conspired to circumvent the federal laws against foreign influence by engaging in a scheme to funnel foreign money to candidates for federal and state office so that the defendants could buy potential influence." They were arrested at Washington's Dulles International Airport Wednesday evening, about to board an international flight with one-way tickets. Earlier that day, the men were seen having lunch with Mr. Giuliani at the Trump International Hotel near the White House. The full nature of Mr. Giuliani's relationship with Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman is unclear. Among other connections, Mr. Parnas helped found an aptly named firm, Fraud Guarantee. On Thursday, Mr. Giuliani confirmed to The Times that he was retained by the firm last year to provide legal and business advice -- but then he backtracked and said maybe it wasn't Fraud Guarantee he worked for after all.
These were not the only associates/clients of Mr. Giuliani to make news this week. Multiple reports also surfaced about Mr. Giuliani's efforts in 2017 to have top officials, including then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, intervene to have the Justice Department drop its criminal case against -- or possibly arrange a prisoner swap for -- an Iranian-Turkish gold trader represented by Mr. Giuliani. Mr. Tillerson balked.
Mr. Trump was coy Friday evening about whether Mr. Giuliani still represents him. "I don't know," he told reporters. "I haven't spoken to Rudy."
Not that Mr. Giuliani was the only impeachment player making waves. Looking to shore up its defense team, the White House has recruited Trey Gowdy, the former Republican congressman from South Carolina who ran a committee that investigated the Benghazi terrorist attack of 2012. This news displeased some members of Mr. Trump's existing legal team. Victoria Toensing, a Washington lawyer unofficially assisting Mr. Giuliani on various presidential projects, suggested the Trump team thinks of Mr. Gowdy as "a joke."
Michael Pillsbury, one of Mr. Trump's advisers on China policy, was also having trouble staying on message. On Wednesday, Mr. Pillsbury told The Financial Times that he got "quite a bit of background on Hunter Biden from the Chinese" during a trip to Beijing last month -- information of fresh relevance in light of Mr. Trump's public call last week for China to investigate the Bidens. Just hours after his remarks were reported, Mr. Pillsbury showed up on C-Span, not only denying his quote but insisting that he had not spoken to The Financial Times in a month. The FT then published its email exchange with Mr. Pillsbury containing the exact quote.
Then there's poor Rick Perry. The energy secretary received a congressional subpoena regarding Ukraine. It seems his work there on energy issues somehow got tangled up with Mr. Parnas's and Mr. Fruman's efforts to install some of their allies atop the state-run energy giant Naftogaz. Also, Mr. Trump has said that his now infamous July 25 phone call with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, was at Mr. Perry's behest. Mr. Perry acknowledges that he repeatedly asked Mr. Trump to hold a call with Mr. Zelensky, but only to discuss energy issues.
By week's end, the impeachment drama had taken on the feel of a telenovela crossed with a mob movie wrapped up in a true crime procedural and decorated with psychedelic TikTok clips. In a word: bananas.
But with a cast of bumblers, grifters and self-promoters like those Mr. Trump seems to favor, one should expect nothing less.

Anticipation for a Bump in the Polls, Even if It's Unlikely to Last

Texto completo: In a crowded field, experts agree, debates can result in a momentary spike in support for second-tier candidates -- but it rarely lasts.
Welcome to Poll Watch, our weekly look at polling data and survey research on the candidates, voters and issues that will shape the 2020 election .
After next week's Democratic debate, pundits will inevitably argue over who won and who lost, and they'll scour the polls to see if any presidential candidate has gotten a "bump" in support.
But as high-profile as they are, debates rarely help a candidate break out of a crowded field. And strategists generally agree that post-debate spikes in the polls seldom last for long.
A dozen candidates will be onstage at the CNN/New York Times debate on Tuesday, but experts broadly agree that none of them are likely to see a significant change in fortunes in a single night.
Ahead of the 2016 Republican primaries, Donald J. Trump's publicity-heavy campaign rolled along with impregnable strength, despite the fact that TV viewers rarely gave him high marks for his debate performances.
The current Democratic race has been characterized by a similar steadiness, experts say, with former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. continuing to command the support of around a quarter of Democratic respondents, and Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts rising consistently and sometimes surpassing him.
"Democratic primary voters basically seem to be fine with their top three options," said Sean McElwee, a co-founder of the polling and analytics firm Data for Progress, referring to Mr. Biden, Ms. Warren and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.
"There's the possibility that a debate would drive a news cycle that would bolster a candidate," Mr. McElwee added. "But instead, what we've seen is that those sorts of moments tend to fall off."
Senator Kamala Harris of California is the only Democratic candidate this cycle who has seen a statistically significant jolt in the polls after a debate. At the first round of Democratic debates in late June, she confronted Mr. Biden on his past opposition to federally mandated school busing. She immediately leapt up in the polls, enjoying double-digit support among primary voters nationwide throughout July.
Perhaps more important, the exchange gave her fund-raising operation a shot of adrenaline: Just 24 hours after the debate, she had raised $ 2 million.
But she soon fell from the race's top tier, and has not broken into the double digits in any major national poll since the start of August.
Mr. McElwee cited recent studies showing that candidates' success is strongly driven by the sheer amount of news coverage they manage to receive -- an argument that was borne out by the success of Mr. Trump in the run-up to the 2016 primaries, when he was able to reverse the unfavorable opinions that most Republican voters held of him, not by changing the tenor of his campaign, but by securing almost nonstop coverage.
"There are lots of different earned-media opportunities in the current climate -- and debates are very important," Mr. McElwee said. "But if you look at the polling, there's been lots of people who have had good debates, bad debates, and at the end of the day, it hasn't really changed the broad structure of the race."
"In the broad scope of cable news coverage, the one hit per month of the debate is not enough to make a candidate break through," he added.
The Democratic pollster Celinda Lake said that debates can help drive future coverage, resulting in a snowball effect. But she added that candidates' fortunes will largely be determined on the ground in early-voting states.
"I think that honestly, the debates are having more impact on news coverage than they are having impact on voters," Ms. Lake said. "Candidates don't get known by unveiling a good plan at the debate. They become known by immersing themselves in these early states."
To qualify for November's debate, candidates will need to reach 5 percent support in two polls in early nominating states, or 3 percent in four early-state or national polls. These are higher thresholds than for any debate thus far. A bump after next week's debate could, at the very least, help candidates such as Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota or the former housing secretary Julián Castro -- who are now foundering in the low single digits -- secure a spot onstage next month.
But historically, early debates have been more likely to disqualify a candidate than to provide a lasting jolt of momentum. In 2011, Gov. Rick Perry of Texas pledged in an early debate to eliminate three agencies from the executive branch if elected president but couldn't remember the name of one of the agencies. He never recovered from the flub. (When Mr. Trump became president, however, Mr. Perry was chosen to head the Department of Energy, the very agency he had forgotten to name.)
Last election cycle, the businesswoman Carly Fiorina enjoyed a strong showing in the second Republican primary debate, seeing a sizable uptick in support in the days afterward. But she could not convert it into a consistent climb in the polls.
"Successful first debate performances create buzz for a candidate but also generate expectations for continued success," the historian and presidential scholar Bruce Buchanan wrote in an email. "If he or she does O.K. but less well in the second debate, the story is about underperformance."
Bob Shrum, a Democratic strategist and speechwriter, said that Ms. Warren had found success by performing strongly in debates -- while not chasing a breakout moment. "She has done this by performing consistently well by not looking for a cute line, and my guess is that she'll continue that," he said.
But Mr. Shrum noted that as the field of candidates narrows, and the remaining candidates each get more airtime, the opportunity for news-making moments will increase. "These early debates are more like skirmishes," he said. "We're now getting into the later debates -- and they can have an impact."
It may not be until the general election that the debate stage once again assumes prime importance.
"Primary debates are more like a beauty contest or a cameo appearance in a play," Peter Hart, a longtime Democratic pollster, said. "It gives you a glimpse, it gives you an insight, and it allows a candidate to get noticed. More importantly, it can eliminate a candidate's potential to be the nominee."
On the other hand, he said, "general election debates have a huge impact upon the dynamics of the election -- and the outcome."

GM strike's toll: Packed warehouses, idle trucks

Texto completo: The truck drivers at Phoenix Transit & Logistics in Dearborn, Michigan, are long gone. Around three dozen of the trailers they once ferried between auto plants - packed with dashboards, engine components, lights and other parts for General Motors - are sitting in a lot with nowhere to go.
It's an increasingly familiar scene as the strike against GM by the United Auto Workers enters its fourth week. From suppliers to shippers to restaurants, the impact of the work stoppage is spreading through the web of businesses whose fates are tied to the biggest American automaker.
Wael Tlaib, the owner of Phoenix Transit & Logistics, said he had laid off nearly his entire staff, including 80 drivers, and had dipped into his personal savings to keep his company afloat.
"I might lose the business next week," Tlaib said.
The most intense economic pain is being felt in the industrial Midwest, where GM's network of plants and suppliers is thickest. It is a difficult time for the region's manufacturing industry, which even before the strike was contending with slowing auto sales, a weakening global economy and the trade war.
An economic blow to the Midwest would have broad consequences in part because the region is an important political battleground that will help determine who wins the 2020 presidential election. In 2016, President Donald Trump's narrow victories in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin put him over the top in the Electoral College tally.
The state of the auto industry "usually has political ramifications that are beyond its direct economic influence," said Matt Grossmann, a political-science professor at Michigan State University. "A lot of Democrats here are running on the promise to help the factory workers and the working class, and saying Trump hasn't done it."
Nearly 50,000 UAW members walked off the job Sept. 16, the largest stoppage since GM workers went on strike in 2007. The union is pressing for more job security as well as the reopening of plants in the United States that the company has recently idled. GM wants to limit wage increases, slow the growth of health care costs, and gain flexibility in how plants are staffed and operated.
After signs of progress last week, the two sides hit a roadblock last weekend on how production might be moved to the United States from Mexico.
The impact of the strike stretches from Mexico to Canada, where GM plants that depend on American factories have been shuttered, putting thousands out of work. Analysts estimate that GM has lost $600 million as a result of the strike.
In the United States, 34 GM plants have gone dark. And striking workers are making do with a $250-a-week subsidy from the union.
In the first three weeks of the strike, $412 million in wages were lost, according to Patrick Anderson, chief executive of Anderson Economic Group.
"Each week the damage grows geometrically," Anderson said. "First you lose your UAW workers, then the immediate suppliers, then the next tiers."
Michigan has the most exposure to the auto sector, with roughly 8% of the state's economy linked to the industry. Even after factory closures decimated employment in the car industry in recent decades, the state remains dotted with auto plants and suppliers.
"There's been real damage to the economy," said Charles Ballard, an economics professor at Michigan State. "It hasn't been huge yet but the ripple effects will get bigger the longer this goes on."
In Flint, at least 1,200 truckers and production workers from suppliers have lost their jobs because of the strike. That includes hundreds from a supplier of seats to GM, Lear Corp., according to Duane Ballard, the financial secretary for UAW Local 659, which represents employees at that factory.
Many of those workers are new hires who have not worked at the Lear plant long enough to qualify for state unemployment insurance, Ballard said.
On a rainy night last week, more than two dozen people affected by the strike showed up at the Martus Luna Food Pantry in Flint, said Art Luna, who runs the pantry.
They "are the ones that are really hurting," he said. "They're anxious to go back to work."

Texto completo: I should start by disclosing that Halloween is my favorite holiday on earth. I love the blatantly transactional nature of it, the fact that it jettisons religious tradition in favor of uncut sugar lust.
But to me, Halloween has always represented something even more profound: the chance to upend the prevailing moral order.
After all, kids are duly instructed in school, at home, and on television to never take candy from strangers. Yet, on this one blessed night, kids are basically exhorted to venture out, garishly dressed, to accept sweets from any rando who happens to open the door.
Back when I was a kid, in the latchkey '70s, there was a communal understanding that certain acts of low-level vandalism and bullying were going to transpire on Halloween. Eggs were going to be chucked. Pumpkins were going to be smashed. Doorbells were going to be rung then ditched. While I'm technically not advocating for any of these activities, I do remember the sheer thrill of Halloween as being drenched with this sense of anarchic peril.
You kind of never knew what was going to happen, what you might see (some neighborhood mom in her slip!), or who you might encounter (a roving band of marauding teens intent on snatching your hard-won treasure). Would you be the kid who dared to bite into the caramel apple booby-trapped by some maniac with a razor blade, and if so, what would it feel like to have your tongue sheared in half?
OK, that looks horrifying on paper. But Halloween used to represent the closest a kid could get to a world free from parental oversight.
Which is precisely why I find today's kid-safe version so lame.
Back in my day — a phrase I am mortified to be uttering — the idea that a parent would chaperone Halloween was unthinkable.
But in my neighborhood now, it's considered de rigueur for parents to trick or treat with their kids — sometimes whole families dress up together. The adults wind up chatting with one another. The themed costumes are praised. Photos are taken. It becomes a coffee klatch.
Some families festoon their homes with elaborate decorations and camp out in their front yards, as if the point of Halloween is for the parents to gather compliments like so many UNICEF pennies.
As any lawyer would tell you, this kind of fraternizing violates both the spirit and intent of Halloween, which is for children to gather as much candy as possible in the limited window allotted. You don't hang on Halloween. You hustle.
Thanks to shrewd planning and an obsessive awareness of my childhood neighborhood, I used to routinely rack up 10 pounds of candy every year. I would then haul the booty back home, where I dumped it on the rug and engaged in an interminable trading session with my brothers. A full-size Snickers bar for two Laffy Taffys and a fistful of candy corn? Nice try.
These sessions were made all the more intriguing by the sheer diversity of candies doled out back then: dozens of different candy bars, hard candies, cream chews, taffies, toffees, jelly beans. National brands, regional brands — like my beloved Big Hunk bar — even homemade concoctions, like the candied apples that Gary Lahr's mom saw fit to give out (and, hey, no razor blades).
Not today. Parents are so paranoid about kids being poisoned, that most stick with the same mass-market bars. When my kids return home, 90 percent of their take consists of the staid six: Snickers, Reese's, Milky Way, Kit Kat, Twix, and M&M's. And they're invariably “fun size," a term I put in quotation marks because I do not consider receiving a fraction of a candy bar to be fun.
But honestly, none of that would be so bad except for the most galling aspect of today's Halloween protocol: the fact that most parents don't allow their children to keep their haul. No, there's an elaborate system of candy buybacks — sometimes dentists get involved — in which kids are basically forced to trade their sweets for cash or toys or, I don't know, karma.
If my parents had suggested such a scheme to me and my brothers, we would have sought legal remedy, arguing (quite correctly) that the candy in question was work product, and, as such, not subject to illegal seizure.
Alas, now comes the ugly part, the part where I confess to having gone over to the dark side.
Because as the father of three young children — two of them registered candy addicts — I must reluctantly admit to having participated in these desecrations. I have chaperoned my children, have limited their trick-or-treating time, and, most shamefully, have requisitioned their Halloween loot — setting aside a few Kit Kat Darks for myself, obviously.
I can offer no excuses for these betrayals, aside from the fact that I had cavities in every single one of my back teeth by the time I was 12.
I'm not proud. I can only plead that nobody reading this will tell my children how I really feel.

All Gassed Up, Destination Unknown

Texto completo: It's a simpler equation than the classic chicken-or-egg question: The automobile came first, of course, but a road trip wasn't far behind.
The open road, heavy with symbolism and full of promise, has long coursed through popular culture, with the journey at least as rewarding as the destination. In addition to the romance of the road, one goal might be distance, like the classic New York-to-Los Angeles jaunt that will add 2,782 miles to your odometer and cross a big item off your bucket list.
Way back in 1905, a merry Oldsmobile was celebrated in song. Jack Kerouac's "On the Road" wildly wandered postwar America. Slightly more recently, Willie Nelson put us "On the Road Again," Bruce Springsteen told us we were "Born to Run" and Rihanna exhorted us to "Shut Up and Drive."
And while Americans have popularized and maybe even perfected the road trip (picture Chicago-to-Hollywood on what's left of Route 66; now picture it in a '57 Corvette), its roots are global. The first automotive road trip of considerable length is said to have been, like the automobile itself, a product of Germany.
Baron Theodor von Liebieg took to the road in his Benz Victoria in 1894. Getting underway in Reichenberg, Bohemia (now Liberec in the Czech Republic), von Liebieg drove to Gondorf on the Moselle River, with a stopover in Mannheim, where he visited Carl Benz, creator of the automobile.
Forget McDonald's -- there weren't even fueling stations along his route. But there were chemist shops, where von Liebieg bought ligroin, a laboratory solvent, to power his machine's single-cylinder three-horsepower engine. In all, the baron and his Benz traveled over 1,500 miles that summer.
Going the distance
Von Liebieg surely didn't realize he was helping define the art of the road trip -- a long journey inspired by wanderlust. And while the length of his drive was amazing given the condition of the roads and the primitive machine he drove, his mileage is a mere drop in the bucket compared with that of Emil and Liliana Schmid, who hold the Guinness World Record for the longest driven journey.
The Swiss couple have traveled almost half a million miles in their Toyota Land Cruiser, interrupting their drive only to ship the S.U.V. from one continent to the next. Having first taken to the road in 1984, they've driven in almost every country on the globe. This month, they were in Iran and on the move.
The Schmids' tough-as-nails Land Cruiser is an excellent road trip vehicle in most regards. Fitted with a giant roof rack and offering plenty of interior space, the vehicle lets the couple take their life with them.
Couple's trip
Not long after von Liebieg completed his journey, and before Kerouac was crisscrossing the country, things got rolling in America.
F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote of a road-tripping adventure in the 1920s for Motor magazine, a Hearst publication that had in its early days targeted an emerging class of Jazz Age Americans with wheels.
In three 1924 issues of the magazine, Fitzgerald recounted a 1920 trip from Connecticut to the Alabama home of his wife, Zelda.
Describing how he and his wife had anticipated the journey, Fitzgerald touched on the emotions that have long driven folks to drive. "To be young, to be bound for the far hills, to be going where happiness hung from a tree, a ring to be tilted for, a bright garland to be won -- It was still a realizable thing, we thought, still a harbor from the dullness and the tears and disillusion of all the stationary world," he wrote, in a quote singled out by Malcolm Forbes in a review of "The Cruise of the Rolling Junk," a compilation of those magazine articles.
The journey is emotional yet lighthearted, with their used Marmon as much a character as the reckless Fitzgeralds. A marriage of automobile and occupants. In brief, a road trip.
After the presidency
Today, retired presidents earn millions writing books and giving speeches. In the early 1950s, they went on road trips. Well, at least one did.
In 1953, shortly after leaving office, Harry Truman and his wife, Bess, left Independence, Mo., in their black 1953 Chrysler with New York City as their goal. It's all documented in a book by Matthew Algeo, "Harry Truman's Excellent Adventure."
The Trumans undertook the journey much as we would today, without Secret Service protection and shunning publicity. Along the way, they explored Main Street America, eating in diners and staying in motels. According to a 2009 essay by Mr. Algeo in The New York Times, they spent a night at the Parkview motel in Decatur, Ill. The tab? Five bucks (not quite $ 50 today), which just fit the Trumans' budget, supported by his $ 111.96 monthly Army pension income (a bit above $ 1,000 today).
Crisscrossing America
Kerouac's "On the Road" is the quintessential work of American road trips. Based on the travels of the Beat generation author, the novel defined the road trip as an escape. Among the memorable road trips Kerouac describes are a sprint from Denver to Chicago in a Cadillac, a foray into Mexico in a distressed '37 Ford and a winter trip from New York to New Orleans in a Hudson.
Narrated by Kerouac's character Sal Paradise, the work itself is a road trip, originally written on a single scroll with no paragraph breaks, much like a highway stretching out before a driver aching to get on the road again.
While America wasn't home to either the first or the longest road trip, we have arguably perfected the genre. We've driven the 1,650 miles of the Pacific Coast Highway from Olympic National Park in Washington to San Diego many times. Countless travelers have enjoyed the roadside Americana that colors the nearly 2,500 miles of historic Route 66 as it winds its way from Chicago to Santa Monica. An even longer journey can be had by following U.S. 50 from San Francisco to Maryland's Eastern Shore.
But U.S. Highway 2 takes the prize as the longest cross-country route, tracing the northern boundary of the United States from Seattle to Acadia National Park in Maine. Along the way are Glacier National Park and Michigan's Upper Peninsula, after which the road takes a detour into Canada before descending into upstate New York.
Although the 2,192-mile Appalachian Trail, which stretches from Georgia to Maine, is famous as a hiking route, there's a driving route as well for those of us who prefer to take our exercise while behind the wheel. A road trip may not do much for one's physical health, but it can be a rejuvenating mental elixir.

Texto completo: Our guide to plays and musicals coming to New York stages and a few last-chance picks of shows that are about to close. Our reviews of open shows are at nytimes.com/reviews/theater.
Previews & Openings
'CYRANO' at the Daryl Roth Theater (previews start on Oct. 12; opens on Nov. 7). Edmond Rostand's play about a man with a silver tongue and a less precious schnozz returns courtesy of the New Group. Peter Dinklage stars as the titular cavalier, in a new version adapted and directed by Erica Schmidt. Aaron and Bryce Dessner, of the National, supply the music. Their bandmate Matt Berninger and Carin Besser provide the lyrics.
800-745-3000, thenewgroup.org
'FOR ALL THE WOMEN WHO THOUGHT THEY WERE MAD' at Soho Rep (previews start on Oct. 14; opens on Oct. 27). Eight times each week, the writer and actress Zawe Ashton stays sane portraying a love triangle's hypotenuse in Harold Pinter's "Betrayal." In "For All the Women Who Thought They Were Mad," the play she wrote about the impact of colonialism on the women of the African diaspora, some of the characters aren't as lucky. Whitney White directs.
866-811-4111, sohorep.org
'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: THE NEXT GENERATION' at the Triad (in previews; opens on Oct. 16). For more than 30 years, Gerard Alessandrini has lampooned Broadway, with love and savagery. His new revue parodies, likely in perfect meter, recent hits including "Hadestown," "Tootsie" and "What the Constitution Means to Me." Immanuel Houston, Aline Mayagoitia, Chris Collins-Pisano, Jenny Lee Stern and Joshua Turchin star, with Fred Barton on piano.
212-279-4200, forbiddenbroadway.com
'THE LIGHTNING THIEF' at the Longacre Theater (in previews; opens on Oct. 16). What do you do when you learn that you're actually the son of a god? Apparently, you go to Broadway. Joe Tracz and Rob Rokicki's 2014 musical, based on Rick Riordan's Percy Jackson novels, about a kid who discovers he has a very fancy family tree, has moved uptown. Stephen Brackett directs.
212-239-6200, lightningthiefmusical.com
'LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS' at the Westside Theater Upstairs (in previews; opens on Oct. 17). If threats to the environment have you rattled, a musical comedy in which a plant triumphs may be just the ticket. Michael Mayer directs a revival of Howard Ashman and Alan Menken's musical horror comedy about a flower shop employee and the bloodthirsty vegetable he nurtures. Jonathan Groff, Tammy Blanchard and Christian Borle star.
212-239-6200, littleshopnyc.com
'NOTES ON MY MOTHER'S DECLINE' at Next Door at NYTW (in previews; opens on Oct. 13). A new dad cares for his old mom in Andy Bragen's semi-autobiographical piece, directed by Knud Adams. (Since Bragen's "This Is My Office" explored his relationship with his father, a companion piece seems only fair.) Bragen has written that it is the most personal play he has ever made and the most difficult.
212-460-5475, nytw.org
[Read about the events that our other critics have chosen for the week ahead.]
'THE ROSE TATTOO' at the American Airlines Theater (in previews; opens on Oct. 15). The fall season is a bit more floral with Marisa Tomei starring in this Tennessee Williams revival. Tomei plays Serafina, a widow confronting her husband's infidelity and her growing attraction to a new man. For the Roundabout Theater Company, Trip Cullman directs a cast that includes Emun Elliott and Ella Rubin.
212-719-1300, roundabouttheatre.org
'SOFT POWER' at the Public Theater (in previews; opens on Oct. 15). A metatheatrical exploration of politics and culture and a riff on "The King and I" as seen through a trick mirror, David Henry Hwang and Jeanine Tesori's musical of a sort arrives at the Public. It conjures a world in which a Chinese businessman meets Hillary Clinton at a campaign fund-raiser, an experience that inspires a hallucinatory blockbuster show. Leigh Silverman directs.
212-967-7555, publictheater.org
'THE SOUND INSIDE' at Studio 54 (in previews; opens on Oct. 17). Mary-Louise Parker, an actress of audacity and surprise, makes a resonant return to Broadway. David Cromer directs Adam Rapp's play, about a creative writing professor facing a cancer diagnosis and her relationship -- complex in emotions and structure -- with a first-year student. When it showed at the Williamstown Theater Festival last summer, Jesse Green called it an "astonishing new play."
212-239-6200, lct.org
'TINA: THE TINA TURNER MUSICAL' at the Lunt-Fontanne Theater (previews start on Oct. 12; opens on Nov. 7). What's Broadway got to do with it? This bio-musical traces eight decades of Tina Turner's life, from her rural Tennessee origins to her early success and her abusive marriage to her solo triumphs. Adrienne Warren, who sings, a New York Times critic wrote, "with a feral, uncaged yearning," reprises the role she created in London. Phyllida Lloyd ("Mamma Mia") directs.
877-250-2929, tinaonbroadway.com
Last Chance
'THE NEW ENGLANDERS' at City Center Stage II (closes on Oct. 20). Jeff Augustin's drama about two dads and their precocious daughter moves on. Jesse Green wrote that the play, directed by Saheem Ali, has problems of plot, genre and tone. Yet he noted, "Even as the story goes haywire, there are powerful moments and hard insights within it."
212-581-1212, nycitycenter.org
'NOVENAS FOR A LOST HOSPITAL' at Rattlestick Playwrights Theater (closes on Oct. 13). Rattlestick's site-specific autopsy of St. Vincent's Hospital, shuttered in 2010, reaches its conclusion. The show, directed by Daniella Topol and starring a luminous Kathleen Chalfant, traverses 16 decades and several locations, which is perhaps too much. According to Jesse Green, "'Novenas' often feels like it's trying to find the quickest way to connect its points, instead of the richest way."
866-811-4111, rattlestick.org
'RUNBOYRUN' AND 'IN OLD AGE' at New York Theater Workshop (closes on Oct. 13). These paired plays, chapters of Mfoniso Udofia's nine-part epic about a Nigerian-American family, finish their Off Broadway run. Directed by Loretta Greco and Awoye Timpo, the two dramas, Jesse Green wrote, "deepen our understanding of the invisible burdens that can weigh down the lives of even the most successful immigrants."

Texto completo: AN EXHIBIT FEATURING Marvel Comics closed last month at The Franklin Institute, but the National Museum of American Jewish History is following up with a superhero exhibit of its own.
That's what Josh Perelman, NMAJH's chief curator and director of exhibitions and interpretation, said of "Notorious RBG: The Life and Times of Ruth Bader Ginsburg," which opened Oct. 4.
The exhibit was inspired by and based on the 2015 New York Times bestseller of the same name by Irin Carmon and Shana Knizhnik, which tells the life story of the first Jewish woman justice to be appointed to the Supreme Court. The exhibit's East Coast debut will be on display through Jan. 12. The ticket price, $9, is a reference to Ginsburg's famous response to the number of women on the Supreme Court that would be enough.
"For a museum that tells the story of the American Jewish experience, to focus on this particular individual feels like exactly the right person at exactly the right time," Perelman said. "But just like we focus on American Jews as lenses into the larger history of this nation, by telling RBG's story, we are also telling a larger story."
Ginsburg was born in Brooklyn, New York, in 1933, and was one of few female graduates in her class at Columbia Law, where she later became the school's first female tenured professor. She broke ground litigating sex discrimination cases, including in front of the Supreme Court, as general counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union in the 1970s, and helped to launch that organization's Women's Rights Project in 1973. She was appointed to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia in 1980, and nominated for the Supreme Court by President Bill Clinton in 1993.
Ginsburg got her "Notorious RBG" nickname in 2013, after publishing a stream of passionate dissents pertaining to the Voting Rights Act. A New York University student, Shana Knizhnik, was inspired by Ginsburg's legal actions, and created the "Notorious RBG" Tumblr blog, whose name referenced the rap star The Notorious B.I.G.
The Tumblr went viral, and Ginsburg went from understated feminist pathbreaker to full-throttle pop-culture icon, such that it's not uncommon to see fans dress like her for Halloween. T-shirts, pins and refrigerator magnets bear her image, and she's been featured on The Late Show With Stephen Colbert - the host joined Ginsburg for her workout routine - and memorialized on Saturday Night Live in various sketches by comedian Kate McKinnon.
Eventually, Knizhnik, now an attorney, teamed up with journalist Irin Carmon, a senior correspondent at New York Magazine, to write the RBG book. The authors have gotten to know Ginsburg well; she presided over Carmon's wedding in 2017 and Knizhnik's wedding last month.
Last year, the "Notorious RBG" exhibit debuted at Skirball Cultural Center in Los Angeles, coinciding with the 25th anniversary of Ginsburg's appointment to the Supreme Court. The first-ever museum retrospective explores her legacy, as visitors follow Ginsburg's journey from aspiring law student to lawyer and advocate for women's rights to sitting on the nation's highest court.
Both Carmon and Knizhnik worked on the exhibit, which serves as a physical exploration of their text.
"The goal has always been to bring Justice Ginsburg's story to everyone, for people to be able to connect to her story and to be inspired themselves to work for a more equal and just society," Knizhnik said. "That's really what the Notorious RBG blog, our book and now this amazing exhibition are all about, is both celebrating the growth of those values, celebrating the work of Justice Ginsburg and also trying to bring her work to a larger audience and really explaining those values in a way that everyone can access them."
Visitors will find various historic heirlooms and photographs of Ginsburg along with displays highlighting her writings, opinions and interviews. Featured artifacts include Ginsburg's Supreme Court robe, one of her iconic jabots and a dress she wore onstage at the Washington National Opera in 2017. Photos chronicling her early life are featured throughout the exhibit along with breakdowns of her famous dissents from the bench. There's also an outfit worn by Felicity Jones when she portrayed Ginsburg in the 2018 biopic On the Basis of Sex.
Much of the exhibit is devoted to Ginsburg's relationship with her husband of more than 50 years. Before he died in 2010, Martin Ginsburg wrote a letter to his wife from his hospital bed. His touching words are on display.

"The exhibition is really bringing the spirit and the content of the book to life. ... Her life and her work are part of a broader history and a broader set of moments. So we're really proud that the exhibition situates her in the context of that history," Carmon said. "Justice Ginsburg thinks a lot about how to send a message to a future generation, that the constitution includes them, that the Supreme Court matters to them and it's their Supreme Court, and capturing the spirit of that is so cool." *

Daily on Energy: EPA looks to lead on lead

EPA LOOKS TO LEAD ON LEAD: The Environmental Protection Agency wants to avoid another Flint, and it’s pointing to its new lead and copper rule as a major step to attack the root of the problem.
EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler is unveiling the proposal during an event in Green Bay, Wisconsin, this afternoon.
The proposal could be a major step in reducing lead in drinking water across the country, especially if it prompts greater replacement of lead service lines. The EPA’s rule would be the first major overhaul of federal protections for lead in drinking water in two decades, and it is part of the Trump administration’s broader strategy to address lead poisoning launched last year.
“Our proposal would ensure that more water systems proactively take actions to prevent lead exposure, especially in schools, child care facilities, and the most at-risk communities,” Wheeler said in a statement.
Environmentalists, though, say the EPA’s proposal wouldn’t go far enough and could actually slow the replacement of lead service lines. And the agency hasn’t yet detailed how it would enforce the new regulation.
What the regulation would do: Wheeler said the EPA’s proposal targets lead in drinking water “by improving protocols for identifying lead, expanding sampling, and strengthening treatment requirements.”
Lead, a heavy metal that had been used for decades in pipes and paint, is known to cause learning disabilities, slower growth, and other health problems, particularly in children. Lead can get into communities’ drinking water supply when water isn’t treated properly and lead service pipes corrode.
The EPA, in its proposal, would require water systems to update a public inventory of where lead service lines are. Water systems would also have to address sources of lead if a home is found to have lead levels in its drinking water exceeding 15 parts per billion.
The EPA is also adding a new “trigger level” of 10 parts per billion, meaning water systems would have to start taking action sooner to treat sources of lead.
Will it prevent another Flint? The answer to that question comes down to how the EPA would enforce its new proposal, experts say.
Asking water systems to proactively act in “good faith” isn’t enough, Carl Reeverts, former deputy director of the EPA’s drinking water protection division, said, adding there should be consequences if a violation occurs. The EPA hasn’t yet said how it’s “going to make sure a water system complies with the requirements,” he said.
Replacing lead service lines is also incredibly expensive, and water systems would benefit from federal help to cover the cost, said Reeverts, who worked at the EPA for more than three decades.
Wheeler, in his statement, said the EPA intends to work with the Department of Housing and Urban Development to ensure states and cities can tap into federal funding options to help replace lead service lines and conduct treatment.

MICHAEL BLOOMBERG SAYS CITIES CAN HELP US MEET PARIS CLIMATE GOAL: New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and eight other U.S. mayors released a policy “playbook” Thursday for how cities can cut emissions from the transportation and building sectors.
The mayors say if the largest 100 U.S. cities took these recommended actions, total combined emissions between them would fall 28.5%, helping the U.S. meet its Paris climate agreement goals. Bloomberg said 25 U.S. cities are already taking his proposed actions through his American Cities Climate Challenge, which his philanthropy has provided with $70 million in funding.
“Our Climate Action Playbook will help spread their successes to other cities across the U.S. and the world, drawing on the proven policies and programs that are reducing emissions, strengthening infrastructure, and improving public health,” Bloomberg said at the conclusion of the 2019 C40 World Mayors Summit in Copenhagen.
Policies proposed by Bloomberg and the other mayors include implementing energy efficiency projects in municipal facilities; purchasing renewable energy to meet municipal electricity demand; installing electric vehicle charging at municipal parking lots; electrifying city buses; and implementing new financing programs for efficiency, renewables, and infrastructure that encourages private sector lending.
COAL INDUSTRY PICKS A FIGHT WITH NATURAL GAS OVER CLIMATE CHANGE: Increasing natural gas use is making tackling climate change harder, according to a new attack from — you guessed it — the coal industry.
Count on Coal, a project of the National Mining Association, released a blog post Wednesday arguing that “fuel switching” in the electricity sector from coal to natural gas is not sufficiently reducing emissions.
“Natural gas has firmly become a leading contributor to the challenge,” the blog post says.
This is ironic because coal, of course, is the dirtier fossil fuel, and gas replacing coal is the biggest contributor to U.S. emissions’ declines over the last decade.
Emissions technology is more important: But the coal industry says improvements in technologies such as carbon capture, which can be used on coal or natural gas plants and also in agriculture and industrial applications, are more important to reducing emissions than fuel switching.
“Fuel switching and targeting, and picking winners and losers was never the answer, regardless of how much natural gas boosters wanted it to be,” the post says. “The answer always has been – and remains – technology.”
The blog post notes that U.S. carbon emissions rose 3.4% in 2018 despite the closure of 40% of the nation’s coal fleet since 2010, and a near-record reduction in coal capacity last year. It cites research from the Rhodium Group showing increased power demand last year was met mostly by natural gas. Of course, if coal was the dominant source providing that power, emissions would have been even worse.
OIL INDUSTRY TO ‘VIGOROUSLY’ FIGHT TRUMP’S RFS CHANGES: The American Petroleum Institute rallied against the Trump administration’s recent moves to boost ethanol, vowing to “vigorously” fight what it deemed a politicized action to benefit Midwestern farmers.
“This is a political convenient departure from the previously balanced approach this administration has taken under the Renewable Fuel Standard,” Frank Macchiarola, API’s vice president of downstream and industry operations, said in a press call Thursday. “The only viable way forward is for this misguided policy to be withdrawn.”
The Trump administration lased week vowed to increase federal mandates for production of corn-based ethanol and biodiesel. The EPA is expected to issue a rulemaking in the coming weeks to formalize the proposed changes, which include expanding biofuel requirements so that more than 15 billion gallons of conventional ethanol are blended into the nation’s fuel supply beginning in 2020, and expanding sales of E15.
EPA said it will continue to give economic hardship exception waivers to small refiners, but will also force large refiners to blend more biofuels to make up the difference.
Farmers' anger has peaked over EPA’s generous use of these exemptions. API said it opposes EPA’s new plan for the exemptions.
“There is no logic in forcing competing refineries to bear the burden of decisions outside their control,” Macchiarola said.
INTERIOR MOVES TO EASE MINING OF MINERALS: The Interior Department wants to make it easier for mining companies to develop non-energy minerals on public lands.
Interior’s Bureau of Land Management proposed a rule Wednesday allowing for mining companies to pay lower royalty rates and other fees they provide to the federal government.
It would “streamline” the process by which producers of minerals such as soda ash, potash, phosphate, sodium, potassium, sulphur, and gilsonite could apply for a reduction in their royalty rate or rental fee. Those non-energy minerals are used in fertilizer, toothpaste, printing ink, cosmetics, and other everyday products.
Interior says the development of non-energy minerals on BLM lands contributed $13.4 billion to the national economy in fiscal 2017, and that its proposed rule would save the mining industry up to $5 million in regulatory costs over the next decade. The move is the latest by the Trump administration to highlight the U.S. dependence on imports for minerals from countries like China and Turkey, which it argues harms national security.
“It is critical that U.S. royalty rate policies do not put domestic non-energy mineral producers at a competitive disadvantage with their foreign competitors in a global economy,” said Republican House Leader Kevin McCarthy, in a statement supporting the proposed rule.
LOCAL SOLAR PROGRAM HITS MILESTONE: More than 300 local governments have met the criteria for the national SolSmart program, which helps communities cut the cost of installing solar power, the program announced Thursday.
The 2016 program — funded by the Energy Department’s Solar Energy Technologies Office — targets “soft costs,” or non-hardware costs, of solar installations, by helping local governments navigate permitting, planning, and zoning requirements and improving financing mechanisms.

'Play hardball': New York Times columnist calls for Giuliani to be arrested

Texto completo: A Cornell law professor encouraged the House to start arresting people close to President Trump to force the White House to comply with subpoenas.
Law professor Josh Chafetz wrote an op-ed in the New York Times on Thursday titled, "The House Can Play Hardball, Too. It Can Arrest Giuliani." Chafetz said House Democrats should respond to a recent defiant letter by White House counsel Pat Cipollone by resorting to tactics that have not been used in generations.
The House should threaten to use "its sergeant-at-arms to arrest contemnors [that violate subpoenas] … especially when an individual, like Rudy Giuliani, is not an executive branch official," Chafetz writes.
Cipollone's letter, released Tuesday, informed Democratic leadership that the Trump administration would not comply with House subpoenas or allow another member of the executive branch to testify until GOP representatives are granted subpoena powers and a larger role in the process.
"Your unprecedented actions have left the president with no choice," Cipollone said. "President Trump and his administration cannot participate in your partisan and unconstitutional inquiry under these circumstances."
Arresting individuals for obstruction would allow Democrats to work around Department of Justice prosecutors, who rarely take action against administration officials in such cases, to enforce their subpoenas.
"The House arresting someone would be explosive and clearly should not be undertaken lightly. But the very explosiveness of it would be a way for the House to signal the seriousness of White House obstructionism to the public," Chafetz writes. "Moreover, having arrest as an option of last resort might also make less extreme options more palatable."
Chafetz also suggested attaching a rider to the next appropriations bill that would defund the White House counsel’s office, either triggering a shutdown or forcing the White House into compliance.

Texto completo: America woke up Wednesday to the shocking news that former "Today" star Matt Lauer has been accused of rape. Which leads to a question: Could Lauer now be prosecuted for an alleged crime that supposedly occurred in Russia in 2014?
Very unlikely. Which is good news for Lauer who is furiously denying the allegation.
For sure, he can't be prosecuted in New York City or anywhere else in the USA. Crimes are prosecuted in the jurisdiction in which they allegedly occurred – in this case, Russia.
Will Russian prosecutors move against him? How could they? There's no extradition treaty between Russia and the U. S.
"The reality is that even when there is a treaty, extradition is 90% politics and only 10% law," says Stephen Vladeck, a law professor at the University of Texas who is familiar with extradition issues. "And especially when you don’t have a treaty, as we don’t with Russia, it starts as a long shot and it's probably not even that likely. "
James Cohen, a law professor at Fordham University in New York, says the idea that Lauer could be prosecuted in Russia is a "non-starter. " Nor is it guaranteed, he says, that any American could get a fair trial in Russia on a criminal charge.
"Nothing is going to happen," Cohen says. "In my mind it’s inconceivable that the Russians would have any interest in prosecuting Matt Lauer. It would be sort of amusing for them – you know, sort of a finger in the eye of the U. S. – but even at that level, which is not all that great, it would not justify them doing anything. "
We are already used to hearing about Lauer as a philanderer and an accused workplace sexual harasser – that's why he was abruptly fired by NBC News in 2017.
At the time, Lauer said some of the accusations of sexual misconduct against him were untrue or "mischaracterized," but there was "enough truth" in other allegations to make him feel "ashamed. "
Now it turns out there may be more to the story , at least according to Ronan Farrow's new book, "Catch and Kill," to be published Oct. 15. Variety obtained an early copy and reported on its contents on Tuesday night.
For the first time, Farrow identifies the accuser, Brooke Nevils, who filed a detailed complaint against Lauer with NBC News' human-resources department on Nov. 27, 2017. The next day, Lauer was fired.
A former assistant to Meredith Vieira, Nevils now has told Farrow that Lauer raped her in his hotel room in Sochi, Russia, at the 2014 Olympics.
"It was nonconsensual in the sense that I was too drunk to consent," Nevils told Farrow, according to Variety. "It was nonconsensual in that I said, multiple times, that I didn’t want to have anal sex. "
According to the Russian Criminal Code, rape involving the "taking advantage of the victim's helpless condition" is punishable by a prison term of three to six years. Also according to the code, Article 78, the statue of limitations for a "grave crime" such as this is 10 years, according to Olga Zalomiy, a Los Angeles lawyer who is licensed to practice law in Russia.
Nevils acknowledged to Farrow that she later had other sexual encounters with Lauer back in the U. S. , according to Variety, that she blames herself for those encounters, and that she was terrified of the control Lauer had over her career at the time.
Lauer said the night in Sochi was the first of several sexual encounters he had with Nevils over several months, including one in his dressing room at NBC, which "showed terrible judgment on my part. "
In response to the reporting on the Farrow book, NBC News chief Andrew Lack issued a memo to the staff on Wednesday.
"Matt Lauer’s conduct in 2014 was appalling and reprehensible – and of course we said so at the time. The first moment we learned of it was the night of November 27, 2017, and he was fired in 24 hours. Any suggestion that we knew prior to that evening or tried to cover up any aspect of Lauer's conduct is absolutely false and offensive.
"Our hearts break again for our colleague," Lack's memo said.
After Lauer was fired, Nevils accepted a seven-figure settlement and signed a non-disclosure agreement to not speak publicly about the matter, Farrow's book says.
But Lack's memo said that under the settlements the network reached with Nevils and another accusers of Lauer, "those women have always been free to share their stories about Lauer with anyone they choose. "
Once again, Lauer is denying the accusations and in even stronger terms than in 2017. "Categorically false," he said in a statement. His encounter with Nevils in Sochi was "extramarital" but "consensual. "
Did Nevils report the alleged rape to Russian authorities in 2014? If she did it's not been publicly reported. And if she didn't, that too would add to the difficulties should Russian prosecutors attempt to charge Lauer.
Did she tell NBC in November 2017 that Lauer raped her three years earlier? At the time, the network called Lauer's behavior "appalling" and cited "sexual misconduct," but there was no mention of the word rape. That was at the behest of the accuser and her attorney, Lack's memo says.
"Today, some have questioned why we used the term 'sexual misconduct' to describe the reason for Lauer’s firing in the days following," the memo says. "We chose those words carefully to precisely mirror the public words at that time of the attorney representing our former NBC colleague. "
Farrow's book is mostly about his investigation, when he worked for NBC News, of movie mogul Harvey Weinstein's alleged sexual misconduct over years and his clash with his network editors over whether they thwarted his story (he eventually left NBC, published in The New Yorker and shared a Pulitzer Prize with The New York Times).
Farrow's book also covers Lauer because Farrow argues that Weinstein sought to bully NBC News into killing his exposé using Lauer as his leverage. Farrow writes that Weinstein made it clear to the network that he knew about Lauer's behavior and could reveal it, according to The Hollywood Reporter, which also obtained a copy of the book.
Juda Engelmayer, a spokesman for Weinstein, who is set to go on trial in New York in 2020 on sex-crime charges, including rape, told USA TODAY Weinstein had no comment on Farrow's book.
Lack's memo did not specifically address the Lauer-as-leverage charge Farrow's book reports. Instead, he reiterated what NBC News has been saying about its relationship with Farrow since the fall of 2017: The network "completely supported" Farrow's Weinstein investigation but after seven months he didn't have any accusers or witnesses on the record or on camera.
"He simply didn’t have a story that met our standard for broadcast nor that of any major news organization," the memo says. When Farrow asked to take his story elsewhere, the network reluctantly agreed.
Later, after the New York Times published its own Weinstein exposé, Farrow's article in The New Yorker was published and "bore little resemblance to the reporting he had while at NBC News," Lack's memo said.
Lauer's firing in 2017 rocked NBC and left his co-anchors on "Today," Savannah Guthrie and Hoda Kotb, stunned and teary on the morning they announced it on the show. On Wednesday, Guthrie and Kotb were just as emotional about the new allegation.
"I feel like we owe it to our viewers to pause for a moment," Guthrie said. "This is shocking and appalling. I honestly don't even know what to say about it. "
Lauer on Wednesday issued a statement denying Nevils' allegation. In a lengthy letter provided by his lawyer to Variety, Lauer said the accusation was full of contradictions, and that he has declined until now to speak out about "false and salacious allegations" to protect his children.
"I have never assaulted anyone or forced anyone to have sex. Period," Lauer wrote. "My silence has been a mistake. Old stories are being recycled, titillating details are being added, and a dangerous and defamatory new allegation is being made. All are being spread as part of a promotional effort to sell a book. It’s outrageous. So, after not speaking out to protect my children, it is now with their full support I say 'enough. ' "
In response, Nevils issued a statement to USA TODAY calling Lauer's defense a "case study in victim blaming. "
Lauer was more contrite about his behavior in his 2017 statement after he was fired. He said then that "some of what is being said about me is untrue or mischaracterized, but there is enough truth in these stories to make me feel embarrassed and ashamed. I regret that my shame is now shared by the people I cherish dearly. "

Texto completo: Jill Freedman, an adventurous photographer who immersed herself for months at a time in the lives of street cops, firefighters, circus performers and other tribes she felt were misunderstood, died on Wednesday at a care facility near her home in Manhattan. She was 79.
Nancy Schiffman-Sklar, a cousin, said the cause was complications of cancer.
Lots of people dream of running away and joining the circus, but Ms. Freedman actually did it, and created a body of images that captured the ache and solitude and weirdness of the American road at the point where, as she wrote, it "sings with the sinister energy of insane clowns."
For Ms. Freedman, this energy was her muse.
In seven books and numerous gallery exhibitions and journalism assignments, she specialized in finding people on the rough margins of American life, rendering them as noble but not necessarily heroic. Even when her subjects were freakish or odd, Ms. Freedman never traded in oddity for its own sake; viewers might laugh with the characters, but not at them.
A chain smoker who liked to drink -- she noted that the Lion's Head bar in Greenwich Village closed at 5 a.m. -- she found her stride in New York when the city was still mostly seedy, living her life and work as if she were auditioning for a role in one of her photos. A police siren, she said, meant that someone was playing her song.
"My friends and relatives know I'm nuts," she told The New York Times about her total immersion in her subjects. "It's obsessive. I want to tell the story and I want to get it right. God forbid I should make it easy on myself."
Ms. Freedman was born in Pittsburgh on Oct. 19, 1939, the only child of Ross and Selma Freedman, a traveling salesman and a nurse. "She was a beautiful, beautiful girl," another cousin, Marcia Schiffman (Ms. Schiffman-Sklar's mother), said in an interview for this obituary in August. "But she was a little bit of a devil."
Ms. Freedman traveled to Israel and England after college, eventually singing and playing guitar there to support herself. She moved to New York in 1964 and spent a couple of years working straight jobs in advertising that she disliked, until waking up one morning in 1966 with a desire to take photographs.
"I'd never taken a picture," she said, "and I woke up wanting a camera." She borrowed a friend's camera to shoot an antiwar demonstration and kept on shooting.
After the assassination of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in 1968, she took up residence in a plywood shantytown erected in Washington by the Poor People's Campaign, which he had organized. There she took photos that landed her in Life magazine and produced her first book, "Old News: Resurrection City," in 1971. Like the work that followed, the images were part documentary, part activism.
"Woody Guthrie had his guitar that said this machine kills fascists," she said. "I'd love to do that with a camera."
New York in the 1970s was spiraling into chaos, and Ms. Freedman embraced what she called the theater of the streets -- "the weirder the better," she said.
Marcia Schiffman said that Ms. Freedman was driven alternately by anger and "a love for humanity, wanting to save the world."
For two years she attached herself to firefighters in the tinderboxes of Harlem and the South Bronx, sleeping in firehouses or the chief's car. Often the only woman in these environments, she was able to capture men behaving in ways that they might not have in front of a male photographer, said the filmmaker Cheryl Dunn, who included Ms. Freedman in her documentary "Everybody Street," about street photographers. "She had really macho guys like cops and firemen letting down a façade."
In one photo, Ms. Freedman caught two firemen, apparently having survived a mission, sharing a cathartic kiss.
Ms. Freedman said that in her work she tried to disappear into the background.
"I put a lot of time into being invisible," she said. "When I was a kid, I always wished I had one of those rings or cloaks that made you invisible. Then I realized years later, I am invisible behind a camera. I am a camera."
Other series followed, including her work with street cops, who she thought were being unfairly maligned. It was a violent world, and she was determined to show the violence in a way not seen in movies and television shows.
"I set out to deglamorize violence," she said.
The work never brought her much money, nor the fame enjoyed by some of her male peers, said Anne Wilkes Tucker, curator emerita of the Museum of Fine Arts in Houston. "I don't think she got her due at the time," Ms. Tucker said in a phone interview in August. "She didn't have that support group that a lot of photographers have. And we all need that."
Ms. Freedman's work and health both tailed off in the 1980s. With no health insurance, she received a diagnosis of breast cancer in 1988 and later broke her pelvis. She moved to Miami in 1991 and shot a series there on local strippers, but she was no longer as motivated as she had been, Marcia Schiffman said.
In addition to her and Ms. Schiffman-Sklar, Ms. Freedman is survived by several other cousins.
Ms. Freedman returned to New York after her time in Miami, to an apartment in Harlem, and talked in recent years about compiling one more photo book, to be called "Madhattan." It would be a tribute to a wild, messy, psychotic, remarkable city that she had missed terribly.
"We used to have a great brand of crazies," she said. Ms. Freedman was their photo booth.

Texto completo: Nine other men were also taken into custody during raids in New York and charged with assaulting people with knives and machetes to protect gang turf.
[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox. ]
Police officers battered down an apartment door in the Bronx on Wednesday and arrested a man investigators believe is the leader of the Trinitarios, a Dominican gang linked to the grisly murder of a 15-year-old boy outside a bodega last year.
The man, Richard Ramirez, was just one of 10 people taken into custody during early morning raids by the New York Police Department in the Bronx, Queens and Upper Manhattan and held on charges including gang assault, conspiracy and attempted murder.
The men are accused of assaulting about half a dozen victims in attacks during 2017 in Upper Manhattan near West 192nd Street, according to one person with knowledge of the case. Five others were still being sought on Wednesday evening, the police said.
"We believe that these were random acts of violence by the Trinitarios gang protecting their territory," Deputy Chief Timothy McCormack said at a news conference. The attacks, he said, were "very vicious acts of violence with knives and machetes."
The men were expected to be arraigned on Thursday in State Supreme Court in Manhattan. They are suspected of being members of Los Surés, a violent faction of the Trinitarios gang that was behind the killing of Lesandro Guzman-Feliz, the teenager killed in June 2018 when gang members mistook him for a member of a rival group.
Video images of Lesandro, known as Junior, being pulled out of the bodega and hacked to death on the sidewalk stunned the city and the nation.
The police have said members of the same gang brutally assaulted a teenager on the Bronx River Parkway two days before Lesandro was killed.
The current charges, however, are not directly linked to Lesandro's murder, Chief McCormack said.
Investigators said they believe Mr. Ramirez took over the leadership of Los Surés from Diego Suero, who was among 14 people indicted last year in connection with Lesandro's killing. In June, a jury convicted five of those men of murder, and they are expected to be sentenced on Friday, according to the Bronx district attorney's office.
The police recovered a shotgun, a handgun and other "paraphernalia" with gang symbols during the Wednesday morning raids, Chief McCormack said.
Los Surés is one of several factions within the Trinitarios, a prison gang founded in 1993 on Rikers Island by two Dominican prisoners, known on the street as "Junito" and "Caballo," Detective Paul Jeselson, an expert on Bronx gangs, told The New York Times last year. The two men were seeking "protection inside the jails," he said.
The name Trinitarios is derived from three revolutionaries of the Dominican Republic. In New York, the gang members are known to use machetes, a symbol of their agrarian roots; the weapons quickly helped to establish their reputation for ruthlessness.
Outside jail, the Trinitarios took hold in the Marcy Houses in Brooklyn, then spread throughout the city and Long Island, Detective Jeselson said.
The factions are highly organized, holding meetings that are governed by a strict set of bylaws. Gang members regularly mete out punishment to transgressors, experts have said.
The expansion of the gang from its origins in 1993 was tightly controlled: New crews could only be created with formal approval of the gang's leadership. That mixture of discipline and ferocious violence has helped the gang thrive. A police database from 2011 estimated there were 1,181 Trinitarios in the city.
Rebecca Liebson contributed additional reporting.

Texto completo: The Competitive Enterprise Institute has published a new paper, "Wrong Again: 50 Years of Failed Eco-pocalyptic Predictions." Keep in mind that many of the grossly wrong environmentalist predictions were made by respected scientists and government officials. My question for you is: If you were around at the time, how many government restrictions and taxes would you have urged to avoid the predicted calamity?
As reported in The New York Times (Aug. 1969) Stanford University biologist Dr. Paul Ehrlich warned: "The trouble with almost all environmental problems is that by the time we have enough evidence to convince people, you’re dead. We must realize that unless we’re extremely lucky, everybody will disappear in a cloud of blue steam in 20 years."
In 2000, Dr. David Viner, a senior research scientist at University of East Anglia’s climate research unit, predicted that in a few years winter snowfall would become "a very rare and exciting event. Children just aren’t going to know what snow is." In 2004, the U.S. Pentagon warned President George W. Bush that major European cities would be beneath rising seas. Britain will be plunged into a Siberian climate by 2020. In 2008, Al Gore predicted that the polar ice cap would be gone in a mere 10 years. A U.S. Department of Energy study led by the U.S. Navy predicted the Arctic Ocean would experience an ice-free summer by 2016.
In May 2014, French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius declared during a joint appearance with Secretary of State John Kerry that "we have 500 days to avoid climate chaos."
Peter Gunter, professor at North Texas State University, predicted in the spring 1970 issue of The Living Wilderness: "Demographers agree almost unanimously on the following grim timetable: by 1975 widespread famines will begin in India; these will spread by 1990 to include all of India, Pakistan, China and the Near East, Africa. By the year 2000, or conceivably sooner, South and Central America will exist under famine conditions. ... By the year 2000, thirty years from now, the entire world, with the exception of Western Europe, North America, and Australia, will be in famine."
Ecologist Kenneth Watt’s 1970 prediction was, "If present trends continue, the world will be about four degrees colder for the global mean temperature in 1990, but eleven degrees colder in the year 2000." He added, "This is about twice what it would take to put us into an Ice Age."
Mark J. Perry, scholar at the American Enterprise Institute and professor of economics and finance at the University of Michigan’s Flint campus, cites 18 spectacularly wrong predictions made around the time of first Earth Day in 1970. This time it’s not about weather. Harrison Brown, a scientist at the National Academy of Sciences, published a chart in Scientific American that looked at metal reserves and estimated that humanity would run out of copper shortly after 2000. Lead, zinc, tin, gold and silver would be gone before 1990. Kenneth Watt said, "By the year 2000, if present trends continue, we will be using up crude oil at such a rate ... that there won’t be any more crude oil."
There were grossly wild predictions well before the first Earth Day, too. In 1939, the U.S. Department of the Interior predicted that American oil supplies would last for only another 13 years. In 1949, the secretary of the interior said the end of U.S. oil supplies was in sight. Having learned nothing from its earlier erroneous energy claims, in 1974, the U.S. Geological Survey said that the U.S. had only a 10-year supply of natural gas. However, the U.S. Energy Information Administration estimated that as of Jan. 1, 2017, there were about 2,459 trillion cubic feet of dry natural gas in the United States. That’s enough to last us for nearly a century. The United States is the largest producer of natural gas worldwide.
Today’s wild predictions about climate doom are likely to be just as true as yesteryear’s. The major difference is today’s Americans are far more gullible and more likely to spend trillions fighting global warming. And the only result is that we’ll be much poorer and less free.

Texto completo: The Diane & Barry Wilen Jewish Book Festival, sponsored by the David Posnack Jewish Community Center, continues with two events this month.
Susan Neiman, an American philosopher and cultural commentator, will discuss her book "Learning from the Germans: Race and the Memory of Evil" in a discussion with Rabbi Leon Weissberg in a free program beginning at 1 p.m. Oct. 17 at the Stirling Road Library, 3151 Stirling Road, Fort Lauderdale. For more information, 954-434-0499, ext. 336. Neiman's book examines German efforts to atone for Nazi atrocities.
South Florida best-selling author Brad Meltzer will bring a special treat - a free premiere screening of his new cartoon TV series "Xavier Riddle and the Secret Museum" at 3 p.m. Oct. 27 in the Orlove Auditorium, 5850 S. Pine Island Road, Davie. The event is free, but reservations are required. Contact 954-434-0499, ext. 336 or dpjcc.org.
Meltzer is known for his action-packed thrillers and series of children's books. The screening is geared for families with children ages 3 to 7 years old. "Xavier Riddle and the Secret Museum" debuts in November on PBS and is based on Meltzer's children's book series, Ordinary People Change the World, about inspiring historical figures as children. The TV series introduces a young boy Xavier, his sister Yadina, and their best friend Brad. In each episode the trio encounter a situation, like being bullied, and go back in time to meet a real hero such as Rosa Parks.

Texto completo: A couple who split their time between Manhattan and Colorado were sentenced Tuesday to one month in prison each for conspiring to fix their daughter's college entrance exams, a scam they decided was worth the $125,000 cost if it boosted her prospects of getting into Duke University, her mother's alma mater.
In choosing to incarcerate Gregory and Marcia Abbott for a month, U.S. District Judge Indira Talwani stopped short of the eight-month penalty prosecutors wanted but wasn't swayed by appeals from the Abbotts and their attorneys to spare the couple prison altogether.
The Abbotts, who must each pay a $45,000 fine and perform 250 hours of community service, are the sixth and seventh parents to be sentenced in the college admissions scandal. In letters to the court and a memorandum filed by their attorneys, the Abbotts described what they portrayed as the uncommon circumstances that led to their corrupt deal with William "Rick" Singer, a Newport Beach college admissions consultant who has admitted rigging dozens of SAT and ACT exams and misrepresenting his clients' children as recruits for sports they did not play.

In letters to the judge, the Abbotts said their daughter is severely ill with Lyme disease, a condition that forced her to abandon a soloist role with the Metropolitan Opera in New York, withdraw from high school and enroll in an online curriculum.
Their daughter -- feverish and sapped of energy -- was struggling on standardized tests, the couple said in the letters. Marcia Abbott said she was introduced to Singer through a friend who recommended him as an expert who "did much of his college counseling in exchange for donations to a charity for underserved schools and youth programs."
Singer did have a charity, though its true purpose was far from charitable. He used his Key Worldwide Foundation to launder sums from wealthy clients and, according to federal prosecutors in Massachusetts, parcel out bribes to test proctors, college coaches and a university administrator.
After tutoring their daughter legitimately for a time, Singer proposed a scheme to guarantee she would receive a score of her parents' choosing, the Abbotts said. The girl would take the test at a private school in West Hollywood, where Singer would bribe an administrator to allow Mark Riddell, his Harvard-educated accomplice, to afterward correct her answers.
Riddell has pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit fraud and money laundering; the administrator, Igor Dvorskiy, said last week that he would plead guilty to conspiracy to commit racketeering.
Before founding a packaging company in 2000, Gregory Abbott pursued a career as a theater producer and novelist, according to a notice in the New York Times commemorating his marriage to Marcia Meighan in 1987. Marcia Abbott, daughter of a former New York senator, worked as a magazine editor and freelance writer, the notice says.
Prosecutors say the Abbotts threw themselves into the scheme "eagerly" -- not just once, but twice. Eric Rosen, an assistant U.S. attorney, wrote in a sentencing memorandum that the couple "exploited" their daughter's illness to secure permission for her to take her exams in West Hollywood, far from their New York and Colorado homes.
Marcia Abbott said her understanding of the scheme was vague, although she knew that it required "some kind of cheating" and that Singer couldn't have promised a particular score "unless he was going out of bounds."
Gregory Abbott said he was aware that his daughter "would be getting some kind of help that was outside the rules," but "didn't know exactly how and, frankly, I didn't want to know."
Rosen described the scheme in his sentencing memo: Gregory Abbott wired $50,000 to Singer's foundation from his charitable trust in April 2018. Two days after the payment, the Abbotts' daughter took the ACT at Dvorskiy's West Hollywood school. Unbeknownst to the girl, her parents and prosecutors say, Riddell corrected her answers afterward. She received a 35 out of 36.
Delighted with the score Riddell obtained for their daughter, they later asked Singer to fix her SAT subject tests, Rosen said, with Marcia Abbott telling Singer a score of 750 or more out of 800 would be "fabulous."
Singer told her it would cost $75,000 to rig two SAT subject tests, in math and literature.
"Yeah, that's fine," she replied. Duke, her alma mater, "told us they didn't want anything below a 750."
In her letter to the court and sentencing memo, Marcia Abbott insisted she "never cared about getting [her children] into name-brand schools," noting her eldest son dropped out of Dartmouth and her younger son briefly attended Bard College, which doesn't require standardized test scores.
The Abbotts' daughter took her SATs at the same West Hollywood school in October 2018. Again, Riddell corrected her answers.
A month later, however, Marcia Abbott was scared, Rosen said in the memo. The College Board hadn't released the scores. Worried the scam was coming apart, she contacted the College Board and spoke with a customer service rep, who memorialized the call.
Marcia Abbott was "extremely adamant" and is "filing a legal complaint," according to notes cited in the prosecution's memo.
Rosen blasted the Abbotts for threatening legal action to hold onto scores they fraudulently obtained.
Prison, he said, "is the only answer for such entitlement and criminality."

Facebook Won't Pull Ads That Lie

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- The 30-second video ad released by the Trump campaign last week is grainy, and the narrator's voice is foreboding. Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., it says, offered Ukraine $ 1 billion in aid if the country pushed out the man investigating a company tied to Mr. Biden's son.
Saying it made false accusations, CNN immediately refused to air the advertisement.
But Facebook did not, and on Tuesday, the social network rejected a request from Mr. Biden's presidential campaign to take it down, foreshadowing a continuing fight over misinformation on the service during the 2020 election as well as the impeachment inquiry into President Trump.
In a letter to the Biden campaign, Facebook said the ad, which has been viewed five million times on the site, did not violate company policies. Last month, the social network, which has more than two billion users, announced that politicians and their campaigns had nearly free rein over content they post there.
Even false statements and misleading content in ads, the company has said, are an important part of the political conversation.
"Our approach is grounded in Facebook's fundamental belief in free expression, respect for the democratic process, and the belief that, in mature democracies with a free press, political speech is already arguably the most scrutinized speech there is," Facebook's head of global elections policy, Katie Harbath, wrote in the letter to the Biden campaign.
The decision by the company illustrates its executives' hardened resolve to stay out of the moderation of political speech, despite the use of the social network to spread discord and disinformation in the 2016 presidential campaign. On Tuesday, the Republican-led Senate Intelligence Committee released a sobering report warning of fresh signs of interference by Russia and other foreign nations in the 2020 election.
The company's position stands in contrast to CNN, which rejected two ads from the Trump campaign last week, including the one the Biden campaign asked Facebook to take down. The cable channel said it rejected the ad because it "makes assertions that have been proven demonstrably false by various news outlets."
Facebook has been dogged by accusations of censorship by conservative politicians, including President Trump, who argue that the Silicon Valley company gives greater attention to liberal points of views on the social network.
But by removing itself as the moderator of political content -- including in paid ads on the site -- Facebook has left itself open another avenue of criticism. In a series of tweets Monday evening, Senator Elizabeth Warren, one of the front-runners for the Democratic nomination, said Facebook allowed President Trump to spread false information widely, and called on the company to take down the attack ad against Mr. Biden, one of her top rivals.
"Facebook already helped elect Donald Trump once because they were asleep at the wheel while Russia attacked our democracy -- allowing fake, foreign accounts to run ad campaigns to influence our elections," Ms. Warren wrote.
Facebook declined to comment.
The ad the Biden campaign asked Facebook to take down, released by the Trump campaign on Sept. 27, starts with staticky shots of Mr. Biden meeting with Ukrainian officials during his time in the Obama administration.
"Joe Biden promised Ukraine $ 1 billion if they fired the prosecutor investigating his son's company," a narrator says, using video from an event in which Mr. Biden mentions the money. "But when President Trump asks Ukraine to investigate corruption, the Democrats want to impeach him."
The $ 1 billion figure was mentioned at an event in 2018 at the Council on Foreign Relations, in which Mr. Biden was talking about how the Obama administration tried to root out corruption in Ukraine. He said he had held back financial aid to push the country to make reforms.
There is no evidence that Mr. Biden, during his time as vice president, pushed for the dismissal of the Ukrainian prosecutor general to help his son Hunter Biden. The former vice president, along with other members of the Obama administration and other international leaders, pushed for the removal of the prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, because of accusations that he ignored corruption.
Days after the ad was broadcast on television and social networks the Biden campaign wrote a letter to Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's chief executive, and Sheryl Sandberg, the chief operating officer, asking to reject the ad. The video "spreads false, definitively debunked conspiracy theories regarding Vice President Joe Biden," Greg Schultz, a Biden campaign manager, wrote to the Facebook leaders.
Mr. Schultz wrote that the vice president's call for a new prosecutor in Ukraine's investigation of a company was supported by the European Union, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. He included clippings from The Washington Post and Factcheck.org that debunked the claims of Mr. Biden's motives of squashing the investigation to benefit his son.
After CNN rejected the ad last week, Tim Murtaugh, the communications director for Mr. Trump's campaign, said that the ad was "entirely accurate and was reviewed by counsel."
"CNN spends all day protecting Joe Biden in their programming," Mr. Murtaugh wrote in a statement. "So it's not surprising that they're shielding him from truthful advertising, too."
The Biden campaign also urged Fox News to reject the Trump campaign ad last week. But the cable channel declined to do so, saying that it was "not in the business of censoring ads from candidates on either sides of the aisle."
The ad has also appeared on YouTube and Twitter. A spokesman for Twitter said on Tuesday that the ad complied with its policies. A YouTube official likewise said the ad complied with its policies.
T.J. Ducklo, a spokesman for Mr. Biden, wrote in an email that "Donald Trump has demonstrated he will continue to subvert our democratic institutions for his own personal gain, but his shortcomings are no excuse for companies like Facebook to refuse to do the right thing."

A WHALE WOODSTOCK IN THE PACIFIC

Texto completo: Humpback whales spend the summer in cold, high-latitude feeding areas. In the winter, when it’s time to mate, they return to the exact tropical spot where they were born. And when they get there, the males sing a tune common to that breeding ground, almost as if it’s a local jingle or a college fight song.
But a study published in Royal Society Open Science reports there’s at least one place where whales mix it up: Raoul Island, nearly 700 miles off the northeast coast of New Zealand. Humpback whales from the South Pacific tend to stop there for a few days on their way from various breeding grounds in places like Tonga and New Caledonia to their feeding ground near Antarctica.
While they’re hanging out near Raoul Island, they do something researchers hadn’t seen: Whales from each breeding ground share their songs and learn one another’s. In other words, it’s a humpback karaoke spot.
The music made by male humpback whales is rich and haunting, mixing disparate pitches and textures. These sounds are an object of fascination for experts and laypeople alike, and they have been the subject of at least one best-selling album. Researchers aren’t entirely sure why whales sing, although most agree that it has something to do with courtship. (Female humpbacks, which make interesting sounds of their own, seem to take the songs into account when choosing mates.)
The more people study humpback music, the more mysteries arise. For instance, although the male whales at a particular breeding ground all sing the same song, the songs themselves change from year to year, incorporating new elements and phrases.
After decades of analyzing the singing of South Pacific whales - one of 14 known humpback populations - scientists from the South Pacific Whale Research Consortium noticed that the whales were remixing their songs to incorporate music associated with other breeding grounds.
“The song we hear in whales in New Caledonia this year - next year we’ll hear elements of that song in the whales in Tonga,” said Rochelle Constantine, a professor at the University of Auckland and an author of the paper. “It moves from west to east.”
The researchers wondered: Where were the whales picking up these new tunes? Humpbacks don’t visit each other’s breeding grounds. And the feeding grounds, where whales from the South Pacific population are all together, are largely silent. “It’s not the month to be singing,” Constantine said. “They’re busy.”
Raoul Island, a volcanically active landmass half the size of Manhattan, is not an obvious place for a whale party. But over the past decade or so, Constantine said, Department of Conservation rangers posted there had noticed humpbacks aggregating in September and October.
“Instead of just swimming in a straight line down to the feeding grounds, which is the fastest point from A to B, they will come out of their way” to spend time at the island, Constantine said.
In 2015, she and some colleagues traveled there to figure out what they were up to.
When the researchers lowered a hydrophone, or underwater microphone, into the water, they were “quite surprised at how much song we heard,” Constantine said. The singing - which the researchers could also hear through the hulls of their boats - was not quite as loud or lusty as it generally is at the breeding grounds. But at any given moment, there was almost always at least one whale performing.
Acoustic analysis of the songs told the researchers that the singing whales were from a number of different breeding grounds, a conclusion bolstered by photo identification as well as later genetic testing. They even recorded a humpback singing two different songs, perhaps in the process of learning.
Although the sample size is small - only a few dozen whales were recorded - the authors have “clearly demonstrated a location where the cultural transmission of song may occur,” said Melinda Rekdahl, a scientist for the Wildlife Conservation Society, who was not involved with the research. She said questions remain, including why songs seem to move from west to east.
But one piece of the puzzle seems to have been placed. “The great mystery for us was: Where’s the place where they share the song?” Constantine said. “And we found it.”

Texto completo: Forget about China helping President Trump smear Joe Biden and his son. Or Ukraine doing so. Or any foreign country with reasonably sane leadership. Foreign interference in next year’s election, if it occurs, is likely to take a more familiar route.
Here’s one possibility: Several countries, each with a lot at stake and all using Russia’s 2016 hacking and disinformation playbook, line up on opposite sides of the election. North Korea and Saudi Arabia, for instance, might trying to help Trump get re-elected while Iran tries to help his opponent.
The Russians never really shut down, as Special Counsel Robert Mueller stressed in his testimony to Congress in July. China is highly capable, as well, and has a strong interest in who wins the election. Even if no one manages the 2020 equivalent of hacking the Democratic National Committee, they could sow doubt and disgust toward what’s already shaping up to be a very dirty campaign.
But it would be a huge risk for any country to help Trump dig up dirt on a rival. Trump once operated with impunity, but the whistle-blower complaint, subsequent investigation and impeachment inquiry, even though it’s still in its early stages, means there is no place to hide. If you were seen to be helping him, you would anger Democrats — and you’d be stuck with the consequences should they defeat Trump.
Ukraine, which still needs U.S. support against Russia, definitely doesn’t need this. And Trump’s theatrics this past week must look very strange to China’s cautious leadership, which dismissed his request to investigate the Bidens with a statement saying it trusted Americans to sort out their own problems.
Trump took a hit for his appeal to China, including from Republican Sens. Mitt Romney of Utah and Ben Sasse of Nebraska, and he fired back at Romney on Sunday. Trump also brought up the prospects of former vice president and another top Democratic contender, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, in a conversation with Chinese President Xi Jinping in summer, CNN reported.
It’s hard to believe Trump actually thought that China would investigate Biden on the basis of his very public appeal. Romney and Sasse probably reacted more to the idea than the possibility it actually would happen. Perhaps, as some commentators maintain, Trump is trying to inure Americans to talk of foreign involvement in U.S. elections. But repeatedly accusing Biden of massive corruption probably damages the former vice president. That, too, could be the point. Biden is already dealing with questions about how he responds to Trump, and his overall fitness for office.
If Trump does manage to drag Biden down, will he then turn on the next Democrat up with something equally dubious?
In the meantime, after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell reversed his opposition, states are likely to get $250 million more in federal money to ensure election security. That doesn’t guarantee a foreign country won’t try to mess with the election process itself, but makes it somewhat less likely. It didn’t really happen in 2016 or 2018.
Instead, the action is likely to be where the Russians showed it could be done cheaply and effectively in 2016: through hacking and social media.
Mueller, of course, outlined Russian interference in the 2016 election and told Congress that Russia was “doing it as we sit here.” Last Friday, Microsoft reported that Iranian hackers had attempted to identify email accounts associated with government officials, journalists covering political campaigns and accounts associated with one of the 2020 campaigns.
Microsoft did not say which campaign had been targeted, but the New York Times quoted sources as saying it was Trump’s.
The Iranians weren’t particularly successful, but still it’s an indication of what may be to come. Darrell M. West, vice president of the Brookings Institution, says that while foreign efforts to influence U.S. elections are not new, “over the past few years, Russians have shown other nations how easy it is to sow disinformation and disrupt democratic elections.”
“Imagine a 2020 campaign where Russia, Saudi Arabia and North Korea engage in U.S. activities designed to re-elect Trump while China, Iran and others seek to undermine him,” West added. “Americans could wake up the day after the election not knowing whether they were manipulated into an election outcome by direct or indirect foreign activities.”
Each of these countries has cyber capabilities, and each has a lot riding on the election.
China has mostly sought industrial and commercial secrets, but its cyber teams are sharp enough to apparently have captured U.S. hacking tools in a National Security Agency attack, and repurposed them. North Korea has more typically engaged in hacking financial institutions, in what U.S. officials say is a campaign to finance its missile program. New U.S. sanctions were imposed last month. A spate of reports earlier this year said Saudi hackers had targeted the Guardian newspaper, a London-based Saudi dissident and the cell phone of Jeff Bezos.
The temptation will be great to at least quietly probe the campaigns, political parties and election systems, and try to seed beneficial stories into social media networks. That would be a lot safer and probably a lot more fruitful than answering a very public appeal from a president facing impeachment.

Trump maintains solid support because the Democrat alternative is a nightmare

Texto completo: Frustrated liberals have been asking for the last four years what it’s going to take for President Trump’s supporters to abandon him. Because, like, don’t they know he’s about to be impeached!?
New York Times columnist David Brooks attempted to answer the question last week by imagining a conversation with someone he simply referred to as “Flyover Man,” because apparently he didn’t know a single real Trump supporter.
It never seems to occur to liberals that perhaps the real problem isn’t that a lot of people continue supporting the president even though he can be strange, vulgar, and sometimes even stupid. The real problem just might be that even if Trump is a gleeful liar and a petty narcissist, the alternative is so much worse.
It’s supposed to be unthinkable that Trump has even one supporter at all, because aren’t they ashamed to vote for someone that the media have called a white supremacist? And don’t forget, he’s about to be impeached!
But if 40% of the country can stomach all of that, shouldn’t that say something about the choice we’re given?
The choice right now is between Trump and a field of Democrats who want to further wreck the already terrible healthcare system, open up the southern border to every poor person south of Texas, and obsess over grievances of transgender people.
There’s only one person standing between Trump supporters and an endless flood of such policies. That that person happens to have a preoccupation with Fox News, a tendency to violate “the norms,” and a history of dumb business ventures is so easy to overlook when you consider that the only other option is someone who’s going to force them to give up their cars and guns and then tell them to “learn to code.”
That Trump maintains even just 10% of support from the country should say less about him and more about just how nauseating the alternative would be.
It’s not a mystery why a lot of people still support Trump. Just look at the choices they have.

Texto completo: Come September, many Mainers expect to see a steady parade of pickup trucks heading into the northern forest as hunters take part in the state's moose hunt.
That's not always been the case, however.
In fact, if you grew up in the 1950s, 1960s or 1970s, you never would have come across a moose hunter. Or, to be more precise, you wouldn't have found a legal moose hunter. There was no hunting season for moose.
That changed in 1980, and has become a Maine tradition since then. Want to get up to speed on the state's hunt? Take a look at this brief history of the hunt, and the state-run permit lottery that hunters enter in order to take part.
The Maine moose hunt timeline
Early 1900s: The state's moose population drops to just a few thousand, statewide, after years of unrestricted hunting, including market hunting, by which animals would be shot and then sold for meat, and the continued clearing of forests for farmland.
1935: After years of more stringent moose-hunting regulations, Maine ends moose hunting entirely.
1980: Changes in forest practices, including clear-cutting, have provided moose with more habitat and food sources, and the herd shows signs of consistent growth. That prompts Maine to stage its first modern moose hunt, with 700 permits available. The moose weren't hard to find -- 91 percent of hunters filled their tags. Those hunters were not limited to a specific Wildlife Management District. Instead, they were allowed to hunt anywhere north of the Canadian Pacific Railroad tracks during the last week of September. A total of 37,636 people -- all Maine residents -- applied for those permits. The hunt is considered a one-year, "experimental" hunt.
1981: No moose hunt is held, but the state considers what it learned through the experimental hunt and concludes that moose hunting should resume the following year.
1982: After a one-year hiatus, the moose hunt returns, with 60,150 applicants signing up for a shot at one of 1,000 permits. The New York Times reports that applicants from as far away as California and Saudi Arabia sign up for a chance at a permit.
1983: A group calling itself SMOOSA -- Save Maine's Only Official State Animal -- lead a referendum drive aimed at ending the state's moose hunt. That effort failed, with 60.5 percent voting against the measure and 39.5 percent voting for it.
1983-1993: Each year the state continues to issue 1,000 moose permits, with 900 going to Maine residents and 100 going to nonresidents. The total number of applicants during this period ranged from a low of 54,825 (in 1983) to a high of 92,706 (in 1993).
1991: An all-time success rate record is established, with 96 percent of the 1,000 permit holders filling their tags.
1994-2001: The state increases the number of moose permits offered as the state's moose population continues to rise. In 1994, 1,200 permits were allotted in a year that 94,532 hunters applied -- a record number of applicants that still stands. By 1999, the number of permits allotted rose to 3,000, where it stayed for three years.
2009: A record 3,015 permits were allotted. A steady decline of applicants for those permits had occurred since 1994, and in 2009, just 56,654 people entered the permit lottery. Some who stopped entering the lottery said they had given up on ever being drawn as they have seen others win permits more than once.
2011: In order to make the lottery more fair to those who haven't been drawn, the state made hunters who are drawn for a permit sit out for three years before they can win another permit. Until now, hunters were only required to sit out for two years. Other rules were designed to reward longtime entrants who have never been drawn by giving them more bonus chances in the lottery and setting a threshold for an applicant to automatically receive a permit.
2013: A still-standing record of 4,110 permits were allotted. Applicant totals increased a bit, from just over 49,000 in 2010 to more than 53,000.
2014: Citing new access to data that showed the state's moose calves had struggled to survive through the winter, the state decreased the number of available permits by 25 percent, to 3,095.
2017: Just 2,106 permits -- the lowest total in 19 years -- were allotted.
2018: The state introduced a web-based registration for big game animals, including moose, that gave biologists and game wardens instant access to tagging records statewide.
2019: Maine unveiled its big game harvest dashboard, which provided daily big game tagging records to anyone with access to the internet.
2020: The annual moose permit lottery will be held at Sky Lodge in Jackman.

Texto completo: Agnieszka Holland's ecological thriller is available on Mubi until Oct. 11. And a new PBS series connects current events with the past.
What's on Streaming
SPOOR (2017) Stream on Mubi. Rent on Amazon. The New York Times critic Manohla Dargis called "Spoor" one of the best titles of the 2017 New York Film Festival. It never received distribution, but it's available on the streaming service Mubi until Oct. 11. Kasia Adamik and Agnieszka Holland's ecologically inclined film is about Janina (Agnieszka Mandat), a pensioner with a passion for animal rights whose dogs disappear near her home in the Polish hinterlands. While searching for them, she is brought in contact with the violent deaths of several local hunters. According to Dargis, Janina's trajectory is "a weird, occasionally funny and increasingly violent journey into assorted hearts of darkness -- hers and others' -- that is as emotionally powerful as it is political."
CLOVERFIELD (2008) Stream on Hulu. Rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. This thoroughly modern monster movie follows a group of friends in New York contending with an attack by a mysterious creature capable of spectacular destruction. Their story is told by found footage that has been stitched together in the aftermath of the monster's rampage. Aside from the total destruction of New York City, the movie focuses on the fractured relationship between Rob (Michael Stahl-David) and Beth (Odette Yustman). Rob is preparing to leave the city for Japan the night of the attack, and Beth arrives at his going away party with a date. They separate after an argument before the mayhem begins, but, even with buildings toppling all around him, Rob can't forget her.
THE TIME TRAVELER'S WIFE Stream on Netflix. Rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. Love stories almost always include a conflict that disrupts the relationship at their center. Sometimes it's a disapproving family that creates friction. Sometimes it's societal taboos or infidelity, maybe a terrible accident. In this film adaptation of Audrey Niffenegger's 2003 novel, it's time, more specifically the involuntary time travel of Henry (Eric Bana), a Chicago librarian. A genetic disorder causes him to drift, at random intervals, through the past and future. This is why, when he meets Clare (Rachel McAdams), she knows him already, but he is meeting her for the first time. She and Henry fall in love but find themselves tested by his condition.
What's on TV
RETRO REPORT 9 p.m. PBS (check local listings). This new series seeks to explain the present by looking to the past. The journalist Celeste Headlee and the artist Masud Olufani trace the sometime surprising connections they find between things that are in the news today and events from previous eras. In the premiere episode, they'll link the recent protests by NFL football players to earlier examples of activism by black athletes; and explore current social media habits with psychological experiments from the 1950s. Past cases of woman fighting sexual misconduct will also be explored alongside the #MeToo movement. Andy Borowitz, the humorist known for his work in The New Yorker, will join the hosts to add some historically informed satire.

Cory Booker wants to talk about child poverty

Texto completo: Headnote 2020 ELECTION
Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey rolled out a broad set of policy proposals Thursday that seek to significantly reduce child poverty, including by offering a $300 monthly cash allowance to most families with young children.
Though many of the Democratic presidential candidates have introduced proposals to help working families, few of Booker's rivals have offered a policy specifically aimed at cutting the child poverty rate. The Booker campaign said its plan would help at least 7.3 million children escape poverty, citing an analysis by researchers at Columbia University.
Earlier this year, Booker campaigned heavily on his "baby bonds" proposal, which would offer government-funded savings accounts for children that would be handed over as a lump sum when they turned 18 but could only be put toward "wealth-building" transactions like paying for college, buying a home or starting a small business.
His new plan seeks to help families with young children immediately. Though it includes some broadly defined goals and builds off ideas his campaign has already introduced, it also includes three proposals that could shift some wealth toward poor people.
"Building on the same American spirit that gave us Social Security, Medicare, nutrition assistance and so much more, we must come together to ensure that every child has a fair shot to participate in and benefit from our collective promise," Booker said in a statement. "I know that we can do this, and as president, I will act."
A central tenet of Booker's plan is to provide a $300 monthly cash allowance to families for each child under 5 years old through a vast expansion of the child tax credit. The proposal would also eliminate a loophole that leaves out the poorest American families, whose tax credit under the current system is limited to 15% of their earned income over $2,500.
The tax credit would begin to phase out for individual filers earning at least $130,000 or couples earning $180,000.
Booker's proposal follows a bill, the American Family Act of 2019, that was introduced by two other Democratic senators: Michael Bennet of Colorado, who is also running for the Democratic nomination, and Sherrod Brown of Ohio. The bill proposed expanding the child tax credit from $2,000 per year to $3,600 per year, or $300 per month, for families with children up to 5 years old, and then $3,000 a year until the child turns 18. Booker and several other Democratic candidates have signed on to that bill.
Sending money to families with children is common in Europe and in Canada, and a Columbia University study of the 2017 version of the bill found that it would cut child poverty roughly in half.
Booker also proposed expanding the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, commonly known as food stamps, by 30%. And he called for expanding school meals outside the academic year and allowing all children who are eligible for food stamps to receive free or reduced-price school lunches.
Experts in childhood education viewed Booker's focus on childhood poverty as a welcome discussion in the sprawling campaign.
"We have kids operating under toxic stress because they're not eating or they don't have a stable home or they're not safe," said Paul Reville, a professor at Harvard Graduate School of Education. "And until you tackle this, the whole problem of human capital development can't possibly be successfully treated."
In a more expansive proposal, Booker called for increasing funding by 40% for the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families block grant program, which provides temporary financial assistance to families dealt an unexpected crisis like a job loss.
Citing a study from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a progressive think tank, which found that the program is providing direct financial assistance to only about 1 in 4 families, Booker also proposed requiring that TANF grants focus on families that are most in need.
The campaign would not offer a total cost for Booker's proposal and said that if elected, he would most likely need cooperation from Congress to increase funding levels for government programs. The campaign proposed paying for his plan with a similar method he has cited in other proposals: repealing President Donald Trump's tax cuts and overhauling capital gains taxes and the estate tax.
Some experts questioned the expansive goals and unknown price tag of Booker's plan.
"I think it is totally aspirational," said Susan Neuman, a professor of childhood education at New York University. "You can do some things that really, really make a difference. If you look at the literature on child poverty, you can see that the tax credit is a benefit, providing lunches year round is a benefit. But providing more money for TANF or child care will not change behavior, and I question whether all of these policies are possible to do at one time."

Texto completo: TAKES ONE TO KNOW ONE by Susan Isaacs (Grove Atlantic, 288 pp., $26).
What is it that makes Susan Isaacs' books so delicious to read? She's funny, for starters. And that humor combined with romance and old-fashioned murder mystery tickles every feel-good bone in our bodies. Her characters are whole and flawed and lovable, and you want only the best for them, even as you ardently wish to find them in danger - repeatedly - along the way.
Isaacs, who lives in Sands Point, hit the big time in 1978 with her debut "Compromising Positions." It was the story of Judith Singer, a smart, bored Long Island housewife who becomes enmeshed in the investigation of the murder of a local periodontist and discovers a gift for detective work - and develops an affinity for the lead homicide detective. It is a classic voyage of discovery: the person seeking answers to a mystery discovers her own better self. Witty, perfectly paced, with just enough danger to temper the romance, the novel became a New York Times bestseller and was made into a movie starring Susan Sarandon and Raul Julia. Isaacs, former president of the Mystery Writers of America, has been a major league writer ever since.
In "Takes One to Know One," her 15th novel, Isaacs introduces us to a new detective, semiretired FBI counterterrorism agent Corie Geller who lives on Long Island. Corie combines a background in Arabic literature with a nose for what doesn't seem exactly right, a delicious resumé that should set her up nicely for continuing adventures.
Corie is newly married to a widowed judge named Josh and fully committed to mothering his 14-year-old daughter. In addition, Corie works as a freelance book screener for a number of literary agencies interested in Arabic writers (that Corie considers this a viable job may feel somewhat implausible for publishing freelancers). Perfect marriage to a perfect guy, loads of money, a stepdaughter who loves her - life should be blissful. And it is. It's a little dull, too - echoes of Singer and other Isaacs heroines, women who want more than a safe, picture-perfect life. Women who can't help the way they hunger for adventure.
Each Wednesday, Corie has lunch at a French restaurant in Shorehaven with a group of local freelancers, a way of making connections in her new community that has, so far, failed to generate any true friendships. What it has generated is a sense of suspicion about one of her fellow freelancers, a packaging designer named Pete Delaney who combines a total lack of personality with some odd behavioral habits. He insists on sitting in the same seat at lunch, gaze fixated on his otherwise uninteresting SUV. "As I watched each week, his eyes always returned to one spot in the parking lot: wherever his car happened to be. Weird." And it seems as if he has a new cellphone every week, too. What is Pete so worried about?
Corie's training tells her it's more than simple oddness. "'When something strikes you as weird,' one of the instructors at the academy in Quantico told us, 'do you say, "Now isn't that something?" No. Course not.'" Maybe she's making it up because she's bored. Or maybe because Corie, too, has a secret (her FBI work), she recognizes Pete is hiding something real. And maybe it's a useful way to engage her retired cop father in an investigatory game, a way of luring him out of the depression that has plagued him since he lost his partner on 9/11. In any case, Corie is off on her adventure, and we follow her story with pleasure, secure in the expectation that the generous Susan Isaacs will provide us with a humane, endearing resolution.
In our overwhelming world, it can feel exhausting to step into a book. If the real world is rife with evil, why would reading about fictional crime provide solace? And yet I think that's precisely what a Susan Isaacs novel is for, a safe trip into danger and back again that takes the edge off the worries that beset us. A solved mystery is a set of facts, none of them "alternative." Describing a particular Arabic novel to her Wednesday lunch group, Corie Geller says, "Crime fiction is a way for writers to challenge the powers that be. It talks about injustice." In Isaacs' capable hands, crime is solvable and good wins out. Injustice loses and we, the readers, win.

Texto completo: Rudy Giuliani once was known as "America's mayor," having led New York City and the country through the aftermath of the 9/11 terror attacks.
He now is better known as personal attorney to President Donald Trump. And he again has been thrust into the national spotlight, this time as a central player in the whistleblower saga engulfing the White House.
Giuliani, his contacts with Ukrainian officials on behalf of Trump and his retention of clients with foreign interests are what House Democrats see as key in their impeachment inquiry of Trump.
Democrats are probing whether Trump used his office to seek help from a foreign power against a domestic political rival, Democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden. Their inquiry was sparked by a whistle-blower's report and a call between the Republican president and his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelensky.
Trump in the July 25 conversation asks Zelensky to look into Biden and his son Hunter, according to a partial transcript released by the White House.
Democrats have accused Giuliani, 75, of acting as a rogue agent advancing Trump's personal political interests in a potential abuse of presidential power. They also have said there may be ethical entanglements between the president's vested interests abroad and those of the clients that Giuliani retains through his namesake security firm.
"A central figure"
Giuliani, who served two terms as New York City mayor and made an aborted run for president in 2008, is referenced in the intelligence community whistleblower's complaint as "a central figure" in Trump's use of "the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 U.S. election."
He also is mentioned by name at least six times in the partial transcript of the conversation between Trump and Zelensky. "Rudy very much knows what's happening and he is a very capable guy. If you could speak to him that would be great," Trump tells Zelensky in the call.
Giuliani has asserted that he has done nothing wrong. Trump has maintained that he was doing his duty in rooting out Ukrainian corruption that he says included activities by Biden and his son. A former Ukrainian prosecutor has said there was no wrongdoing by the Bidens.
Last Monday, the Democratic chairmen of the House Intelligence, Foreign Affairs and Oversight committees subpoenaed Giuliani for documents and communications as part of their impeachment inquiry. They wrote that they are considering whether the former mayor acted as "an agent of the President in a scheme to advance his personal political interests by abusing the power of the Office of the President."
The Democrats also sent subpoena letters to three of Giuliani's associates, including Ukrainian-American businessmen Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman.
"A growing public record, including your own statements, indicates that the President, you, and others appear to have pressed the Ukrainian government to pursue two politically motivated investigations," they wrote, citing the prosecution of Ukrainians providing evidence against convicted Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and the investigation into the Ukrainian business dealings of Biden's son, Hunter, and whether the then-vice president shielded his son from investigation.
Traveling as an envoy 
Giuliani has acknowledged in news interviews that he traveled to Madrid, Paris and Warsaw this year to meet with Ukrainian officials. The Madrid trip in early August came just after the Trump-Zelensky call.
The former mayor also had planned a May trip to Kiev, Ukraine, to meet Zelensky but canceled it, telling the New York Times that the Democrats "say I was meddling in the election - ridiculous - but that's their spin." 
Giuliani told Reuters that Trump did not pay for his trips to Madrid, Paris and Warsaw but wouldn't disclose who did.
He also has pushed back on criticism that he was embarking on rogue missions as Trump's personal attorney, saying that he was asked by the State Department to connect with the Ukrainian representatives about their Biden investigation.
Giuliani on Thursday tweeted screenshots of his text exchanges with former U.S. special envoy to Ukraine, Kurt Volker, as Volker testified before House Democrats. Volker resigned after being named in the whistle-blower report as the American diplomat connecting Giuliani with top Zelensky aide Andriy Yermak.
"Volker reached out to me to ask if I would take a call from Mr. Yermak," Giuliani tweeted in one of several posts featuring images of the text conversation.
Volker during his House deposition provided text messages that lay out a plan to tie an audience with Trump and aid to Ukraine with efforts by its government to launch probes into interference in the 2016 U.S. election and the Bidens. Giuliani is a participant in some of the exchanges.
Volker in his opening statement said he warned Giuliani against trusting the Ukrainians in power at the time and said he did not believe the accusation that Biden acted inappropriately to be credible.
Fighting back
The lawyer representing Giuliani in connection to the House Democrats' inquiry would not say whether and how the former mayor will respond to the subpoena.
"We're just evaluating," Miami-based defense attorney Jon Sale told Newsday. "It's a complex issue. There's privilege issues and separation-of-power issues, so I'm just in the beginning of analyzing it."
Sale, who attended law school with Giuliani and served as an assistant special Watergate prosecutor, would not disclose their legal strategy.
He said Friday that he had not yet reviewed Volker's testimony.
Giuliani has reiterated in a flurry of fiery TV interviews and tweets - as Trump has - that the focus should remain on transgressions by the House Democrats, the Bidens and the news media.
He recently said he is considering lawsuits against individual Democratic members of Congress.
"Now it's time to fight back," Giuliani told Fox Business Network on Wednesday. "It's time to hold these people liable for trampling the Constitution of the United States, destroying his (the president's) right to counsel, intimidating his lawyers, threatening to arrest the president's attorney general."
Editor's Note: Volker's statement that he did not believe the accusation that Biden acted inappropriately to be credible was misstated in an earlier versio

Mourning a 'death' in the family The closure of the Biddeford Journal Tribune, which served its community for 135 years, will leave a void.

Texto completo: Journalism is an "ism," meaning that it's a doctrine, a practice, a way of looking at the world.
Its adherents are trained to ask a lot of questions and verify the answers, often by asking more questions of someone else. The facts are assembled and reported to the world, not always to the delight of the people who appear in the stories.
The people drawn to this work make absurd sacrifices of their time and talent, knowing that they are going to infuriate as many people as they please. When I first started as a reporter, I thought other reporters were my enemies. But I soon realized that we were all part of a big, dysfunctional family.
And in Maine, the family is in mourning.
The owner of the Biddeford Journal Tribune announced last week that it will shut down production after a 135-year run. The daily newspaper - an evening paper until two years ago - could not stay ahead of losses in circulation and advertising revenue.
The announcement was made by Masthead Maine, the parent company of the Journal and five other Maine dailies as well as the Maine Sunday Telegram and 25 weeklies - in other words, my bosses. The decision may have been a rational one, but still sad for the people who worked at the Journal and sad for what's left of its readership.
A daily newspaper is a business - at one time a very lucrative business, but not these days. When a business can't keep revenue ahead of expenses, it adapts to the market or it dies.
But a newspaper is not just another business. We can't switch product lines, because the thing we do - journalism - isn't a product. It's an "ism." Good journalism can change a lot of things, but it doesn't make money, and even at the prevailing low wage, it's expensive to produce.
The Journal Tribune is only the latest casualty. According to a 2018 study by the University of North Carolina, one in five American newspapers has shut down since 2004, leaving large parts of the country without any local news coverage, a phenomenon the researchers call "news deserts."
Things are only slightly better in the publications that stay afloat. Newspaper employment has been cut in half since the Great Recession.
Hundreds of publications are officially still in business but are "ghost newspapers," just shadows of their former selves. The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette announced last week that it would produce a newspaper only three days a week.
In other bad newspaper news last week, the Newseum in Washington, D.C., the industry's monument to itself, announced it will permanently shut its doors later this month. When your tombstone goes out of business, folks, it's not a good sign.
Maybe the most alarming number is the decline in readership. Nationally, newspaper circulation has dropped from 122 million in the years before the Great Recession to 73 million last year.
The UNC study cites Nicco Mele, director of the Shorenstein Center for Media, Politics and Public Policy at Harvard University, who predicts that as many as half of the nation's dailies will no longer be in print as soon as 2021 if current rates continue.
If you think like a journalist, you might want to ask a question now. It might be, "So what?"
If people don't want to read the newspaper, they can't be too sad about them disappearing. The internet has made it much easier to get information and publish it. There are many ways for people to get their news, maybe better ways.
Maybe, but I haven't seen it. Every reader's attention span is a finite commodity, and the competition to grab a piece of it is not between different sources of local news.
To keep up, the local newspaper has to be more compelling than The New York Times, Fox News, Hollywood, the world's cutest cat videos and the Twitter feed of a certain world leader who knows how to get everyone's eyes on him.
That's a lot to ask from a story about a controversial zoning amendment.
All across the country, municipal governments, even state legislatures, are doing their business in places where nobody is asking them any questions. Political operatives get to tell their own story, in their own self-serving way.
People may have more information than ever, but we're not better informed.
But we'll have time to mourn representative democracy later. Today our condolences go out to the men and women who put out the Biddeford Journal Tribune.
You hung on for a long time in tough circumstances that were not of your making. You had a good run. We are going to miss you.

Texto completo: If you go to his page, which I try not to, and stare into it like the night sky, sometimes you can catch one in real time.
A Trump tweet that is. You'll have hours of nothing and then WHOOSH , a streak of white hot ignorance cuts through the Twittersphere, leaving behind it a flaming wake of likes and an ever-lengthening streak of comments.
Like most shooting stars, the tweets are just flaming trash en route to either self-immolation or a crash landing, but something about it still captivates us. We've grown somewhat accustomed to the meteor shower of typos, bigotry, provocation, and insouciance flung by President Trump, but we still can't quite believe our eyes.
(And likewise, I often find myself using Trump tweets as occasions to cast wishes into the void of space.)
But lately, the morning dusting of fiery content from the White House seems a bit heavier, the projectiles more weighty and more frequent, their impacts leaving more damage, cratering the discourse. After staring slackjawed at the spectacle of TOTUS (that T is for troll) as the firestorm from his thumbs ramps up, one thing is certain: It's not pretty.
This past week has seen Trump elevate his troll game on Twitter into something that can only be described by an unfortunate term I have no interest in putting here. The term in question designates a social media style that relies on relentless nuisance posting of memes, comments, and unfunny jokes purely as a means of sadistic self-gratification.
KnowYourMeme.com has the most useful summation: “an Internet slang term describing a range of user misbehaviors and rhetoric on forums and message boards that are intended to derail a conversation off-topic, including thread jacking [another word I probably can't put here], and non-commercial spamming."
Random , useless , and unnecessary all spring up in other attempts to define the unprintable term — but more often than not, it tends to be one of those you-know-it-when-you-see-it situations.
Over the past week, we've seen the president perch on his wire to drop messy conspiracy theories about a deep state coup, insult members of Congress, insinuate that his impeachment would trigger a civil war, and perhaps worst of all, share a Nickelback song (since removed for copyright violations; a slight consolation.)
It would all seem like the desperate ravings of the most powerful man in the world who is losing touch with reality in front of 65 million followers if . . . oh wait I guess it does seem like that, doesn't it?
Granted, like many other numbers associated with Trump, his Twitter metrics are the products of wild inflation. Glance at the comments that clog any of his tweets and you'll notice that most of those in his online infantry either have follower counts in the low teens or the hundred-thousands. It's hard to say who is really along for the ride.
But whether you follow him or not (I follow the “Unfollow Trump" account, which posts his tweets without contributing to his count), the fallout from his tweetstorms goes well beyond the browser. His unchecked abuse of the platform authorizes harassment and trolling from the highest levels of our society — revels in it, even. And if the process of removing Trump from office seems unlikely to succeed, let the ongoing attempts to get him kicked off of Twitter show you how it's not done.
Senator, presidential hopeful, and Maya Rudolph impersonator Kamala Harris this week issued a public plea to Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey to remove Trump from the platform for “blatant threats that put people at risk and our democracy in danger" (and, oh yeah, run afoul of the Terms of Service that we all clicked “Sure, fine, whatever" to).
And Recode founder Kara Swisher wrote a searing op-ed in The New York Times titled “Donald Trump Is Too Dangerous for Twitter," in an attempt to galvanize a growing chorus of exhausted, feed-weary users wondering why, if there is indeed a @Jack, does he allow bad things to happen to good tweeters.
“With this latest move by the troller in chief, with no reaction from Twitter, it's official that the medium has been hijacked by those who want to take advantage of its porous and sloppy rules," Swisher wrote. “It is incumbent on the giant social platforms to prevent the president from dangerously weaponizing their tools."
Twitter's standard defense for allowing Trump to run rampant is the newsworthiness of his tweets; and rather than remove Trump's dangerous posts, the fix is rather to affix a “notice" to his most egregious violations that users must click through before seeing the tweet, offered “to provide additional context and clarity." Sort of like a sign posted inside of a burning house to let you know it's on fire.
It's all part of Twitter's mission to “protect the health of the public conversation," whatever that means. In the meantime, not to bury the lead, but the sky is falling. Is that newsworthy?

Texto completo: Standing before thousands of Iowa voters, former Vice President Joe Biden said parents today have different conversations with their children about their future because of
We’re no longer the wealthiest middle class in the world,” he said. Is that true?
Canada rising
Because there is no universally recognized definition of “middle class,” there are various ways to measure the data based on wealth and income.
Biden’s claim tracks back to a 2014 article in the New York Times headlined “The American Middle Class Is No Longer the World’s Richest.”
It’s important to note that while Biden used the word “wealthiest” in his Iowa comment, the article — and most of the economic literature — has focused on income. Income refers to money earned in a period of time, such as a year, while wealth refers to the accumulation of past income and assets.
So they’re not exactly the same thing, but we’ll take a look at the studies on income as the best available approximation.
LIS, a group that maintains the Luxembourg Income Study Database, worked together with the New York Times’ Upshot team to examine data for household income from around the world. The article’s analysis used median income through 2010 as an indicator of the economic status of the middle class.
The new champion of middle class wealth, the article predicted, was Canada. The New York Times wrote that median income in Canada pulled into a tie with median United States income in 2010 and that Canada had most likely surpassed it since then. Median incomes in Western Europe still trailed the United States, but the gap had narrowed.
The New York Times attributed the findings to a few factors: U.S. educational attainment rose more slowly than elsewhere in the industrialized world, U.S. companies distributed less profits to workers, and Americans received meager raises.
The data showed that when examining the 50th percentile of income, the United States was strongly ahead of other nations in 1980. But by 2010, Canada and Norway caught up to the United States.
Middle class data from other organizations
Other groups have worked on this middle-class comparison, with similar findings of a U.S. retreat. The Pew Research Center, for example, compared the United States with 11 Western European countries based on the median (after-tax) household income of each country.
In 2013, the national median disposable income for a three-person household in the United States was $52,195, behind Luxembourg ($65,293) and Norway ($57,031). (The income numbers were adjusted for differences in the cost of living across countries, using 2011 prices.)
In 1991, the United State and Luxembourg were considered equally on top. (The difference of a few hundred dollars is not statistically significant.)
However, comparing the median income in Luxembourg and the United States may not be an ideal comparison, because their economies and populations are so vastly different (600,000 Luxembourgians versus 327 million Americans).
Another source on this question is the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a consortium of about three dozen member countries that share internationally comparable data.
According to 2016 data used by the OECD, the United States had the fourth-largest median income among OECD countries behind Luxembourg, Norway and Switzerland.
Using middle-class size, not wealth
Aside from wealth, economists also use size as a way to examine a country’s middle class.
OECD’s analysis on the middle class found that the share of people in the U.S. middle-income class — just over 50% — is much smaller than in most OECD countries. OECD defined middle class as 75-200 percent of median income.
OECD also found that the U.S. middle-income class has grown smaller with each successive decade.
Janet C. Gornick, a professor at the CUNY Graduate Center and director of the US Office of LIS, said that the middle class has hollowed out in several industrialized countries including the United States since the 1980s.
The share of the middle class — defined as non-elderly households with income between half and twice the median income — shrunk by about 2 percentage points between 1985 and 2013 in the United States.
Our ruling
Biden said, “We’re no longer the wealthiest middle class in the world.”

Google Is Asked if Homeless Black People Were Targets

Texto completo: Atlanta officials are seeking answers from Google after a news report said that company contractors had sought out black homeless people in the city to scan their faces to improve Google's facial-recognition technology.
The New York Daily News reported on Wednesday that a staffing agency hired by Google had sent its contractors to numerous American cities to target black people for facial scans. One unnamed former worker told the newspaper that in Atlanta, the effort included finding those who were homeless because they were less likely to speak to the media.
On Friday, Nina Hickson, Atlanta's city attorney, sent a letter to Google asking for an explanation.
"The possibility that members of our most vulnerable populations are being exploited to advance your company's commercial interest is profoundly alarming for numerous reasons," she said in a letter to Kent Walker, Google's legal and policy chief. "If some or all of the reporting was accurate, we would welcome your response as what corrective action has been and will be taken."
Google said it had hired contractors to scan the faces of volunteers to improve software that would enable users to unlock Google's new phone simply by looking at it. The company immediately suspended the research and began investigating after learning of the details in The Daily News article, a Google spokesman said.
"We're taking these claims seriously," he said in a statement.
The dust-up is the latest scrutiny of tech companies' development of facial-recognition technology. Critics say that such technology can be abused by governments or bad actors and that it has already shown signs of bias. Some facial-recognition software has struggled with dark-skinned people.
But even companies' efforts to improve the software and prevent such bias are proving controversial, as it requires the large-scale collection of scans and images of real people's faces.
Google said it hired contractors from a staffing agency named Randstad for the research. Google wanted the contractors to collect a diverse sample of faces to ensure that its software would work for people of all skin tones, two Google executives said in an email to colleagues on Thursday. A company spokesman provided the email to The New York Times.
"Our goal in this case has been to ensure we have a fair and secure feature that works across different skin tones and face shapes," the Google executives said in the email.
The unnamed person who told The Daily News that Randstad sent the contractors to Atlanta to focus on black homeless people also told the newspaper that a Google manager was not present when that order was made. A second unnamed contractor told The Daily News that employees were instructed to locate homeless people and university students in California because they would probably be attracted to the $ 5 gift cards volunteers received in exchange for their facial scans.
Randstad manages a work force of more than 100,000 contractors in the United States and Canada each week. The company, which is based in the Netherlands and has operations in 38 countries, did not respond to requests for comment. Google relies heavily on contract and temporary workers; they now outnumber its full-time employees.
Several unnamed people who worked on the facial recognition project told The Daily News that Randstad managers urged the contractors to mislead participants in the study, including by rushing them through consent forms and telling them that the phone scanning their faces was not recording.
The Google executives did not confirm those details in their email. They said that the tactics described in the article were "very disturbing." Google instructed its contractors to be "truthful and transparent" with volunteers in the study by obtaining their consent and ensuring they knew why Google was collecting the data, the executives said in the email.
"Transparency is obviously important, and it is absolutely not okay to be misleading with participants," they said.
A Google spokesman said that the volunteers' facial scans were encrypted and only used for the research, and deleted once the research is completed.
In 2017, an Apple executive told Congress that the company developed its facial-recognition software using more than a billion images, including facial scans collected in its own research studies.
"We worked with participants from around the world to include a representative group of people accounting for gender, age, ethnicity and other factors," the executive said.

Texto completo: NEW YORK • Diahann Carroll, the Oscar-nominated actress and singer who won critical acclaim as the first black woman to star in a non-servant role in a TV series as "Julia," has died. She was 84.
Carroll's daughter, Susan Kay, told The Associated Press her mother died Friday in Los Angeles of cancer.
During her long career, Carroll earned a Tony Award for the musical "No Strings" and an Academy Award nomination for best actress for "Claudine."
But she was perhaps best known for her pioneering work on "Julia." Carroll played Julia Baker, a nurse whose husband had been killed in Vietnam, in the groundbreaking situation comedy that aired from 1968 to 1971.
"Diahann Carroll walked this earth for 84 years and broke ground with every footstep. An icon. One of the all-time greats," director Ava DuVernay wrote on Twitter. "She blazed trails through dense forests and elegantly left diamonds along the path for the rest of us to follow. Extraordinary life. Thank you, Ms. Carroll."
Although she was not the first black woman to star in her own TV show (Ethel Waters played a maid in the 1950s series "Beulah"), she was the first to star as someone other than a servant.
NBC executives were wary about putting "Julia" on the network during the racial unrest of the 1960s, but it was an immediate hit.
It had its critics, though, including some who said Carroll's character, who is the mother of a young son, was not a realistic portrayal of a black American woman in the 1960s.
"They said it was a fantasy," Carroll recalled in 1998. "All of this was untrue. Much about the character of Julia I took from my own life, my family."
Not shy when it came to confronting racial barriers, Carroll won her Tony portraying a high-fashion American model in Paris who has a love affair with a white American author in the 1959 Richard Rodgers musical "No Strings." Critic Walter Kerr described her as "a girl with a sweet smile, brilliant dark eyes and a profile regal enough to belong on a coin."
She appeared often in plays previously considered exclusive territory for white actresses: "Same Time, Next Year," ''Agnes of God" and "Sunset Boulevard" (as faded star Norma Desmond, the role played by Gloria Swanson in the 1950 film.)
"I like to think that I opened doors for other women, although that wasn't my original intention," she said in 2002.
Her film career was sporadic. She began with a secondary role in "Carmen Jones" in 1954 and five years later appeared in "Porgy and Bess," although her singing voice was dubbed because it wasn't considered strong enough for the Gershwin opera. Her other films included "Goodbye Again," ''Hurry Sundown," ''Paris Blues," and "The Split."
The 1974 film "Claudine" provided her most memorable role. She played a hard-bitten single mother of six who finds romance in Harlem with a garbage man played by James Earl Jones. Carroll says she got the role after the intended lead actress, Diana Sands, became sick and insisted her friend take the role (Sands died in 1973). But Carroll said those behind the movies did not see her in the role because of her work in Julia and made her audition without makeup.
"Give me a chance. Just give me the opportunity to show you that I understand," she recalled telling them in an interview with the National Visionary Leadership Project. "I'm an actress, singer, from New York City, from the streets of New York, and I pride myself on my work ... I would like to be given the opportunity to stretch my wings."
She would end up being nominated for her Oscar, and she recalled the filming a magical experience.
"I had such a good time, I almost told them you don't need to pay me," she added.
In the 1980s, she joined in the long-running prime-time soap opera "Dynasty" as Dominique Deveraux, the glamorous half-sister of Blake Carrington; her physical battles with Alexis Carrington, played by Joan Collins, were among fan highlights. Another memorable role was Marion Gilbert, as the haughty mother of Whitley Gilbert (played by Jasmine Guy) on the TV series "A Different World."
"Diahann Carroll you taught us so much. We are stronger, more beautiful and risk takers because of you. We will forever sing your praises and speak your name. Love Love Love, Debbie," wrote actress, dancer and director Debbie Allen, who was a producer on "A Different World."
More recently, she had a number of guest shots and small roles in TV series, including playing the mother of Isaiah Washington's character, Dr. Preston Burke, on "Grey's Anatomy" and a stretch on the TV show "White Collar" as the widow June.
She also returned to her roots in nightclubs. In 2006, she made her first club appearance in New York in four decades, singing at Feinstein's at the Regency. Reviewing a return engagement in 2007, a New York Times critic wrote that she sang "Both Sides Now" with "the reflective tone of a woman who has survived many severe storms and remembers every lightning flash and thunderclap."
Carol Diann Johnson was born in New York City and attended the High School for the Performing Arts. Her father was a subway conductor and her mother a homemaker. She recalls when she was around 3 or 4, her parents took her to an aunt in North Carolina and left her in the care of her aunt, without notice, for a year She said it took a long time to forgive her parents, though she eventually did, and was there for them in their later years.
"It happened, it's over, it's done. A mature person finds a way to let go of that," she told OWN's "Masterclass in an interview a few years ago. "They did a lot of wonderful things. They lived, gave me everything they possibly could, and they passed on."
She began her career as a model in a segregated industry; she got much of her work due to publications like the black magazine Ebony. A prize from "Arthur Godfrey's Talent Scouts" TV show led to nightclub engagements.
In her 1998 memoir "Diahann," Carroll traced her turbulent romantic life, which included liaisons with Harry Belafonte, Duke Ellington, Miles Davis, Sammy Davis Jr., Sidney Poitier and David Frost. She even became engaged to Frost, but the engagement was canceled.
An early marriage to nightclub owner Monte Kay resulted in Carroll's only child, Suzanne, as well as a divorce. She also divorced her second husband, retail executive Freddie Glusman, later marrying magazine editor Robert DeLeon, who died.
Her most celebrated marriage was in 1987, to singer Vic Damone, and the two appeared together in nightclubs. But they separated in 1991 and divorced several years later.
After she was treated for breast cancer in 1998, she spoke out for more money for research and for free screening for women who couldn't afford mammograms.
"We all look forward to the day that mastectomies, chemotherapy and radiation are considered barbaric," Carroll told a gathering in 2000.
Besides her daughter, she is survived by grandchildren August and Sydney.

Texto completo: Uh-oh, I'm 30 seconds into my phone call with Tony Danza and I've already got him riled up.
"Don't call me 'sir,' " Danza exclaims. "Young whippersnapper, I'm already mad at you."
There's a chuckle behind the Brooklyn-inflected words, though, and that's how a conversation with the affable star goes. Within moments, it's like you're joshing with an old neighborhood pal - not interviewing a star who endeared himself to America on not one but two long-running sitcoms, first as kind-hearted boxer Tony Banta on TV's "Taxi" and then as streetwise yet sensitive housekeeper Tony Micelli on "Who's the Boss?"
Danza will bring his evening of "Standards and Stories" on Oct. 5 to the Clermont Performing Arts Center. Don't worry: Danza won't be surprised if you were unaware he's a song-and-dance man.
"I think I hid in plain sight for a long time," he says.
He starred in Broadway musicals "The Producers" and "Honeymoon in Vegas," earning a rave review from The New York Times for the latter. He has toured regularly with his band, which will accompany him in Clermont.
It all started coming together back in 2015, when he had the chance to perform at Café Carlyle, the well-known nightspot in a deluxe hotel on New York's Upper East Side. It had been a longtime dream.
"I could see the Carlyle from my apartment," Danza says. "It aggravated me, it haunted me."
There was only a minor hitch: "I didn't have an act, and I didn't have a music director," he says. He reached out to a friend with a desperate request: "Do you know someone who could arrange 20 songs in about three and a half weeks?"
As it turned out, he did: John Otto, a music director for Rosemary Clooney, came to the rescue. And a show was born. Danza gives Otto a lot of the credit for "Standards and Stories," saying "it was a combination of me trying to do a more mature act and him coming into my life."
Danza is certainly not shy about heaping praise on his friends and colleagues. He throws out compliments with genuine, warm-hearted enthusiasm.
On Judith Light, his leading lady on "Who's the Boss?": "You know how good of an actress she is? She can cry out one eye at a time."
He's thrilled about her recent star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. "She's knockin' 'em dead," he says.
And he credits her skill at playing uptight Angela, Tony's employer on the 1980s sitcom, for contributing to his own success. "I don't know where I'd be if it weren't for Judith Light. It's all about your partner. If you don't have that person, that chemistry, it's all over."
On Josh Groban, his most recent TV partner: "He works hard ... you see it when you look in his eyes."
On their recent Netflix show "The Good Cop," "We had a ball," Danza says. "I thought it was a counterweight to all the darker stuff."
Danza has a theory on why the show won't be returning: "He was fighting, and I was singing," he says with a laugh. "There's something wrong with that picture."
He's still plenty busy. Besides the concert tour, he stays heavily involved with New York City's Police Athletic League, especially its Cops and Kids Chorus. "They're singing the national anthem Oct. 4 at the Yankees game," he tells me proudly.
After all, you can't take the Brooklyn out of the boy.
He casually mentions how he's "making sauce" while waiting for his upcoming shows. The glamour of the Carlyle Hotel still excites him as much as performing there.
"They give you an embroidered, monogrammed pillowcase," he says incredulously. "I steal it immediately!" - then that hearty laugh again - "No, they let you have it."
At this stage in his life, the 68-year-old isn't taking anything for granted. He and the band have a ritual before each "Standards and Stories" performance.
"When we put our heads together before the shows, I look around and think, 'This is fantastic, but it ain't gonna last forever,' " he says seriously. "We gotta enjoy every moment we get to do this."

The train line where Brooklyn was raised

Texto completo: Al Zelazo can still remember how the wooden platform would sway on the old Myrtle Avenue El.
"The first time up there I said, 'Dad, what's that?!' As a kid you're nervous," said Zelazo, who grew up in Brooklyn. "'Oh, that's just the El leaving Bridge-Jay Streets,' he would say. You could tell when the train got moving again. The whole structure would shake."
Friday marks the 50th anniversary of the death of the old El, which at one point linked commuters from Ridgewood, Glendale and Maspeth to parts of downtown Brooklyn and lower Manhattan, rumbling over the Brooklyn Bridge. There is still an arm of the abandoned section reaching out from Bushwick, hanging over a block of Myrtle Avenue west of Broadway.
Zelazo, known as "Subway Al," is a retired PATH worker who sells train memorabilia. He rode the train on occasion with his father. It was the only rapid transit line still using wooden cars at the time; their rattan seats and canvas straps were a draw as a novelty.
"We would go just to ride it and ride the wooden cars," he said.
But the general public sentiment wasn't as rosy. Many viewed the Els as antiquated as subways and private automobiles proliferated and that notion helped lead to the demise of the elevated lines across the city, including along Myrtle Avenue.
"What happens with the Myrtle Avenue El kind of parallels what was happening in Brooklyn - ridership peaked in the 1920s," said Rob DelBagno, the New York Transit Museum's manager of exhibitions. "The 20s is a prosperous time and how people are moving around in the late 1920s is really changing fast. The subway system is expanding and people are buying cars."
The Els were unbearably loud and cast a shadow over streets storefronts. Officials at the time would promote their removal as an effort to "open up the sky."
But the Myrtle El, built and opened in 1888, was a key complement of the Brooklyn Bridge to help facilitate the development of deeper parts of Brooklyn and Queens - like Bushwick and Ridgewood - before either were incorporated as boroughs of New York City.
At the time areas like Brooklyn Heights had been established as well as what were akin to little villages, like Williamsburg. The elevated line's first few stops passed through other established areas, too, like what's now Fort Greene and Cobble Hill.
"But the rest of the trip going into what's now Bushwick and Ridgewood, Queens - those places barely existed at that point," said DelBagno. "It had a huge effect on Brooklyn. Industrial Williamsburg grew around the El, residential Ridgewood, Queens, grew around the El. It had a big effect in the late 19th century and early 20th century."
But when the depression hit, the bustling waterfront economy was disappearing and without jobs fewer commuters had reason to take the El to Brooklyn's piers and warehouses. Ridership saw an uptick briefly, during World War II, when the Brooklyn Navy Yard became the borough's largest employer. But when the war was over, ridership fell off hard. As other Els were torn down, it seemed to be only a matter of time for Myrtle's demise.
Joe Raskin, author of The Routes Not Taken: A Trip Through New York City's Unbuilt Subway System, said officials had disregarded maintenance of the Els, sealing their fate.
"The powers at be chose not to maintain it and it became what was a self-fulfilling prophecy," he said. "'It's not going to accomplish anything to repair it, so let's not repair it.' And then look at what happened."
A newer section of the Myrtle Avenue El built at the start of World War I is still operational and serves the M running into Middle Village. The rest of the line was replaced by bus service, and arguably the G line and the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway.
The Transit Authority announced the closure of the Myrtle Avenue El abruptly, the summer before it shuttered. William Ronan, the authority's chairman at the time, touted the opening of "a 35-block stretch of Myrtle Avenue to light and air."
In 1968 the authority collected 4.5 million fares combined at the eight stations that were shuttered. The Myrtle-Willoughby Avenues station of the G train, for example, brought in roughly three times as many fares in 2018 than the average shuttered station along Myrtle Avenue El in 1968.
"The closure of the Els really added stress to the streets and existing transit system," said Raskin. "And if you think of what's going on now with the L train, the Myrtle El could have really provided an alternative service."
Myrtle's demise did not come without protest. Small groups of residents picketed outside of the city's Board of Transportation offices. Queens commuters pleaded for a reopening at a 1970 public hearing, saying the replacement bus service doubled their trip times, according to a report in The New York Times.
The closure of the El, as well as the construction of the BQE in the mid-20th century, ended up taking a toll on the surrounding neighborhoods for years.
"The construction of the BQE took out a city-block-wide stretch all the way through Brooklyn," said DelBagno, "And at the same time you don't have the ridership on the Myrtle Avenue El. Restaurants and bars that used to be along the El all went out of business and all of those neighborhoods really had a downturn for several decades."
The lasting legacy of the Myrtle El is the beautiful brownstones that popped up along the route in the 1880s and 1890s said DelBagno.
Just as New Yorkers do today, riders flocked to the Myrtle El for its last run. A banner was attached to the front of the train bidding it farewell. One rider was photographed with a train car's rattan seat on his shoulder as he hauled it away.
"I rode it just to ride it, knowing it was coming to an end," said Ed Gerson, 74, who was born in Brooklyn, living in Flatbush at the time.
It was a week before the Myrtle's closure and Gerson's first and last trip on the line.
"I probably rode from Broadway to Bridge-Jay Streets," said Gerson. "I wanted to be able to say I was on it. I'm not a sentimental person, but it was fun."

Just one more thing for a mom to do: Time

Texto completo: It's always the mom, isn't it? Driving the carpool, rushing forgotten sneakers to school in time for gym, baking at midnight for tomorrow's teacher-appreciation breakfast.
And now, going to the clink.
Yes, it's true that Felicity Huffman committed a crime. She paid $15,000 to get her daughter a better SAT score, and in the process cheated everyone who's playing by the rules.
But now that Huffman is bracing for two weeks in federal prison while the uncharged William H. Macy plays the supportive husband — holding her hand as she walks drawn and somber into a Boston court for sentencing, writing an emotional letter to the judge (“Watching Felicity being a mother is a wonderful thing to see") — some say a second injustice has occurred.
She's being vilified and he isn't.
“It's the same jacked-up scenario of when a dad shows up at school to help in the classroom and suddenly he's a hero," said Sherry Kuehl, author of the Snarky in the Suburbs books. “Or when a dad posts a picture on social media where he's doing his daughter's hair and the Internet explodes with warm, fuzzy accolades.
“She's getting all the daughter angst," Kuehl added. “For the rest of Huffman's life, her daughter will always have the comeback of, 'Well, what about when you didn't believe in me and thought you had to lie to get me into college?' Meanwhile, the dad is sitting pretty."
(To the many dads who are in fact equal parenting partners, we'd like to acknowledge you here. Thank you!)
What's going on? Why was Huffman arrested at gunpoint by FBI agents in an early morning raid at her Los Angeles home in March, while Macy has (so far, at least) escaped charges?
Lawyers have their theories (which we'll touch on later) and moms have theirs.
Theory number one, voiced by a surprising number of women, stems from the fact that Macy, while definitely supportive, seems removed from the kids, as if he were a very nice second husband who came along when the girls were in high school.
“It seriously made me wonder whether he's the real father," said Shari Noe.
(He is.)
Noe, a Newton psychologist who helps diagnose learning disabilities and attention deficit disorders, sees many families where the mother takes on the vast majority of child rearing responsibilities, a job that starts when the kids are born and continues through the college application process.
“Not that I'm supporting her," Noe said, “but you see these moms that get uber crazy in the process."
Indeed, Huffman said as much herself in a Sept. 4 letter she submitted to US District Judge Indira Talwani. After the mastermind of the college bribery scandal, Rick Singer, suggested that she pay to have a proctor improve her daughter's SAT score, Huffman wrote:
“I couldn't make up my mind for six weeks. . . . I felt an urgency which built to a sense of panic. . . . As warped as this sounds now, I honestly began to feel that maybe I would be a bad mother if I didn't do what Mr. Singer was suggesting."
Theory number two, which is also erroneous, is that Huffman kept the caper secret from Macy. Perhaps whispering on the phone with the crooked college coach while Macy lolled about elsewhere in the mansion in ignorant bliss.
“Mothers do all sorts of things that their partners are unaware of, especially when it comes to micromanaging their children," said Michelle Ephraim, an associate professor of English at Worcester Polytechnic Institute, and the mother of four.
The secrecy, she said, stems from the desire to avoid a fight with a spouse. “College admissions gets into our deepest fears and anxieties, and it's very easy to get into an argument" over different strategies, she said.
As for Macy's so-called ignorance? “I think sometimes husbands learn not to ask about things," she said. “It's a 'don't ask, don't tell' policy."
Considering their different trajectories — Huffman's next wardrobe call will be a fitting for a prison uniform while Macy is awaiting the November premiere of the 10th season of his hit show “Shameless" — the only thing that would seem fair is if he were ignorant of the shenanigans.
But as media outlets have reported, references in the prosecution's criminal complaint suggest that Macy — identified in the complaint as “her spouse" or “Spouse" — was not only aware of the plans, but a participant in at least some of them.
Seeking to explain the prosecutors' reasoning, Rebecca Roiphe, a former prosecutor and a professor at New York Law School, told The New York Times that, “The bottom line on Macy was that he seemed to have been less involved in the conduct. There is no doubt that the conduct could have been charged, but prosecutors use their discretion all the time, and decide not to charge somebody because they consider it either unfair or not worth the resources."
Once again, mom's the one on the job!

Texto completo: A conservative, he helped steer his country away from a leftist course after a dictatorship was ousted. He was later president of the U.N. General Assembly.
Diogo Freitas do Amaral, a conservative politician who played a leading role in cementing democracy in Portugal after the so-called Carnation Revolution in 1974, and who was later president of the United Nations General Assembly, has died. He was 78.
The government announced his death on Thursday without providing further details. Portuguese news outlets said he had been hospitalized recently in Cascais, a coastal resort town outside Lisbon. Some reports said he had lived there.
Mr. Freitas do Amaral was a founder and the first leader of the Christian Democratic Party, which was formed barely three months after an army coup on April 25, 1974. The coup leaders ousted a dictatorship that had been set up in the 1930s by António Salazar and promised to introduce parliamentary democracy.
But though they had the support of most of the population, their ambitions were slowed by political turmoil.
The coup, in which almost no shots were fired, became known as the Carnation Revolution after a restaurant worker and pacifist, Celeste Caeiro, offered carnations to the soldiers as civilians took to the streets to celebrate. Carnations were placed in the muzzles of the soldiers' rifles and on their uniforms.
Mr. Freitas do Amaral's party helped balance the far-left fervor, led by the Portuguese Communist Party, that surged after the dictatorship's ouster. He played a central role in helping to steer Portugal away from its radical course in the post-revolution years, which coincided with the Cold War and triggered fears in Western Europe and the United States that the country, a member of NATO, might align with Moscow.
This year, President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa described Mr. Freitas do Amaral as "one of the fathers of Portuguese democracy." In 1980, The New York Times described him as "every inch a congenial but strict disciplinarian." But in 2005, three decades after his founding role, he was shunned by the party he helped create when he accepted the post of foreign minister in a Socialist Party government. Christian Democrat officials took down his photograph from a wall in their Lisbon headquarters and mailed it across town to the Socialist Party.
Mr. Freitas do Amaral said he was never again invited to a party event.
After Portugal's first parliamentary elections with universal suffrage in 1976, Mr. Freitas do Amaral served in a series of governments as deputy prime minister, foreign minister and defense minister. He was a key member of the Democratic Alliance, which drew moderates from various parties to stand together in a 1979 election. The Alliance won a majority in parliament.
In 1980, as both deputy prime minister and foreign minister, he briefly became head of government when Prime Minister Francisco Sá Carneiro, a 46-year-old Social Democrat, was killed along with six others when their small plane crashed into a house after taking off from Lisbon Airport on its way to a political rally.
Mr. Freitas do Amaral, a professor of law, was a driving force behind a new constitution approved in 1982. The initial post-revolution constitution of 1976 was inspired by Marxism, calling for the nationalization of the means of production. It also provided for the coup's military leaders to have an unelected power-sharing role in government.
The 1982 reform removed the ideological references, closed the military's path to power, opened up the economy and created a Constitutional Court.
Mr. Freitas do Amaral narrowly lost the 1986 presidential election to the Socialist Party candidate Mario Soares, capturing 49 percent of the vote. As president of the United Nations General Assembly from 1995 to 1996, he pressed member nations, especially the United States, to pay their outstanding dues. He loudly opposed the United States-led invasion of Iraq in 2003.
Mr. Freitas do Amaral was born on July 21, 1941, in Póvoa de Varzim, a small town in northern Portugal. He received a law degree from the University of Lisbon in 1963 and a Ph.D. in public law and international law in 1967.
He and his wife, Maria José Salgado Sarmento de Matos, were said to have had four children. No information on survivors was immediately available.
The government said it would declare a national day of mourning on the day of Mr. Freitas do Amaral's funeral, which had yet to be arranged.

Texto completo: He minced no words when he wrote about classical music, which for most of his career he did for The Los Angeles Times.
Martin Bernheimer, a classical music critic noted for witty, withering writing that won him a Pulitzer Prize in 1982, died on Sunday at his home in Manhattan. He was 83.
The cause was sarcoma, his wife, the theater critic Linda Winer, said.
"Historically," Mr. Bernheimer wrote in the Financial Times in 2008, "the best critics have guarded standards, stimulated debate and, in the complex process, reinforced the importance of art in society. They have been tastemakers, taskmasters and possibly ticket-sellers. Some have even written well."
Mr. Bernheimer certainly did. Few classical music critics in the United States since Virgil Thomson possessed his way with words, or his eagerness to wield them without mercy.
Luciano Pavarotti? "The overhype tenor of the century."
Lorin Maazel? "He knows how to capitalize on his limitations."
An opera by Nico Muhly? "Eine kleine pretty-music."
Mr. Bernheimer mostly lent what one colleague called his "special, feisty, demanding, informed and unyielding voice" to The Los Angeles Times, which he joined as chief critic and music editor in 1965. He stayed until 1996. The Pulitzer jury cited his writing on a "wide variety of subjects and targets."
Opera was Mr. Bernheimer's first love, but his main quarry was the Los Angeles Philharmonic, an orchestra he watched grow from a respectable ensemble into one with claims to top-echelon status. Zubin Mehta was on the podium when Mr. Bernheimer arrived at the paper.
"Although Mehta never had difficulty pleasing the casual concertgoer," Mr. Bernheimer wrote in 1978, upon Mr. Mehta's departure for the New York Philharmonic, "he did not always make a minority of hard-core aficionados ecstatic. They recognized his penchant for the superficial effect, his willingness to cheapen a subtle impulse, his tendency to exaggerate, his weakness (or is it strength?) for bombast and disinclination for subtle introspection."
Even a decade earlier, Mr. Bernheimer's reviews had drawn the ire of Dorothy Buffum Chandler, the philanthropist whose name graced the orchestra's hall at the time. When she pressured her son, Otis Chandler, the publisher of The Los Angeles Times, to fire his critic, Mr. Chandler refused, and took out an advertisement in his own paper, declaring that the critic "faces the music, even when it hurts."
By 1977, eight years after the arrival of Ernest Fleischmann as the orchestra's executive director, The New York Times reported that "a first-class old-fashioned war" between the critic and the executive had broken out. Mr. Fleischmann accused Mr. Bernheimer of "curmudgeonly, slick, superficial outpourings" that had a "demoralizing, depressing effect" on musicians. Mr. Bernheimer retorted that a critic ought not be a "cheering section." Twelve years later, he called Mr. Fleischmann "the Tyrant of the Philharmonic."
Mr. Bernheimer's reputation tended to overshadow the praise he voiced when he felt it was deserved. "We won't have Zubin Mehta to kick around any more," he lamented in 1978; "in spite of everything, we will miss him."
Even Mr. Fleischmann found that bombs sometimes came wrapped in ribbons. "He is aggressive, demanding, autocratic, egocentric and, under the right circumstances, very good at his job," Mr. Bernheimer allowed in 1989.
Charles Champlin, a fellow critic at The Times, wrote in a 1982 appreciation that despite his reputation, "caring is in fact at the heart of Bernheimer's reviewing," for his "love of music is one of the most passionate romances of our time."
Martin Bernheimer was born on Sept. 28, 1936, into a Jewish family in Munich. His mother, Louise (Nassauer) Bernheimer, was an artist; his father, Paul, was a partner at Haus Bernheimer, a prominent antiques business in Munich. After the family business was damaged on Kristallnacht, when synagogues and Jewish businesses, homes and schools were attacked, Paul and his brothers were sent to Dachau, but they later managed to go free.
As war broke out in Europe, Mr. Bernheimer and his parents left for the United States and settled in Norton, Mass., within driving distance of Boston. There he saw his first opera, "Carmen."
"In retrospect, it was probably a pretty lackluster performance," he told Brown Alumni Magazine in an interview in 2012, "but I was struck by the fusion of drama and music."
Naturalized in 1946, Mr. Bernheimer graduated from Brown University in 1958 with an honors degree in music before further studies at the Hochschule für Musik in Munich and at New York University, where he earned an M.A. in 1961. By then he was on the staff of The New York Herald Tribune.
Mr. Bernheimer joined The Los Angeles Times after spells at The New York Post, The Musical Courier and Saturday Review. He won the prestigious Ascap Deems Taylor Award for writing about music twice, in 1974 and 1978, and served successively on the faculties of the University of Southern California, the University of California, Los Angeles, and other nearby colleges. He appeared regularly on the Metropolitan Opera's national radio broadcasts.
Mr. Bernheimer married Ms. Winer in 1992. His first marriage, to Lucinda Pearson in 1961, ended in divorce. In addition to his wife, he is survived by four children from his first marriage, Mark, Erika and Marina Bernheimer and Nora Caruso; and four grandchildren.
Later in life, Mr. Bernheimer became a mentor for several young critics. Simon Chin, who has written for The Washington Post, said in an email that Mr. Bernheimer "was the most unfailingly generous, supportive and insightful mentor I could have asked for."
Mr. Bernheimer had been fortunate to make his mark while newspapers were strong and classical music had greater popular cachet, but he came to lament the decline of criticism more broadly.
"With newspapers round the U.S. shrinking at best, disappearing at worst," he wrote in the Financial Times in 2010, "critics have become an endangered species." (Dodos, he specified elsewhere.) But if expertise like his was at risk, he insisted, there should be no retreat into fandom.
"Critics, antagonists claim, should be objective," Mr. Bernheimer wrote in 2008. "No way."

Texto completo: Samin Nosrat's laugh is delightful and infectious. It's the kind of warm uninhibited chorus that makes you feel not only like you've known the New York Times best-selling author for years, but also that she couldn't be more happy to talk with you today.
This charming, approachable persona is an undeniable part of the reason why Nostrat's Netflix series "Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat" — inspired by her James Beard Award-winning book of the same name — has been hailed for changing the food show landscape forever.
In the four-part series, viewers see Nosrat lose herself in the pleasure of a piece of aged Parmesan cheese, giggle as her eyes water while chopping onions and do an adorable happy dance with a friend as they devour a dish while standing around the kitchen counter.
It's a show that's as much about food, where it comes from and how to make it, as it is about watching someone simply enjoy it.
The show premiered on the streaming platform almost a year ago, and Nosrat's been busy in the intervening months. She's already begun work on a second series and thinking about her next book, "What to Cook."
She's also hitting the road, crisscrossing the country for evening events during which she chats with local hosts about food, cooking and anything else that might come up when she fields questions from the audience.
We chatted with the author, TV star and chef about what fans can expect.
Question: So, what can people expect from this tour?
Answer: We basically laugh a lot (laughs) and then, I mean, each conversation is different, which is something I really love about it.
One thing I'm really excited about that is that I edited this year's edition of "Best American Food Writing." I was pretty riled up when I was doing the editing and writing the forward but what I'm excited about is I think it will rile people up when they read it. I did my best to highlight all sorts of different issues beyond what we just consider to be food and I'm really excited to get to talk about the wonderful diversity of the writing.
The other thing I'm thinking so much about is climate change and how food affects and is affected by it.
I have been reading a lot about climate change and agriculture and food and I feel like — and I'm so hesitant to say this, but I gotta start saying it somewhere — I feel like the only responsible thing for me to do is become a daytime vegan. And I really don't want to. Like I really don't want to but I feel like it's something I have to do and I feel like it's what I need to, not necessarily bully other people into doing, but at least model for people. Changing out diets is the single most powerful thing we as individuals can do.
It's both depressing and exciting. (laughs)
Why getting a show was a 'whiplash moment' Q: It sounds like you maybe have been thinking about using your platform to be an activist? Or raise awareness, maybe?
A: I wouldn't use the word "activist." I still do have a relationship with the New York Times so I have not fully jumped into activism. But I do think education and awareness is really important and it's my job.
I found out that Netflix was interested in the show two days after the 2016 election and it was a really hard time for me. I really felt that that election said to me, personally, that people who look like you are not wanted here. So I was sort of sitting with the grief of that and then found out this thing two days later.
It was a really whiplash moment for me and I took it really seriously and thought really carefully about whether I wanted to put myself in the public eye when the public had made it clear that people who look like me or are from the part of the world that my family is from are not necessarily considered American or welcome here.
I did in the end decide that I did want to do it and I was like, OK if I am going to do this then I'm going to use it to promote the kind of message that's really important to me, which is one of unity and sharing with people my ultimate belief that we are more similar than different across the world.
So I don't know that I would use the word "activist" necessarily, but I do think that there are so many things in our daily lives that feel really overwhelming. Changing a habit is really hard. I get how hard it is. I have my own really conflicted decisions about changing the way I eat and yet my brain understands that it's what we all have to do. Or it's what I have to do at least.
What being 'daytime vegan' means Q: But vegan? I don't know if I could give up cheese...
A: Well, the thing is it's daytime vegan (laughs)
Q: So, only when the sun is up?
A: Totally. Basically, statistically, if you give up animal products for two of your meals, you end up using less carbon than if you're a full-time vegetarian. I think if I fully had to give up cheese and dairy and butter it would just be like, I couldn't. I would die.
One of the books I've been reading is by my friend Jonathan Safran Foer. He has a new climate change book coming out, and he proposes this and his whole book is about his own personal difficulty with it and also the understanding that if you don't do it, you're just a person who didn't do something when the moment required it.
Q: I know you're working on another book. Can you share anything about what people can expect in "What to Cook"?
A: Yeah! I mean to be completely honest I have not actually started working on it because I am going to make another TV series first. I'm in the sort of development part, which is like the brainstorm part of the show, so that's been taking up most of my mental energy.
How her new book will be different from 'Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat' But as far as the book, one of things I've seen is that people feel kind of stuck about deciding what to make.
Even really good home cooks create a menu for a dinner or a party page for page, word for word out of a magazine spread of recipes. Or because they saw such-and-such-thing on TV or Instagram. I started to think about how there's so much I can share with those people about how to make their lives easier by understanding what decisions to make about what they should be cooking.
I did my best with "Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat" to teach people how to translate how professional cooks think about how to cook. What I've realized is I haven't really that similar translation about how professional cooks decide what to cook.
I think people have a really romantic notion that chefs show up at work and are like 'today I feel like making this grand and wonderful creation' or something. And maybe some people do that. But the constraints of a real kitchen are what chiefly make a professional cook decide what to make. If I can teach that to home cooks I think it would make people's day-to-day cooking a lot easier.
So that's what I'm going to do with the book that I have not started writing yet. (laughs)

Why is the media absolving the Bidens?

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — Let’s be clear: President Trump’s call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was not “beautiful” or “perfect.” Far from it. Trump should not have asked Zelensky to investigate Hunter Biden or to cooperate with his private attorney Rudolph Giuliani’s investigation of the former vice president’s son. Since Trump made no promises or threats in the call, it is a stretch to claim his conduct rises to the level of “high crimes and misdemeanors.” But it was highly inappropriate.
However, it does not follow that Trump’s malfeasance absolves Joe Biden and his son of their malfeasance. Two things can be true at the same time: that Trump did something wrong, and that Joe and Hunter Biden did something wrong as well. This seems to be lost on many in the media, who are bending over backward to absolve the Bidens of wrongdoing.
For example, many in the media state as fact that Biden’s actions in encouraging the firing of Ukrainian prosecutor Viktor Shokin had nothing to do with his investigation of the natural gas company, Burisma, which employed Hunter Biden as a board member. His firing was justified, they say, because the U.S. government, the International Monetary Fund and other U.S. allies were demanding he be fired as well. Furthermore, as CNN’s Jake Tapper insisted this weekend, “according to the Ukrainians that investigation [into Burisma] was dormant at the time.”
First, the phrase “dormant” means, by definition, that an investigation into Burisma existed and was not closed. Second, we don’t know for certain that the Burisma investigation was, in fact, “dormant.” Shokin has sworn in an affidavit it was not. His successor says it was. Who is lying? Nobody knows for sure. Journalists don’t get to choose which version they prefer and report it as fact.
But here is what is incontestably true: Joe Biden had a conflict of interest. His son took a position with a Ukrainian natural gas company, despite having no experience in Ukraine or natural gas, the very same month the elder Biden visited Kiev and urged Ukraine to increase its natural gas production. As Yoshiko Herrera, an expert in Russia and Eurasia policy at the University of Wisconsin at Madison, put it, “conflict-of-interest rules should have applied.”
The latest spin is that there is nothing to see here because, as Reuters reports, the investigation of Burisma “focused solely on activity that took place before Hunter Biden, son of former U.S. Vice President Joe Biden, was hired to sit on its board.” Did it occur to anyone that maybe that is precisely why Burisma hired the American vice president’s son? According to The New York Times, Biden’s hiring “allowed Burisma to create the perception that it was backed by powerful Americans.” As Robert Weissman, president of the progressive watchdog Public Citizen, has said, “It’s hard to avoid the conclusion that Hunter’s foreign employers and partners were seeking to leverage Hunter’s relationship with Joe, either by seeking improper influence or to project access to him.” The revelation that Hunter Biden accepted a job with a Ukrainian company that was under investigation while his father was taking the lead in fighting corruption in Ukraine is damning, not exculpatory.
Biden knew about his son’s involvement with Burisma, because the New Yorker has reported that in December 2015 Obama energy czar Amos Hochstein “raised the matter with Biden.” We also know, via The New York Times, that “some State Department officials had expressed concern that Hunter Biden’s work in Ukraine could complicate his father’s diplomacy there.” No doubt, there is a paper trail at the State Department to that effect.
The Code of Federal Regulations (§2635.502) clearly states that when a federal official takes action he knows will affect “a relative with whom the employee has a close personal relationship” and “the circumstances would cause a reasonable person with knowledge of the relevant facts to question his impartiality in the matter, the employee should not participate in the matter.” In other words, Joe Biden should not have taken the lead on Ukraine policy while Hunter Biden was working for Burisma. And even if Shokin deserved to be fired, Biden had no business being the one to deliver the ultimatum.
Hunter Biden’s business dealings, in Ukraine and elsewhere, are crying out for investigation. That does not mean it was appropriate for Trump to raise them with the Ukrainian president. But the fact that Trump did so does not give the media carte blanche to make excuses for the Biden family.

Texto completo: En los últimos días surgió la noticia de que el presidente Donald Trump habría sugerido disparar a las piernas de los inmigrantes para tratar de frenar su llegada a Estados Unidos. Las presuntas declaraciones se habrían hecho en marzo pasado.
Aunque el presidente niega haber dicho tal aseveración , independientemente de si son ciertas o falsas, distintas organizaciones proinmigrantes han manifestado su rechazo a esas palabras, ya que consideran que esto solamente eleva un odio que podría generar más violencia.
Por medio de un comunicado, la Red Fronteriza de Derechos Humanos ( BNHR , por sus siglas en inglés) dice no estar de acuerdo con la supuesta declaración, la cual fue publicada en un informe de The New York Times basado en entrevistas con fuentes no identificadas.
“Sugerir que alguien que está tratando de cruzar la frontera debe recibir un disparo en las piernas es una declaración tan espantosa y desagradable en sí misma, pero que lo haga el hombre que se sienta en la oficina más alta de este país es alucinante y nos muestra cuán lejos de lo normal nos hemos desviado”, comentó el director ejecutivo de BNHR, Fernando García.
García agregó que las personas que vienen a Estados Unidos solamente buscan proporcionar alimento a sus familias y huir de la violencia vivida en sus países de origen, por lo que en caso de ser cierta la declaración, sería un “castigo horrible” y citó la masacre ocurrida recientemente en El Paso.
“Hace solo unas semanas, un supremacista blanco que defiende la retórica de Trump abrió fuego y mató a 22 personas en un Walmart local. El presidente incita a la violencia entre sus seguidores y no tiene en cuenta la vida humana. Este es el tipo de lenguaje que trafica. Oramos para que los inmigrantes y todos los que viven a lo largo de la frontera se mantengan a salvo de los vigilantes rebeldes provocados por las palabras de Trump ”, acotó García.
Al respecto, el director de America’s Voice, Mario Carrillo , consideró que una declaración como esa solo promociona la violencia y normaliza la “peligrosa cosmovisión” de la supremacía blanca. Además de calificar como “destructivos” dichos comentarios.
“Hace dos meses, un supremacista blanco viajó a través de Texas a mi ciudad natal de El Paso y mató a 22 personas e hirió a dos docenas más en un Wal-Mart local. No fue una coincidencia que un tirador preocupado por una “invasión hispana” eligiera aterrorizar a esta ciudad de mayoría latina ni que la violencia tuviera lugar mientras Trump se concentraba en los refugiados y solicitantes de asilo en la frontera”, dijo Carrillo mientras también recordaba el ataque de Pittsburgh.
“Hace casi un año, un supremacista blanco obsesionado con la ‘teoría del reemplazo’ mató a 11 personas en la sinagoga Tree of Life en Pittsburgh después de que el presidente Trump hizo de la ‘caravana de migrantes’ su enfoque obsesivo en las últimas semanas de las elecciones de mitad de período. Por supuesto, el lenguaje de Trump de castigar a las personas y violentar a los inmigrantes no es solo una retórica peligrosa que incita: son ideas fundamentales para las políticas de la administración diseñadas para mantener alejados y expulsar a los inmigrantes y las personas de color y sus persistentes intentos de avivar las brechas a lo largo de líneas raciales y étnicas”, agregó Carrillo.
Por su parte, el presidente Trump utilizó su cuenta de Twitter para negar que sugirió disparar a las piernas de los inmigrantes, además de rechazar que quería construir el muro en la frontera con picos y corriente eléctrica.
“Ahora la prensa está tratando de vender el hecho de que quería una fosa rellena de caimanes y serpientes, con una cerca electrificada y puntas afiladas en la parte superior, en nuestra frontera sur. Puedo ser duro con la seguridad fronteriza, pero no tan duro. La prensa se ha vuelto loca. ¡Noticias falsas! ”, escribió el mandatario.
Now the press is trying to sell the fact that I wanted a Moat stuffed with alligators and snakes, with an electrified fence and sharp spikes on top, at our Southern Border. I may be tough on Border Security, but not that tough. The press has gone Crazy. Fake News!

Texto completo: El fiscal general de EEUU William Barr le pide al CEO de Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg, que postergue sus planes de cifrar los tres servicios de mensajería de la compañía hasta que los funcionarios del Dpto. de Justicia puedan determinar que esto no reducirá la seguridad pública, en una carta fechada el 4 de octubre, reporta CNBC.
La solicitud de Barr está respaldada por funcionarios del Reino Unido y Australia.
BuzzFeed News informó por primera vez la historia después de obtener un borrador de la carta abierta el jueves 3 de octubre.
La carta (que puede leerse en inglés aquí), que el Departamento de Justicia envió a CNBC el jueves, se basa en las preocupaciones sobre los planes de Facebook para integrar y cifrar sus servicios de mensajería en Messenger, Instagram y WhatsApp.
Una investigación del New York Times publicada el sábado encontró que la tecnología encriptada ayuda a los depredadores a compartir pornografía infantil en línea de una manera que hace que sea mucho más difícil rastrear la aplicación de la ley.
“Las mejoras de seguridad en el mundo virtual no deberían hacernos más vulnerables en el mundo físico”, dice la carta. “Las empresas no deben diseñar deliberadamente sus sistemas para impedir cualquier forma de acceso al contenido, incluso para prevenir o investigar los delitos más graves”.
En la carta, Barr y el secretario del Interior del Reino Unido, Priti Patel, el secretario de Seguridad Nacional de los Estados Unidos, Kevin McAleenan , y el ministro de Asuntos Interiores de Australia, Peter Dutton , le piden a Facebook que cree una forma para que las fuerzas del orden accedan a contenido ilegal.
“Los riesgos para la seguridad pública de las propuestas de Facebook se exacerban en el contexto de una plataforma única que combinaría servicios de mensajería inaccesibles con perfiles abiertos, proporcionando rutas únicas para que los posibles delincuentes identifiquen y preparen a nuestros hijos”, dice la carta.
En un comunicado, un portavoz de Facebook dijo a CNBC: “Creemos que las personas tienen derecho a tener una conversación privada en línea, en cualquier lugar del mundo”. Facebook dijo que ha estado consultando con expertos en seguridad infantil, así como con gobiernos y otras compañías tecnológicas. para garantizar que sus servicios recién encriptados sean seguros. Facebook “se opone firmemente a los intentos del gobierno de construir puertas traseras porque socavarían la privacidad y la seguridad de las personas en todas partes”, según el comunicado.
Facebook no es la primera compañía tecnológica que se enfrenta al gobierno por el cifrado. Hace solo unos años, Apple estaba en un enfrentamiento con la Oficina Federal de Investigación (FBI) sobre el acceso al iPhone de un tirador en el ataque de San Bernardino de 2015.
Un juez federal le pidió a Apple que ayudara al FBI a desbloquear el teléfono, pero el CEO de Apple, Tim Cook, calificó la orden como “peligrosa” porque podría permitir al gobierno sobrepasarse en casos futuros y exigir a las empresas de tecnología que vigilen a los usuarios. El Departamento de Justicia finalmente dijo que podía acceder a los datos del teléfono sin Apple y le pidió al juez que abandonara el caso.

Texto completo: NEW YORK - Jessye Norman, the renowned international opera star whose passionate soprano voice won her four Grammy Awards, the National Medal of Arts and the Kennedy Center Honor, has died, according to family spokesperson Gwendolyn Quinn. She was 74.
A statement released to The Associated Press on Monday said Norman died at 7:54a.m. EDT from septic shock and multi-organ failure secondary to complications of a spinal cord injury she suffered in 2015. She died at Mount Sinai St. Luke's Hospital in New York, and was surrounded by loved ones.
"We are so proud of Jessye's musical achievements and the inspiration that she provided to audiences around the world that will continue to be a source of joy. We are equally proud of her humanitarian endeavors addressing matters such as hunger, homelessness, youth development, and arts and culture education," the family statement read.
Norman was a trailblazing performer, and one of the rare black singers to attain worldwide stardom in the opera world, performing at such revered houses like La Scala and the Metropolitan Opera, and singing title roles in works like "Carmen," Aida" and more.
She sang the works of Wagner, but was not limited to opera or classical music, performing songs by Duke Ellington and others as well.
"I have always been drawn to things other people might consider unusual. I'm always taken by the text and beautiful melody. It's not important to me who has written it. It's just more reasonable to have an open mind about what beauty is," Norman said in a 2002 interview with the Chicago Sun-Times. "It's important for classical musicians to stretch and think beyond the three B's (Bach, Beethoven and Brahms). They were wonderful composers, but they went to the great beyond a long time ago. There's lots of music that will live for a very long time."
In that same interview she profoundly said, "Pigeonholing is only interesting to pigeons."
Norman certainly knew no boundaries or limits. She broke barriers and had hoped her industry would see more faces like hers.
"It is a more diverse place, thank goodness," Norman said of the opera world in a 2004 interview with NPR, "I wish it were even more diverse than it is."
Norman was born on September 15, 1945 in Augusta, Georgia, in segregationist times. She grew up singing in church and around a musical family that included pianists and singers. She earned a scholarship to the historically black college Howard University in Washington, D.C., to study music, and later studied at the Peabody Conservatory and the University of Michigan.
Eventually she made her operatic debut in 1969 in Berlin, wowing audiences around the world on stages in Milan, London and New York thanks to her shining vocals, no matter the language. The New York Times described her voice as "a grand mansion of sound."
"It defines an extraordinary space. It has enormous dimensions, reaching backward and upward. It opens onto unexpected vistas. It contains sunlit rooms, narrow passageways, cavernous falls," the Times' Edward Rothstein wrote.
The Met Opera called Norman "one of the great sopranos of the past half-century" in a statement.
"Starting with her Met debut as Cassandra in Berlioz's Les Troyens on Opening Night of the Met's centennial 1983-84 season, Norman sang more than 80 performances with the company, dazzling audiences with her beautiful tone, extraordinary power, and musical sensitivity," the statement read.
Former Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams said: "Farewell to the beloved Jessye Norman, a woman of vision, adventure and joy. A glorious voice and beautiful soul has winged towards Heaven. Her legacy lives on in music and the children who greet art in her name each day." And Broadway legend Audra McDonald wrote on Twitter, "UGH! Nooooooo! This is awful. I was literally supposed to spend time with her next week. RIP most magnificent amazing brilliant Diva."
In 1997, at age 52, Norman became the youngest person ever to earn the Kennedy Center Honor in the organization's 20-year history at the time. She received her National Medal of Arts from former President Barack Obama and has earned honorary doctorates from a number of prestigious schools, including Juilliard, Harvard and Yale. She is a member of British Royal Academy of Music and Georgia Music Hall of Fame. Norman even has orchid named after her in France, and the country also made her a Commander of the Order of Arts and Letters.
She's earned 15 Grammy nominations throughout her illustrious career, picking up her first at the 1985 show for best classical vocal soloist performance for "Ravel: Songs Of Maurice Ravel." She earned Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2006.
Norman also gave back, raising funds to help students attend school, championing the arts in schools and championing diversity.
"I look at symphony orchestras around this country and I want those orchestras to look more like the demographic they're meant to serve. I would like to see more African-Americans on the stage at the Metropolitan Opera here in New York. There are certainly some, but not nearly enough, and I come across so many singers who are terribly gifted and that would be an asset to these opera companies around our country. But we still have these people who are just a little bit hesitant, and perhaps not as openhearted ... as I'd like them to be," she said. "I look forward to the day when we do not think about color of skin when we're looking to have a person do a job, whatever that job is."
The Jessye Norman School of the Arts opened in 2003 in Augusta to provide a free fine arts education to disadvantaged children. The Augusta Chronicle reported that Norman was set to attend the Oct. 11 street-naming ceremony in her hometown on Eighth Street, where the school is located. It will be named Jessye Norman Boulevard.
In 1990, Augusta opened the Jessye Norman Amphitheater to honor the opera icon.
Norman released her memoir, "Stand Up Straight and Sing!," in 2004.
She is survived by two remaining siblings, James Norman and Elaine Sturkey.

A fight over 'fire cider' pits Maine herbal folk traditions against corporate America

Texto completo: BELFAST, Maine -- Herbalists rely on the sun and rain to grow the plants they use to make remedies and concoctions.
But for years, Maine herbalist Kathi Langelier has been working under a cloud: a lawsuit brought by a Massachusetts company that she believes threatens her livelihood.
She's one of three herbalists being sued for trademark infringement by Shire City Herbals of Massachusetts, in a suit pitting homespun tradition against capitalism that has dragged in the courts for five years.
[Subscribe to our free morning newsletter and get the latest headlines in your inbox]
The "fire cider" trial held in U.S. District Court in Springfield, Massachusetts, wrapped up this July, but the herbalists are still waiting for the judge's verdict. The long legal ordeal has had an effect on Langelier and the other two herbalists named in the suit, Mary Blue of Providence, Rhode Island, and Nicole Telkes of Austin, Texas, and Portland, Oregon.
"The lawsuit alone is very wearing on the soul. It's very heavy," Langelier, who owns Union-based Herbal Revolution Farm & Apothecary, said this week. "I'm tired of having this hang over me. We're all tired of it."
It also has cast a shadow on the greater Maine herbalist community. Denise DeSpirito, an herbalist and gardener from Hope, is a co-organizer of the Maine Herbalist Gathering, scheduled to be held Oct. 5 at the Merryspring Nature Center in Camden. She expects that the fire cider lawsuit will be on people's minds during the gathering.
"It comes up all the time," she said. "This corporatization of things is not really welcome here in general. Corporate America, in some ways, is particularly unwelcome in the herbal community in Maine."
[image id="2878518" size="full" pos="center" /]
Fight over fire cider
So just what has gotten DeSpirito and other members of this normally tranquil community so worked up? It starts with fire cider, a spicy herbal concoction that is made from apple cider vinegar, onions, garlic, hot peppers and horseradish. Devotees of the folk remedy swear it can help stop a cold in its tracks.
The term fire cider was coined in 1980 by herbalist Rosemary Gladstar, and a loose recipe under that name has been widely used ever since.
But in 2012, Shire City Herbals trademarked the name after founder Dana St. Pierre began selling it at craft fairs and farmers markets. On the Shire City Herbals website, St. Pierre said his recipe was handed down by his "feisty German grandmother," who brewed it to keep her family healthy.
When other herbalists learned that Shire City had trademarked the phrase they had long used, it was a blow -- made worse when the company started reporting them for allegedly violating its trademark.
In a January 2014 blog post, Shire City responded to herbalists angered at the idea that fire cider could be trademarked.
"We did not write the law, but we ignore it at our peril," company founders wrote. "We are asking all those who want to sell commercially to change the name within that commercial setting, that is all."
But Langelier, who had started selling "Fire Cider No. 9" in the 1990s, rejected this. Although she eventually changed the name to "Fire Tonic No. 9," Shire City was not appeased, she said.
In June 2014 she, Blue and Telkes filed a petition in court to cancel the trademark, arguing that fire cider has become a generic term. They also encouraged consumers to boycott Shire City's product and helped start the "Free Fire Cider" website and movement.
The following year, Shire City filed a lawsuit against the three women, claiming copyright infringement and saying that the boycott had harmed their business.
"My opinion is that it's this really weird clash of worlds," St. Pierre told the New York Times earlier this year. "We're just trying to run a business. The herbalist community has tried to present this as a story of good versus evil."
'Standing up for our truth'
Whatever its roots, the lawsuit has been difficult and financially intimidating, Langelier said.
"They're trying to get a lot of money from me," she said, adding that Shire City at one point was seeking more than $200,000 plus close to $1 million in lawyers' fees.
But she and the others did not want to back down. They believe trademarking fire cider is against the traditions of the herbalist community, which encourage sharing knowledge and honoring pioneers such as Gladstar.
"I can say for myself that when I did get up and testify, it was the most empowering experience I'd ever had," Langelier said. "I felt strong. I felt clear. We were all standing up for our truth, and we all put our livelihoods and businesses on the line."
Nyla Bravesnow, a Thorndike herbalist who is co-organizing this weekend's gathering, said that the lawsuit has changed how she markets her own version of fire cider.
[image id="2878519" size="half" pos="right" /]
"I definitely feel like I have to be careful," she said. "It feels really hurtful that herbalists would take other herbalists to court and sue them."
DeSpirito said that regardless of the trial's outcome, she does not think the herbalist community will go back to the way it was before the lawsuit.
Her hope is that it will become even stronger.
"I think there is the awareness of protecting these recipes and protecting traditional herbalism, and also protecting the land and our communities," she said, adding that this weekend's gathering will help that goal. "When the herbal community can connect, it allows us to be a larger force."

Texto completo: President Trump on Wednesday raged over House Democrats' accelerating impeachment inquiry, leveling several false claims, ducking questions and publicly venting an anger that's been percolating for a week behind closed West Wing doors.
Trump's outburst came amid an intensifying showdown with Capitol Hill as House Democrats said they would issue a subpoena to the White House on Friday if the Trump administration did not voluntarily turn over records related to a July 25 phone call with Ukraine's president.
Later during public appearances at the White House, Trump repeated his claim that the whistleblower is "a spy" and vowed to "find out who that person was."

Asked whether the whistleblower's anonymity should be protected, Trump told reporters in the Oval Office, "I don't care."
Earlier, Trump assailed Democrats in a tweet for "wasting everyone's time and energy on BULLSHIT," responding in real time to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's televised morning news conference.
Trump continued his attempt to portray the whistleblower as fake during a news conference in the White House East Room alongside the president of Finland. "I have a lot of respect for whistleblowers, but only when they're real," he said.
Joseph Maguire, the acting director of national intelligence, and Michael Atkinson, the intelligence community's inspector general, have both said the whistleblower has followed the law and filed a legitimate complaint.
The bulk of the whistleblower's complaint has been corroborated by Trump himself. He has acknowledged asking Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, one of Trump's possible opponents in the 2020 presidential race.
Trump has also confirmed that at the time of the call, he had put a hold on nearly $400 million in critical aid to that country. A White House account of the July 25 call quoted Zelensky as expressing interest in more U.S. military aid and Trump responding by asking the Ukrainian leader for a "favor."
Trump has insisted that the two actions were unrelated. He continued to defend the conversation as "perfect" and pointed to Zelensky's public statement that he didn't feel pressured.
But when a reporter asked him what he had wanted from Ukraine in terms of investigating Biden and his son Hunter, who served on the board of a natural gas company there for five years, Trump refused to answer, turning hostile when the question was repeated and telling the reporter, Jeff Mason of Reuters, to "not be rude."
Trump also seized on the revelation, first reported in the New York Times, that the whistleblower initially sought guidance from the House Intelligence Committee about how to proceed with a complaint, giving Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Burbank), the committee chair, advance notice that a complaint might be coming.
Schiff's office said the person was advised to hire an attorney and file a formal whistleblower's complaint -- standard practice in such circumstances.
"It shows that Schiff is a fraud," said Trump, who waved a copy of the New York Times article during his news conference and called it evidence that the scandal has been a conspiracy against him.
Trump also said he suspected that Schiff helped write the complaint.
Schiff's office said he didn't see the complaint ahead of time and had nothing to do with writing it.
Other Republicans joined in attacking Schiff, calling it a "deep state" plot that raised questions about the legitimacy of the Democrats' impeachment inquiry.
Asked at his news conference whether he would cooperate with potential subpoenas, Trump was brusque. "I always cooperate," he said. "This is a hoax."
Among the documents being sought are any communications between administration officials involving Trump's phone conversation with Zelensky.
Separately Wednesday, the State Department inspector general, Steve Linick, briefed legislative staff behind closed doors on what had been described as an "urgent" matter.
Afterward, lawmakers said Linick turned over a packet of what Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.), a member of the House Judiciary and Oversight committees, called "propaganda," papers outlining what he described as several conspiracy theories about Ukrainian involvement in the 2016 election that had apparently been sent to Secretary of State Michael R. Pompeo.
Democrats had previously expressed concerns that Pompeo has been pressuring State Department officials not to cooperate with congressional investigations.
Pompeo rejected that criticism during a news conference in Italy, one of his stops on a four-nation tour of Europe this week. He accused congressional staff leading the impeachment inquiry of mistreating State Department workers.
"We won't tolerate folks on Capitol Hill bullying, intimidating State Department employees," he said. "That's unacceptable and it's not something that I'm going to permit to happen."
At the same news conference, Pompeo acknowledged that he was listening in on the July 25 call between Trump and Zelensky.
It's common practice for diplomats and intelligence officials to take part in phone calls between heads of state, but Pompeo had previously suggested he didn't know details of the conversation.
Sen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.), the ranking member on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said Pompeo should recuse himself from Ukraine-related issues because of his involvement.
He also said Pompeo "must refrain from any direct or indirect participation in or influence over the State Department response to the Ukraine scandal, including congressional requests for documents or to interview State Department personnel."
Schiff said any refusal to hand over documents to Congress would create the "adverse inference that those [underlying] allegations are in fact correct." Democrats have warned that any attempts by the administration to block the impeachment inquiry could themselves be impeachable offenses.
"We're not fooling around here, though. We don't want this to drag on months and months and months," Schiff said.
Schiff also sharply criticized Trump's attacks on the unidentified whistleblower, including the president's allusion during private remarks last week to how American spies were once executed.
"This is a blatant effort to intimidate witnesses," Schiff said. "It's an incitement of violence."
Schiff has been a frequent target of Trump's anger, and the president twice told reporters that he should resign and be investigated for treason. When asked at the news conference about his increased use of the word "treason," Trump said he thinks it's warranted when someone lies about the president.
Pelosi (D-San Francisco) sought to send the message that Democrats were not spending all their time on impeachment and instead were working on lowering prescription drug prices and advancing Trump's proposed revision of the North American Free Trade Agreement.
Progress is being made on a revised NAFTA despite the lack of public comments about it, she said.
"The quiet you hear is progress," Pelosi said.
Trump had threatened that nothing would get done in Congress as Democrats pursued their impeachment inquiry.
"If the president is saying, 'If you question my actions, you can't agree on any subject,' the ball is in his court on that," Pelosi said.
Trump rejected Pelosi's comments on Twitter. "It is just camouflage for trying to win an election through impeachment," he tweeted. "The Do Nothing Democrats are stuck in mud!"

Texto completo: What's Streaming
HIGH LIFE (2019) Stream on Amazon; Rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. The French director Claire Denis is known for making independent movies that tell intimate, personal stories. But on paper, her first English-language film, "High Life," doesn't necessarily shout "intimate." It's a sci-fi movie, for one thing, and it accordingly takes place in about the most vast setting possible: space. Robert Pattinson stars as Monte, a young man who has agreed to participate in an extraterrestrial mission in order to avoid the death penalty. He's traveling on a spaceship as part of a small criminal crew, bound for a black hole in deep space. Also on the ship is a troubled doctor played by Juliette Binoche; other crew members are played by Lars Eidinger and the musician André Benjamin. Their mission is derailed, in part, by an unexpected birth. "As is often the case in Denis's movies, 'High Life' vibrates with low-key erotic energy that can feel exciting, a little dangerous," Manohla Dargis wrote in her review for The New York Times. "But," she added, "too often the ideas here, visual and otherwise, feel haphazard -- outer and inner space, Pattinson's head, sexual taboo, apocalypse now or maybe then -- more like material for a vision board than a fully realized vision."
ARIADNE AUF NAXOS Rent on Met Opera on Demand. The soprano Jessye Norman, who died on Monday at 74, was a towering figure on stages in New York and abroad. "In the title role of Strauss's 'Ariadne auf Naxos' or as Wagner's tormented Kundry in 'Parsifal,' it seemed that her opulent tone was not originating from her body, but enveloping you, coming at you from all the corners of the opera house," Anthony Tommasini wrote in The Times this week. "Her voice penetrated; it permeated." You can rent a filmed version of the Strauss, from the 1980s, on the Metropolitan Opera's streaming site. Videos of Norman performing in Wagner's "Die Walküre," Poulenc's "Dialogues des Carmélites" and Berlioz's "Les Troyens" are also available to rent.
What's on TV
IHEARTRADIO MUSIC FESTIVAL 8 p.m. on the CW. The 2019 edition of this annual festival was held in Las Vegas over two nights late last month. The second night, airing Thursday, features performances by Chance the Rapper, Miley Cyrus, Alicia Keys, Mumford & Sons, Zac Brown Band and more.
THE HOLZER FILES 10 p.m. on Travel Channel. Hans Holzer was a prolific ghost hunter. By the time of his death, in 2009, he had written well over 100 books on paranormal subjects, the product of international travels and troves of research. Holzer sought out subjects who believed they had experienced paranormal phenomena. This series, produced with the involvement of one of Holzer's daughters, looks back at some of his work. It centers on a paranormal investigator, a medium and a researcher, who revisit some of the cases Holzer once looked into. First up: a historic (and possibly haunted) house in Rye, N.Y.

Texto completo: The opera star, who has been the company's general director since 2003, resigned, saying allegations had "compromised" his ability to continue.
The opera star Plácido Domingo resigned on Wednesday from his position as general director of Los Angeles Opera, a company that he helped found, and withdrew from his upcoming performances there. They were his last scheduled engagements in the United States after others were canceled amid allegations that he had sexually harassed multiple women over several decades.
His departure from Los Angeles Opera raised the possibility that the storied, five-decade American opera career of Mr. Domingo, 78, could be drawing to a close. The announcement came a week after he agreed to withdraw from a run of performances at the Metropolitan Opera and said that he would not return there, and after several other prominent American arts organizations canceled his appearances. His European calendar, however, remains full.
Mr. Domingo said in a statement that his ability to continue with the Los Angeles company had been "compromised" since The Associated Press in recent months reported allegations that he had sexually harassed numerous women over the years.
"I hold Los Angeles Opera very dearly to my heart and count my work to create and build it as among my most important legacies," Mr. Domingo said in a statement to The New York Times. "However, recent accusations that have been made against me in the press have created an atmosphere in which my ability to serve this company that I so love has been compromised."
"While I will continue to work to clear my name," he added, "I have decided that it is in the best interests of L.A. Opera for me to resign as its general director and withdraw from my future scheduled performances at this time."
The accusations against Mr. Domingo were first reported in August by The A.P., which wrote that he had frequently pressured women into sexual relationships, and sometimes professionally punished those who rejected him. (In addition to being one of opera's biggest stars, he has held leadership positions at Washington National Opera as well as in Los Angeles.) The news agency reported allegations by 20 women, two of whom were named.
Debra Katz, an attorney for one of the named women -- Patricia Wulf, a mezzo-soprano who said that Mr. Domingo had made repeated, unwanted propositions to her when they sang together in Washington -- said in a statement that his resignation in Los Angeles was "an important and welcome step in the effort to end sexual misconduct by powerful men in the opera industry."
Mr. Domingo -- a star tenor who branched into conducting, administration and a late career singing lower baritone roles -- has been key to opera in Los Angeles for decades.
Even before the city had its own opera company, he appeared there on tour with New York City Opera, and he starred in Los Angeles Opera's first production, Verdi's "Otello," in 1986. The executive leadership of the company's board issued a statement calling him "the driving force behind the creation, development and growth" of the company and thanking him "for popularizing opera in the consciousness of Los Angeles."
Christopher Koelsch, Los Angeles Opera's president and chief executive, who has handled the day-to-day duties of running the company, wrote in an email to employees on Wednesday that the company had "received and accepted" Mr. Domingo's resignation. He thanked Mr. Domingo for his "decades of service" and noted that the investigation into his behavior, which is being conducted by Gibson, Dunn and Crutcher, would not end.
"Both the board and the senior staff believe strongly that it is important for that investigation to continue until its resolution -- and it will do so," Mr. Koelsch wrote.
He added that the company's leadership "knows we must take further steps to guarantee we are doing everything we can to foster a professional and collaborative environment."
The accusations against Mr. Domingo have divided the opera world -- and divided the United States and Europe.
Two American institutions, the Philadelphia Orchestra and the San Francisco Opera, immediately canceled his upcoming appearances, citing the need to provide safe workplaces for their employees. The Dallas Opera followed later. The Metropolitan Opera initially planned to go ahead with Mr. Domingo's performances in Verdi's "Macbeth" this fall, saying that it would await the results of Los Angeles Opera's inquiry before taking any action. But after an outcry among members of the company, Mr. Domingo withdrew on the eve of opening night -- the Met's statement suggested that it had asked him to do so -- and Mr. Domingo made it clear that he did not intend to return to the Met.
But no European presenters have canceled Mr. Domingo's engagements, and several have said they would wait to see what Los Angeles Opera's inquiry determines. A second investigation is being conducted by the American Guild of Musical Artists, the union representing choristers, soloists, directors, dancers and other opera house employees.
When Mr. Domingo made his first appearance after the accusations were first reported, at the prestigious Salzburg Festival in Austria, he got a lengthy standing ovation. Later this month he is scheduled to sing in "Macbeth" at the Vienna State Opera. That company's director, Dominique Meyer, said in a statement over the summer that he was "not in a position to judge the specifics and also do not want to play them down," but that Vienna would honor its contracts with Mr. Domingo, who Mr. Meyer added was "valued both artistically and as a human being by all in this house."
Now Mr. Domingo's calendar lists upcoming engagements in Zurich; Moscow; Vienna; Hamburg, Germany; Valencia, Spain; Milan; Cologne, Germany; Krakow, Poland; Berlin; Madrid; London; and Munich. With his withdrawal from Donizetti's "Roberto Devereux" in Los Angeles in February and March, none remain in the United States.

Texto completo: Years ago, while covering a track meet in Eugene, Ore., I was driving to breakfast, or to the stadium, when I saw a figure jogging along the road, bent and listing. As I passed, I realized it was Alberto Salazar, once among the greatest American marathon runners, a three-time winner in New York and the Boston champion in an epic finish in 1982.
Even in his prime, Salazar ran with what Neil Amdur of The New York Times once described as a "duck-like wobble." In retirement, he was left with a body broken by so many hard miles. Each stride seemed full of agony and something resembling denial. Or perhaps grief and regret.
That's the image I recalled Monday night upon hearing that Salazar, 61, the world's best-known coach of distance runners and head of the Nike Oregon Project, had been suspended four years for violating the rules against doping. He vehemently denied the accusations. But unless he is successful on appeal, his coaching career and his reputation may end up as wrecked as his body.
Full disclosure: I believe doping should be legal. At the least, sports would be more honest. It is naïve and hypocritical for the rest of us to enhance our daily performance with a medicine-cabinet buffet while insisting that elite athletes should achieve the miraculous on bananas and water. And while looking the other way when Olympians are given exemptions for using asthma medication and other drugs that can enhance their medal chances.
But my opinion remains a minority view. To be clear, I don't condone some behaviors examined in the Salazar case, including testing substances on athletes who seemingly did not know what was being done to them and altering medical records.
Salazar now may have to pay a steep price. As with his running, he pushed so hard with his coaching methods that he crossed a line, veering from the questionable to the pharmacologically impermissible, according to the United States Anti-Doping Agency.
The American Arbitration Association panel that imposed Monday's ban acknowledged that Salazar made some "unintentional mistakes that violated the rules." He seemed motivated by trying to provide the best training and results for his athletes, the panel wrote, but that desire "clouded his judgment in some instances."
Hence, the accusations made against Salazar by USADA and a 2015 investigative report by the BBC and ProPublica: experimenting with testosterone gels on his son; giving athletes substances that were not medically necessary, like thyroid and asthma medication, to enhance their performance; infusing improper amounts of a substance called L-carnitine, which converts fat into energy.
The pushing of boundaries and the restless tinkering precisely describe -- in a general sense, unrelated to doping -- the Salazar I covered for years as a coach and whose legend as a runner I came to know.
John Brant, who co-wrote Salazar's memoir and "Duel in the Sun," a book about Salazar's 1982 Boston Marathon victory, recalled on Tuesday a conversation he had with the high school coach of Galen Rupp before the 2016 Rio Olympics. Rupp, coached by Salazar, finished third in that Olympic marathon.
"Alberto is like the pit boss in an Indy 500 crew," Dave Frank, Rupp's coach at Central Catholic High School in Portland, Ore., told Brant for an article in Runners World magazine. "If the rules say that a tire can't exceed a certain width, that pit boss is going to have tires that are built to that limit and not a millimeter less. The pit boss would never think he was cheating by pushing the rules to the limit, and neither would Alberto."
Now, Salazar has been found guilty of trying to make the tires a little wider than they should have been. Pit crew mechanic, though, seemed an apt description for much of what he did.
I went to see Salazar in Albuquerque, N.M., in 2010 when he was training Dathan Ritzenhein for the New York City Marathon. He was changing Ritzenhein's posture and stride, altering the way his foot struck the ground, admonishing him that Ethiopians and Kenyans were running 160 miles a week and if they had better biomechanics, too, "you are in trouble."
At the 2012 London Olympics, I visited Rupp's hotel room after he won a silver medal at 10,000 meters. Salazar was excited about a mobile lab that had pulled up to the hotel. It was a cryotherapy chamber, perfectly legal, meant to speed recovery by inhibiting inflammation and enhancing oxygenation of the muscles.
"It feels like an ice bath on steroids," Rupp said, in what now may seem like an unfortunate choice of words.
As a runner, Salazar most famously pushed himself to a dangerous limit along the humid, seven-mile course of the 1978 Falmouth Road Race on Cape Cod, where he ended up with a body temperature of 107 degrees and was administered last rites.
"I don't think I've ever seen an athlete drive himself as hard as Alberto," said George Hirsch, chairman of the board of New York Road Runners, the organizers of the New York City Marathon, where Salazar won in his debut at 26.2 miles in 1980.
In Salazar's coaching, Hirsch said, "There was always this sense that Alberto would push the envelope but that to his credit, he knew where the line was and got to the edge but within legal limits."
Others were more suspicious. According to USADA, Salazar strayed beyond the allowable. His greatest athlete, Mo Farah of Britain, who won four Olympic gold medals on the track and left the Nike Oregon Project in 2017, said in a statement, "I have no tolerance for anyone who breaks the rules or crosses a line."
The response among people I spoke with on Tuesday seemed more bittersweet.
Salazar is on a short list of legendary American marathon runners -- Frank Shorter, Joan Benoit Samuelson, Bill Rodgers, Meb Keflezighi, Deena Kastor. Rodgers, who won Boston and New York four times each and trained with Salazar when Salazar was just a superfast teen from suburban Boston, said, "This is a thin case."
For those keeping score, though, the report is 140 pages thick.
Few have possessed Salazar's determination to succeed, which brought him to soaring heights and may have contributed to his downfall.
"Alberto is one of the true heroes of the sport," Hirsch said. "Any questions raised, that's concerning for sure."

Texto completo: A couple of weeks ago novelist and birdwatcher Jonathan Franzen wrote a doomsday piece in The New Yorker under the headline “What If We Stopped Pretending?” that began with a Kafka quote: “There is infinite hope — only not for us.”
Franzen is among the smart people in this world who have decided that vis a vis the climate emergency there is no point at such a late date in applauding the optimists who still say “it’s time to ‘roll up our sleeves’ and ‘save our planet’; that the problem of climate change can be ‘solved’ if we summon the collective will.” Maybe, he and his fellow travelers believe, that can-do attitude would have saved the day if we’d collectively adopted it 30 years ago, when the full science of ongoing global heating became clear.
But in those three decades we have put as much carbon into the atmosphere as in the preceding 200 years. We’ve radically upped the seriousness of the problem rather than even begun to deal with it.
So sorry, Greta and the kids: We’re doomed. Earth as we know it, over and out. Our bad. Love always, Mom and Dad.
A fellow tries to, you know, walk on the sunny side, and I had been thinking of all this in the context of the news last week that Lynda and Stewart Resnick, who gave us Pom Wonderful and, ahem, Fiji Water, among other beverages, have pledged $750 million to Caltech to “support cutting-edge research into environmental sustainability.”
To save the world, right? Go, world!
Except, I don’t know, wouldn’t a cool billion have been a rounder, better number?
Whatever.
Just so long as my favorite Southern California university doesn’t use that money to merely erect another building where a cool grove of trees or lawn or bungalow used to be. There are plenty of good-to-great buildings at Caltech already, and a few awful ones. Well, I guess they could chop down Millikan Library and no one would miss it. It’s mostly storage now as it is, since no student would crack a mere book.
Just don’t spend like half of the Resnicks’ scratch on the edifice, please. Put that money to work showing Jonathan Franzen that we’re going to … hang tough. Capitalism-philanthropy our way out of this little pickle.
Caltech President Tom Rosenbaum told The New York Times the money would go to “attempts to sequester carbon from the atmosphere and store it in the ocean; capture and reuse rainfall; make plants more resistant to drought; and create plastics that are easier to recycle.”
That’s good stuff, right? Here’s hoping they are game-changers.
Monday night I tucked into bed and read the magazine’s letters to the editor about the Franzen piece, seeking, as humans will, consolation. Found some: “He says that we should resign ourselves to the destruction to come. This argument promotes complacency and hopelessness, and it gives an easy out to people who might otherwise advocate for the political action we need. I trust the climate scientists and activists who believe we have the resources to create a hopeful future. Franzen does not offer reality — he offers defeat,” wrote
Judy Schneier of Brooklyn.
And then found some unconsolation:
“If environmentalists resent Franzen’s piece, it is only because it presents the state of human inaction on climate in a well-reasoned, clear-sighted, and complex way. We cannot prevent cataclysmic temperatures and extreme weather. Wouldn’t we all feel better if we acknowledged that fact and acted accordingly?” — Linda J. Drake, Denver.
Somehow, that doesn’t meet my definition of feeling better.
Boosting solar, biofuels, decomposable plastics, clean water, and “biosphere engineering research,” as the Resnicks’ money will allow Caltech to do — that does meet my definition.
Or at least if we’re all going down with the ship anyway there will be a lot of geniuses, and some practical engineers, too, gainfully employed on the Pasadena campus during these End Days, bringing home the plant-based bacon to their families.
No, I’ve got to go with the last letter in the magazine, the one from Siri Bardarson of Freeland, Wash., the one that finally let me get some sleep: “Yes, the climate reality is desperate. But caving like this? Pathetic. I could never explain to my classroom of fourth graders this kind of moral surrender.”

New York Times quietly deletes claim the NRA sought a quid pro quo from the White House

Texto completo: If you blinked, you missed it.

The New York Times quietly amended a report last week that originally claimed embattled National Rifle Association Chief Executive Wayne LaPierre had discussed bankrolling President Trump’s impeachment defense in return for assurances the White House would back off gun-control legislation.

All language alleging a quid pro quo between the president and the NRA has been removed since from the Times report. There is no editor’s note highlighting the change.

A spokeswoman for the paper defended the move Wednesday, telling the Washington Examiner that the story’s unannounced changes are representative of the Times’ normal editing process.

"We regularly edit web stories to refine the story, add new information, additional context or analysis," she said, "The crux of the story – that according to sources familiar with the meeting, President Trump met with Wayne LaPeirre of the N.R.A. and discussed prospective gun legislation as well as whether the N.R.A. could provide support for the president as he faces an impeachment inquiry and re-election – never changed."

The Sept. 27 Times article, authored by reporters Maggie Haberman and Annie Karni, began originally with these paragraphs:
President Trump met on Friday with Wayne LaPierre, the chief executive of the National Rifle Association, to discuss how the N.R.A. could provide financial support for the president’s defense as he faces political headwinds, including impeachment, according to two people familiar with the meeting. It was not clear whether Mr. Trump asked Mr. LaPierre for his support, or if the idea was pitched by the N.R.A. But in return for the support, Mr. LaPierre asked that the White House “stop the games” over gun control legislation, people familiar with the meeting said.
A few commentators, reporters, and Democratic lawmakers were quick to highlight what certainly sounded like swampy, if not outright criminal, behavior from Trump and LaPierre.

“If the below article is accurate, it appears [Donald Trump] seeks to trade action on legislation in exchange for financial support from the [NRA]. That would be illegal. A felony, to be exact,” said Rep. Ted Lieu of California.

The New Yorker’s Ben Taub summarized the article thusly, "Trump asks NRA to help pay for his legal defense. Perhaps, La Pierre replies—if you ‘stop the games’ over gun control.”

Said the Washington Post’s Helaine Olen, “Donald Trump does not appear to understand what quid pro quo is and why it's wrong.”

Then something happened the same day as the report's publication. The Times amended the article to remove all language alleging a tit-for-tat between Trump and LaPierre. The report's opening passages now read:
President Trump met in the White House on Friday with Wayne LaPierre, the chief executive of the National Rifle Association, and discussed prospective gun legislation and whether the N.R.A. could provide support for the president as he faces impeachment and a more difficult re-election campaign, according to two people familiar with the meeting. During the meeting, Mr. LaPierre asked that the White House “stop the games” over gun control legislation, people familiar with the meeting said. It was not clear whether Mr. Trump asked Mr. LaPierre for his support, or what that support would look like.
Let's see where that leaves us: The story is no longer that LaPierre pledged financial assistance to the president’s impeachment defense in return for a promise that the White House back away from gun-control legislation. The story is now that LaPierre met with the president to discuss gun legislation and maybe, possibly, probably talk about the NRA’s support for the president going forward.

Is that really the story? That the head of gun-rights group met with the president to lobby on the behalf of his group? That is one heck of a scoop you got there, New York Times.

Oh, and for what it is worth, the NRA has definitively denied the paper’s since-deleted allegations..

“The NRA categorically denies any discussion occurred about special arrangements pertaining to the NRA’s support of the President and vice versa,” said a representative.

That is not a non-denial denial. That is just a flat denial. Ordinarily, I would say this is bit of a he said/she said. But the NRA's strong denial coupled with the Times stealth-editing suggest here that the paper got the story wrong in a big way.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump's chief Republican ally in the Senate urged the prime ministers of the United Kingdom, Italy and Australia late Wednesday to cooperate with Attorney General William Barr's inquiry into the origins of Robert Mueller's Russia investigation.
The unusual request issued by Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S. C. , comes after the White House and Justice Department acknowledged earlier this week that Trump — at Barr's request — had contacted other countries to help the attorney general and Connecticut U. S. Attorney John Durham connect with officials abroad.
Durham was tapped earlier this year by Barr to lead the investigation into the origins of the special counsel's now-completed investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. Among the avenues of inquiry has been whether U. S. officials abused their surveillance authority, a claim long advanced by the president.
Graham did not consult with Barr before writing the prime ministers, a Justice official said Wednesday.
Trump efforts to advance the attorney general's inquiry have included the president's recent outreach to Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison.
An Australian government spokesman acknowledged Trump's recent entreaties, saying that the government "has always been ready to assist and cooperate with efforts that help shed further light on the matters under investigation. "
"The (prime minister) confirmed this readiness once again in conversation with the president," the Australian statement said.
News of Trump's outreach to Australia, first reported by the The New York Times, came as Congress continued to examine a July 25 telephone call in which Trump pressed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate his political rival Joe Biden.

During that call, which has prompted a House impeachment inquiry, the president invoked Barr's name, repeatedly indicating that Barr would be calling to assist in reviving a then-dormant inquiry into a Ukrainian energy company, where Biden's son, Hunter Biden, served as a board member.
Neither the former vice president nor his son have been accused of wrongdoing by the Ukrainian government.
Justice officials have said that Barr had no prior knowledge that Trump had suggested the Ukrainian president work with the attorney general.
Australia, however, played a pivotal role in the FBI's decision to launch the initial investigation into Russia interference in 2016. At the time, Australia's top diplomat in the United Kingdom passed information to U. S. authorities after a meeting with George Papadopoulos, a Trump campaign foreign policy adviser. The diplomat said Papadopoulos confided that Russians were offering up damaging information on then-Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.

Papadopoulos later served two weeks in prison for lying to FBI agents about his interactions with a Russian national while working for the Trump campaign. Trump has dismissed Papadopoulos as a low-level campaign aide.
He was the first former Trump aide to be sentenced in Mueller's investigation of Moscow's interference operation.
Papadopoulos admitted that he lied to the FBI about interactions in which people he thought were linked to the Russian government described Moscow having “thousands of emails” containing damaging information about Hillary Clinton.
Earlier this year, Trump appeared to offer a preview of the attorney general's expected efforts to pursue contacts with other governments in the Mueller examination.
"He can look, and I hope he looks at the UK, and I hope he looks at Australia, and I hope he looks at Ukraine," Trump said in a May 24 exchange with reporters on the South Lawn of the White House.
"I hope he looks at everything, because there was a hoax that was perpetrated on our country. It's the greatest hoax in the history of our country, and somebody has to get to the bottom of it. "

Texto completo: Les Winkeler is sports editor of the Southern Illinoisan, and will be retiring next April after 30 years on the job. He and his wife, Judy, live in Harrisburg.
1 What were your thoughts when SIU Athletic Director Jerry Kill decided to leave SIU again to become assistant coach at Virginia Tech?
Disbelief and a little disappointment. I thought Jerry had really come back to SIU to stay. He didn’t explicitly say this is where he would end his career, but I think people believed he would be here for the long haul. Jerry did a lot of good in his short tenure as SIU’s AD, but I, like of lot of other people, feel there is still work to be done. Having said that, I know how much coaching means to him. A person has to follow his/her dreams.
2 What is your favorite sport to write about?
Baseball/softball is my favorite sport to write about. Because I spent so much time playing the game, I feel I have a better grasp on the nuances and quirks of the game. On the other hand, there is nothing I like better than watching Saluki basketball. The speed of the game, the athleticism of the players is breathtaking.
3 You will retire in a few months from The Southern, where you were a reporter, sports editor and outdoors editor. What is your take on the future of print journalism?
I think it will always exist. Small-town papers are vital to the health of their communities. Newspapers cover school boards, city councils and county boards. Someone needs to serve as watchdog of the taxpayer’s dollar and newspapers are uniquely positioned to do that — either in print or augmented by online coverage. And, in these trying political times, The New York Times and Washington Post are thriving because of their investigative work. Again, newspapers are better able to devote time, resources and space to in-depth investigative journalism.
4 You have also been a member of the Southern Illinoisan editorial board. What do you think about the impeachment investigation into President Donald Trump?
No person is above the law. Members of Congress, of both parties, have taken an oath to defend and protect the Constitution of the United States. When evidence grows that a president has abused his power or broken the law, it is the constitutional duty of the House of Representatives to investigate. In this political climate, at least at this moment, it is unlikely the Senate would convict the president. However, I believe it is important for the House to proceed if for no other reason than to make it clear to future presidents the limits of executive power.
5 What would you consider to be your single greatest accomplishment in the newspaper business?
Surviving. And, that’s only half-facetious. Over the years, I’ve covered presidents, governors, big time athletes, goose callers, high school athletes and the everyday hobbies of the guy/gal who lives next door. The best accomplishment? Having people say this story or that story made me smile. Thanks. That makes it all worthwhile.

Texto completo: With the Trump-Ukraine scandal simmering and generating headlines every few hours, the story posted by The New York Times Tuesday on President Trump's border wall push may not be getting as much attention as it might have.
The article focuses mainly on a brief slice of time in March. But it adds stunning new details to a string of disturbing portrayals of the controversial, divisive president that have appeared in books and newspaper accounts since he took office in January 2017.
In a White House appearance Tuesday afternoon, he denied details of the story about his bizarre suggestions for fortifying the border wall, saying he “never said it, never thought of it."
Misstating where the story appeared, he said, “It's fake because almost everything The Washington Post does is fake. ... It was a total lie. It was corrupt reporting."
Here are nine things you should not miss from the story by reporters Michael D. Shear and Julie Hirschfeld Davis, which was based on interviews with more than a dozen White House and administration officials. The Times article was adapted from their book, “Border Wars: Inside Trump's Assault on Immigration," to be published by Simon & Schuster next week.
■ Trump has talked privately often about fortifying his border wall with a water-filled trench that would contain snakes or alligators. His aides went so far as to seek a cost estimate. Trump also wanted the wall electrified and to have spikes placed on top.
■Trump, who had publicly suggested soldiers shoot migrants who throw rocks, suggested that soldiers shoot migrants in the legs to slow them down. Aides told him that was not allowed, either.
■In an Oval Office meeting in March, Trump ordered aides to completely shut down the entire 2,000-mile border by noon the next day. His team, concerned about the impact on trade and the US economy, tried desperately to placate him as he shouted, “You are making me look like an idiot!" with a profanity added in.
■Days later, Trump suggested instead stopping migrants from crossing the border completely, with no exceptions. He told Kevin McAleenan, then the Customs and Border Protection chief (who is now Homeland Security secretary), on a trip to California that if McAleenan did it and got into any trouble, Trump would pardon him.
■On the same California trip, Trump worked a room full of Border Patrol agents and told them to turn away all migrants at the border. After the president left the room, McAleenan told the agents to ignore the president, that they did not have the authority to stop processing migrants.
■Former Homeland Security secretary Kirstjen Nielsen regularly found herself telling Trump the reasons he couldn't have what he wanted. Nielsen told Trump the government needed permission from landowners after he ordered wall construction accelerated. Trump told her to seize the land and let them sue.
■In a briefing on a different topic, the need for new legal authority to down drones, Trump told Nielsen, “Kirstjen, you didn't hear me the first time, honey," according to two people familiar with the conversation. “Shoot 'em down. Sweetheart, just shoot 'em out of the sky, O.K.?"
■After the March Oval Office meeting, Nielsen scrambled to come up with a six-point plan to control the border, but when she presented it to Trump, he dismissed it and told her what he really needed was a cement wall. She told him she didn't think it was possible, even if it would work. The designs for steel barriers had been finalized and contracts had been signed. He responded it was time for her to leave the administration.
■ Trump ultimately backed off his demands. However, advised by Stephen Miller who believed senior officials were thwarting Trump, the president began to purge Nielsen and others. The people who tried to restrain Trump have largely been replaced by a team that embraces Miller's policies, Shear and Davis reported.

Both presidents have released transcripts while in office trump tweet fodder for comparisons

Texto completo: It was April 29, 1974. President Nixon held a press conference announcing that he was about to release more than 1,200 pages of edited transcripts of his recorded conversations.
Nearly three weeks earlier, the House Judiciary Committee had subpoenaed the tapes. Nixon hoped releasing transcripts would be enough.
"... These transcripts will show," Nixon told the American people, "that what I have stated from the beginning to be the truth has been the truth: that I personally had no knowledge of the [Watergate] break-in before it occurred, that I had no knowledge of the coverup until I was informed of it by John Dean on March 21 . . ."
There was a problem, though. The transcripts were different from what was said on the tapes. At times, very different.
Last Wednesday, the Trump administration released a rough transcript of a phone call between President Donald Trump and the president of Ukraine that has led to an impeachment push in the House. According to the rough transcript, Trump offered Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky Justice Department help investigating Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, as well as a White House meeting in exchange for the investigation.
Trump said in a tweet Sept. 28 the rough transcript will prove it was a "very friendly and totally appropriate call."
To students of history, though, this is more fodder for the endless comparisons between Trump and Nixon.
The first revelation when Nixon released the transcripts was that he and his aides swore - a lot. "EXPLETIVE DELETED]" littered the pages and became a national joke. Rather than smooth the language, the all-caps censoring ended up magnifying what in many cases were mild swears like "hell" or "damn," making them seem worse than they actually were.
But there were other issues, too. Nixon said he had personally removed anything from the transcripts that weren't relevant. And as Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein later described in their book "The Final Days," Nixon had spent months excising "long and relevant" sections of the tapes from the transcripts.
While Republican leaders praised the president for his "fair and reasonable" release of the transcripts, Democratic leaders on the House Judiciary Committee refused to accept them. They still wanted the tapes. Nixon also was fighting a subpoena for the tapes from Special Prosecutor Leon Jaworski.
Nixon eventually released 19 clips of the tapes to the committee but refused to hand over any more, according to the New York Times.
Nixon's defense hinged on the transcripts showing that while he had discussed ways of covering up White House ties to the Watergate break-in, they made it clear he never ordered aides to take any of those steps.
He also said the transcript of a pivotal conversation on March 21, 1973, with White House Counsel John Dean made it clear he was just becoming aware of the White House ties to the break-in in that moment.
But in late June, a Republican member of the committee leaked internal memos to the Times, showing there were dramatic discrepancies.
Some of it could be explained by the House having superior audio equipment, but "words, phrases and sometimes whole sections of conversation contained in the Judiciary Committee transcripts are missing from or at variance with the expurgated White House narrative," the Times reported.
For example, Nixon mentioned that aides could avoid perjuring themselves in testimony by saying they didn't recall. In the White House version, Nixon suggests it - "But you can say 'I can't recall' " - whereas in the actual tape he ordered them to do it - "Just be damned sure you say, 'I don't remember; I can't recall; I can't give any honest answer to that that I can recall.'"
In the pivotal March 21 conversation with Dean, the White House transcript has Nixon saying "we could" buy time by paying off Watergate conspirator E. Howard Hunt, but, in the actual recording, he said "we should," later adding "for Christ's sakes, get it."
In the same conversation, Nixon told Dean to write up a Watergate report to defend the White House. On the tape, he added, "Understand, I don't want it that goddamned specific." That entire sentence was missing from the White House transcript.
Most importantly, the March 21 conversation was supposed to show Nixon was just learning of the cover-up that day. But in a recording three weeks earlier, Nixon said his former attorney general and 1972 campaign manager, John Mitchell, was "too clever" to allow himself to be "ruined" by Watergate. This comment was missing from the White House transcript.
On July 9, the committee released publicly its version of the transcripts. Two weeks later, the Supreme Court ordered the president to release the remaining tapes to the special counsel.
Nixon finally released the tapes, including the so-called smoking gun tape, from June 23, 1972, just a few days after the Watergate break-in, in which he talked about asking the CIA director to instruct the FBI to back off its investigation of the break-in.
Nixon announced his resignation on Aug. 8, 1974.

Why is the media absolving the Bidens?

Texto completo: Let's be clear: President Trump's call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy was not "beautiful" or "perfect." Far from it. Trump should not have asked Zelenskiy to investigate Hunter Biden or to cooperate with his private attorney Rudolph Giuliani's investigation of the former vice president's son. Since Trump made no promises or threats in the call, it is a stretch to claim his conduct rises to the level of "high crimes and misdemeanors." But it was highly inappropriate.
However, it does not follow that Trump's malfeasance absolves Joe Biden and his son of their malfeasance. Two things can be true at the same time: that Trump did something wrong, and that Joe and Hunter Biden did something wrong as well. This seems to be lost on many in the media, who are bending over backward to absolve the Bidens of wrongdoing.
For example, many in the media state as fact that Biden's actions in encouraging the firing of Ukrainian prosecutor Viktor Shokin had nothing to do with his investigation of the natural gas company, Burisma, which employed Hunter Biden as a board member. His firing was justified, they say, because the U.S. government, the International Monetary Fund and other U.S. allies were demanding he be fired as well. Furthermore, as CNN's Jake Tapper insisted this weekend, "according to the Ukrainians that investigation (into Burisma) was dormant at the time."
First, the phrase "dormant" means that an investigation into Burisma existed and was not closed. Second, we don't know for certain the Burisma investigation was, in fact, "dormant." Shokin has sworn in an affidavit it was not. His successor says it was. Who is lying? Nobody knows for sure. Journalists don't get to choose which version they prefer and report it as fact.
But here is what is incontestably true: Joe Biden had a conflict of interest. His son took a position with a Ukrainian natural gas company, despite having no experience in Ukraine or natural gas, the same month the elder Biden visited Kiev and urged Ukraine to increase its natural gas production. As Yoshiko Herrera, an expert in Russia and Eurasia policy at the University of Wisconsin at Madison, put it, "conflict-of-interest rules should have applied."
The latest spin is that there is nothing to see here because, as Reuters reports, the investigation of Burisma "focused solely on activity that took place before Hunter Biden, son of former U.S. Vice President Joe Biden, was hired to sit on its board." Did it occur to anyone that maybe that is precisely why Burisma hired the American vice president's son? According to the New York Times, Biden's hiring "allowed Burisma to create the perception that it was backed by powerful Americans." As Robert Weissman, president of the progressive watchdog Public Citizen, has said, "It's hard to avoid the conclusion that Hunter's foreign employers and partners were seeking to leverage Hunter's relationship with Joe, either by seeking improper influence or to project access to him." The revelation that Hunter Biden accepted a job with a Ukrainian company that was under investigation while his father was taking the lead in fighting corruption in Ukraine is damning, not exculpatory.
Biden knew about his son's involvement with Burisma, because the New Yorker has reported that in December 2015 Obama energy czar Amos Hochstein "raised the matter with Biden." We also know, via the Times, that "some State Department officials had expressed concern that Hunter Biden's work in Ukraine could complicate his father's diplomacy there." No doubt, there is a paper trail at the State Department to that effect.
The Code of Federal Regulations clearly states that when a federal official takes action he knows will affect "a relative with whom the employee has a close personal relationship" and "the circumstances would cause a reasonable person with knowledge of the relevant facts to question his impartiality in the matter, the employee should not participate in the matter." In other words, Joe Biden should not have taken the lead on Ukraine policy while Hunter Biden was working for Burisma. And even if Shokin deserved to be fired, Biden had no business being the one to deliver the ultimatum.
Hunter Biden's business dealings are crying out for investigation. That does not mean it was appropriate for Trump to raise them with the Ukrainian president. But the fact Trump did so does not give the media carte blanche to make excuses for the Bidens.

Texto completo: Rutgers University athletics director Pat Hobbs says for the next two months he'll oversee the search for a replacement for fired football head coach Chris Ash. Nunzio Campanile is the interim head coach for now.
Speculation is rampant that former Rutgers coach Greg Schiano will be a frontrunner. Schiano went 68-67 in his 12 seasons here (before the school joined the Big Ten), including a stretch from 2005-11 where the Scarlet Knights were 56-33 with six bowl appearances.
In 2006, Rutgers was 11-2 with a win over No. 3 Louisville, a week spent inside the AP Top 10, and a school-record No. 12 finish in the AP poll.
So will Schiano return? Here's what you need to know:
Schiano is not a frontrunner... yet
When asked on Monday, Hobbs did not directly reference Schiano but also did not rule out the possibility that the former coach is in the mix.
"Anybody who can help Rutgers football be competitive and win conference championships is a candidate for this position," Hobbs said.
Despite speculation that Schiano could be a favorite for the job, Hobbs said he has not spoken to or met with any potential candidates yet.
"No, and I'll repeat that because I know there's been reports out there of agreements and other things," Hobbs said. "I have had no conversations with anyone about the permanent position of being the head football coach at Rutgers University."
The Tennessee controversy
The University of Tennessee planned to hire Schiano as its new head coach in 2017, but school officials changed their minds after many Vols' fans, donors and politicians balked at the hire. Their complaints stemmed from Schiano's background as an assistant at Penn State during Jerry Sandusky's tenure as the Nittany Lions' defensive coordinator. Sandusky is serving 30 to 60 years in prison for his conviction on 45 counts of sexual abuse. Schiano has said he had no knowledge of Sandusky's crimes. Tennessee school officials said they fully vetted Schiano, including examining his time at Penn State.
The Schiano file
Schiano left Rutgers for a job with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in 2012 for his first-ever head coaching job at the professional level. He compiled a 11-21 record in two seasons before being fired in 2013.
He then coached two years at Berkeley Prep in Tampa before Urban Meyer hired him to be Ohio State's defensive coordinator and associate head coach in 2016.
Right now, he's not coaching
After three years with the Buckeyes, it was announced in early 2019 that Schiano would not be returning to the team. Reports suggested that the New England Patriots were hiring Schiano to be defensive coordinator, but he suddenly resigned due to his wishes to spend more time with his "faith and family."
Would a Schiano return mean The Chop is coming back?
The Rutgers football team's rallying cry was "Keep Chopping" during the Schiano tenure (Ash did away with the mantra. replacing it with "The Hunt"). Schiano started the craze after the 2005 opening game, when Rutgers blew a 20-point lead at Illinois and he had no idea what to say, according to the New York Times. Schiano gathered his players in a meeting room and recalled the words of a sports psychologist he once met at the University of Miami who told the team that playing football was like chopping wood. It caught on: It was not uncommon for a player to refer to a game as a "60-minute chop" and explain a big hit by saying, "I got my chop on."

Texto completo: A sci-fi serial killer movie is streaming on Netflix. And "Donnie Brasco" airs on Showtime.
What's Streaming
IN THE SHADOW OF THE MOON (2019) Stream on Netflix. Mysterious, bloody, possibly paranormal murders come with an order of cheese steak in this hard-to-categorize movie. Set in Philadelphia, the film opens in 1988 with the grisly deaths of a steak-slinging diner cook, a concert pianist and a bus driver. Each person collapses on the job, blood streaming from their ears, eyes and mouths. Neck wounds point to a serial killer's involvement. Seeing a chance to prove himself, a young police officer (played by Boyd Holbrook) throws himself into solving the bewildering case at the same time that his detective brother-in-law (Michael C. Hall, an expert in fictional serial killer stories onscreen) is doing the same thing. Where the story goes next, though, is more unusual than that premise might suggest -- the relationship between investigators and killer (Cleopatra Coleman) becomes a decades-long affair that eventually involves time travel.
THIS CLOSE Stream on AMC Premiere. The actors Josh Feldman and Shoshannah Stern created and star in this dramedy, which recently released its second season. Feldman and Stern play Kate and Michael, best friends who live in Los Angeles. She's an entertainment publicist; he's a graphic novelist. The plot revolves around the pair's struggle to balance their close friendship with their mutual need for self-discovery, plus the discrimination they encounter because they are deaf (as are the actors who play them).
What's on TV
DONNIE BRASCO (1997) 7:45 p.m. on Showtime. Audiences other than those at the New York Film Festival will have to wait until November to see Al Pacino return to the mobster movie genre in Martin Scorsese's "The Irishman." In the meantime, there's always "Donnie Brasco," Mike Newell's tale of friendship and deception in the world of organized crime. Pacino plays Lefty Ruggiero, an aging mafia hit man who develops a friendship with an undercover F.B.I. agent, played by Johnny Depp. The movie is based on the autobiographical book by Joseph D. Pistone, who infiltrated the Bonanno crime family in New York in the 1970s. For an undercover crime story on the opposite coast, see POINT BREAK (1991), airing at 10 p.m. on Showtime. This movie, directed by Kathryn Bigelow, stars Keanu Reeves as an F.B.I. agent who infiltrates a gang of surfers who are also bank robbers; their leader is played by Patrick Swayze. It is safe to assume that it is the only crime thriller to contain the line "Caught my first tube this morning, sir."
BLACK SWAN (2010) 6:10 p.m. on HBO. Natalie Portman plays a New York City ballerina under pressure in this thriller from Darren Aronofsky. The movie, which gives a highly dramatized peek at the world of ballet, won Portman an Academy Award. "Aronofsky makes this world (or his version of it) exciting partly by pulling back the velvet curtains and showing you the sacrifices and crushingly hard work that goes into creating beautiful dances," Manohla Dargis wrote in her review for The New York Times.

John Rothman, Who Made Archives Of Times Visible at a Click, Dies at 95

Texto completo: Long before Google, he helped create The New York Times Information Bank, an electronic repository of content from The Times and other publications.
John Rothman, who in an era before Google conceived and helped develop The New York Times Information Bank, a revolutionary system that let computer users easily find journalism by The Times and dozens of other publications, died on Thursday in Manhattan. He was 95.
His son, Andrew, said the cause was a stroke.
Introduced in 1972, the Information Bank was an electronic retrieval system that gave subscribers computer access, through telephone lines, to long abstracts of articles from The Times and other newspapers, including The Washington Post and The Los Angeles Times, as well as from magazines like Newsweek, Time and Business Week.
Mr. Rothman was a fitting leader for the Information Bank. He had, since 1946, worked for The New York Times Index, the invaluable monthly, quarterly and annual publications that offered summaries of articles from as far back as 1913, guiding students and researchers to find the full ones on microfilm.
"Indexing is a giant guessing game," Mr. Rothman wrote in Saturday Review magazine in 1965, when he was the index's editor. "Indexers must assess in advance what information a user is likely to seek, where he is likely to look for it and how much detail the abstract (or entry) should include to possibly spare him a trip to the original item in the newspapers."
Working on the index led Mr. Rothman to think about how computers could store, sort and deliver abstracts of Times content to users at the paper and other locations, like public libraries, universities and major corporations. He proposed the Information Bank -- the Times Index writ large -- in 1965 and began working on it with IBM the next year.
"The Times was interested in computers for typesetting and printing the newspaper," Mr. Rothman said in 2013 in an interview with the City University of New York Graduate Center, where he was a volunteer archivist after retiring from The Times in 1990. "And of course they were blocked by the unions. They were interested in having me pursue this because they thought it would give them a chance to get their feet wet with computers."
In 1972, Times staff members began testing the Information Bank as a research tool. It would soon augment the paper's archives, known as the morgue, where file cabinets are packed with clippings dating to the 19th century. In Times Talk, the paper's in-house newsletter, Mr. Rothman assured colleagues that "once the basic methods" of searching the Information Bank were mastered, "retrieving the information is quite simple."
In late 1972, the first installation of the Information Bank outside The New York Times was made at the University of Pittsburgh's Hillman Library. Within six months, its 14 customers included NBC, The Associated Press, the State Department, the C.I.A., the Library of Congress, Exxon and the Chase Manhattan Bank.
At its inception, the Information Bank's retrieval capability went back three years. Users at The Times and elsewhere were able to get full articles through microfiche cards, which were part of an institution's Information Bank subscription.
The Times was not alone in recognizing the promise of electronic data retrieval. Mead Data Central started its Lexis legal information service in 1973; its Nexis news and information service began six years later.
The Information Bank was a pioneering venture. But financially speaking, Mr. Rothman told the Graduate Center, "it wasn't a rousing success."
In 1983, The Times made a deal for Mead to exclusively license and distribute the Information Bank. The company shut the Information Bank's computer facilities and let Mead handle the transmission and dissemination of the Times's data as part of Nexis.
Hans Rothmann was born on April 21, 1924, in Berlin. He and his parents -- who were Jewish and designated by the Nazis as resident aliens because his grandfather was a Polish immigrant -- had their property and possessions seized and were expelled in 1939. They fled to Brooklyn, where his father, Max, sold refrigeration equipment to restaurants, and his mother, Johanna (Marcuse) Rothmann, known as Hennie, was a homemaker.
Hans learned English by working at a movie theater and attended Queens College before enlisting in the Army. (At 19, he changed his name to John Rothman, which he felt sounded more American.) While serving in military intelligence for the Fourth Armored Division in Europe, he used his native language to interrogate German prisoners of war and civilians.
After his discharge, Mr. Rothman went back to Queens College to finish his bachelor's degree, in English and comparative literature. He then sought a job at The Times. He wanted to be a theater critic -- he would earn a master's degree in 1949 at New York University for a thesis about drama criticism at The Times -- but was offered a job as an indexer. Within a few years, he was assistant editor of The Times Index.
In 1956, he earned a Ph.D. in comparative literature from Columbia University.
He worked for 44 years at The Times. In addition to editing the Index and serving as director of library and information services -- the position he held when the Information Bank began -- Mr. Rothman later oversaw the newspaper's research and information technology and its archives.
In addition to his son, Mr. Rothman is survived by his wife, Gertrude (Ullmann) Rothman; a daughter, Vivien Tartter; four grandchildren; and three great-grandchildren.
After his retirement, he organized the archives of Cyrus Vance, the lawyer and former secretary of state; William Scranton, the former governor of Pennsylvania; and Ellmore C. Patterson, the chairman of J.P. Morgan & Company during the 1970s.
From 2000 to 2015, he was a volunteer at the Graduate Center, where he brought order to the archives of its presidents and student organizations.
"This was his retirement gig, but he came in wearing a suit and tie, and he gifted this organization his archival skill," Polly Thistlethwaite, chief librarian of the graduate center, said by phone. "There were no sick days for him on a volunteer job."
John Rothman in 1950. Over a decade later, he wrote, "Indexing is a giant guessing game."; Mr. Rothman in 1975. The New York Times Information Bank allowed access to many publications.

Conservatives balk at Trump congratulating China's Communist Party

Texto completo: President Trump congratulated China on the 70th anniversary of communist rule there in a tweet that belies America's foreign policy position and ignores decades of human rights abuses.
"Congratulations to President Xi and the Chinese people on the 70th Anniversary of the People's Republic of China!" Trump tweeted on Tuesday morning.
Shortly thereafter, House Republican Conference chairwoman Liz Cheney of Wyoming released a statement contradicting the president and pointing to the People's Republic of China's oppressive governing tactics.
"This is not a day for celebration," Cheney said in a joint statement with Representative Mike Gallagher, Republican of Wisconsin. The United States will use the occasion to "rededicate ourselves to ensuring that the Chinese Communist Party is left on the ash heap of history," they added.
Trump's cheerful commemoration of China came as prodemocracy protests in Hong Kong against Chinese rule turned violent and one teenage protester was shot by police.
Republican Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska also released a statement that deeply contrasted with the Republican president.
"Today Chinese tyrants celebrated 70 years of communist oppression with their typically brutal symbolism: by sending a police officer to shoot a prodemocracy protester at point-blank range," Sasse said. "The freedom-seekers in Hong Kong mourn this anniversary, and the American people stand with them against those who deny their God-given dignity."
And Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas said, "From the Great Leap Forward to the Cultural Revolution to the camps in Xinjiang today, it has been a ghoulish 70 years of Chinese Communist Party control."
Even congressional allies of Trump, like Republican Representative Chip Roy of Texas, took issue with Trump's tweet. "I will pass," Roy tweeted about offering his congratulations.
Trump's critics on Twitter blasted him over his celebratory tweet for China.
"Congratulations to the people of Hong Kong for standing up for freedom. And best wishes to the people of China for freedom and democracy in the near future," wrote conservative columnist Bill Kristol.
Another conservative writer, Dan McLaughlin, similarly responded to Trump.
"I don't celebrate the Soviet revolution in Russia, the Nazi takeover of Germany, or the Khmer Rouge taking power in Cambodia," he tweeted. "For the same reasons, I do not celebrate Chairman Mao's revolution in China."
Trump's relationship with Xi has been rocky. Trump has called the Chinese president a friend, and yet, in the midst of a protracted trade war between the nations, Trump recently referred to Xi as an enemy.
But Trump's congratulatory tweet to Xi as the dictator oversaw a massive military parade appeared rather chummy.
Washington Post
Sanders raises $25.3 million in third quarter
Senator Bernie Sanders raised $25.3 million in the past three months, his campaign said Tuesday, a total that continues to demonstrate his strength with small donors as he fights to maintain support in key early-voting states.
The financial haul, among the first that a candidate has announced for the third quarter, will place Sanders in the top of the field for fund-raising.
It is also a much-needed boost for his campaign, as it looks to move past a summer slump that coincided with staff shakeups in New Hampshire and Iowa and a slip in some polls in early-voting states. And it will perhaps help quell the narrative that his campaign is in decline.
Sanders received 1.4 million donations in the third quarter, his campaign said.
His third-quarter dollar total exceeds the $18 million he raised in the second quarter, which was roughly the same amount he collected during the first six weeks of his campaign at the beginning of the year. His campaign did not say how much cash it had on hand.
Sanders announced his total for the quarter just minutes after Mayor Peter Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., said he had raised $19.1 million in the same period.
Meanwhile, Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey raised more than $6 million in the past three months, his campaign said on Tuesday, his best fund-raising quarter yet but one that still falls short of the leading candidates' hauls.
The end of the third quarter provided Booker's campaign with one notable success: meeting a self-imposed $1.7 million fund-raising goal in the final 10 days of September. The campaign told supporters that that amount was necessary to continue his candidacy, and that without it Booker would have dropped out.
The push gave Booker his biggest 10-day fund-raising period of the campaign. More than a third of what the campaign raised over the past three months came in the last 10 days.
Nonetheless, Booker's total fund-raising since his campaign began, roughly $19 million, lags behind even what Sanders raised in the third quarter.
The campaign also crossed the 165,000 unique donor threshold during its end-of-quarter blitz, meeting the new requirement set by the Democratic National Committee to make the November debate stage. But Booker is still short two qualifying polls. (He has already qualified for the October debate two weeks from now.)
Booker's financial struggles have mirrored his similarly stagnant polling, constantly in the low single digits. But he continues to rack up endorsements in key early states: His 84 endorsements in New Hampshire alone are more than those received by any other Democratic candidate, according to his campaign.

Texto completo: The same bunch who brought us the failed Russian "collusion" story, the sliming of Justice Brett Kavanaugh, and charges that President Trump is a racist (which also failed, given the spectacular increase in minority employment), are now rerunning the same show with different characters.
According to a still anonymous "whistleblower," who wrote a multi-page "complaint" about a phone call between President Trump and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky that he or she heard about secondhand from another unnamed person, President Trump held back military aide to Ukraine until "dirt" on Joe Biden and his son Hunter could be provided. Hunter Biden served on the board of Burisma, a Ukrainian gas company, which paid him $3.1 million over a 16-month period. This when his father was vice president of the United States and, according to Bloomberg, pursing "...an anti-corruption policy in Ukraine ... that included a call for the resignation of the country's top prosecutor who had previously investigated Burisma."
Ukraine's prosecutor general has since come out and said that there is no evidence of wrongdoing by U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden or his son, but something doesn't pass the smell test.
The New York Times reports the whistleblower is a CIA agent who was on loan to the White House. I have known several CIA agents and two directors of the CIA - George H.W. Bush and Porter Goss - and none were known for the kind of prose contained in the complaint. The document appears to have been written by a team of lawyers with a political objective, namely impeachment of the president.
This is a view shared by Fred Fleitz, president of the Center for Security Policy, a conservative, Washington, D.C.-based think tank. Fleitz is also a former deputy assistant to President Trump and to the chief of staff of the National Security Council (NSC).
Writing in The New York Post, Fleitz says: "I am very familiar with transcripts of presidential phone calls since I edited and processed dozens of them when I worked for the NSC. I also know a lot about intelligence whistleblowers from my time with the CIA.
"My suspicions grew ... when I saw the declassified whistleblower complaint. It appears to be written by a law professor and includes legal references and detailed footnotes. It also has an unusual legalistic reference on how this complaint should be classified. From my experience, such an extremely polished whistleblowing complaint is unheard of. This document looks as if this leaker had outside help, possibly from congressional members or staff."
When it comes to an impeachable offense, there is no there, there.
Like other attempts to undo the results of the 2016 election, this one should also fail if Republicans stick together, as Democrats did during the impeachment of Bill Clinton. Rep. Al Green (D-Texas) revealed his party's true motives when he said that if Trump isn't impeached he will be re-elected.
There are deeper issues for 2020. They include capitalism vs. socialism; higher unemployment vs. lower; judges who revere and obey the Constitution vs. judges who wish they had written it and know what the Founders intended better than the Founders; government health care vs. reforms in the current system to make it better; greater dependence on government vs. an expansion of individual liberty; rewarding initiative and success vs. penalizing the successful with higher taxes and more regulations.
Don't expect President Trump to start quoting this line from the Ukraine national anthem, but it could prove prophetic if Democrats fail in their latest cynical attempt to impeach him: "Like the dew before the sun enemies will fade. We will further rule and prosper in our promised land."

Texto completo: Listeners hungry for Sturgill Simpson's familiar croon better keep feasting on the old stuff – because the Kentucky songwriter's new album trades country comfort for all-out helping of rock 'n' roll grime.
On his new album "Sound & Fury," Simpson steps firmly away from the outlaw country sound where some once considered him a torchbearer. Instead, he ventures deep into the underbelly of fuzzy, futuristic guitar rock.
Simpson recorded "Sound & Fury" at Michigan's McGuire Motor Inn, working alongside bandmates Bobby Emmett, Chuck Bartels and Miles Miller. John Hill, known for his work with Portugal. The Man and Cage The Elephant, co-produced the album.
And, if Simpson tapping into a no-nonsense dystopian soundscape wasn't enough, Simpson teamed with leading names in anime to team the 40-minute stack of new tunes with a Netflix film of the same name. How's the album sound? And what can you expect from the Netflix film? Here's what we know about "Sound & Fury."
'Sound & Fury,' the album Simpson's 10-track "Sound & Fury" follows the subtle country storytelling of 2016's "A Sailor's Guide To Earth," which earned the major label newcomer international acclaim – including an unexpected nomination for Album of the Year at the 2017 Grammy Awards (he'd fall to Adele, but brought home Best Country Album that year).
As outlined in a New York Times profile earlier this month, Simpson found "Sound & Fury" by way of Nashville nonconformity, worn-down months on the road ("There was a point in 2017 where I thought I was just going to just go away," he said) and the immobile weeks after a sinus surgery that led him to rediscover the music of his formidable years.
In his time recovering from surgery, Simpson told Apple Music's Zane Lowe that he turned to hip-hop, the Cars and Black Sabbath, each influencing the rip-roaring sound that boils with audacity and swagger on "Sound & Fury."
A cathartic output, Simpson told the Times he wanted it to hit "like a Wu-Tang record." From the article:
"I could've very easily probably made the same record five times by now and just gone right down that middle lane and played it safe, and I'd have $80 million in the bank," Simpson said, dryly. "And I'd probably be hanging from a (expletive) rope on one of these trees over here by now, you know what I mean? So it's not worth it."
The result? A sonic onslaught that explores galaxies between genre.
Simpson blurs between disco itches and gritty guitar scratches on the album. There's the groove of instrumental opener, "Ronin;" The slick, funky flair of "A Good Look;" southern-soaked bombast with closer "Fastest Horse In Town;" and an ode to longing, reflective guitar-pop with six-minute album standout "Make Art Not Friends."
On the subtly spacey "Mercury In Retrograde," Simpson sings to the dog-and-pony show that once greeted his rising success: "They come back stage and on my bus, pretending to be my friend/ Shaking hands behind grandstands, wearing the same 'ole grin."
The songs come from "a weird spot," Simpson told Lowe earlier this year – including his distaste for the industry behind the art. "It is a dirty toxic industry," he said. "And I wanted to express a lot of that."
'Sound & Fury,' the film A 41-minute "Sound & Fury" anime epic, now streaming on Netflix, puts colorful (and unapologetically violent) context to the album.
Simpson, a Navy veteran once stationed in Japan, enlisted acclaimed creative Jumpei Mizusaki to direct, with "Afro Samauri" creator Takashi Okazaki serving as character designer.
The film draws blood-soaked lines between good and evil, a tension illuminated by dystopian chemicals and city-sprawling guerrilla warfare.
It took about $1.2 million to produce, the Times reported and follows "hegemonic structures, politics, corruption, greed – you know, things that usually lead to really (expletive) music," Simpson said.
On his new album "Sound & Fury," Sturgill Simpson steps firmly away from the outlaw country sound where some once considered him a torchbearer.

Texto completo: A reader who had an asthma attack on a Brooklyn street praises these "heroes and heroines."
To the Editor:
Re "E.M.T.s Deserve Pay Equity" (editorial, Sept. 22):
I am asthmatic. Nearly four years ago, I had an asthma attack on the streets of Williamsburg, Brooklyn. Fortunately for me, two good Samaritans saw me struggling and called 911. I sat with them on a street corner, seconds feeling like an eternity, gasping for breath.
I did not think that I would make it. In a minute or two, an ambulance arrived with the equipment needed to get my lungs to work again. The paramedics who took care of me, calmly giving me the meds I needed, encouraged me to hold on as the ambulance raced to the closest emergency room.
One of the paramedics even came back to my hospital bed that evening to visit me to make sure that I was O.K. I have always wished that I had known her name to thank her.
The nameless heroes and heroines who are emergency medical technicians deserve more credit and pay for the lives they save every day. I, for one, am eternally grateful.

Shrinking the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict

Texto completo: Shaking the rigid ideologies that have defined Israel's politics.
The inconclusive results of Israel's Sept. 17 election have thrust Israeli politics into a gripping deadlock. The center-left has no way to form a coalition, but for the first time in many years, neither does the right. This political paralysis reflects a profound change sweeping Israeli society in the last decade in the debate about the conflict.
For years the Israeli left promised: If Israel withdraws from the West Bank and permits the creation of a Palestinian state, this will bring peace and security. But election after election, Israelis rejected the left's generous offer and voted for right-wing governments. In the recent elections, for the first time, the Israeli right made a counteroffer: an annexation of swaths of the West Bank. But the election results show that neither proposal is acceptable to the Israeli public. Just as they rejected the two-state solution, they also rejected an annexation that would create a one-state reality. In other words, Israel's political deadlock reflects its ideological deadlock: Most Israelis oppose annexation of the West Bank just as strongly as they oppose a withdrawal.
To understand why Israelis oppose a withdrawal, just look at the Gaza Strip. In 2005 Israel pulled out of Gaza, removing the army, uprooting the settlers and shutting down its local intelligence operations. The move backfired. Ever since, every Israeli town within 10 miles of the Gaza Strip has been under threat of rocket attacks. Israelis look at life on the Gaza border and imagine what life would be like along the West Bank border after an Israeli evacuation. A 10-mile radius from the West Bank includes the greater Tel Aviv area and Jerusalem: Israel's demographic, economic, and cultural heartland. If central Israel is exposed to constant rocket attacks, Israel would simply cease to function. So it is easy to understand why Israelis are so wary of a withdrawal from the West Bank.
But it is also easy to understand why Israelis are wary of an annexation. Just take a look at Lebanon for a look at life in a Middle Eastern country where no national group has a clear majority. Lebanon is deeply polarized and fractured, and in order to avoid importing Lebanese-style anarchy, Israel must do everything to stop becoming a binational state. Israel's continued control of the West Bank, home to more than two and a half million Palestinians, imperils its Jewish national majority and risks thrusting the country into binational chaos.
Most Israelis are acutely aware of the trap they are in: Withdrawing from the territories would jeopardize their national security, but annexing the territories would jeopardize their national majority. In the recent elections, this conceptual trap produced political deadlock. And the only way out of this deadlock (and to avoid a third election) is to form a national unity government, in which the Likud Party and Blue and White share power. Such a government would give political expression to an emerging consensus in Israeli society. But ironically, this consensus is not about what must be done but what must not be done -- no to a territorial withdrawal, and no to a territorial annexation. This raises the concern that a unity government will settle on perpetuating the status quo.
But there is another way forward, an alternative to trying to "solve" the conflict or "manage it": shrinking the conflict. Israelis have started talking about steps that Israel could take to avert the threat of a one-state reality without increasing the risk of rockets on Tel Aviv. This third way could include paving a network of roads connecting all the Palestinian autonomous areas to each other, and transferring these roads to Palestinian Authority control. Israel's defense establishment already has various plans that could realize this goal, of achieving autonomous transportational contiguity for the Palestinians. Such a mighty initiative would eliminate Israeli checkpoints and give Palestinians full freedom to move across the West Bank. Israel could also give the Palestinian Authority more land for development around the major towns and support the construction of new Palestinian towns, along the lines of the successful Rawabi initiative. Other steps might promote the Palestinians' economic independence and prosperity.
This third way, of shrinking the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, wouldn't solve or end the conflict -- a hope that doesn't look realistic. It would contain it, it would lessen it. It would broaden the Palestinians' freedom of movement, their freedom to develop and their freedom to prosper -- all without an Israeli military withdrawal, and therefore no security dangers for Israeli civilians. Since this third way enhances the Palestinians' effective independence, it would mitigate the risk of a deterioration into a one-state reality and create new horizons for diplomatic progress.
Yet why has no government done so yet? The right-wing objects for obvious reasons: For many, the land is sacred and not even an inch can be given away. But surprisingly, the left also objects. For many, "concessions" should only be made in the context of a permanent peace accord that solves the conflict as a whole. Hence, a paradox: By making a full peace treaty a condition for progress on the ground, the impossibility of reaching a full peace treaty guarantees that there will never be progress on the ground. And thus emerged a baffling, implicit alliance between the right and the left. Both of them support a form of the status quo. Paradoxically, faith in the sanctity of peace is as much a contributor to the status quo as faith in the sanctity of the land.
If they form a national unity government, the Likud and Blue and White have a golden opportunity to govern from the new political center. To reject the right-wing vision of annexation and the left-wing vision of peace and embrace a centrist vision of shrinking the conflict. This is a vision that refuses to let the perfect be the enemy of the good. A national unity government could liberate Israel and the Palestinians from the rigid ideologies that have perpetuated the unsustainable status quo and dramatically transform the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

Texto completo: Some staff members at the Bronx group home hit and kicked residents, gave them cold showers and left patients with black eyes and bruises.
[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox .]
It was five years ago in a Bronx group home for developmentally disabled adults that reports surfaced of workers physically abusing and neglecting residents. Some staff members hit and kicked them, gave them cold showers, spit in their faces and left some with black eyes and other bruises.
When the sister of one resident called the facility, a worker answered, "Good morning, Bronx Zoo," a civil rights lawsuit alleged.
Now New York State has agreed to pay $ 6 million to settle that lawsuit, which had been brought on behalf of three residents, all profoundly disabled women, ages 39 to 52, who had been abused at the facility, according to settlement papers filed on Monday in Federal District Court in Manhattan.
In addition, the state spent almost as much defending the lawsuit, paying $ 5.7 million thus far to more than a dozen private law firms retained to represent the state employees named as defendants, according to the state comptroller's office.
As part of the settlement, the State Office for People With Developmental Disabilities also agreed to take the extraordinary step of surrendering control of the facility to a private nonprofit agency that will oversee the residents' care using its own employees -- a provision the plaintiffs insisted upon, their lead lawyer, Ilann M. Maazel, said.
"We lost all faith that the agency can run this house effectively," Mr. Maazel said. "The most important thing the families want is for their loved ones to be safe, and they had no confidence that the state would keep them safe."
Jennifer O'Sullivan, a spokeswoman for the Office for People with Developmental Disabilities, said the proper care and treatment of people supported by the agency "is our highest priority, and this resolution will help ensure these residents receive it."
The facility, which is known as the Union Avenue I.R.A., includes three group homes housing up to two dozen disabled residents that are part of the network of more than 1,000 state-run group homes.
Laura Kearins, whose 50-year-old sister has lived at the facility since 1992, and who was one of the plaintiffs, said she hoped that the transfer of ownership would be done expeditiously.
"I pray that it's a very quick change," Ms. Kearins said, adding that she wanted all of the Union Avenue residents to "be able to live happy lives, lives that are not lived in fear of what's going to happen to them next."
The settlement comes in a case that not only exposed the mistreatment of the Union Avenue residents, but also revealed a culture in which employees who sought to report misconduct faced retaliation and intimidation.
For example, a whistle-blower offered detailed accounts of the abuse in a series of anonymous letters to a state official and several families in 2014. The letter writer, who described being afraid of retribution for reporting the abuse, was later identified as a group home employee.
A state investigation later substantiated allegations of misconduct by 13 workers.
But the state failed to fire any of the employees, The New York Times reported in June.
A state arbitration process shielded the workers who had been cited for abuse and neglect. They were typically sent to other jobs in the system.
Another provision of the deal seeks to bar the employees named in the lawsuit from having contact with any of the three plaintiffs.
The settlement document says the defendants have designated $ 1.5 million of the state's settlement as fees for the plaintiffs' law firm, Emery Celli Brinckerhoff & Abady. But the document also makes it clear that ultimately the judge, Paul A. Engelmayer, and not the state, will decide the legal fees and approve the settlement.
The settlement funds are to be placed in special needs trusts for each plaintiff, the document says.
The lawsuit was scheduled for trial this fall, but at a hearing in April, Judge Engelmayer urged a lawyer for the Office for People with Developmental Disabilities to settle the case, given the "substantial consequences" in potential damages and demands for reform that the state could face if the plaintiffs proved their case.
"The state has an obvious interest in helping control its destiny by helping shape the outcome here," the judge said. He suggested that the lawyer tell her office that "the judge shook us by the lapels and basically said, this case ought to settle and ought be taken seriously early."
