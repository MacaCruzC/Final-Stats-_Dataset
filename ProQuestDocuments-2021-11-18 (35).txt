Texto completo: It’s easy to find an obvious motive for President Trump’s well-documented and much-ballyhooed “war” on California. After all, this state in 2016 gave Hillary Clinton a margin of more than 3 million votes over Trump and he’s felt hurt and angry over it ever since.
He’s taken action after action against this state’s best interests, one example his September attempt to eliminate California’s unique authority the early-1970s Clean Air Act to regulate its own air quality. Even though Trump and his handpicked chief of the federal Environmental Protection Agency moved the other day to revoke that ability, most legal authorities say he can’t actually do it because California’s right to fix its air was granted by Congress, not the President of that time, Republican Richard Nixon.
Presidents have a lot of executive authority, those legal experts say, but they cannot unilaterally reverse acts of Congress.
Showing its whimsical nature, Trump’s administration shortly after announced it would withhold highway funds from dozens of California areas because they don’t meet federal clean air standards – even though some of the affected areas do in fact meet those standards. So Trump wants to penalize California for having dirty air at the same time he seeks to take away its ability to clean up that same air. Go figure, or as Democratic U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein deadpanned, the combined moves “seem counterintuitive.”
Trump also threatens to withhold federal grants from police in California’s many “sanctuary cities.” He warned he would cut federal wildfire aid and penalize San Francisco because its homeless population allegedly dumps human waste and hypodermic needles into the Pacific Ocean and San Francisco Bay. Except they don’t do that.
Time after time, Trump trumpets actions against California, with the state’s attorney general, Xavier Becerra, reacting with lawsuits like a Pavlovian laboratory dog.
But does Trump really mean all this seriously, when he’s had so little success at it? Or is another agenda at work here?
This question arises because the pre-presidency Trump was in effect a carnival barker, always aware of the legendary circus impresario P.T. Barnum’s observation that “There’s a sucker born every minute.” Trump the showman understood while running his reality television show that, as a New York Times television critic observed, “the only rule is that there are no rules.”
He carried this sense over into his presidency, where a day rarely goes by without some crisis, be it a threat to bomb Iran or one to punish California. Trump also knows that California-bashing is a longtime, popular national pastime everywhere outside the Golden State.
So when Trump blasts America’s longtime allies and cozies up to the most murderous of foreign dictators, it may all be for show, with the sense that as long as he keeps America entertained, he can get on with his real interest, which is making profits.
It’s an approach completely unlike any previous President, and one whose ultimate consequences are unknown as an impeachment inquiry gets started. But it is fairly clear that Trump stands little chance of making good on most of the attacks he’s made against California.
Top state officials say they are fairly certain of that, despite a Supreme Court that’s upheld some other unprecedented Trump actions, like his condoning the caging of small immigrant and refugee children.
Said Gov. Gavin Newsom, who seems to enjoy sparring with Trump, and so is part of the President’s new show, “If Trump prevails, we will have more asthma in California…and other diseases. But that’s the state of things today in this country…We will fight back when he goes after our Dreamers and our health standards. And we will win in the courts.”
Added Becerra, “If the arguments in the President’s tweets are the arguments they will use to propel (legal actions), then we’re looking pretty good and we will enjoy facing them in court.”
The trick here is to see Trump’s real apparent motive: Less to hurt California or the potential victims of his actions than to keep the spotlight constantly on himself, impeachment investigation or not, and thereby help ensure another presidential term and even more personal profits while he steers government and foreign spending to his many properties.

Texto completo: After Illinois freelance writer Melissa Blake wrote an anti-Trump op-ed piece for CNN last month, critics fired back with comments about her looks, calling her fat, referring to her as "it," and comparing her to a potato and a blobfish.
Blake, who is disabled due to the genetic bone and muscular disorder Freeman-Sheldon syndrome, responded with a tweet so cheerfully defiant that the internet swooned.
"During the last round of trollgate, people said that I should be banned from posting photos of myself because I'm too ugly," she wrote. "So I'd just like to commemorate the occasion with these 3 selfies..."
More than 293,000 people have liked her tweet, with her new fans calling her a goddess, a bad (expletive) and a powerful woman. One issued a "new super-hero alert," and another offered six (emoji) trophies with a fiery "Work it girl! YOU IZ FAB."
Reached by email, Blake, who lives in DeKalb, said the response was "beyond anything I could have imagined -- and quite overwhelming."
"I posted the tweet on Saturday night (Sept. 7) and didn't expect this huge response at all," she said. "But I'm so glad that it's resonating with people and to have something so positive come out of those nasty, negative comments is such a joy!"
Blake, who graduated from Northern Illinois University with a journalism degree in 2005, writes about disability, relationships and pop culture on her blog, So About What I Said (Tagline: "Smart is the new sexy, awkward is the new cool, flawed is the new beautiful.") Her writing has appeared in The New York Times, Glamour and Cosmopolitan, according to her online biography.
As interest in her tweet grew, she offered some background on the online abuse she's encountered, including copies of offensive messages from some of her trolls:
In a follow-up blog post, Blake wrote, "I'm getting so tired of people (read: men) thinking it's OK to insult a woman's appearance. Yes, my disability makes me look different. Trust me, I know that. I've known that my entire life.
"And people wonder why I've struggled so much with self-acceptance when it comes to how I look and our society's notion of what "beautiful" is. It's because of comments like these -- comments that dismiss me and deem me unworthy."
Mark Hoppus of Blink-182 was among those who shared her tweet, calling her a hero.
By Sept. 9, it was clear that Blake had a hit on her hands; she tweeted about waking up to 26,000 Twitter followers, an email from a book publisher and an interview request from BBC.
But Blake, once described by a friend as a "down-home Carrie Bradshaw," seemed to be taking the attention in stride.

Texto completo: We now know that The New York Times has reported that the government official who blew the whistle on President Donald Trump's attempts to use a foreign government for his own corrupt purposes was a member of the CIA who was detailed to the White House. We should not know this, because in a matter of days or perhaps hours – maybe even by the time you read this – we will probably know the man's name and everything else about him.
This is a problem, because there are people who want to do harm to this whistleblower and his colleagues. Prominent among them is the president of the United States himself, who has already said that he would like to know the identities of those who have placed him in jeopardy (or, in yet more jeopardy) of impeachment. Indeed, Trump thinks the whistleblower should be dealt with as an enemy spy and a traitor to the state.
In his usual emulation of the mob bosses and dictators he admires, the president said: "I want to know who's the person, who's the person who gave the whistleblower the information? Because that's close to a spy. You know what we used to do in the old days when we were smart? Right? The spies and treason, we used to handle it a little differently than we do now."
He means the death penalty, of course.
This is the same president who thought he could mend fences with the intelligence community at the start of his term by giving a speech at the most sacred place at the CIA, in front of the wall of unmarked stars that commemorate American intelligence professionals who gave their lives in the course of their duties. As usual, Trump couldn't help himself, and instead of showing respect to the people who died in anonymity to protect the nation, he talked about his favorite subject: himself.
CIA officer trying to do his job This time, a CIA officer is trying to protect his nation by warning his superiors of a danger emanating from the Oval Office itself. This was not some rogue nitwit stuffing classified material in her pantyhose like Reality Winner, or a self-important stooge like Edward Snowden collaborating with our avowed enemies overseas. This is an intelligence community professional who, as Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph McGuire confirmed repeatedly to the House Intelligence Committee, went through all the proper channels and observed every legal necessity to alert his colleagues that the president was trying to muscle an American friend under attack by Russia into doing his personal bidding.
The whistleblower's reward for observing proper procedure has been a chorus of orchestrated Republican talking points aimed at discrediting him and his motives. The message from the GOP is clear to this and any other whistleblower who might ever threaten a Republican president: Cross our Dear Leader, and we will destroy you. Such is the patriotism of a party that is now nothing more than a seedy cult of personality. Even Sen. Mitt Romney – not exactly a tower of courage himself these days – said recently about the Republicans trying to avert their eyes from Trump's misdeeds: "I think it's very natural for people to look at circumstances and see them in the light that's most amenable to their maintaining power, and doing things to preserve that power."
Trump's apologists will wave away his comments (including his reference to journalists as "scum") as just another meaningless example of the president's swaggering New York style of verbal venting. It might be acceptable for a rich kid from Queens to talk like a sociopathic mobster or beetle-browed junta enforcer when he's trying to bully the local stonemasons and carpenters on his latest slapdash condo project, but it is utterly unacceptable in a president of the United States. The House Judiciary Committee should add this threat against a CIA officer to its list of impeachable offenses.
Trump's unhinged rhetoric has inspired unstable people to take matters into their own hands, including one who is now in prison for sending bombs. The president must be called to account for his abuses of power sooner rather than later, but every decent American left in public life must immediately demand that he stop any further attacks on this whistleblower, before it's too late and there's another star on the wall at Langley.

Texto completo: Lena C. Taylor
Did you know that there were two Emancipation Proclamations? Okay, technically one was called the Preliminary Emancipation Proclamation. It’s the proclamation that most of our textbooks leave out of our history lessons. It is the proclamation that is least understood. It is the proclamation that, had things gone differently could have led to the continued enslavement of people of African descent in this country. In fact, the backstory of President Abraham Lincoln’s historic emancipation proposition, to use today’s vernacular, was a hot mess!
Afterall, this year marks the 400th anniversary of the first ship arriving in Point Comfort, Virginia, carrying 20 enslaved Africans in August 1619. Historians and lay people alike, are revisiting or learning for the first time, different aspects of the depraved treatment of people of African ancestry in what would become America. The following excerpt from the 1619 Project, that was led by journalist Nikole Hannah-Jones for The New York Times captures this nation’s convoluted history with the trafficking of black people.
“Out of slavery — and the anti-black racism it required — grew nearly everything that has truly made America exceptional: its economic might, its industrial power, its electoral system, diet and popular music, the inequities of its public health and education, its astonishing penchant for violence, its income inequality, the example it sets for the world as a land of freedom and equality, its slang, its legal system and the endemic racial fears and hatreds that continue to plague it to this day. The seeds of all that were planted long before our official birth date, in 1776, when the men known as our founders formally declared independence from Britain.
The product of those early seeds included a union that was divided about money, tariffs, and tax revenue. Southern states were upset that paid the majority of the tariffs, while Northern states benefitted the most from them. Facing an increase in tariffs that would have Taylortripled the Southern states’ payments, these states talked early about seceding from the union. This struggle for fair taxation and laws impacting Southern slavery such as the Dred Scott Supreme Court decision proved to be the breaking point. As states turned against each other, Lincoln was desperate to hold the union together. Ironically, the Civil War was the vehicle to do that.
Yet, history has often mischaracterized this war as a primary moral struggle to address slavery. However, history frequently sidesteps the fact that during his presidential campaign, candidate Abraham Lincoln said “I have no purpose, directly or indirectly, to interfere with the institution of slavery where it exists. I believe I have no lawful right to do so, and I have no inclination to do so.” Lincoln repeated those words after his first inauguration. Understanding that helps us better understand what Lincoln intended for the Preliminary Emancipation Proclamation.
Lincoln announced, on September 22, 1862, that if the rebels did not end the fighting and rejoin the Union by January 1, 1863, all slaves in the rebellious states would be freed as punishment.
The Confederacy did not rejoin the Union and that is how we got the second Emancipation Proclamation.

Democratic Debate to Have At Least 12, on Same Stage

Texto completo: The Democratic field is shrinking. But the number of candidates on the debate stage is about to grow.
At least 12 presidential hopefuls are expected to appear together on a single night at next month's televised debate in Ohio, Democratic officials said on Friday, contrary to recent speculation that the event might be spread across two days to accommodate the large lineup.
Squeezing a dozen voluble politicians onto one stage could prove unwieldy, with plenty of opportunities for cross talk as lower-polling candidates hunt for what may be their last chance at a national breakout moment. Moderators from CNN and The New York Times, the debate's co-sponsors, will be tasked with keeping order.
The Ohio debate, on Oct. 15, is set to include the 10 candidates who appeared at this month's debate in Houston, which was broadcast by ABC. In addition to that group, the billionaire former hedge fund investor Tom Steyer and Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii are scheduled to take the stage.
The format is meant to guarantee that viewers can see the party's top contenders face off against one another. Viewership rose for the debate held in Houston, the third of the campaign cycle and the first to feature two leading candidates, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, on the same stage.
A pair of CNN anchors, Erin Burnett and Anderson Cooper, will share moderating duties with The Times's national editor, Marc Lacey, at the debate, which will be held on the campus of Otterbein University in Westerville, Ohio.
No Democratic debate this year has allowed for more than 10 candidates onstage at once. But party officials faced a unique situation for next month's matchup.
Several candidates, including Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York City, have ended their bids because of a lack of support. Yet Mr. Steyer, who has not yet appeared at a televised debate, and Ms. Gabbard recently passed the threshold to qualify for a spot onstage.
Had Democratic officials opted for two nights, with six candidates randomly chosen for each round, voters may have been deprived of seeing the party's leading candidates debate one another directly. Another option -- to split the candidates by polling performance -- was used in 2016 for several Republican debates. But that arrangement led to criticism that the so-called undercard candidates were being unfairly stigmatized.
Choreographing a primary debate can be a tricky business. In a note to campaigns on Friday, the Democratic National Committee left open the possibility of a format change after Tuesday, the final day for candidates to meet the debate qualification criteria.
"Pending a final decision after the certification deadline, it is the intention of the D.N.C. and our media partners to hold the October debate over one night on Tuesday, Oct. 15," party officials wrote.
Viewers' interest in the 2020 race remains high. Ratings for this month's Houston debate surpassed 14 million viewers.
The second night of the first debate, held in Miami and hosted by NBC and Telemundo in June, drew 18.1 million viewers, breaking the record for the biggest television audience for a Democratic primary matchup.

Texto completo: Our guide to film series and special screenings happening this weekend and in the week ahead. All our movie reviews are at nytimes.com/reviews/movies .
CUTTING CLASS at the Alamo Drafthouse (Sept. 28-Oct. 13). As a tie-in with the Oct. 11 release of Bong Joon-ho's "Parasite," a stinging and darkly funny satire on class disparities in South Korea that won the top prize at Cannes in May, the Drafthouse is showcasing other films that deal with vengeance across social strata. The selections include Claude Chabrol's "La Cérémonie" (on Saturday), with Isabelle Huppert and Sandrine Bonnaire playing characters based on Christine and Léa Papin, real-life sibling maids who killed their employers; and Kim Ki-young's "The Housemaid" (on Oct. 13), a South Korean classic in its own right, in which a new housekeeper (Lee Eun-shim) brings temptation and terror to a music teacher's household.

FIVE BY FORSYTH at the Museum of the Moving Image (Sept. 27-Oct. 6). The Scottish director Bill Forsyth has fallen off the radar of late -- his most recent feature was 20 years ago -- but in the 1980s he was a critical darling. (In 1983 in The New York Times, Janet Maslin wrote of his "Local Hero," showing on Sunday: "Genuine fairy tales are rare; so is film-making that is thoroughly original in an unobtrusive way.") This retrospective is timed to a new restoration of "Gregory's Girl" that opens at Film Forum on Oct. 4. The sleeper may be "Breaking In" (on Saturday), scripted by John Sayles, with Burt Reynolds as an experienced thief who takes a protégé (Casey Siemaszko) after the two separately raid the same house.

FRITZ LANG'S INDIAN EPIC 'THE TIGER OF ESCHNAPUR' AND 'THE INDIAN TOMB' at Film Forum (Sept. 27-Oct. 3). A sweeping adventure filled with tigers, snakes, romance and the camp-connoisseur favorite Debra Paget, these two movies marked Lang's return to German film production after more than two decades in Hollywood, although both were shot and set in India. Released in the United States in 1960 as a condensed 92-minute version, the films are showing here as separate features, which means that more than three hours of expressionistic color and wild plot developments await.
212-727-8110, filmforum.org
NEW YORK FILM FESTIVAL at Film at Lincoln Center (Sept. 27-Oct. 13). The world premiere of Martin Scorsese's "The Irishman" and other main-slate screenings may nab the headlines, but you can spend the entirety of this festival at the sidebar programs and come away sated -- not least because this year's revivals include a 25th-anniversary restoration of Bela Tarr's "Satantango" (on Sunday), a film that runs seven and a half hours. For the festival's 57th edition, the big retrospective celebrates the 100th anniversary of the American Society of Cinematographers. In the first week, the members represented include the innovative Chinese-American cinematographer James Wong Howe, with "The Hard Way" (on Saturday), a melodrama in which Ida Lupino refuses to let anyone impede her sister's rising stage career, and the film noir master John Alton, with the Los Angeles police procedural "He Walked by Night" (on Tuesday). In the annual Spotlight on Documentary lineup, Sergei Loznitsa offers a sardonic found-footage look at the pageantry surrounding Statlin's death in "State Funeral" (on Saturday and Sunday), while in "Free Time" (also on Saturday and Sunday), the city symphonist Manny Kirchheimer makes a cine-collage out of scenes of downtime in New York shot from 1958 to 1960, adding a gently off-kilter sound design of classical music, jazz and imperfectly synced noise.

Texto completo: Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
To get into the minds and notebooks of Times journalists, look no further than Instagram.
The app allows many reporters, editors and photographers based in New York and around the world to show how their professional and personal lives intersect. Their feeds become a repository for unpublished details and visuals, and serve as a creative outlet for their journalism-related interests.
Here are 12 Instagram accounts from journalists who span The Times's report and take readers behind the scenes.
Kathy Ryan, @kathyryan
Director of photography for The New York Times Magazine
Follow for: Artistic scenes from the New York Times headquarters, in black, white and red
In 2012, a shaft of light falling across some stairs in the Times Building caught Kathy Ryan's eye. She posted a photo of it on Instagram, and from there evolved a series she dubbed "Office Romance."
"It's overwhelmingly about the light for me," says Kathy, who captures The Times through the people and objects in its Renzo Piano-designed building -- "the greatest studio in the world."
Her subjects, often bathed in soft sunlight punctuated by stripes of shadow, appear ethereal in her posts -- a conscious contrast to the chaos of working at a news organization. She shoots them mainly in black and white, with the occasional pop of cherry red, in a style that evokes film noir.
Each post, she says, captioned with the time and date she took the photo, allows her followers "for a split second to be in this remarkable building in this remarkable city."
But if the Times Building looks like the Garden of Eden on Kathy's feed, its sins can be seen on @dont_tell_renzo, a humorous account she recommends.
Pete Wells, @pete_wells
Restaurant critic
Follow for: A slice (often literally) of New York's dining scene
Pete Wells has a disclaimer in his Instagram bio: "sloppy with lighting; struggling with focus."
"I'm kind of picking the least bad photo from my three visits to a restaurant," Pete says of his approach to posting. "And sometimes it's still pretty bad."
While he makes no claims to high art, his feed brings followers to tables across New York City, from slice shops to high-end sushi counters. They can also see his review process, which often involves comparing meals at similar restaurants.
Pete credits Instagram for "one of the biggest subtle changes in restaurant design" in recent years: lighting fixtures that act as spotlights for your plate, chosen with amateur food photographers in mind. But when the lighting isn't ideal, he admits he uses his iPhone's flash, "even though it's the biggest no-no in food photography."
"If you do it right," he advises, "you can get really great high-contrast, shadow-filled dramatic pictures."
Sebastian Modak, @sebmodak
52 Places correspondent
Follow for: Armchair travels around the world at a breakneck pace
Unlike most Times journalists, Sebastian Modak actually has Instagram in his job description. As the 52 Places Traveler, he uses the platform daily to bring along his followers on his yearlong adventure.
Sebastian's feed brims with his best shots from each destination and gives a sneak peak of his weekly columns. But his Instagram Stories are, well, another story. The often humorous slide shows of photos, text and videos reveal the "not fun part of travel" -- flight cancellations, exhaustion, middle-of-the-night driving -- and everyday moments, like a haircut in Croatia, that don't make it into his articles.
Followers have sent Sebastian a plethora of recommendations, and he has taken them up on offers to be his tour guide. "It's a really nice way to meet people," he says, "and I never even thought of Instagram as a tool for that."
Pamela Paul, @pamelapaul2018
Editor of the Book Review
Follow for: Reflections on books and illustrators, occasionally interrupted by three beguiling cats
The focus of Pamela Paul's Instagram feed is, unsurprisingly, books -- "both in terms of my life here at The Times and, on a more personal level, my life as a reader and also an author."
But her "gold standard" for a post is when her family's cats -- Zoomer, Loki and Octavian -- intrude upon her more purely literary posts.
In a rather meta photo, she recently documented her progress on a forthcoming children's book -- about a cat that gets in the way of a boy's reading -- with Zoomer lounging on some early illustrations. "It is not purely fiction," says Pamela, who has two sons and a daughter.
Farther from home, Pamela likes to post photos of foreign-language books and bookshops she stumbles across: "It's a lot of what I'm doing when I'm abroad, and I think it's part of what people are looking to me for." Mindful of her own aversion to Instagram posts of idyllic vacations, she adds, "But it doesn't make anyone feel bad."
Eve Lyons, @lyonse
A Styles photo editor
Follow for: Photographers to have on your radar, with a dash of mustard yellow
For Eve Lyons, what started as a practical concern last year -- finding meeting spaces after a recent renovation of The Times's newsroom -- turned into "a happy accident."
When photographers came in for portfolio reviews, she started using the diner-style yellow booths installed during the office makeover. As an experiment, she began doing short shoots at the end of each meeting to feature the artists on her Instagram.
"The yellow is such a good visual signifier," says Eve, who likes the playfulness that the colorful booths elicit.
As the series evolved, she added more photos to highlight not only the photographers, but also pieces from their portfolios. It has turned into "a destination for people to explore new work, new stories, new projects," not to mention her own visual Rolodex of freelancers.
On a temporary assignment, Eve has decamped to Los Angeles, where actual diner booths are serving as her stand-in.
Dionne Searcey, @dionnesearcey
Politics reporter
Follow for: Snapshots of life in West Africa , and election coverage from across the United States
Dionne Searcey joined Instagram four years ago, after becoming The Times's West Africa bureau chief. She saw the platform as a way to document everyday life in a part of the world that remains off the radar for many.
"I always tried to show things that were unexpected," she says, and "to bust stereotypes of the continent in general being a place that was full of bad things."
Her Instagram posts, often short vignettes drawn from the stories she writes, have featured cow herders in Nigeria, athletes in Senegal and her own life as a correspondent.
Dionne, who is from Nebraska and recently joined the Politics team to cover the 2020 election, has already started posting photos from her new beat.
"I'm hoping to travel to parts of rural America that people on the coasts call 'flyover country,"' she says, comparing her work in the United States to her work abroad. "I think that is a similar approach and a similar philosophy, of showing parts of America that a lot of people in big cities don't see."
Hannah Wise, @sewmanycomments
A social media editor
Follow for: Crafting #inspo and amusing news commentary
After covering a police shooting for The Dallas Morning News in 2016, Hannah Wise wanted a tactile, screen-free activity to do in her free time. The solution came when she saw a "really bizarre" comment on one of her reporting partner's stories and decided to embroider it.
With that, her new hobby and new Instagram account were born. Hannah, who has a background in graphic design, compares it to drawing in thread. She stitches quotes and comments that amuse her, or that touch a nerve in journalism.
Most of her hoops end up as gifts. A 12-inch one memorializing the journalists who were killed at the Capital Gazette last year was included in The Dallas Morning News's care package for the Maryland newspaper.
Fittingly, she used embroidery to announce her new job at The Times last month.
Gia Kourlas, @giadk
Dance critic
Follow for: Mesmerizing short videos of dancers in the studio
For nearly three years, Gia Kourlas has written the weekly #SpeakingInDance column, which explores the world of dance through videos posted on Instagram.
The sessions are filmed by professional videographers and appear on The Times's main Instagram account, but Gia also takes her own videos and edits them for her personal feed. She hopes her followers feel "like you're in a room with me, seeing a different perspective."
Growing up in Ohio, Gia, who trained as a dancer, didn't get to see many performances. Now, with Instagram, she can bring dance to more people around the country, and the world.
"I just want to get more eyes on dance," she says, "in any way I can."
Mujib Mashal, @mujmash
Senior correspondent in Afghanistan
Follow for: Poignant scenes from a changing Afghanistan
Mujib Mashal's reporting has taken him across Afghanistan, where he was born and raised, and South Asia. He likes to take photos as part of his notes, documenting the remote, visually stunning areas where his work takes him.
"Those are places that sometimes I don't get back to," he explains, "so I want to make a record for my own memories and archives."
From that collection, he chooses photos for his Instagram feed to illustrate the news he covers, or simply to show life in Kabul, where he lives -- a stop at a park, a cafe, an ice cream shop.
Mujib uses Instagram Stories to present highlights from his bigger projects. He thinks of them as trailers to draw readers in through the videos, sounds, photos and quotes he gathers during his reporting.
Melissa Clark, @clarkbar
NYT Cooking reporter
Follow for: Cooking ideas and tutorials, and vicarious global eating
Melissa Clark wants her Instagram feed to feel inviting, and to inspire home cooks. That means mostly informal shots of the new dishes she tests in her Brooklyn kitchen -- no filters or food styling involved.
"I like to show people how I really do it," she says.
Melissa also sees the platform as an educational tool. She has created in-depth guides to techniques such as yogurt making with Instagram Stories. And when she travels, she uses her food photos to share what she learns, like how it's actually O.K. to eat oysters in the summer.
In addition to pictures of cooking and eating, you'll see Melissa's daughter, husband and friends. "Each post tells a story, but the whole entire group tells a story, too," she notes. And if you look closely, that story follows a pattern, which Melissa boils down to "cake, child, sardine or anchovy, cocktail."
Chang W. Lee, @nytchangster
Photographer
Follow for: Visual stories told in up to 10 photos
Photojournalists may take hundreds, even thousands, of shots for a single story, but only a fraction will end up online -- and even fewer in print.
For Chang W. Lee, Instagram is a way not only to publish more work from his Times assignments, but also to express himself through the photo selection and edits. In his posts, he often arranges multiple images to tell a complete visual story.
"It's like my own publication," he says.
Chang, who has traveled around the world for The Times, favors human interest stories. He has shot young basketball players in the Philippines, impoverished families in the United States, and the aftermath of natural disasters. He also has an eye for capturing the artistry and physical feats of athletes in motion at major events like the Olympics and the United States Open.
Nick Casey, @caseysalbum
Andes bureau chief
Follow for: Reporting outtakes from Latin America
Nick Casey's Instagram -- a play on his Twitter account, @caseysjournal -- acts as an extension of his notebook. Details that don't make it into his stories, behind-the-scenes reporting shots and glimpses of daily life in Latin America fill his feed.
"If you look at my Instagram account and the reporting," Nick says, "they kind of put together one piece."
You can see photos from Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador, Easter Island and Colombia, where he lives. But perhaps his most photographed country is Venezuela, where he was based until 2016, when he was banned for his reporting on the country's economic collapse.
Now, whenever Nick returns to Venezuela, he posts as much as he can. He says his photos of trying to pay for things -- with stacks of bills and wire transactions, necessitated by the country's hyperinflation -- have particularly captured his followers' attention.

PROBE BIDEN AS A 'FAVOR'; Don seen holding up $400M in aid before chat with Ukraine's leader

Texto completo: Democrats in Congress got fresh fodder in their impeachment probe of President Trump on Wednesday, compelling the commander-in-chief to give a series of frenzied press conferences.
A partial transcript of a phone call released Wednesday showed Trump had asked Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Democratic presidential front-runner Joe Biden.
"I would like you to do us a favor," Trump told Zelensky in a July 25 phone call, according to a transcript released by the White House.
He went on to urge Ukraine's leader to work with Attorney General William Barr and Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani on an investigation into the former veep and his son Hunter Biden.
"There is a lot of talk about Biden's son, that Biden stopped the prosecution, and a lot of people want to find out about that," Trump said during the 30-minute call.
"So whatever you can do with the attorney general would be great."
For his part, Giuliani has admitted to conducting an extensive effort to find dirt on the Bidens. The former mayor has said, without proof, that the ex-veep wanted Ukraine's former top prosecutor fired to prevent an investigation of Hunter Biden, who was previously on the board of a Ukrainian gas company.
Trump insists there was nothing wrong about the July call. But Democrats view it is as a key piece of a pattern in which Trump misused the power of American foreign policy for political gain.
Trump reportedly put a hold on nearly $400 million in military aid to Ukraine days before the call, suggesting he was trying to make a quid pro quo with Zelensky - even if the tradeoff wasn't explicit.
"The release of the notes of the call by the White House confirms that the president engaged in behavior that undermines the integrity of our elections, the dignity of the office he holds and our national security," House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in a statement, a day after announcing an impeachment probe into Trump.
Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) said the call was a "shakedown" and said the transcript was "far more damning" than he expected.
Trump made no fewer than three press appearances Wednesday, right in the middle of the UN General Assembly in New York.
His tone ranged from self-pitying to disgusted as he lashed out at a range of perceived enemies.
Near the start of the day, he tried to spin the story by claiming, "A lot of people said, 'I never knew you could be so nice.' "
Trump and Zelensky appeared side by side in the afternoon.
"We had, I think, a good phone call. It was normal. We spoke about many things," Ukraine's leader said.
"Nobody pushed me."
Trump gave a solo press conference later in the day at the U.S. Mission to the UN. He used a familiar gaslight tactic from the Trump playbook, accusing Democrats of the exact charges he is facing - in this case, pressuring Ukraine to help his political agenda.
"They went there and they wanted to force the new president to do things that they wanted under the form of political threat," he said of congressional Democrats.
"That's what they're accusing me of, but I didn't do it."
He also insinuated former Vice President Biden and son Hunter took out "millions of dollars" from Ukraine and China, though he gave no details or evidence of the inflammatory charges.
He tauntingly said Democrats should ask for a transcript of an additional call he held with Zelensky, as well as "VP [Mike] Pence's conversation."
But news reports revealed a more panicked attitude behind the scenes.
He reportedly had begged Pelosi not to conduct an impeachment probe, asking her, "Can we work something out?"
Nevertheless, Trump's allies stayed true to form Wednesday.
"It's a dark day for the rule of law that a president is going to be found guilty without any proof," said House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.).
After about a week of stonewalling, the White House on Wednesday agreed to give lawmakers the whistleblower complaint at the center of the impeachment probe. Details of the document were not known as of Wednesday evening.
But Schiff called the allegations in the complaint "deeply disturbing."
"I also found them deeply credible, and I understand why the inspector general found them credible," Schiff said.
The whistleblower was also concerned over how the White House handled records of Trump's call, according to a New York Times report, citing sources. The whistleblower also said multiple White House officials were witnesses to potential misconduct by Trump and could corroborate the complaint, the sources said.
The whistleblower, whose identity is not known, went to the U.S. government's intelligence inspector general in August.
The complaint is likely to give context to the phone call transcript, which was not a verbatim report of what was said but rather a "memorandum" compiled by staffers.
Biden lamented the president's conduct.
He said, "It is a tragedy for this country that our president put personal politics above his sacred oath."

Texto completo: Dan Banquet, the executive editor of the New York Times, defended his paper's decision to release key details about the identity of the Trump-Ukraine whistleblower.
"The president and some of his supporters have attacked the credibility of the whistle-blower, who has presented information that has touched off a landmark impeachment proceeding. The president himself has called the whistle-blower’s account a 'political hack job,'" Banquet said Thursday in the New York Times. "We decided to publish limited information about the whistle-blower — including the fact that he works for a nonpolitical agency and that his complaint is based on an intimate knowledge and understanding of the White House — because we wanted to provide information to readers that allows them to make their own judgments about whether or not he is credible."
The paper wrote Thursday that the whistleblower was a CIA officer along with that fact that he "was previously detailed to work at the White House and had expertise on Ukraine."
Tweet
The Times received a barrage of criticism over the decision, with some claiming it could put the whistleblower's life at risk.
TweetTweetTweet
The lawyer of the whistleblower, Mark Zaid, hit back at the Times saying that publishing the information created a "dangerous situation" for the whistleblower, or the person the Times identified as the whistleblower.

Trump said Thursday that the person who helped the whisteblower obtain information was "close to a spy."

Texto completo: “The rules are simple: they lie to us, we know they’re lying, they know we know they’re lying, but they keep lying to us, and we keep pretending to believe them.”
— Elena Gorokhova, A Mountain of Crumbs
“Some liars are so expert they deceive themselves.”
— Austin O’Malley, Keystones of Thought
As the evidence of wrongdoing mounts and the anecdotes of inconsistency and imbecility accrue, Democrats and pundits have transitioned from describing President Trump’s statements as fantasies and started labeling them as lies.
Children lie and know when they are lying, but they are being children. Some grow up to be honest, decent citizens. And some grow up to be one of our presidents.
Aside from what is fact or fabrication, Trump appears simply not to care whether what he says is true. Take for instance, President Trump’s press conference on Sept. 25, where he said:
“The president [of Ukraine] just came out with a statement saying there was absolutely no pressure put on him.”
What else could be expected in response to a president who has demonstrated he can and will punish with his power?
“As usual, the United States helps, and nobody else is there.”
From 2015 through 2018, the International Monetary Fund contributed $8.6 billion to the economic stability of Ukraine.
“It’s the single greatest witch hunt in American history, probably in history, but in American history.”
In the Salem witch hunt between 1692-1693, more than 200 people were accused of witchcraft. Nineteen were found guilty and hanged. Another, for refusing to plead, was crushed to death. It remains the “greatest witch hunt in American history.”
“…a lot of people said, ‘I never knew you could be so nice.’”
Speaking of suffering Lou Gehrig’s disease, Stephen Hawking said, “My expectations were reduced to zero when I was 21. Everything since then has been a bonus.”
“Part of the problem you have is that you have a lot of fake news, you have a lot of corrupt reporting….”
The Cambridge English Dictionary defines “fake news” as having originated to describe “false stories that appear to be news, spread on the internet… usually created to influence political views or as a joke.”
Fake news is a fair description of the thousands of “fake news websites” posted by Russia during Trump’s presidential campaign. However, the term has been co-opted by Trump and other Republicans to describe — without the need for evidence — whatever they don’t like. As a result, New York Times Publisher A.G. Sulzberger observes: “The phrase has been used to jail journalists in Cameroon, to suppress stories about corruption in Malawi, to justify a social media blackout in Chad….”
And it continues to be used — without evidence or argument — by Donald Trump.
“…the stock market went down very substantially yesterday when they saw the charge. After they read the charge, the stock market went up very substantially.”
Can mere accomplishment be a substitute for the constitutional processes by which guilt or innocence is determined? Can the size of a military evidence the decency of a citizenry, or of a president?
“We have created the greatest economy in the history of our country.”
If by “we” President Trump means all those who contributed to the recovery from the financial crisis of 2008 — Republicans and Democrats, economists and industrialists, farmers and small business owners — then the most he is guilty of is exaggeration.
But we know that’s not what he means. He means:
Donald Trump has created the greatest economy in the history of our country.
And that — and virtually everything else he said in his press conference and much of what he has said before it — is a lie.

Trump's smoking-gun summary

Texto completo: We now have the smoking-gun summary, the most incriminating White House document since Watergate. Even with ellipses and maybe redactions for national security reasons, the reconstruction of Donald Trump's July 25 conversation with newly elected Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy is chilling in its specificity.
Instead of subtly alluding to Joe Biden or hinting that a little private help might be appreciated, Trump instead bluntly instructed Zelenskiy, "There's a lot of talk about Biden's son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the attorney general would be great."
With Ukraine desperate for $391 million promised by America for secure military communications, Zelenskiy had about as much free will as a gambler in hock to loan sharks who break kneecaps. And then there was that minor matter of Trump using Attorney General Bill Barr as his middleman for delivery of would-be dirt on Biden.
Trump is so overt and inept in his plotting that if he had been president during Watergate, he probably would have called a press conference after the burglars were caught at Democratic National Committee headquarters. "Of course, I sent them," Trump would have bragged. "The DNC has been very nasty to me. The Democrats are bad people. They got what they deserved."
For Nancy Pelosi, this rough transcript of Trump's investigate-or-else Ukrainian ultimatum must have felt like welcome vindication. With her dramatic turnabout on impeachment, Pelosi ran the risk that the call summary might be as murky as the Mueller report. Instead, it read like the Nixon White House transcripts minus the deleted expletives.
For all the frenzied analysis of the risks that House Democrats in marginal districts are taking in buying a ticket on the Impeachment Express, it is equally important to understand the dangers facing ambitious congressional Republicans who have to decide whether to remain Trump toadies.
There are, of course, old-fashioned Republicans like Lamar Alexander and Pat Roberts, who are retiring from the Senate in 2020, presumably baffled and buffeted by the transformation of their party. With 16 grandchildren between them, Alexander and Roberts will have ample time in the months ahead to figure out how to answer the obvious future question, "Grandpa, what did you do when Donald Trump was shaking down Ukraine?"
But the challenges for Republicans on Capitol Hill extend far beyond mulling their legacies in an age of Trump tumult. What should matter more to congressional Republicans who dream of political careers after 2020 is where they calculate the GOP is apt to be in 2022 and beyond.
The odds are probably better than 50-50 that Trump will no longer be residing in the Oval Office in 2022 either because of electoral defeat or - much less likely - impeachment. By the way, it is unwise to completely dismiss the chances of Trump's conviction in the Senate before we hear from the national security whistleblower who initially sounded the warning about Ukraine.
But even if Trump survives impeachment and wins reelection, he will probably be a largely spent political force by 2022. That's what happens to most two-term presidents in their sixth year in the White House from Ronald Reagan to Barack Obama.
So what really are the risks for GOP senators who privately squirm at Trump's antics in the White House and secretly worry about what the 45th president is doing to democracy and the powers of Congress?
If such senators are not on the ballot until 2022 (and I'm guessing that Rob Portman, John Thune and maybe Marco Rubio fit into this category), then fears of political retribution for disloyalty from MAGA-hatted zealots may be exaggerated.
Sure, there may be some rough Trump tweets like the one mocking Mitt Romney as a presidential loser. Maybe there would be some booing at party dinners back home and vague talk of primary challenges. But, in all likelihood, this frenzy would have dissipated long before the formal launch of a 2022 reelection campaign.
I have been thinking about Republican senators like these since I asked Michael Bennet about Trump and Ukraine during the Democratic steak fry in Des Moines, Iowa, on Saturday. Bennet, who serves on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said about some of his GOP colleagues, "I know these guys, and I know a lot of them know the difference between right and wrong. And at some point, everybody's going to have to step up here and do their jobs."
There are two relevant lessons from Watergate that should interest any Republican legislator who knows the difference, as Bennet put it, "between right and wrong."
When Nixon's support collapsed during the summer of 1974, it happened fast. Under the banner headline, "NIXON RESIGNS," The New York Times wrote in its Aug. 9 edition, "In the end only a small minority of his former supporters were urging him to stay. ... It was his friends, not his legions of enemies, that brought the crucial pressures for resignation."
It is also never too late for an erstwhile backer of a scandal-smeared president to recognize the error of his or her ways. Conservative hero Barry Goldwater, who had loyally supported Nixon through much of Watergate, also volunteered to be the messenger to tell the president that he had fewer than 15 backers in the Senate.
House Democrats have made their choice in the last few days - and it is the right one. Now the question facing America is whether congressional Republicans will follow the course of honor or continue their servitude to an unethical president whose moral compass always points at himself.

Texto completo: SYDNEY, Australia -- Australia's capital on Wednesday became the first jurisdiction in the country to legalize the recreational possession and cultivation of marijuana, a move that runs counter to federal laws that can carry prison terms for personal use of the drug.
Passage of the measure, which came after months of debate over policy, legal and health issues, echoed efforts in the United States, where more than 10 states have legalized recreational use of marijuana even as it remains illegal under federal law.
The new law in the Australian Capital Territory, which encompasses the capital city, Canberra, allows residents over 18 to possess up to 50 grams of dried marijuana and grow two plants per person or four per household at a time. Supplying the drug to other people remains illegal.
"The passage of this legislation is an Australian first," Michael Pettersson, a Labor Party lawmaker who was a driving force behind the bill, said in a statement. "It will work to reduce the harm of drugs in our community by reducing the stigma of drug use and encouraging people to seek help without fear of arrest."
Marijuana is the most commonly used illicit recreational drug in Australia. In a 2016 government survey, about a third of Australians over age 14 said they had used it, with about 10 percent saying they had used it in the previous 12 months.
Australia approved the use of marijuana for medical purposes in 2016, but the country has not moved in the direction of the small number of other countries, like Canada, that have legalized recreational use on a national level.
Before the Australian Capital Territory passed its legalization measure, possession of small amounts of marijuana had been decriminalized there and in a few other jurisdictions, giving police officers the discretion to issue fines instead of making arrests.
In other jurisdictions, possession is still a crime, though warnings are usually given to first-time offenders.
Under federal law, recreational possession carries a potential penalty of two years in prison. The Australian Capital Territory legislation provides a legal defense under local law for adults who possess marijuana but does not remove the risk of arrest under federal law, said Gordon Ramsay, the territory's attorney general.
The final legislation, which is likely to go into effect at the end of January, included a number of amendments. They restrict cultivation of plants to private property, make it an offense to smoke near minors, require proper storage away from children and add a separate weight limit of 150 grams, or about five ounces, for freshly cultivated marijuana.
The federal government has moved to overturn major legislative changes by states or territories in the past, though it is unclear whether it will do so in this case. In 2013, it successfully argued in court to reverse legislation in the capital territory that allowed same-sex couples to marry. The federal government then legalized same-sex marriage in 2017.
Opponents of the capital's cannabis bill said that while the amendments would limit some of the harm, it would lead to higher consumption of marijuana, which some researchers have linked to an increased risk of psychosis, and more cases of people driving under the influence.
The legislation could lead to a "whole bunch of perverse outcomes," Jeremy Hanson, the attorney general for the conservative-leaning Liberal Party, said during debate on the measure. "The current laws as they work are effective."
The capital branch of the Australian Medical Association said that use of marijuana could lead to chronic health problems, but that the risk was low and that those who used the drug occasionally were unlikely to be affected, according to a government inquiry into the issue.
"It doesn't appear to be the sort of legislation or policy change that results in the sky falling down," said Dr. David Caldicott, an emergency medicine consultant who supported the bill.
The nation's capital has been at the forefront of drug reform policy in the past, including testing pills at festivals, Dr. Caldicott added. "Rather than causing a shift in cannabis consumption in Australia," he said, "it might create a broader conversational environment" around the policies governing it.
The Australian Capital Territory police said in a statement that they would coordinate with the local government and other agencies to carry out the new legislation, including working out how it intersects with federal law.

Texto completo: House Democrats could have probably waited another three weeks to break the glass on impeachment, because we’re still at least that long away from figuring out what exactly is going on with Joe Biden’s son, Hunter Biden.
The sleepy story about President Trump and his midsummer call with the head of Ukraine has so far only interested reporters because it brings back fond memories of Russia and collusion. The part of the story dealing with whether Biden, as vice president, did anything to help his son’s business dealings in Ukraine is mostly being treated as an afterthought.
For example, reporters for the New York Times on Monday showed their enthusiasm for Biden and his son’s role in the controversy not by answering questions about it, or even trying to answer questions about it, but by simply declaring that there are, in fact, questions.
One line in the Times' report said that Biden “and his advisers have long feared that Hunter Biden would become a target for political opponents, according to people familiar with their thinking, and now the scrutiny of Mr. Biden’s son is bound to intensify.”
Why had that been “long feared,” you might ask? The Times doesn’t offer any hints.
The report later said that “allies of Mr. Biden acknowledge privately that the campaign has been girding for months for criticism of Hunter Biden” due to his “winding career as a bank executive, lobbyist and financier,” which often meant “operating in parts of the private sector that overlapped with his father’s footprint in government.”
“Girding for months,” you say? Anticipating “criticism” of Hunter Biden’s “winding career,” you say? Tell me more!
Unfortunately, the Times report didn’t have much to add there, either.
The paper did, however, note in two different places that it had asked Biden’s “allies” and even his spokesman whether Hunter Biden had been “vetted” for any potential liabilities his background might bring to the campaign.
No answers were provided, sadly. Gosh, if only there were a respected institution with vast resources that could do the vetting on behalf of the public instead. Maybe one that’s even protected by the Constitution.
Oh, well!

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – Republicans appear to be sticking by President Donald Trump despite concerns he sought foreign help to discredit Democratic opponent Joe Biden.
The latest controversy riling up the White House revolves around Trump's contacts with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky, a whistleblower complaint at a U.S. intelligence agency and whether Trump conditioned granting military aid to Ukraine on an investigation into the former Vice President's son, Hunter Biden.
Trump has acknowledged bringing up Biden, the former vice president and leading Democratic 2020 presidential contender, in a July phone call with Zelensky, but he denied offering the aid in exchange for an investigation into Biden.
"I didn't do it," Trump told reporters on Monday in New York at the United Nations General Assembly.
Many Senate Republicans on Monday resisted saying too much about the controversy, dodging questions by reporters and stressing that none of the information about the complaint or the president's conversations has been verified. But others downplayed the issue, saying this was another attempt by Democrats to amplify impeachment efforts. Some also repeated comments that the president himself has made that Biden should be investigated and that's what the media should be focusing on.
Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin met with Zelensky in Ukraine earlier this month and said before his visit, he talked with Trump on the phone. Johnson said he hoped he could convince Trump to approve of the aid so he could relay that message in person to Zelensky. Trump declined.
"The rationale that he gave [me] is the concern about corruption in Ukraine, which is what I relayed to President Zelensky, and they all acknowledge it. It's why he won the election. They're trying to rid the country of corruption," Johnson said, adding Trump "did not mention anything about Joe Biden or anything" during their phone call.
Johnson said he didn't believe the whistleblower complaint should be made available to Congress, nor should a transcript of Trump's call with Zelensky. "It's a very dangerous precedent" to start, he said of releasing the call and said it does not appear the complaint is "something necessarily has to have."
Sen. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell blamed Democrats for choosing to "politicize this issue." He said their actions are "circumventing the established procedures and protocols that exist so the committees can pursue sensitive matters in the appropriate, deliberate, bipartisan manner."
"What I really see happening is that Democrats are winding up the outrage machine again," said Sen. John Barrasso, the third highest-ranking Republican in the Senate, adding it's all about "beating the impeachment drum."
"They didn't get what they wanted out of the Mueller investigation," said Barrasso, R-Wyo. "They're hoping they have something here. I just don't see it."
McConnell also noted that he personally talked with the Secretary of Defense and Secretary of State to "ensure that Ukraine received this much-needed assistance."
Republicans were divided over whether those materials should be made available to Congress.
Several Republicans expressed unease with the reports about Trump's conversation with Zelensky and stressed the need for more information. Utah Republican Sen. Mitt Romney said it would be "very serious" if Trump demanded an investigation into Biden and stressed that Congress needs more information on what happened.
Sen. Susan Murkowski, R-Alaska, also said while there aren't facts showing Trump requested an investigation into Biden in exchange for the aid, "it's not OK to make a request that's a quid-pro-quo."
Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., echoed concerns of president and his personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, that Biden's conduct should be looked into.
"I think one, we have to get more information about what the President said. And also, we have to get an understanding of exactly what Biden did," Scott said.
The New York Times reported in May that Biden, while in office in 2016, threatened to withhold $1 billion in U.S. loan guarantees unless Ukraine reduced its corruption. Part of that demand called for removing the country's top prosecutor, who was investigating the oligarch behind an energy company where Hunter Biden served on the board.
The prosecutor was accused by U.S. officials of ignoring corruption in his own office. The Ukrainian Parliament eventually voted him out. But Yuriy Lutsenko, Ukraine's current prosecutor, told Bloomberg News Service in May that he had no evidence of wrongdoing by Biden or his son.

Texto completo: Joe Biden on Tuesday said he supports the impeachment of President Donald Trump if the White House does not comply with Congress' requests for details about a call he made to Ukraine's president in which they discussed the former vice president.
"I can take the political attacks," Biden said, referring to Trump's statements about his son's business in Ukraine. "They'll come and they'll go, and in time they'll soon be forgotten. But if we allow a president to get away with shredding the United States Constitution, that will last forever."
He delivered a four-minute statement at the Hotel du Pont in Wilmington on Tuesday, where he called impeachment proceedings a tragedy, "but a tragedy of (Trump's) own making."
Biden did not answer questions at the event, which comes after polls of Democrats in New Hampshire and Iowa this week showed that Biden lost his lead among contenders for his party's presidential nomination.
He joined a chorus of Democrats — including presidential candidates Sens. Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren — this week in calling for Congress to begin impeachment proceedings, following reports that Trump may have sought political help from a foreign power.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced late Tuesday afternoon that the House of Representatives will begin a formal impeachment inquiry of Trump.
In August, a U.S. intelligence official submitted a whistleblower complaint, which the Washington Post and the New York Times have said involved details of a July phone call Trump had with Ukraine's new President Volodymyr Zelensky.
The Wall Street Journal reported that Trump asked Zelensky eight times during the call to investigate Hunter Biden.
On Sunday, Trump acknowledged he brought up Biden during the call, but said the conversation was "largely congratulatory." Many on Capitol Hill have since called on the White House to release the transcript of the conversation.
Trump tweeted Tuesday, minutes before Biden was set to speak, that he has "authorized the release tomorrow of the complete, fully declassified and unredacted transcript of my phone conversation with President Zelensky of Ukraine.
"You will see it was a very friendly and totally appropriate call," Trump tweeted. "No pressure and, unlike Joe Biden and his son, NO quid pro quo! This is nothing more than a continuation of the Greatest and most Destructive Witch Hunt of all time!"
Trump campaign officials also fought back before Biden's speech, sending out a list of questions they said Biden should answer. It included "an explanation for why he believes it was appropriate for Hunter (Biden) to make millions of dollars in Ukraine at the same time Joe Biden was leading diplomatic relations with Ukraine."
In 2014, Hunter Biden joined the board of Burisma Holdings, a Ukrainian natural gas company. During his tenure, Ukrainian prosecutor Viktor Shokin investigated the company.
Shokin later lost his job as prosecutor following pressure from the White House and specifically from then-Vice President Biden. Trump says the elder Biden acted to protect his son.
Last spring, the country's current top prosecutor told Bloomberg News that there is no evidence Biden or his son acted inappropriately.
Hunter Biden was not accused of wrongdoing.
The Republican National Committee on Tuesday called for Biden to release transcripts of the calls he made as vice president with Chinese and Ukrainian leaders.
"Once again, Joe Biden has shown he is just as extreme as the rest of the 2020 Democrats who are desperate to bring President Trump down," Ronna McDaniel, RNC chairwoman, said in a statement.
In his brief remarks Tuesday, Biden made no mention of his son Hunter or his business dealings. He called for the Trump administration to stop "stonewalling and provide Congress with all the facts that it needs, including the copy of the formal complaint made by the whistleblower."
"This isn't a Democratic issue or a Republican issue," Biden said. "This is a national issue. It is a security issue."
Joe Biden delivers a statement Tuesday at the Hotel du Pont in Wilmington, where he called for Congress to impeach President Donald Trump if the White House does not comply with Congress' requests for details about a call he made to Ukraine's president.

Trump's Misleading Defense for Withholding Assistance to Ukraine

Texto completo: The president, facing calls for impeachment over his pressuring Ukraine to investigate his political rival, inaccurately accused European countries of not providing aid to Ukraine.
"But my complaint has always been and I'll withhold again and I'll continue to withhold until such time as Europe and other nations contribute to Ukraine because they're not doing it. Just the United States. We're putting up the bulk of the money. And I'm asking why is that."
-- in remarks to reporters before the United Nations General Assembly meeting on Tuesday
This is exaggerated.
President Trump was responding to reports that he had directed his staff to freeze military aid to Ukraine before he pressed the country's president to investigate unsubstantiated corruption allegations involving former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.
But Mr. Trump is wrong that other countries do not contribute to Ukraine's efforts to counteract Russian aggression in recent years.
Aid across different countries is difficult to compare, as there is no single publicly accessible source that aggregates all forms of assistance. And some sources of data shows that the European Union has actually provided more aid to Ukraine than the United States.
A 2018 report from Chatham House, a British think tank, finds that the European Union and its member states "are the biggest donor in Ukraine."
European countries have contributed $ 1.8 billion in development assistance from 2014 to 2017, compared to $ 926 million from the United States, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.
For example, Germany has pledged over 1 billion euros, or about $ 1.1 billion, in humanitarian aid, development programs and loans to Ukraine since 2014. Assistance from Britain has totaled about 145 million pounds, or more than $ 180 million at current exchange rates, since 2014.
Countries outside of Europe have assisted Ukraine as well, with Canada providing $ 785 million and Japan $ 468 million.
"The European Union's support to Ukraine in the past 5 years has been unprecedented and consistent," Maja Kocijancic, the European Union spokeswoman for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, said in a statement.
The Congressional Research Service estimated a higher figure than the O.E.C.D. data for the United States' contribution: $ 1.3 billion in aid to Ukraine from late 2013 to early 2017 and $ 600 million in security assistance. The European Union also reported a larger contribution when loans from European banks are factored in: 15 billion euros since 2014, or about $ 16.5 billion, including 133.8 million euros in humanitarian assistance.
NATO also set up a number of trust funds to help Ukraine develop military defense capabilities. A NATO official said that allies had pledged 40 million euros, or about $ 44 million, through the trust funds and that individual allies had their own bilateral assistance programs with Ukraine.
Michael Emerson of the Center for European Studies, a research institute in Brussels, also noted that the European Union is Ukraine's largest trading partner.
"E.U. has a deep association and free trade agreement with Ukraine since 2014, and its trade flows have expanded greatly, displacing Russian trade flows, while U.S. trade flows are relatively marginal," Mr. Emerson said. (The United States is Ukraine's 10th-largest trading partner.)
Asked whether Mr. Trump had a point about European contributions in comparison to the United States' funding, Mr. Emerson suggested a reformulation: "U.S. assistance pales in comparison to that of the E.U."

Where Press Freedom Isn't a Given

Texto completo: Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
In a powerful Op-Ed about press freedom published Monday, the publisher of The New York Times, A. G. Sulzberger, mentioned my hasty departure from Egypt on a muggy August evening a couple of years ago.
It started with a phone call from The Times's international editor, Michael Slackman, to discuss an alarming confidential warning the paper had received from an American official in Washington.
The New York Times Magazine had earlier published my article about the death of Giulio Regeni, an Italian student whose body had been found in Cairo with torture marks. The article cited American officials who linked the killing to Egypt's security services.
Now, the source said, the Egyptians were furious and were considering actions, including arresting me. The official told my editor that his superiors were unlikely or unwilling to intervene, and he risked his career just to get out this warning.
Michael urged me to leave Egypt immediately.
I called the United States Embassy. A press officer expressed concern but said that, as an Irish citizen, I should call my own embassy. I did.
An hour later, an Irish Embassy car pulled up outside my door and, after I had thrown some belongings into a suitcase, a diplomat whisked me to Cairo's airport. Then he sat patiently, in the back of the car, as I hunted for the next available flight to Europe. Hours later, I took off for Germany.
After a few weeks, I flew back to Egypt, unhindered, and got back to work. Since then, I've wondered what might have happened without that timely warning.
Maybe nothing -- the Egyptian officials might have gotten over their anger. Or maybe an arrest -- after all, foreign journalists have been jailed before. It's hard to know. Egypt's security services are notoriously opaque and unpredictable, especially under President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi.
What has become increasingly clear, though, is that journalists can't rely on the United States government to have our back as it once did.
For decades, major American news outlets figured they could count on their government to do everything it could to help reporters abroad when they found themselves under threat.
We no longer work under that assumption.
President Trump's near-daily attacks on the press, and his use of the loaded term "enemy of the people," gives succor to autocrats like Mr. el-Sisi who view the free press as an irritant to be quashed.
I've continued to report from Egypt, with some difficulties: stalled accreditation and visas, threats of legal action and conspiratorial smear articles in the pro-government press. Relatively speaking, that has been mild. A reporter with The Times of London was expelled in 2018. In February, my colleague David Kirkpatrick was barred from entering Egypt at Cairo's airport.
Such troubles pale next to Egyptian journalists who have been imprisoned, exiled or killed in great numbers. The Committee to Protect Journalists says Egypt is among the world's worst jailers of journalists, alongside Turkey and China. Another three were arrested in the past few days -- two photographers and a blogger who covered an unusual scatter of street protests against Mr. el-Sisi.
At least 962 people have been arrested over the recent protests, according to the Egyptian Center for Economic and Social Rights.
Last week, Mr. Trump joked that Mr. el-Sisi was his "favorite dictator." On Monday the two leaders met again at the United Nations, and Mr. Trump issued fresh praise.
One Egyptian journalist is in jail because of me. During last year's presidential election, the police arrested Adel Sabry, the editor of a news website called Masr al-Arabia, for publishing a translation of an article that I wrote with a colleague about government officials paying Egyptians to vote.
Mr. Sabry is being held at Qanatir Prison outside Cairo, where he faces charges of spreading false news and joining a terrorist organization. His detention was renewed last week.
My near arrest in 2017 wasn't the first time my reporting got me into trouble with a country hosting me. In 2013 I was expelled from Pakistan, where I had been living for nine years. On that occasion, State Department officials went to great lengths to stall my expulsion, and they advised me directly on my safety. They later lobbied the Pakistanis to allow me to return.
In Egypt, I was lucky just to have the backing of a large and resourceful news organization with an unwavering commitment to free speech. Not every reporter has such good fortune.
A few weeks ago, after long delays, the Egyptian authorities finally extended my press card to 2020. I am hopeful that's a sign of positive change to come.

Texto completo: Similar to Warren's plan, his proposal would affect more people and tax wealthiest more
DAVENPORT, Iowa - Sen. Bernie Sanders proposed a tax on the wealthiest Americans on Tuesday as a way to help underwrite his slate of ambitious - and costly - policies, offering his own version of an idea one of his toughest rivals has campaigned on aggressively and pushing it further.
The Democratic presidential candidate, an independent from Vermont, offered his blueprint after Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who has surged in the polls, made a wealth tax one of her signature ideas. Her crowds regularly chant "Two cents!" at her rallies when she brings up the idea, a reference to how much the wealthy would have to pay on the dollar.
Sanders's proposed wealth tax is more aggressive than Warren's and would raise more money. Warren's plan calls for levying a 2 percent tax on wealth above $50 million, as well as a 3 percent tax on wealth above $1 billion. The relatively high threshold has helped Warren fend off critiques that large farms could be exposed to the tax.
Sanders would hit more people with the tax and would also significantly increase how much it would take from the very wealthiest, following a pattern in which he has sought to stake out the leftward boundary of the Democratic Party when it comes to policy proposals.
Sanders's plan introduces a new 1 percent wealth tax on those earning over $32 million and then increases that rate in steps until it reaches 8 percent for those with more than $10 billion.
The announcement Tuesday highlighted the country's striking divide over economic policy. Two of the three top-polling candidates for the Democratic nomination are now advocating a sweeping change in the way wealth is allocated in the United States, embracing policies that have not been so prominently discussed since the 1960s.
Under President Trump, meanwhile, the Republicans have passed a far-reaching tax cut plan that economists say will dramatically expand the deficit. This comes less than a decade after the tea party angrily seized the nation's attention, and a measure of power within the GOP, with a low-spending, anti-deficit message.
On Tuesday, Sanders concluded a two-day swing through Iowa counties that Barack Obama won and then went for Trump. He's dubbed the trip his "Bernie Beats Trump" tour, presenting himself as the most electable Democratic candidate against the president.
But Sanders has struggled to recapture the magic of his near-win in this first caucus state in 2016. A recent Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom poll showed Warren leading with 22 percent. Former vice president Joe Biden was at 20 percent, and Sanders was running third at 11 percent.
Sanders and Warren have been battling for supremacy in the Democratic Party's liberal wing, issuing dueling proposals on a number of topics that would reshape the nation's safety net and significantly expand the role of government.
Their proposals include making public colleges and universities tuition-free, wiping away much or all of the student loan debt in the country, and enacting a Medicare-for-all health-care system.
The plans are estimated to cost tens of trillions of dollars, raising questions about how they would be paid for. Warren for months has pointed to her wealth tax, and Sanders's new proposal gives him a similar revenue source to cite.
Sanders aides noted that the senator has spoken of a wealth tax for decades, including proposing it as a possible funding source for his Medicare-for-all plan. In 1997, Sanders wrote that it was "time, high time, to establish a tax on wealth similar to those that exist in most European countries."
However, there is no guarantee that Warren or Sanders, if elected, could push such a far-reaching new tax through Congress.
When it comes to wealth taxes, the impact on the nation's biggest fortunes would be profound. Bill Gates, estimated to have $107 billion in wealth, would under Sanders's plan pay at least an additional $8 billion annually to the federal government. Sanders's campaign says the wealth of billionaires overall would be halved under his proposal.
The plan to tax the wealthy could pay for some of Sanders's plans but fall short of covering other parts of his agenda. Economists Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman at the University of California at Berkeley estimate Sanders's plan would raise $4.35 trillion over 10 years, although conservatives have said such estimates overstate how much can be raised through a wealth tax.
Sanders has unveiled a $2.5 trillion plan to end homelessness and create 10 million new housing units and a $1.7 trillion plan to cancel all student debt in the United States; those two initiatives alone would come close to equaling the money raised by the wealth tax. The campaign said the tax would be used to fund the housing plan, pay for universal child care and help finance Medicare-for-all.
The senator has proposed a $30 trillion Medicare-for-all health-care system that would eliminate families' health-care spending, which Sanders has said would be paid for with higher middle-class taxes, as well as taxes on the wealthy.
The biggest difference with Warren's plan is that Sanders's would more directly target the fortunes of billionaires and multibillionaires.
Zucman noted on Twitter that Sanders's plan "would make it much harder to remain a multibillionaire durably." But he said that if Sanders's tax had been enacted in the 1980s, billionaires' share of the national wealth would still have increased.
That means Sanders's plan would stop short of a "maximum income" plan favored by some on the left, although Sanders has come out in favor of that as a long-term goal, telling the New York Times, "I don't think that billionaires should exist."
That position follows months of debates in left-leaning circles over whether Democrats should push taxes high enough to eliminate all billion-dollar fortunes, an idea championed, for example, by an aide to first-term Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.).

Texto completo: AMHERST — The historic records have lost none of their tectonic punch over the last half century. Dark memos of war. Details of deception.
A porthole into a time when there were marches in the streets and the United States seemed on the verge of a national nervous breakdown.
“Secrecy is very dangerous to our democracy and to human survival," Daniel Ellsberg said. “Officials in any country want to keep their secrets. What defines a democracy is that they don't get to."
And now Ellsberg, a top-rated war analyst who in 1971 leaked a massive, top-secret history of the American involvement in Vietnam — the so-called Pentagon Papers that exposed deception and mistakes by five US presidents — has chosen a home for his massive archive.
The papers are going to the University of Massachusetts' flagship campus here, where researchers will be able to pore over a catastrophic conflict in Southeast Asia, where 58,000 American lives were lost in a foreign war whose fateful lessons have echoed now across two generations.
The university has acquired the papers for $2.2 million, most of which — $1.35 million — was provided by an anonymous donor, the university said Monday.
The rest of the money will come from the university's special collections fund.
Ellsberg's papers include his evolving assessment of the Vietnam War, documentation from his criminal trial for leaking the Pentagon Papers, and records from his work in the antiwar and antinuclear movements.
“The focus of our archive is social change," said Robert S. Cox, head of special collections and university archives at UMass. “People, organizations, and individuals who go about trying to change the world consciously for the better. And so social change becomes what we do. And Dan fits that."
He certainly does.
When I caught up with him by telephone late last week, he was just leaving a climate change protest in California on a day when marches and rallies reverberated across the globe, crafting this message for world leaders headed to a summit at the United Nations: The world is warming. Act now.
He's 88 years old now. But the fire within him has not diminished.
“Both the Democrats and the Republicans are giving more money to the Pentagon than the Pentagon asked for," Ellsberg said. “It's keeping the danger alive. I'd say the world is not more dangerous than it was in the past, but it's not less dangerous."
Cox said any archive that measures more than 100 linear feet usually is considered large. Ellsberg's measures about 600 linear feet, or more than 500 boxes. The university estimates it will take the equivalent of two years of a full-time archivist's time to process and catalogue the collection.
“That's huge," Cox said.
Huge. And fascinating. And historic.
There is a 1969 onion-skin letter to Ellsberg from Henry Cabot Lodge Jr., who had served as ambassador to South Vietnam and who, at the time the letter was written, served as delegate to the Vietnam peace talks in Paris.
There's a letter to Ellsberg written by Henry Kissinger when Kissinger was serving as Richard Nixon's national security adviser.
There's a formal invitation to a wedding reception hosted by Minnesota Senator Eugene McCarthy and his wife at their home in Washington, D.C.
“In the course of eight days in Vietnam I talked to a great many people," Philip A. Hart, then a Democratic senator from Michigan, writes to Ellsberg's father in a 1967 letter in the archive. “From no one did I learn more than from your son."
That letter was written four years before Ellsberg was to take his place in American history after he opened his safe at the Rand Corp., a nonprofit research institution where he worked, and began copying a 7,000-page, top-secret report.
The Globe's Thomas Oliphant broke a story that said the few people who had reviewed the papers copied by Ellsberg supported withdrawing from Vietnam. Oliphant had interviewed Ellsberg and learned of the documents' backstory.
But Neil Sheehan's front-page story in The New York Times on June 13, 1971, was a genuine journalistic bombshell.
“A massive study of how the United States went to war in Indochina, conducted by the Pentagon three years ago, demonstrates that four administrations progressively developed a sense of commitment to a non-Communist Vietnam, a readiness to fight the North to protect the South, and an ultimate frustration with this effort — to a much greater extent than their public statements acknowledged at the time," Sheehan wrote.
The Nixon administration asked the Times to stop publication. The Times refused. A federal judge issued a temporary restraining order barring further publication. But then The Washington Post obtained the papers and began publishing. As the two national papers went to court to oppose Nixon's efforts to stop them, Ellsberg reached out to other newspapers, including The Boston Globe.
“It was a huge coup for the Globe," former Globe editor Matt Storin told me. “Much like today, The New York Times and The Washington Post were considered the top papers in the country. So when we got [the papers], we were quite pleased with ourselves — and quite excited."
At UMass, Cox said Ellsberg's papers will be rich material for scholars who are examining warfare or nuclear power or governmental secrecy — or ethics and morality.
“He could have stayed in his lane," Cox said when I visited with him in his 25th-floor office at the library here. “He could have been a guy sitting up in the highest echelons of war planning, and if he had been one of those guys who was willing to live with that, we wouldn't know him today."
Ellsberg faced 115 years in prison, but his case ended in a mistrial because the government gathered its evidence against him illegally, including burgling the office of his psychiatrist.
Ellsberg, who has a PhD in economics, will join UMass as a distinguished researcher and will become a fellow at UMass's Political Economy Research Institute.
He is scheduled to visit the UMass campus here and will attend an event in Boston in late October.
He considered placing his papers with the University of California Santa Cruz. But decided on UMass after meeting with officials from the school. “They really wanted it," Ellsberg said. “And they got it."
It's clear from talking to Ellsberg that age has not dimmed the fire that burns within him.
“I would say I'm still at it," he said. “I continue to be at it. But who's winning? The secret keepers are winning."

A hard time letting go

Texto completo: In 2001, a graphic designer in New Jersey refused to sign a non-compete agreement required by her employer.
The woman's father, an attorney, had advised her not to and the decision cost her the job. Years of litigation followed, with the state Supreme Court ultimately ruling that the company had justly fired her.
The incident is a worst-case scenario of what can happen when parents meddle in their adult children's careers, said John Sarno, president of the nonprofit Employers Association of New Jersey.
Almost 20 years later, parents are asserting themselves to an even greater degree by sitting in on job interviews, filling in job applications, badgering employers to give their children raises and promotions, and — in at least one case — bringing a cake to a child's potential employer, according to a survey by a subsidiary of Robert Half, a global human resource consulting firm.
"Sadly, it's not a new phenomenon," said Dora Onyschak, the New Jersey metro market manager for Robert Half. "Bulldozer parents and helicopter parents are kind of similar in that really they just want what's best for their kid so they want to try and help them to be as successful as possible. But that can sometimes blind them to the fact that maybe they're being too involved or their involvement can be inappropriate or certainly unprofessional when looking for a job."
"Helicopter parenting" became part of American lexicon in the early 2000s to describe the practice of hovering over children and monitoring their every move. The behavior has since evolved into that of bulldozer, snowplow or lawnmower parenting — when parents remove obstacles in their children's lives so they never have to face adversity or failure.
Sarno prefers to call them "advocate parents" and traces their rise to increased diagnoses among children of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, as well as intensified competition to gain admittance to good colleges. Both converge to create anxiety-riddled parents who feel obligated to overly protect their children, he said.
"It's really about a parent who has had this identity, this role as the advocate through the public school, often through college, and they can't give up the role when the young adult starts their career," Sarno said. "I really think it's about parents that can't let go."
Part of that reluctance stems from the 2008 financial crisis and changing social attitudes that have delayed typical markers of adulthood such as marriage and home ownership, said Jacob Goldsmith, director of the emerging adulthood program at Northwestern University's Family Institute. Studies show that unlike more prosperous previous generations, half of children born since 1980 will not out-earn their parents.
"It really scares parents," Goldsmith said. "I think there are a lot of parents looking around and realizing that their kids are not going to make the same money that they did, that their kids are not reaching the milestones they did at the same time and they don't know what to make of that and they really want to be helpful, so they jump in."
Fourteen percent of U.S. adults surveyed this year by Morning Consult for The New York Times said they had pulled strings in their professional networks to secure a job for their 18- to 28-year-old child. About 11% of respondents said they would contact their adult child's employer if the child had an issue at work. Another 16% said they had written all or part of a job or internship application.
Both Goldsmith and Sarno said parental interference in work matters is rare and not unique to millennials, who have been unfairly maligned by some as lazy or entitled.
Most of the parents Goldsmith works with as a therapist exert more subtle control. They will not sit in on job interviews, but they will edit job applications for their children or perform other tasks on their behalf, he said. Instead of teaching, they take action.
"Part of why we as therapists get worried about bulldozer parents is we worry that these kids don't learn the skills they need to do this stuff themselves," Goldsmith said. "I see a lot of emerging adults who struggle to know how to have difficult emotional conversations with their bosses. That's hard, there's no class for that, we often learn that by talking to our parents. But if the parents step in and do it for you, you never learn it."
Children of bulldozer parents often resemble children who have been neglected, he said. Both hit adulthood without a toolkit for dealing with adversity and feel like they have not accomplished anything on their own.
"What I see, and this is a direct result of helicopter parenting, is kids who hit 25 and they've never hit a major roadblock in their life and they are terrified of failure, paralyzed because they feel like life is only successful if you make no mistakes," Goldsmith said. "Kids that were helicopter-parented in many ways look like the kids who never had opportunities... because they're never really doing it themselves."
Most hiring managers are put off by candidates with meddling parents, said Onyschak.
"As an employer, do I then become concerned about the candidate's ability to think independently, do I worry then that they perhaps are not good decision makers?" she said. "It questions their level of independence and maturity and you don't want that to be the reason the person does or does not get the job."
Still, employers like Google, Amazon and LinkedIn have embraced the close relationship between new hires and their parents, launching "Take Your Parents to Work" days to give parents a glimpse of their children's work lives.
Onyschak said she supports parents who provide more hands-off guidance: helping their children practice job interviews, helping them weigh the pros and cons of multiple job offers, looking over cover letters and resumes. But the oversight should stop there, she said.
"We're not hiring the parent, we're hiring the individual, so we want candidates who can think for themselves, who are assertive, who can ask their own questions," Onyschak said.
For parents feeling the urge to become more heavily involved, Goldsmith recommends taking a step back and asking if they are facilitating — or enabling.
"When you've got a parent who's really tuned in and providing good support and facilitating growth, that kid's going to fly to the moon," he said. "But when you have a parent who responds to anxiety by stepping in and trying to run the kid's life — even if it's not as egregious as showing up at a job interview – you still end up with a kid who doesn't really trust the tools they have to be in the world."

Texto completo: The inaugural season of a new music director's term is always an exciting time for an orchestra, and its audience as well. Although the musicians will have played a few concerts with the new director, both as part of the search process and during that official-but-not-quite period when the new conductor is the music director designate, the relationship is still fresh and packed with hopes and expectations of what might change for the better, in terms of everything from repertoire to the way their sound is built and shaped.
Listeners have hopes as well, some paralleling those of the musicians, others based on aspects of the orchestra's programming or performances that they liked or disliked during the previous director's tenure - or during the newcomer's performances so far.
In Eckart Preu's case, those between-administrations performances with the Portland Symphony Orchestra have been deeply satisfying, both in terms of his repertory choices and his ability to draw a rich, unified sound from his ensemble, so the formal start of his tenure, leading the orchestra's Sunday afternoon concert at Merrill Auditorium, was something to look forward to.
Preu did not disappoint. He assembled a program that was meant to show the orchestra at its best in a pair of familiar works, Sibelius' "Finlandia" (Op. 26) and Richard Strauss's "An Alpine Symphony" (Op. 64), and to put a spotlight on some of the repertory adventures in store with an unknown score, Lilian Elkington's "Out of the Mist," a 1921 tone poem about the return of the body of the Unknown Warrior to Britain after World War I.
The Elkington piece comes with an interesting provenance. Elkington, a British composer born in 1900, was a piano prodigy who went on to study composition - but gave up her musical career, except for work as a church organist, when she married in 1926. After Elkington died in 1969, her husband remarried, and when he died, his second wife disposed of Elkington's scores. The performance materials for "Out of the Mist" were discovered in the 1970s by musicologist David J. Brown, who found them in a used bookstore in England.
Preu has performed the work with his former orchestra, the Spokane Symphony, and with the Long Beach Symphony Orchestra, where he is still music director. (For the record, he retains a third position, as music director of the Cincinnati Chamber Orchestra.) His championship of the work comes at a time when the classical music world at large is trying - too slowly - to discover and revive music composed by women over the centuries, while also commissioning new works from women composing now.
Elkington's score is meant to evoke a vision of the flotilla bearing the soldier's body emerging from the mist over the English Channel, as well as the emotional underpinnings of the occasion, and it succeeds beautifully, and movingly, with thoughtfully wrought string writing that begins in the violas and cellos and takes in the rest of the orchestra as the ship comes fully into view. There are no traces of nationalistic triumphalism, here - Elkington's music is sober and focused, melancholy but never overwrought. Preu and the orchestra gave it a rich, enveloping performance.
The concert began with a vivid account of the Sibelius, to which the orchestra brought a solid, hefty sound with memorably biting brass textures and assertive percussion in the introduction, and energetic wind and string playing as the work's grand gestures unfolded.
Preu's agenda here was to show the players at their most sizzling, and they were up for it, as they were in the Strauss, to which the second half was devoted. I must confess to not much liking "An Alpine Symphony." True, Strauss's pictorialism may be at its zenith here, but the work's narrative - an ill-fated hike up a mountain and back - is pretty dull, its clangorous thunderstorm and its amusingly cowbell-laden meadow visit notwithstanding.
But the work has its enthusiastic adherents, and Preu's detailed, fluid readings make it clear that he is one of them. I can't say that his enthusiasm for the piece won me over, but the precision and clarity with which he marshaled the 110 players on Merrill's stage was impressive, and there was a great deal to admire in the sheer execution of the work. As in the Sibelius, the brass playing was textured and often thrilling. The percussionists produced the score's vital dramatic effects and splashes of pastoral color magnificently, and the expanded woodwind and string sections met the score's constantly shifting demands with both suppleness and vitality.
Whatever one might say about the individual works, as a glimpse of what the Portland Symphony Orchestra can do - and as a hint of what the Preu era might bring - the concert could hardly have been better.

Texto completo: PROVIDENCE — President Trump's anti-press rhetoric is undermining trust in American media and emboldening authoritarian leaders worldwide to crack down on reporters, New York Times Publisher A.G. Sulzberger said at Brown University on Monday.
Sulzberger, who graduated from Brown in 2003 and first worked as a reporter at The Providence Journal, spoke to hundreds of people packed into a Brown auditorium delivering a speech titled “Free Press in Peril: The Growing Threats to Journalism Around the World."
US leaders have long understood that press freedom is one of the nation's “greatest exports," Sulzberger said.
“The current administration, however, has retreated from our country's historic role as defender of the free press," he said. “And seeing that, other countries are targeting their own journalists with a growing sense of impunity."
That isn't just a problem for reporters, he said.
“It's a problem for everyone — because this is how authoritarian leaders bury critical information, hide corruption, and even justify genocide," Sulzberger said. “As John McCain once warned, when you look at history, the first thing that dictators do is shut down the press."
Sulzberger told a story he hadn't previously shared publicly, saying that two years ago the newspaper received a call from a US government official warning that Declan Walsh, a Times reporter based in Egypt, was about to be arrested.
Such warnings are not unusual, but this one stood out because this official was alerting the Times without the knowledge or permission of the Trump administration, Sulzberger said.
“Rather than trying to stop the Egyptian government or assist the reporter, the official believed the Trump administration intended to sit on the information and let the arrest be carried out," he said. “The official feared punishment for even alerting us to the danger."
So the Times turned to Walsh's home country — Ireland — for help, and within an hour Irish diplomats had safely escorted Walsh to the airport before Egyptian forces could detain him. “We hate to imagine what could have happened had that brave official" not alerted the Times, he said.
Sulzberger said press freedom has been “an area of enduring consensus" among Americans from different political parties, ideologies and generations.
He noted Ronald Reagan once said, “There is no more essential ingredient than a free, strong and independent press to our continued success in what the founding fathers called our 'noble experiment' in self-government.' "
Despite this long tradition, Sulzberger said he does not expect Trump to stop his attacks on the press.
“If recent history is any guide, he may actually point to my comments today and claim that the Times has a political vendetta against him," he said. “To be clear, I am not challenging the president's recklessness because of his party, his ideology or his criticism of the Times. I am sounding the alarm because his words are dangerous and they are having real-world consequences."
Sulzberger concluded by urging members of the audience to subscribe to newspapers and support groups such as the Committee to Protect Journalists.
“Most of all, carve out a place for journalism in your everyday life, and use what you learn to make a difference," he said. “The true power of a free press is an informed, engaged citizenry."
The United States has done more than any other country to bolster free expression and champion press freedom, Sulzberger said.
“The time has come for us to fight for those ideals again," he said.

What's worth watching this fall?

Texto completo: The days when September signaled the return of our favorite series after three months of reruns are long gone. But fall still means something in the world of TV: With it comes the Emmys, celebrating the best of the medium's last year; the launch of the broadcast networks' season, marking the start of the next; and, this time around, the debut of two brand-new platforms: Disney+ and Apple TV+.
After polling The Times TV team about new and returning series, here are some of the shows we're most excited about this fall:
'A Little Late With Lilly Singh' (NBC, Sept. 16) Taking over the spot on the schedule vacated by Carson Daly, the Canadian-born Singh is a new face as far as network TV is concerned, but on YouTube she's a proven star, with nearly 15 million subscribers to her channel "||Superwoman||," where she has delivered one-person comic sketches and the occasional celebrity cameo (the Rock is a fan).
'mixed-ish' (ABC, Sept. 24) Kenya Barris adds another branch to the "black-ish" family tree with a look back at the childhood of matriarch Rainbow (Tracee Ellis Ross), who grew up in a hippie-ish cult-commune before it was broken up in 1985. Ross is on hand to narrate, this fish-out-of-water comedy as young Rainbow (Arica Himmel) and her siblings adjust to the horrors of public school and '80s fashion.
'Creepshow' (Shudder, Sept. 26) One of Stephen King's stories from his cult 1982 horror anthology has been adapted for the pilot, which was directed by showrunner and Romero protege Greg Nicotero ("The Walking Dead"). The revolving cast includes Giancarolo Esposito, Dana Gould and, in another nod to the show's roots, Adrienne Barbeau.
'Evil' (CBS, Sept. 26) Built around the pairing of a skeptical clinical psychologist (Katja Herbers) and a priest-in-training (Mike Colter) charged with investigating mysterious happenings, the series will try to walk the line between science and the supernatural with horror standbys such as haunted homes and demonic possession.
'Godfather of Harlem' (Epix, Sept. 29) The story of Harlem crime boss Bumpy Johnson (Forest Whitaker), a crime figure who gets out of jail in the '60s to find his neighborhood devastated by drug use and the influence of the mafia. The solution? Teaming with Malcolm X (Nigel Thatch) to win back his territory during an already tumultuous time in America.
'Back to Life' (Showtime, Oct. 6) Let's be clear: There is no "hot priest" in this acclaimed British series, which first aired on the BBC and was cowritten by star Daisy Haggard, who plays a woman returning to her seaside hometown after serving an 18-year prison sentence for murder. Still, you can't blame Showtime for hoping to recapture the magic of "Fleabag" with this series, which was produced by Harry and Jack Williams.
'Mr. Robot' Season 4 (USA, Oct. 6) A lot has happened since we last saw this cyber-thriller, which after two years away is embarking on its final season. It's impossible to predict what lies ahead for Rami Malek's Elliott - "Mr. Robot" has always delighted in blurring fantasy and reality alongside madness and sanity.
'Nancy Drew' (The CW, Oct. 9) At a time when nearly every Marvel character has a series in the works, there's something almost quaint about the return of this teenage detective, who dates to a series of mystery novels from the 1930s and was first seen on TV in the feathered hair heyday of 1977. Kennedy McMann takes over as the red-headed sleuth in a series created by Josh Schwartz ("The O.C.," "Chuck") with a more complex present day in mind.
'Modern Love' (Amazon Prime Video, Oct. 18) The New York Times' weekly-column-turned-podcast composed of first-person essays about romance and relationships will be transformed into an eight-part anthology featuring a high-profile cast that includes Tina Fey, John Slattery, Anne Hathaway, Dev Patel and Andy Garcia.
'Mrs. Fletcher' (HBO, Oct. 27) With her standout appearances on "Transparent" and "I Love Dick," no one inhabits the comic indignities of midlife quite like Kathryn Hahn. Adapted by Tom Perrotta from his own novel, the series centers on Hahn as the title character, a divorced woman who experiences a sexual reawakening that upends her stable life after her son goes away to college.
'The Mandalorian' (Disney+, Nov. 12) This bounty hunter's story, helmed by showrunner Jon Favreau, stars Pedro Pascal, Gina Carano, Carl Weathers, Giancarlo Esposito, Nick Nolte and, yes, Werner Herzog. Plot details are slim, but we do know that the series is set between the events of "Return of the Jedi" and "The Force Awakens."
'The Preppy Murder: Death in Central Park' (Sundance/AMC, Nov. 13) Spread over five episodes, this docuseries looks at the 1986 case of 18-year-old Jennifer Levin, who was killed in Central Park by fellow prep school graduate Robert Chambers. The case spurred a tabloid frenzy, and in revisiting the ways that bias was reflected in favor of privilege and against the victim, viewers may recognize how far we've come. Or not.
'The Crown' Season 3 (Netflix, Nov. 17) There's a new queen in town as this historical drama bids farewell to Claire Foy, Matt Smith and the rest of a cast that held court for two acclaimed seasons. The third season, now in the capable hands of Oscar winner Olivia Colman as Elizabeth II, Tobias Menzies as Prince Philip and Helena Bonham Carter as Princess Margaret, examines the queen's reign from 1964 to 1977.
'Toast of London' (IFC, Dec. 4) Portraying middling stage actor and chaos magnet Steven Toast, Matt Berry ("What We Do in the Shadows") flexes the talent for far-out absurdity that has made him a perfect fit for Taika Waititi's oddball universe. Keep an eye out for cameos from long-frustated comic actor Jon Hamm and Queen of the Stone Age's Josh Homme.
'The Morning Show' (Apple TV+, TBA) Apple's foray into original content looks to begin with this ripped-from-the-headlines drama about a morning show host (Jennifer Aniston) dealing with the fallout after her cohost (Steve Carrell) is accused of sexual misconduct - and the feather-ruffling local news reporter (Reese Witherspoon) who's either her biggest ally or her biggest rival.

Seen those ads asking you to call Tina Smith on surprise medical bills? Here’s what they are about.

Texto completo: In recent weeks, Minnesota television viewers have been blitzed with ads urging them to tell U.S. Sen. Tina Smith to oppose “government rate setting” for payments to doctors and hospitals.
The group behind the ads, Doctor Patient Unity, spent more than $28 million to air them in states where senators are running for re-election next year, including $2 million targeting Smith, the New York Times reported last week.
The sources of that money were a mystery. Doctor Patient Unity is a so-called “dark money” political action group that doesn’t list its members or disclose its donors.
But last Friday, the Times proclaimed “Mystery Solved.” It reported that two physician staffing companies, TeamHealth and Envision Healthcare, which generate large amounts of “surprise medical bills,” were the main funders for the ad campaign.
In an interview Thursday, Smith said the ads were intended to derail legislation that would bar doctors and hospitals from charging patients for “out-of-network” medical services, usually emergency care, that is not covered by insurance. Smith is a co-sponsor of legislation to roll back surprise medical bills. It has bipartisan support and President Donald Trump has called on Congress to protect patients from surprise medical bills.
Those are unexpected bills that patients receive often for emergency care that they assumed their insurance would cover. In many cases that surprise bill is for the difference between what a doctor charged and what insurance paid, and it’s often thousands of dollars.
“I don’t think patients should pay the price when, through no fault of their own, (they incur bills) that they had no idea about ahead of time,” Smith said.
The ads don’t mention surprise bills. Instead they warn that “government rate setting” that could harm patient care.
In one ad, a man who says he represents “big insurance” steps into a hospital waiting room and tells patients to leave because “we’re closing this hospital.” Asked why, he answers that “insurance companies teamed up with Congress” to set rates that will mean “doctor shortages and hospital closures.” It then asks viewers to call Smith and ask her to “protect patients.”
SMITH: MANY LEFT CONFUSED
The ads “did not prompt significant reaction from people,” the Minnesota Democrat said. “We heard a lot about it at the State Fair. Mostly people were kind of confused about what was happening, what it was all about.”
To Smith, the ads were “flat-out misleading.” The bill she backs would stop surprise medical billing of patients and require health-care providers and insurance companies to use arbitration to resolve billing disputes. On its website, Doctor Patient Unity supports that approach.
Another bill in Congress, which Smith opposes, would set federal rates to settle billing disputes.
In a statement to the Times, Doctor Patient Unity spokesman Greg Blair said, “We oppose insurance-industry-backed proposals for government rate-setting that will lead to doctor shortages, hospital closures and loss of access to medical care, particularly in rural and underserved communities.”
Smith thinks the group targeted her because they oppose any limits on their billing practices.
“The ads were designed to intimidate me, and I’m not going to be intimidated,” she said.
HOW IT’S DONE IN MINNESOTA
The ads may have fallen flat in Minnesota because surprise bills are a smaller problem here than in other states.
A report from the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation in June found that roughly one in every six Americans taken to an emergency room or checked into a hospital receives a surprise bill following treatment. But in Minnesota only 2 to 3 percent of patients receive such bills.
That may be in part because the 2017 Legislature passed a law limiting how much a patient can be billed for services that are not covered by insurance.

Texto completo: A documentary traces the life and times of a notorious lawyer whose career stretched from Joseph McCarthy to Donald J. Trump.
In a television interview near the end of his life, Roy Cohn predicted that his obituaries would lead with Senator Joseph McCarthy. He wasn't wrong. Thanks partly to the televised Army-McCarthy hearings, Cohn's role as the Wisconsin senator's youthful counsel was imprinted on the public memory and seemed, when Cohn died of AIDS in 1986, to be the most significant episode in a contentious public career.
Lately, the emphasis has shifted, in part thanks to Cohn's association, in the '70s and '80s, with the New York real estate developer who is now the president of the United States. Matt Tyrnauer's compact and informative new documentary, "Where's My Roy Cohn?," quotes President Trump in its title. The film's answer to the question suggests that Cohn is among the threads that link the politics of the Red Scare with whatever it is we're living through now. He's still around.
As one of the principal characters in Tony Kushner's great play "Angels in America" -- an embodiment of hubris and shame, not without a tragic dimension -- Cohn has been posthumously played by a handful of first-rate actors, including Al Pacino, Nathan Lane and F. Murray Abraham. The man himself, reanimated by Tyrnauer (a former writer for Vanity Fair) in newsreels and video clips, evidences a certain slippery charm, a relish for verbal combat, and what can only be called a passionate disdain for the truth.
Cohn's personality and career are fleshed out by the testimony of accomplices and witnesses, lawyers and journalists (including Sam Roberts of The New York Times). The story they tell zigzags a bit on its way from an unhappy, privileged childhood through precocious success to disbarment and death. It's the chronicle of a closeted gay man's fate in a hostile environment and also, contrapuntally, of an unscrupulous fixer's progress.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
The people who reveal the worst about Cohn are the ones who knew him best -- friends, family members, a former lover and a handful of colleagues. Some are well known, like Roger Stone, Cohn's protégé in the dark arts of political manipulation. Others, like two of Cohn's younger cousins, are private citizens who give an intimate account of their relative's public corruption.
Nearly all of their reminiscences are tinged with the kind of astonishment that can start to sound like admiration. The chutzpah! The ambition! The nerve!
"Where's my Roy Cohn?" offers a critical account of its subject's ethically dubious behavior, early and late. As part of the team prosecuting Julius and Ethel Rosenberg for espionage, he made ex parte phone calls to the judge urging that the couple be sentenced to death. Later, he defended organized crime bosses and cooked his own books.
Through it all, he was a fixture of New York society and a welcome guest in Washington power circles. He counted Ronald and Nancy Reagan among his friends, and friendship was a crucial tool in his arsenal. He was good at knowing when favors needed to be done and when they needed to be called in. He made a great show of loyalty, and received it in return.
Television interviewers, even when they made a show of asking Cohn tough questions, tended to fawn over his intelligence and connections. There is no doubt that he was a fascinating and important character, but "Where's My Roy Cohn?" is most interesting for the questions it doesn't explicitly ask.
Those have to do with not with Cohn's blatant amorality, but with the moral compromises of the elite who tolerated his company and found uses for his talents. It's not that any of the high-minded, good-doing, often professedly liberal people who invited him to parties and accepted his favors necessarily approved of him, any more than they approved of, say, Harvey Weinstein or Trump himself. But they kept him around, out of some combination of cynicism, self-interest and curiosity that remains an underexamined and toxic force in the history of our time.
Where's My Roy Cohn?
Rated PG-13. Nothing nice. Running time: 1 hour 37 minutes.

Texto completo: LeBron James spent the summer celebrating his love for eating Tacos on Tuesday, and he was even hoping to turn his family tradition into a business
The NBA star applied to trademark "Taco Tuesday" but his application was rejected, as the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office said "Taco Tuesday" was a "commonplace message," which means James can not capitalize off the phrase.
No doubt the news is music to the ears of the owners of one Mexican restaurant who feared LeBron's trademark filing would hurt their business.
Taco Tuesday Mexican Grill is located in Wood Dale, Illinois and has been in business since April 2016. In a letter filed with the trademark office, the company claims the restaurant "specializes in taco sales," and noted that the "Protestor's company would be crippled if precluded from using its own business name in Internet marketing channels."
James applied for the "Taco Tuesday" trademark after he began sharing posts on his social media channels, showing his family enjoying tacos on Tuesday.
A spokesman for James said his lawyers were still looking over the patent office's findings, but noted that in refusing to trademark the phrase, "the office had essentially offered what Mr. James wanted all along: protection from liability if he used "Taco Tuesday" in certain projects, like podcasts and other media," writes The New York Times.

Texto completo: NORTH FORK, Idaho - The Middle Fork of the Salmon River, one of the wildest rivers in the contiguous United States, is prime fish habitat. Cold, clear waters from melting snow tumble out of the Salmon River Mountains and into the boulder-strewn river, which is federally protected.
The last of the spawning spring-summer Chinook salmon arrived here in June after a herculean 800-mile upstream swim. Now the big fish - which can weigh up to 30 pounds - are finishing their courtship rituals. Next year there will be a new generation of Chinook.
Despite this pristine 112-mile-long mountain refuge, the fish that have returned here to reproduce and then die for countless generations are in deep trouble.
Some 45,000 to 50,000 spring-summer Chinook spawned here in the 1950s. These days, the average is about 1,500 fish, and declining. And not just here: Native fish are in free-fall throughout the Columbia River basin, a situation so dire that many groups are urging the removal of four large dams to keep the fish from being lost.
“The Columbia River was once the most productive wild Chinook habitat in the world,” said Russ Thurow, a fisheries research scientist with the Forest Service’s Rocky Mountain Research Station.
Standing alongside the Salmon River in Idaho, Thurow considered the prospect that the fish he had spent most of his life studying could disappear. “It’s hard to say, but now these fish have maybe four generations left before they are gone,” he said. “Maybe 20 years.”
Thirteen species of salmon and steelhead trout are listed as threatened or endangered in the Columbia basin, an area that includes parts of Idaho, Oregon, Washington, Montana and British Columbia. Salmon are a keystone species in this region, critical as a food source for animals such as bears, eagles and insects.
That group of beneficiaries includes an endangered population of orcas, or killer whales, along the West Coast that survive by eating Chinook in the winter and spring, up to 30 a day.
Many experts believe the orcas are starving in large part because of the decline of wild salmon. This year alone, their number has dropped from 76 to 73, alarming conservationists and scientists. Last year, an orca mother carried a dead calf for 17 days on her back. She was presumed to be grieving.
“The best thing you could do to get more spring Chinook for the orcas is to remove those four lower dams,” said Don Chapman, a retired fisheries scientist who worked as a consultant to the hydropower industry and defended the dams and mitigation efforts.
He has since changed his mind about the dams: “They kill too many juveniles going downstream and some adults going back.”
Salmon are swimming in warming waters, with uncertain consequences, according to a recent study. Breaching the dams also would help keep water temperatures cooler as the climate changes, Chapman said.
Warming waters
Chinook, or king salmon, are huge, powerful fish, the largest member of the salmon family in North America. Spring-summer Chinook make an epic migration thousands of miles through the Columbia River to the waters surrounding Alaska’s Aleutian Islands, and then back to the high elevations of the Rocky Mountains.
Before the 20th century, some 10 million to 16 million adult salmon and steelhead trout are thought to have returned annually to the Columbia River system. The current return of wild fish is 2% of that, by some estimates.
While farming, logging and especially the commercial harvest of salmon in the early 20th century all took a toll, the single greatest impact on wild fish comes from eight large dams - four on the Columbia and four on the Snake River, a major tributary.
The four Snake River dams are used primarily to create reservoirs for the barging of Idaho’s wheat to ports. But the dams raise water temperatures and block travel migration routes, increasing fish mortality.
Climate change also has raised both river and ocean water temperatures, which can be deadly to fish. In 2015, for example, unusually warm water killed an estimated 250,000 sockeye salmon.
For decades, experts have tried to ameliorate the loss of the Columbia’s wild fish by installing ladders that allow the fish to swim around the dams, and by placing them in barges and trucks for transport around the dams. The massive efforts have not stemmed the decline, despite the fact that more than $16 billion has been spent on recovery over the last several decades.
Now most scientists come down on the side of removing the dams. Last fall, orca researchers urged Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington and the Southern Resident Orca Task Force, a state government panel, to begin removing the four dams on the Snake River to aid the starving whales.
“Put simply, orca need more Chinook salmon available on a year-round basis, as quickly as possible,” they wrote, calling the removals “vital to ensure orca survival.”
The federal agencies responsible for managing fisheries on the Columbia, though, maintain that removing the Snake River dams is not critical to the survival of salmon and that hatchery-reared fish have made up for the loss of the river’s wild fish for the orcas.
The southern resident killer whales “do not distinguish between hatchery and wild fish,” the Northwest Fisheries Science Center, part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, said in a statement.
The National Marine Fisheries Service has proposed killing more than 1,100 sea lions along the Columbia River because they eat salmon as they gather to spawn.
Those who want to keep the dams point to changing ocean conditions as a major factor in the decline of the salmon. Water temperatures have been unusually warm in recent years, which reduces salmon food sources. Federal officials just announced that the marine heat wave has returned this year.
But hatchery fish are not the same, said Deborah A. Giles, science and research director at Wild Orca, a group that studies and advocates for protection of the whales. Orcas evolved eating big wild fish, some 300 to 350 pounds a day.
“Wild fish are much bigger and more lipid-rich,” she said. “Having to catch the equivalent of 350 pounds in hatchery fish, which are smaller and lower quality, expends significantly more energy. They have to work a lot harder for their meals.”
A grueling journey
The extreme migration of the spring-summer Chinook salmon is one of the natural world’s great journeys.
Before the dams were built in the 1960s and 1970s, the fish born in the Middle Fork were swept by strong spring currents 800 miles to the sea. The rivers moved them rapidly along, from 6 to 10 mph, and the young fish reached the brackish waters of the Columbia River estuary in a couple of weeks.
As they travel, the parrs, or young freshwater salmon, undergo a profound transformation called smoltification, becoming smolts able to thrive in saltwater. After leaving the river, the fish turn north and travel to the North Pacific, near the Aleutian Islands.
They spend up to four years feeding at sea, and then those that survive the seagoing journey return to the mouth of the Columbia. Their physiological changes are reversed as they move upstream, and they again become freshwater fish.
Picking up the scent of their natal stream, they fight the current, forgoing food on the grueling trip, gaining about 6,500 feet in elevation, and overcoming physical barriers in what biologists describe as a heroic journey.
“I’ve seen them jump an 8-foot waterfall, and they are known to jump 12 feet,” said Thurow. “They are the definition of persistence.”
Chinook are known as “high-fidelity” spawners, not only returning to the stream where they were born, but also often to the same shallows. Then the game is afoot: In their waning days, as males battle for dominance, females excavate a redd, a depression in the gravel riverbed.
The female releases clusters of eggs as the male sidles up, releasing its sperm at the same time. The current mixes them, resulting in fertilization. The eggs are adhesive and stick to the gravel after they fall. The female buries them in an egg pocket.
The mating is repeated multiple times; all told, some 5,000 eggs may be released by a single female. “By the time she finishes, she’s within a day or two of dying,” Thurow said. The next spring, the offspring emerge and make their own journey to the sea. Always a gantlet, the migration now is far more deadly. The eight large dams along the Snake and Columbia rivers created 325 miles of slack water in reservoirs. The average speed of the water flowing downstream has dropped to less than 1.5 mph, and it takes the fish far longer to reach the sea.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – Rep. Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass., introduced an impeachment resolution against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh after a new report of alleged sexual misconduct.
"I believe Christine Blasey Ford. I believe Deborah Ramirez. It is our responsibility to collectively affirm the dignity and humanity of survivors," she said in a statement to Boston public radio station WBUR.
Pressley referred to the two women who accused Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct during his contentious nomination process last October.
"Sexual predators do not deserve a seat on the nation's highest court, and Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation process set a dangerous precedent," Pressley told WBUR. "We must demand justice for survivors."
The two-page resolution asks the House Judiciary Committee to investigate the possibility of impeachment.
Democratic leadership seems to have little appetite for a fight over impeachment, and the resolution is unlikely to go anywhere.
An essay published in The New York Times on Sept. 14, adapted from a forthcoming book about Kavanaugh, included reporting about a newly surfaced misconduct allegation, as well as potential corroborating evidence for another allegation.
The New York Times added an editor's note to the article about information on the allegation that Kavanaugh's "friends pushed his penis into the hand of a female student" that had been left out of the article originally. "The book reports that the female student declined to be interviewed and friends say that she does not recall the incident," the Times said.
Kavanaugh has denied the previously reported allegation and declined to be interviewed by the Times about the new allegation.

Texto completo: What's on TV
A LITTLE LATE WITH LILLY SINGH: THE PRIMETIME SPECIAL 10 p.m. on NBC. With over 14 million subscribers, the YouTube star and comedian Lilly Singh has achieved a level of internet celebrity that might make traditional TV fame look passé. So it came as something of a surprise in March when NBC announced that Singh would be helming her own late-night show on the network, taking over a slot previously held by Carson Daly. "A Little Late With Lilly Singh," which debuted at the beginning of the week, will normally air weeknights at 1:35 a.m. On Wednesday, she will go prime time with an all-star lineup of guests set to include Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada, Kenan Thompson, Tony Hale, Mandy Moore and others. "I want to be that place people go when they're like, 'I've had a long day, I want to laugh, I want to turn off a little bit,"' Singh said recently during an interview on the Today Show. "I want to be that spot."
WELCOME TO MARWEN (2018) 8 p.m. HBO. Fantasy and reality intermingle in this most recent feature from Robert Zemeckis. Based on a 2010 documentary, the film stars Steve Carell as Mark Hogancamp, an illustrator who is the target of an assault that leaves him unable to draw or remember much of his own life. He copes by constructing an elaborate fantasy world populated by dolls in his backyard. The story flits between the real world and the constructed one, which comes alive with the help of distinctive visual effects. The movie, which also counts Leslie Mann, Diane Kruger and Janelle Monáe among its cast, is "at once compulsive in its application of craft and barely in control of its themes and implications," A.O. Scott wrote in his review for The New York Times. "There is not much in this movie that feels authentic or fully realized," he added, "but its very strangeness makes it hard to forget or dismiss."
AMERICAN HORROR STORY: 1984 10 p.m. on FX. Less than a week before the first day of fall, "American Horror Story" is heading off to camp. But don't come looking for a sunny escape. With previous seasons focused on a coven, a cult and more, the series has developed a following by delivering gory frights. This time the scares are delivered alongside coifed hair and neon swim trunks at a summer camp in the 1980s. It's a safe bet that the experience will be more "Friday the 13th" than "Wet Hot American Summer."

BILL BURR: PAPER TIGER Stream on Netflix. The comedian Bill Burr, who was once described by Jason Zinoman in The Times as speaking "with a wiseguy Boston accent that becomes so flamboyant that he can sound like a gangster in a Bugs Bunny cartoon," uses that voice to discuss his five years of marriage, fatherhood and cancel culture in this new special, which was filmed at the Royal Albert Hall in London.

Texto completo: Lara Prescott is at a liminal moment.
She is sitting in the Houndstooth Coffee on East Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard like a regular person (which she more or less is), but she is very in between states, on the cusp of Something Maybe Big.
A few weeks ago, she was a 37-year-old MFA graduate about to publish her first novel. She was a little older than a lot of her cohort at the Michener Center for Writers at the University of Texas.
She already had a whole other career behind her — for most of the 21st century, she was a digital strategist for various left-leaning political campaigns before becoming sick of the “money over everything else” dynamic of even the most progressive candidates.
Prescott was an unknown quantity in the literary world. Now, she is the proud publisher of a New York Times bestseller called “The Secrets We Kept,” a savvy mix of historical novel and page-turner. The book is getting raves. She did a morning show in Canada. Reese Witherspoon made it a book club selection. It has been optioned for the screen (which is the film industry version of swiping right on a dating app and not much else, but still, it’s something).
“The Secrets We Kept” explores the beginning of the Cold War, in the U.S. and in the Soviet Union. It follows Olga Ivinskaya, author Boris Pasternak’s mistress, muse and, as Prescott puts it as we talk, “his business manager.” Olga inspires the character of Lara in Pasternak’s “Doctor Zhivago” and aids its smuggling to the West. She ends up doing time in a Gulag and is shunned by Pasternak’s family for her trouble.
Prescott’s book also follows the women of the newly minted CIA, most of whom are stuck in the typing pool after serving as agents during World War II. When a first-generation Russian American named Irina gets a job there, it turns out she is just mousy enough to become a low-key agent under the tutelage of the much flashier, much Bond-ier bombshell Sally Forrester, a top-flight spy with secrets of her own, secrets people on her own side are more than willing to exploit.
But “The Secrets We Kept” is also a novel about women consigned to the margins while also doing jobs that might have seemed unimaginable to their friends and neighbors.
“I’m super interested in how women are depicted in history and forgotten by history,” Prescott says. “Olga was Pasternak’s mistress, but she was also essentially his business manager. (Cold War-era CIA director) Allen Dulles thought as early as 1953 that the CIA was underutilizing women, which was progressive at the time.”
A brilliant mix of sentence-to-sentence lit-craft with the pacing of a stone-cold page-turner, “The Secrets We Kept” is a novel about the power of literature, about a historical moment when the Western intelligence services believed a novel could change the course of the Cold War.
It has first-person plural and third-person omniscient narration. It switches points of view and moves through time
smoothly and without fuss.
It’s the sort of novel you cast in your head. (Cate Blanchett circa 2000 is absolutely Sally; how do we feel about Bryce Dallas Howard circa now?) It has little in-jokes about the early days at the CIA. (One character is called Teddy Helms, recalling CIA founding father Richard Helms; nobody is named after CIA spymaster James Jesus Angleton, sadly, though I was holding out for, I don’t know, a Jim Judas.) It might very well be a total smash.
So, yeah, liminal.
Prescott, 37, hails from Greensburg, Penn., which is right outside of Pittsburgh. Getting into the idea of activism and public service, she ended up at American University in Washington, D.C., for undergrad, did time in AmeriCorps and ended up joining a political campaign doing all sorts of digital work — ghost tweeting, ad writing, that sort of thing. She eventually joined David Axelrod’s political consulting shop, AKPD Message & Media.
After a few years, Prescott became disillusioned with the whole enterprise.
“I became really jaded,” Prescott says. “You’re working for the good guys, but just seeing the amount of money involved in politics, how much money it takes to get elected, really left a bad taste in my mouth. You have candidates who wanted to talk about what they were passionate about and have to spend all this time fundraising or lose because they didn’t fundraise enough.”
Prescott’s husband, food activist and cookbook author Matthew Prescott, asked her a crucial question: What do you really want to do? “And I said, ‘I want to write books.’ And he said, ‘You’re going to quit your job and try.’”
After some struggle, she got into the Michener Center in 2014, where Deb Olin Unferth and Elizabeth McCracken were her advisers.
“Both of them were pivotal readers for me,” Prescott says. By her third year in the program, she had the fourth draft of “The Secrets We Kept” done.
“It is the rare polyphonic novel that adds up to more than the sum of its parts,” McCracken says. “It is incredibly hard to do, but her book is genuinely symphonic. All of these voices work together. She just understands when to sustain in a voice and when it’s gonna be stronger (for the book as a whole) to switch.”
McCracken, author of books like this year’s “Bowlaway,” knows from good writing, but did she think it was going to be no-kidding actually popular?
“I did, and I rarely think that,” McCracken says. “There is a lot of wonderful writing that I know is good but I don’t automatically think will be a big commercial success, but Lara’s book I thought was the type that would attract a wide variety of people reading and pressing on other people.“
Having a substantive plot doesn’t hurt. “I don’t think plot is a dirty word,” Prescott says, “and that can be a little controversial in the MFA world.”
“But part of it is your instructors, too,” she continues. “Elizabeth does not impart her own sensibilities of what she would write onto your work, which is what you need.”
Perhaps the biggest challenge was when to hew to real history, when to adapt and when to make something up out of whole cloth.
“When I was dealing with real people, I tried to stick to the script as much as possible,” Prescott says. “If there was a source, if a moment existed, especially with Pasternak and that aspect, I tried to use record, but I wasn’t (beholden to it). On the CIA side, all of those people are amalgamations of other spies that had existed, but in a lot of the files that were released by the CIA, names have been redacted.
“It’s definitely not nonfiction.”

Missing details are problem in Monday's Kavanaugh article

Texto completo: A quarter of the front page of Monday's Orlando Sentinel covered sexual misconduct allegations against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.
The article from the Los Angeles Times opened with President Trump's strong defense of Kavanaugh, but then included this information from a New York Times piece on Sunday about a new book on the case: "A classmate, Max Stier, saw Mr. Kavanaugh with his pants down at a different drunken dorm party, where friends pushed his penis into the hand of a female student."
Several readers wondered why the article did not mention two details:
*That the woman in the new allegation told friends she had no memory of the event and declined to speak with the New York Times.
*That Max Stier worked for the law firm in 1998 that represented then President Bill Clinton during the investigation into his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
The article should have included both details.
The first was not known before publication. The New York Times amended its piece late Sunday - I am checking at what time - to include this editor's note:
"An earlier version of this article, which was adapted from a forthcoming book, did not include one element of the book's account regarding an assertion by a Yale classmate that friends of Brett Kavanaugh pushed his penis into the hand of a female student at a drunken dorm party. The book reports that the female student declined to be interviewed and friends say that she does not recall the incident. That information has been added to the article."
As for the second about Stier, it was a detail easy to find and the article should have included it.
It's interesting to note that the Los Angeles Times updated its article Monday morning at 4 a.m. with both those details.
It's also interesting to note that an article in the Washington Post says the Post last year "independently confirmed that lawmakers and authorities knew of the claim, but did not publish a story because the alleged witnesses were not identified and the woman said to be involved declined to comment."
CNN also is not using details of the new allegation, which is similar to one from Deborah Ramirez, another classmate of Kavanaugh's.
The basic rule of journalism is that you need to verify your information with more than one source. Another basic rule is that fairness requires you to disclose to readers information that might cause them to question one side or another.
In this case, the Times failed to let readers know the woman at the center of the new allegation declined to be interviewed and that her friends said she didn't remember. The allegation is based on Stier - and the article makes clear he also declined to talk with the reporters, who "corroborated the story with two officials who have communicated with Mr. Stier."
The piece did not say Mr. Stier once worked for Bill Clinton, although he now runs a nonprofit organization, the Partnership for Public Service.
The point isn't that his past work for Clinton means he is not credible, but readers needed to know that information so they can factor it into their judgment.
The followup to the Times' article and editor's note is fueling the latest round of attacks on the media for its coverage of President Trump.
I think the Times needs to say more about its decision making. It turned the newspaper into the story, instead of where the focus should be, in new important details about the Ramirez incident and the FBI's limited investigation of that case.
And I think we need to acknowledge that the Orlando Sentinel made a poor choice of top stories Monday. It's easy to blame others, but in the end it's our name on the top of the page, so we are responsible for what publishes.
That's why when readers alerted us to their concerns on Monday, I began looking into what happened and wrote this column.
We also talked with our national news team about the need for a more thorough story about this case, which is being published with this column in Tuesday's newspaper.

House panel investigates Elaine Chao for possible conflicts

Texto completo: The House Oversight Committee said Monday it is investigating whether Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao acted improperly to benefit herself or her family's shipping company.
Two Democratic leaders sent Chao a letter asking her to turn over documents and communications related to the New York company, Foremost Group. Chao's father and sisters own the company, which transports material to and from China.
The New York Times and Politico have reported that Chao may have used her Cabinet position to benefit the company and increase its influence and status with the Chinese government. China has extended hundreds of millions of dollars in low-interest loans to the company for the purchase of foreign-flagged ships.
Chao has denied wrongdoing.
Democratic Representatives Elijah Cummings of Maryland and Raja Krishnamoorthi of Illinois said they are examining Chao's statements and actions and whether she complied with ethics rules. Cummings chairs the Oversight panel, while Krishnamoorthi heads an economic and consumer policy subcommittee.
A Transportation Department spokesman said Monday the department has received a letter seeking information on a variety of topics based on publicly available information and news coverage.
"We look forward to responding to the committee's request," said spokesman Stephen Bradford.

McCabe lawyers say attacks make fair trial impossible
Andrew McCabe, the former acting FBI director, and his legal team have waged a vigorous campaign to dispute allegations that he lied to investigators about a media leak.
In recent months, McCabe's attorneys shared with federal prosecutors and top Justice Department officials a point-by-point rebuttal of what they view as flaws in a possible criminal case against McCabe.
They argued that prosecuting McCabe would be unprecedented, politically driven, and contrary to the very legal thinking that Attorney General William Barr outlined when he decided President Trump should not be charged with obstruction of justice in the special counsel investigation, according to an analysis provided to The Washington Post by McCabe's team, the substance of which was communicated to the Justice Department.
McCabe's attorneys threatened to mount a no-holds-barred defense, arguing that the case should be thrown out because of Trump's frequent personal attacks and raising the prospect that they would demand information that might show investigators were influenced by political bias.
McCabe's team was told Wednesday that Deputy Attorney Jeffrey Rosen had rejected one of their last attempts to get the Justice Department to abandon the case. The team had been told last month that line prosecutors had recommended moving forward, and Jessie Liu, a US attorney for the District of Columbia, had endorsed their recommendation.
But as of Monday morning, no charges had been filed, and there was no sign of the grand jury that had been hearing evidence in the matter previously. That panel was suddenly called back in to the D.C. federal courthouse last week after a monthslong hiatus — which seemed to be an indication that they would soon be asked to consider approving an indictment.

Biden, other hopefuls set for Southern-style politics
Four Democratic presidential candidates are descending on South Carolina for what organizers call the oldest traditional campaign speech event in the country, taking an opportunity to continue to make their cases ahead of the first Southern vote of 2020.
On Monday, Joe Biden, Bill de Blasio, Pete Buttigieg, and Amy Klobuchar are scheduled to speak at the Galivants Ferry Stump, a biennial Democratic event that takes place in a rural portion of northeastern South Carolina. One by one, they will speak to an expected crowd of thousands gathered in the unincorporated community of Galivants Ferry along the banks of the Little Pee Dee River.
The event dates back to the 1870s, when former Civil War General Wade Hampton arrived in Galivants Ferry as part of his campaign for South Carolina governor. Area businessman Joseph Holliday began to invite Democratic candidates to give campaign speeches from his Galivants Ferry store, standing on a tree stump to be seen above the crowd.
A tradition was born, and the Holliday family has continued to host the stump every other year preceding an election. These days, candidates speak not from the original pine stump but from the porch of the Hollidays' store, which has been recognized as a "Local Legacy" by the Library of Congress.
Republicans are always invited to attend the stump but aren't allowed to speak.

Judge won't toss charge over Muslim candidate threat
A federal judge refused on Monday to throw out a case in which a North Carolina man is charged with anonymously threatening to lynch a Muslim-American man campaigning for a state Senate seat in Virginia. Joseph Cecil Vandevere is charged with interstate communication of a threat to injure a person in connection with a tweet directed at candidate Qasim Rashid. The tweet included a picture of a lynching and read, "VIEW YOUR DESTINY."
Vandevere argued his indictment must be dismissed on First Amendment free speech grounds, claiming the communication in question was not a "true threat."
However, US District Judge Max Cogburn Jr. said he cannot rule as a matter of law that the alleged threat was "political hyperbole" or that "no reasonable person would interpret this communication as a serious expression of intent to do harm."

New allegation surfaces against Kavanaugh Trump rallies to his defense in fresh report of sexual misconduct

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump vigorously defended Brett Kavanaugh on Sunday following a new allegation of sexual misconduct during the Supreme Court justice's college years, as some leading Democratic presidential contenders raised fresh suspicions that Kavanaugh was untruthful during last year's Senate hearings leading to his confirmation to the high court.
In an early-morning tweet, Trump called on the Justice Department to "come to Kavanaugh's rescue," and accused critics of trying to deter the justice from rulings favorable to the administration. The president's angry ripostes came a day after The New York Times reported that a male former classmate at Yale had told the FBI about witnessing an episode similar to, but separate from, an already publicized account by a female classmate, Deborah Ramirez, who said an inebriated Kavanaugh had thrust his penis in her face during a Yale party in the 1980s.
The authors of The New York Times story said Kavanaugh did not speak to them about the newly reported allegation.
Many of the Democrats who want to challenge Trump in 2020 have frequently referred to the string of sexual-misconduct allegations against the president himself, but there has been little appetite for making the Kavanaugh case a major campaign talking point, in part because the episode was so polarizing. In the ensuing months, the president has often invoked the case at fiery rallies, insisting that Kavanaugh was the wronged party.
But with the campaign season now underway in earnest, the previous allegations, coupled with newly reported information, are again becoming part of the discourse.
Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Kamala Harris of California both called for impeachment proceedings against Kavanaugh, with Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont saying he supported "any appropriate constitutional mechanism" being used against the newest justice.
Warren tweeted that the new allegation was "disturbing," adding: "Like the man who appointed him, Kavanaugh should be impeached." Harris declared on Twitter that "Brett Kavanaugh lied to the U.S. Senate and most importantly to the American people," and Sanders said on Twitter that he should never have been nominated.
Sen. Amy Klobuchar, a Minnesota Democrat who, like Harris, sits on the Judiciary Committee and is seeking the Democratic nomination, repeated her deep misgivings about Kavanaugh in an interview Sunday on ABC's "This Week," citing his judicial views on the power of the presidency as well as the past and current sexual misconduct allegations.
On Twitter, Trump blasted "Radical Left Democrats and their Partner, the LameStream Media" for targeting Kavanaugh and "talking loudly of their favorite word, impeachment."
"He is an innocent man who has been treated HORRIBLY," Trump wrote in one tweet. In another, he urged that the justice sue for "liable," later correcting the spelling to "libel." Trump also accused Kavanaugh critics of acting out of unhappiness over high court rulings.
"They are trying to influence his opinions," the president tweeted.
Many commentators, however, called the situation yet another troubling instance of the president seeking to politicize the Justice Department and federal law enforcement by calling on the department to intercede on Kavanaugh's behalf.
The New York Times article focused on Ramirez's student days and her account of a party at which Kavanaugh, then a freshman, "pulled down his pants and thrust his penis at her, prompting her to swat it away and inadvertently touch it." The story said the FBI had failed to interview witnesses who may have been able to provide corroborating testimony, and that the paper's 10-month investigation suggested there was evidence to support Ramirez's account.
The New York Times also disclosed a previously unreported allegation: "A classmate, Max Stier, saw Mr. Kavanaugh with his pants down at a different drunken dorm party, where friends pushed his penis into the hand of a female student." The article said Stier, who heads a nonprofit organization in Washington, has not come forward publicly with his account, but notified senators and the FBI at the time.
The authors of the Times story said Kavanaugh declined to answer questions about Stier's account, and the article said the FBI did not investigate his claim.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – The report of a new sexual misconduct allegation against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh has sparked fury among figures on both the left and right.
In a Sunday morning tweet, President Donald Trump accused the "LameStream Media" and Democrats of colluding to scare Kavanaugh "into turning Liberal."
And on the left, Democratic presidential candidates former HUD Secretary Juli n Castro, former Rep. Beto O'Rourke, and U.S. Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Kamala Harris of California called for Kavanaugh's impeachment.
"Last year the Kavanaugh nomination was rammed through the Senate without a thorough examination of the allegations against him," Warren wrote on Twitter. "Confirmation is not exoneration, and these newest revelations are disturbing. Like the man who appointed him, Kavanaugh should be impeached."
Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and a Democratic presidential hopeful, said he supported "any appropriate constitutional mechanism to hold (Kavanaugh) accountable"
Sanders, Warren, and Harris voted against Kavanaugh's confirmation in October 2018.
Kavanaugh was confirmed by a 50-48 Senate vote last October after a bitter nomination process. Christine Blasey Ford accused Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct while they were high school students in the 1980s, but Kavanaugh denied the claim during the confirmation hearing.
A New York Times essay published Saturday evening and adapted from the upcoming book "The Education of Brett Kavanaugh: An Investigation" featured new information that two reporters said corroborated a previous claim of sexual misconduct against Kavanaugh and uncovered evidence supporting a previously unreported claim.
Deborah Ramirez, a Yale classmate of Kavanaugh's, alleged during his confirmation process that he had exposed himself to her in college. Her account received less attention than Ford's at the time though, as Ford had testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
"During his Senate testimony, Mr. Kavanaugh said that if the incident Ms. Ramirez described had occurred, it would have been 'the talk of campus.' Our reporting suggests that it was," wrote New York Times reporters Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly.
The reporters said at least seven people they interviewed had heard about the incident – including the accuser's mother.
Despite this, Pogrebin and Kelly say, the FBI "interviewed none of them, though we learned many of these potential witnesses tried in vain to reach the FBI on their own."
Pogrebin and Kelly say they also uncovered another incident of sexual misconduct in which another one of Kavanaugh's classmates "saw Mr. Kavanaugh with his pants down at a different drunken dorm party, where friends pushed his penis into the hand of a female student."
The classmate, Max Stier, flagged the report to the FBI, but the agency declined to investigate the incident, The New York Times reported.
Brian Fallon, executive director of progressive judicial group Demand Justice, pitched a question about Kavanaugh's impeachment as a question for the next Democratic debate.
Ronna McDaniel, chairwoman of the Republican Party, slammed the report. "The New York Times should be ashamed of this smear on Justice Kavanaugh," she said, citing a tweet from Federalist Senior Editor Mollie Hemingway claiming the reporting in Pogrebin and Kelly's book undercut the reporting in their essay.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell pledged his support to Kavanaugh.
"Fortunately a majority of Senators and the American people rallied behind timeless principles such as due process and the presumption of innocence. I look forward to many years of service to come from Justice Kavanaugh," he wrote on Twitter.
Trump tweeted that Kavanaugh should "start suing people for libel, or the Justice Department should come to his rescue."

A lesson on fame, grief and when to log off

Texto completo: For reasons I cannot explain and nevertheless felt bashful about, I spent the better part of the week sporadically scrolling through the Instagram feed of a person named Caroline Calloway and trying to figure out why I was scrolling through the Instagram feed of Caroline Calloway.
This is an Internet celebrity who most of the world had never heard of - a social media "influencer" whose nearly 800,000 followers were apparently drawn to her globe-trotting, life-is-a-sparkler-and-I'm-the-match photos and captions. She wore a lot of flower crowns; she'd once gained some notoriety after scheduling and canceling a series of "creativity workshops," for which she charged $165 a ticket and ordered 1,200 Mason jars.
"Why did she promise people Mason jar gardens?" a friend emailed me on Wednesday, because my friend, too, had fallen into a Caroline Calloway vortex and could not claw her way out.
It was all a lark until suddenly it wasn't, until suddenly it was a meditation on the nature of grief and fame, creativity and complicity.
Here's what happened to launch this obsession: Last week, New York magazine published a very long, very viral essay written by a former friend of Calloway's. Natalie Beach alleged that she had ghostwritten many of Calloway's successful Instagram posts. And that Calloway may have purchased some of the account's followers. And that Calloway had promised her a never-materialized portion of a $375,000 book advance. And, and, and.
There were a lot of privileged problems, a lot of friendship drama. The spikiest distillation of the essay I heard was an acquaintance claiming that reading it was like boiling six seasons of HBO's "Girls" into a teaspoon, and injecting it into your veins.
Was Beach's essay petty? Yes. Was it embarrassing and painful? Yes - especially because Calloway documented her response in real time. "When we were still best friends I don't think I even saw [Beach] clearly enough to love her," she wrote online. "You may . . . say that I'm manic or spiraling or melting-down . . . I know what I am making and I have a creative vision."
And, while observing all that in the moment, was it still inexplicably tempting to scroll all the way back to the 2012 beginnings of Calloway's Instagram feed, to examine a mundane photo of an ice cream cone and marvel over the fact it garnered 1,873 likes?
Well, here we are.
Ever since Nick Carraway wandered into one of Jay Gatsby's parties, ever since the talented Tom Ripley went to Italy to collect Dickie Greenleaf, America has been a sucker for stories of middle-class souls drawn into friendships beyond their pay grades.
First, these wealthy benefactors dazzle with incomprehensible charm. They bestow gifts and experiences, and they allow their new friends to bask in their reflected glory. Then, after a while, the middle-class friend begins to realize he is not being shined upon, he is being sucked in.
At that point, resentment builds to a revelation: There was never anything particularly great about Gatsby. The scenery was lovely but the conversation was banal; the books in his library were fakes. Money and fame can mask a whole manner of dullness while prompting a whole range of envy.
The publication of the Caroline Calloway essay launched an immediate wave of armchair analysis, at least in the rabid little corner of society that cared about it: Was this a story about toxic friendship? Was this a story about the vapidness of young, millennial white girls? Should we all feel embarrassed for reading such a frivolous thing?
To me, it wasn't vapid. It wasn't girly. It was F. Scott Fitzgerald reworked for our Instagram age; it was Patricia Highsmith with the comments function enabled.
Why did Caroline Calloway promise people Mason jar gardens? Because this is how we update our modern classics for 2019. The rich remain as inscrutable as they ever were, and we remain just as disdainful of them, and just as taken in.

Anyway. These were my thoughts about Caroline Calloway, until Thursday afternoon, when she put up something else on Instagram - a sharp departure from rehashing the Natalie drama.
Her father had just died, she wrote. She'd learned only an hour before. She posted a photo of herself as a toddler gazing up at a dark-haired man wearing Coke-bottle glasses.
Even in grief, she'd considered the optics of posting this news: "I'm worried that by even telling this I will cheapen the truth. That I will make this moment into another 'notorious misfortune' of mine as the New York Times called them."
Suddenly, writing about Calloway only as if she were a character in literature felt odious - even as she continued writing about herself that way, spilling every thought onto the page. Two hours after she got the phone call about her father, she gave an interview with NBC. It was already scheduled, she said, and she didn't care if people judged her for doing it. It was how she was processing her grief, she said, and the format wasn't anyone's business but hers.
"Just don't tell me how to f---ing grieve," she wrote.
Suddenly, writing about Calloway at all took on a level of deeper meaning. Too big for a column, really, or even for a long, viral essay written by a former friend. Calloway had gone from being a cartoonish symbol to a hurting, complicated human.
It had become a story about what is real and what is fake, and what is livelihood and what is life. And what is fame, anyway, when the currency is likes and not dollars, and the role we all play in that.
Social media had made her a celebrity and then made her into a villain, and now, in an incredibly dark and painful time, it had simply made her. She seemed to cling to it, for better or worse. Only now, there was less of the applause she usually received; instead, there were baffled readers telling her to just log off, already, just stop creating.
Nothing about this felt mockable. It felt, instead, like a sad, strange, painfully real and incredibly bizarre world we'd all helped build and now were all watching teeter. And it all started to feel gross.
Enough with mining her Instagram, enough with trying to understand what made her more viral than lots of other more talented people, enough with the week of obsession.
The last post of hers that I read was one in which she talked about figuring out how to move forward after everything that had happened last week. "I don't know how to be Caroline Calloway right now," she wrote.
And then, since she wasn't logging off, I did.

Loyalty system not unique to Alabama

Texto completo: At Alabama, where the football is only boring when the home team goes up by six touchdowns, students are being penalized if they leave a game early.
A report by the New York Times found that the juggernaut uses location-tracking technology in its student loyalty rewards program. Students download the Tide Loyalty Points app, earn 100 points for attending a home game and get an additional 250 if they're still there in the fourth quarter.
The idea is that the incentive of more points will prevent students from leaving games early, something Coach Nick Saban often has spoken out against.
Alabama's system represents an extreme example of a broadly used idea. On a local level, Maryland employs a loyalty system for football and men's basketball. In recent years, there has not been much use for the program during football season. With the Terps hanging around the bottom of the Big Ten, most students who applied for a ticket received one.
But this year, the ticketing system will be a factor. Penn State is coming to College Park on Sept. 27, and the athletic department received about 14,500 requests for 10,000 seats as of Thursday, according to a school spokesman. When demand exceeds capacity, a lottery is triggered and a student's number of entries is determined by loyalty points.
Students that attended Maryland's first two home games had four points, two for each game. Maryland's system does not incentivize length of stay.
If you want to attend a football game at Virginia Tech, you enter a simple lottery. Just give your name during the sign-up period and cross your fingers. But at Virginia, Sabre Points are used during men's basketball season. Demand to see the NCAA champions is high, and if the number of ticket requests exceeds capacity, a lottery is triggered. The number of entries each student receives in the lottery is determined by their Sabre Points. These can be earned by attending other sporting events at the university.

Coloring books, Klingon dictionaries and other books banned by state prisons

Texto completo: In Florida, where roughly 96,000 men and women are locked up in state prisons, the government's list of 20,000 publications that are off-limits to inmates includes Klingon dictionaries, Dungeons & Dragons guides, prisoners' rights pamphlets and Windows manuals "for Dummies." Also listed are a host of coloring books - draw-between-the-lines titles featuring illustrations of butterflies, flowers, paisley patterns, "calming mandalas," muscle cars and (in the case of "Exotic Chickens: Coloring for Everyone") poultry breeds like the Crèvecoeur, Houdan, golden laced Wyandotte and Polish hen .
Under guidelines used by the Literature Review Committee at the Florida Department of Corrections, all those books are apparently "detrimental to the security, order or disciplinary or rehabilitative interests" of the state's prisons, or "might facilitate criminal activity." But what's so bad about, for instance, a coloring book? In an email, a Florida corrections spokesman explained that some offer "easy to use templates for tattooing," which is prohibited because of the risk of transmitting diseases. Foreign (and fictional) language dictionaries, meanwhile, can pose a security threat "by providing a method of communication not readily identifiable by security staff."
The same books might be perfectly fine in another state. If that sounds arbitrary, it is. "There is a serious nationwide need for better standards and oversight in what prisoners are allowed to read," says Michelle Dillon, public records manager and development coordinator for the Human Rights Defense Center, a prisoners' rights organization based in Lake Worth, Fla. The group, which also runs Prison Legal News, a monthly magazine for inmates, published the Florida banned books list in July, as part of a larger effort to obtain similar lists from the Federal Bureau of Prisons and each state correctional system.
So far, the center has compiled full or partial lists from 20 states, not including publicly available lists for Pennsylvania and Washington state. Based on the group's findings, the worst places for incarcerated readers include Texas - which made headlines in 2017 after it banned "Where's Waldo?" but not Hitler's autobiographical manifesto, "Mein Kampf" - as well as Arizona and Florida.
In Florida, prisoners can appeal a publication's impoundment or rejection in the mail room by filing a grievance to the Literature Review Committee, a group of three prison officials that meets every two weeks; their decisions form the banned books list. But in Alabama and many other states, no systemwide review committee exists.
"What we've seen in the last 30 years is a dramatic clampdown," says HRDC executive director Paul Wright, who founded the group after successfully challenging book bans as an inmate in Washington state. "Especially looking at self-help books. It almost harks back to the days of slavery, when it was illegal for slaves to learn to read or write, and a crime for anyone to teach them."
His organization recently won a lawsuit against the Southwest Virginia Regional Jail Authority, which had required preapproval for all publications and barred HRDC magazines because the staples could be used as weapons or "tattooing guns." But battles in the judicial system don't always go their way. In January, the Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal of a case in which the group had unsuccessfully sued to overturn a ban on Prison Legal News in Florida jails. Officials argued that the publication's advertisements, including for three-way phone-calling services, posed a security risk.
Most prisons do have libraries, which are often so underfunded and understaffed that inmates rely on reading material mailed by friends, family or nonprofits such as the Seattle-based Books to Prisoners. The organization sends about 12,000 packages each year to inmates asking for novels, dictionaries, Spanish-language textbooks and the like, amid byzantine prison regulations on what can be delivered.
Some of the rules, of course, make intuitive sense. Manuals on lock picking or improvised explosives are prohibited for obvious reasons. But plenty of the regulations are more questionable - or at least have unfortunate consequences. Many prisons ban hardcover books over fears that drugs might be hidden inside. And most states have strict rules on sexual content, leading to bans on art-history guides or works of literature like "The Color Purple" by Alice Walker and "I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings" by Maya Angelou.
Perhaps the most glaring example of prison censorship has been the rejection of books about criminal justice reform, mass incarceration and inmates' rights. In a country where, according to the federal Bureau of Justice Statistics, black men serve prison sentences at nearly six times the rate of white men, books like Howard O. Lindsey's "A History of Black America" and Henry Louis Gates Jr.'s "Finding Oprah's Roots" have repeatedly run afoul of censors.
"Chokehold: Policing Black Men" by Paul Butler was banned in Arizona prisons until June, weeks after the American Civil Liberties Union threatened a lawsuit, and Michelle Alexander's "The New Jim Crow," a searing indictment of mass incarceration, was off-limits to prisoners in North Carolina, Florida and New Jersey before bans were lifted amid similar challenges by the ACLU. (Once again, "security" was cited to justify the bans. The New York Times reported that "The New Jim Crow" was barred from North Carolina prisons because officials determined it was "likely to provoke confrontation between racial groups.")
Such books have proved transformative for readers like Jesse Dunaway, 38, whom I connected with through FAMM, an advocacy group that was formerly known as Families Against Mandatory Minimums. He began reading "The New Jim Crow" while in solitary confinement about five years ago, a decade into a life sentence for selling crack cocaine. "It woke me up," he said by phone from Sussex II State Prison in Virginia. "It pretty much took me on a course where I'm fighting for my freedom" - that is, filing a petition for clemency.
If Dunaway is ever released, he will be one of the 95 percent of prisoners who eventually return home. "You have to ask yourself, 'What kind of people do you want in your own community once they're released?' " says Dillon. "Do you want people who have had access to these materials to expand their minds, or people who have had materials withheld from them for the past five, 10, 20 years?"

Texto completo: Recently I've been thinking about taking more day trips. Kentucky is great for just such a thing.
By what I see and read, it appears Owensboro city officials agree and are interested in alluring more visitors, sports tourists, pilgrims of bluegrass, and other travelers who want to get to know our commonwealth a little better.
That is, after all, a major impetus behind the Bluegrass Music Hall of Fame and Museum, the O.Z. Tyler Distillery, and the Owensboro Convention Center, among other investments that have been painstakingly made in our town.
These things are for us to enjoy too, obviously, but we like to get on the map, show off our stuff, and make visitors feel welcome here.
There is so much of this state I haven't seen or heard of, even.
For instance, have you ever heard of Vicco, Kentucky?
I hadn't either.
That's why I love The New York Times and it's why I used to love "The Colbert Report," Comedy Central's now defunct late-night talk and news satire TV program, featuring Stephen Colbert.
Both The Times and "The Colbert Report" featured Vicco, Kentucky, bringing our state's smallest town (population 344, with 326 of them being white) into the national spotlight.
Why?
Because Vicco, Kentucky's smallest town, became America's smallest town to pass a Fairness Ordinance.
In 2013.
That's right, six and a half years ago, what the New York Times called "a coal smudge of a place," voted 3-1 to pass a fairness ordinance, which outlaws discrimination based on sexual orientation.
That's all that means. It's pretty simple, really. A fairness ordinance simply makes it illegal to refuse service, housing, or employment to a person on the basis of their sexual orientation.
It isn't trickery; it's common decency.
In Vicco, and in 12 other Kentucky towns and cities, you cannot be refused these basic human rights on the basis of the anatomy of the person you love most in the world.
(It is noteworthy to mention that all four Vicco commissioners are white, heterosexual, native-born residents; the out-gay mayor, Johnny Cummings, who is also the town's hairstylist, did not vote, as he only does so to break a tie.)
Twenty years ago, Louisville
see time/page d2
time
from page d1
became the first Kentucky city to adopt a fairness ordinance. Since then, Lexington, Covington, Vicco, Frankfort, Morehead, Danville, Midway, Paducah, Maysville, Henderson, Dayton, and Georgetown have followed suit.
On Sept. 9, the Scott County city of Georgetown (population 35,000) became the thirteenth Kentucky city to pass a fairness ordinance. The vote was 5-3, and it was the culmination of nearly five years of work among local leaders in that city.
Five years!
How long have our own city and county leaders been discussing the issue?
It seems, after a cursory search of the M-I's website, since at least 2014.
Which is great news! That means we have been talking about this for five years, too.
If we follow Georgetown's model, that means we have an ordinance that should be ripe for the picking.
So what is going on that we don't have a fairness ordinance on the docket? What is all the fuss about? What in the world stands in the way of our acting locally to protect the rights of all people, since the state legislature is unwilling to enact such a law to offer blanket protection over the entire commonwealth?
What I hear from most deniers of local discrimination is that A) this kind of thing doesn't happen in Owensboro, and B) this interferes with our religious liberty.
First, why yes, of course, this kind of thing happens in Owensboro. And it happens every single day.
This very newspaper has printed at least one article recently featuring local citizens who have experienced deep discrimination due to their sexual identity.
The reason we don't notice it and have to have the issue forced on the front page of the local paper is because "we" don't identify as homosexual and, therefore, "we" aren't privy to the kind of hate, slurs and egregious and unjust prejudice that homosexual persons experience all the time, in the same way that white people will never understand the plight of black people in this country.
White people should not be in sole custody of the responsibility for making laws to protect the civil rights of black people.
Heterosexual people should not be in sole custody of the responsibility for making laws to protect the civil rights of LGBTQIA+ people.
But we do not have fair representation on our city and county commissions. This is not meant as an insult, but as a statement of fact.
How many persons of color, LGBTQIA+ persons, or other minority members sit on our elected councils?
So we are left with the rather dim hope of entrusting our elected leaders to act courageously and decently and to do the right thing, regardless of whether they believe there is enough political will or enough votes to see it through.
We ask them to stand up, unite our city, speak to our fears, reassure of us our core values, and remember aloud the words of leaders past who gave their lives for love, for kindness, for fairness, for decency, and for civility.
But those elected leaders would like to be elected again.
In every time and place, such pressure incites fear for those who seek re-election.
And, of course, this means that often stuff doesn't get done, justice never sees the light of day.
How sad?!
But since it only affects "a very few of them," we don't have to be too sad for too long.
And the discrimination continues in the very way we host the conversation about discrimination.
We talk about people who are excluded from the table where the decisions about those very people are made.
Which means that clearly, and secondly, this is not a religious issue. It is a civil one.
If it were a religious one, we would welcome all to the table, discuss decently our disagreements, and err always on the side of kindness, because literally every religion in the world has something to say affirming fairness, kindness, inclusion, and embrace.
Fairness is kindness. Nothing more. Nothing less.
Better than any museum, fairness means all are welcome. Until we have that ordinance, many are not. There go all our tourism dollars.
To our city and county leaders: it's time.

18-karat gold toilet called ‘America’ stolen from Churchill’s birthplace

Texto completo: An 18-karat gold toilet titled “America" was stolen from an exhibit at Blenheim Palace, the birthplace and family home of Winston Churchill, early Saturday.
Before the theft, the toilet was part of a larger exhibit featuring artwork by its creator Maurizio Cattelan that began earlier in the week. The artist, however, found some humor in the incident.
“At first, when they woke me up this morning with the news,” he said in an email to the New York Times, “I thought it was a prank: Who’s so stupid to steal a toilet? I had forgotten for a second that it was made out of gold."
“‘America’ was the one percent for the 99 percent, and I hope it still is," he said of the piece. "I want to be positive and think the robbery is a kind of Robin Hood-inspired action.”
Cattelan added that the theft was not a prank and that the news of the toilet heist “is deadly serious if even a little bit surreal since the subject of the robbery was a toilet.”
Police are still investigating the robbery but have arrested a 66-year-old man, who has not yet been charged. The toilet, which is still missing, had been plumbed to the building and left "significant damage and flooding" when it was removed, according to a detective inspector. Police believed a “group of offenders” was behind the theft and used at least two vehicles to pull it off.
The toilet was made out of 103 kilograms of gold and is worth more than $4 million, according to an accredited precious metals dealer who added that the thieves could melt it "into gold bars in days and there would be no way to trace them" if they had the proper equipment.
"It is deeply ironic that a work of art portraying the American dream and the idea of an elite object made available to all should be almost instantly snatched away and hidden from view,” Dominic Hare, the chief executive of Blenheim Palace, said.
The toilet gained attention back in 2016 when it was installed at the Guggenheim Museum in New York City. The museum later offered it to the White House in lieu of a Vincent van Gogh painting that had been requested for President Trump and first lady Melania Trump's private living quarters.

Texto completo: SPRINGFIELD  Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul this week said he would reject a settlement agreement with opioid manufacturer Purdue Pharma under its reported current terms and announced a lawsuit against several other opioid manufacturers.
In April, Raouls office filed a lawsuit against Purdue Pharma, the manufacturer of the opioid OxyContin and defendant in thousands of other lawsuits from local municipalities and states affected by the opioid epidemic.
Raouls suit alleged the company dispatched sales representatives to Illinois hundreds of thousands of times between 2008 and 2017, and funded third-party publications under the guise of educational materials to promote opioids and downplay their risks.
>
Raoul alleged these tactics more than tripled prescriptions of Purdues opioids in Illinois. In a news release, he pointed to Illinois Department of Public Health statistics that showed more than 2,000 Illinoisans were killed by opioid overdoses in 2017. IDPH also reported instances of babies born with neonatal abstinence syndrome, which can be caused by opioid exposure, increased by 64 percent from 2011 to 2017.
In August, Raoul expanded the suit against Purdue to include members of the Sackler family, which founded and operates Purdue Pharma.
The Sackler family knowingly misled the public and continued pushing Purdues addictive opioids without care or consideration of the death and destruction their product caused, Raoul said in a statement Wednesday.
Raouls statement was in response to media reports that detailed a tentative settlement between Purdue and thousands of municipal governments and more than 20 states.
The New York Times reported the deal, for which final details are still being negotiated, would compel Purdue to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and dissolve. A new company would be formed that could continue selling OxyContin and other medicines, but its profits would be used to pay the plaintiffs in the suit, which was reported to be worth $12 billion.
Purdue would also be required to donate drugs for addiction and overdose treatment, and the Sackler family would donate $3 billion in cash over seven years but would not be forced to admit any wrongdoing.
Raoul, however, was among at least 20 attorneys general who told NBC News they had not agreed to the deal.
My office is prepared to hold the Sacklers accountable, regardless of whether or not Purdue declares bankruptcy, and I am pleased that a majority of states will continue to fight, he said in a statement.
According to the news release, Raouls expanded suit asks the court to prohibit Purdue and the Sacklers deceptive conduct to ensure it does not happen again in the future, and to assess penalties against the defendants. Raoul is also asking the court to require the defendants to pay to help remediate the opioid problem and forfeit profits resulting from the alleged misconduct.
I reject in the strongest terms, any agreement that does not adequately hold the Sackler family accountable for the irreparable harm their actions caused to families in Illinois and across the country, Raoul said in the statement. My office expanded our lawsuit against Purdue Pharma to include the Sacklers because as the family behind Purdue, their ruthless pursuit of profits destroyed other families and communities throughout Illinois and the nation.
Raoul filed a similar lawsuit Tuesday against 16 other opioid manufacturers, alleging they carried out unfair and deceptive marketing campaigns that prioritized profits over public health.
The companies actions, Raouls office said in a news release, resulted in unprecedented levels of opioid prescribing, while the distributors irresponsibly flooded Illinois with opioids, failing in their role as gatekeepers in preventing the diversion of opioids.
Raouls lawsuit seeks similar results as the one against Purdue: to abate and remedy the statewide public nuisance, prohibit the manufacturers and distributors deceptive and unfair conduct and force penalties on the companies.
The companies named in the suit are Johnson & Johnson; Janssen Pharmaceuticals Inc.; Ortho-McNeil-Janssen Pharmaceuticals Inc.; Janssen Pharmaceuticals Inc.; Endo Health Solutions Inc.; Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc.; Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited; Teva Pharmaceuticals USA Inc.; Cephalon Inc.; Allergan Finance LLC; Actavis Pharma Inc.; Actavis LLC; Watson Laboratories Inc.; McKesson Corporation; Cardinal Health Inc.; and AmerisourceBergen Drug Corporation.

Best new shows of fall

Texto completo: TV is about to become bigger this fall. A whole lot bigger.
In addition to the usual crop of new shows from broadcast networks, cable channels and streaming services, two new players will jump into the game in fall 2019: Apple TV+ and Disney+.
Disney will unveil "The Mandalorian," the first live-action TV show in the "Star Wars" franchise, with the service's Nov. 12 launch. Apple, which has not yet announced a debut date, is betting on star power, including Jennifer Aniston, Reese Witherspoon and Steve Carell in drama "The Morning Show."
And some old favorites will return, including the long-awaited third season of Netflix's "The Crown" ( Nov. 17), with Oscar-winner Olivia Colman stepping in the role of Queen Elizabeth II. Series such as ABC's long-running family sitcom "Modern Family" (Sept. 25) are also coming back for one last season.
To help you sort through this fall's avalanche of television, we chose the 10 most exciting new series.
'Undone' Amazon Prime (Sept. 13)
"BoJack Horseman" creator Raphael Bob-Waksberg joins forces with Kate Purdy ("Cougar Town") for this adult animated series that embraces darkness. "Undone" is a magical realist drama about Alma (Rose Salazar), a directionless woman in her late 20s who survives a terrible car accident and discovers she has an ability to move through time and communicate with her dead father. The series touches on themes of family history and self-destruction, and uses its animation to beautifully and render eerily realistic sketches of its talented cast, which includes Bob Odenkirk as Alma's father. The result is a series that deliberately lives in the uncanny valley, much like its protagonist.
'Country Music' PBS (Sept. 15, Sundays at 8 EDT/PDT; check local listings)
Because aKen Burns documentary is almost always a gripping, informative and gorgeously scored examination of American history, it's natural for the celebrated director to point his lens at country music, a uniquely American cultural phenomenon. The 18-hour, comprehensive look at the genre's rise genre is not just for diehard fans. It looks at the influences of African instruments and rhythm and blues, among others, includes interviews with dozens of artists and historians, and features an excellent soundtrack.
'Stumptown' ABC, Sept. 25 (Wednesdays at 10 EDT/PDT)
Cobie Smulders ("How I Met Your Mother") returns to TV with the butt-kicking moves she learned from her Marvel films ("The Avengers"). Except Dex, her damaged private investigator character on "Stumptown," drinks and gambles far more than S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Maria ever would. Based on a graphic novel, "Stumptown" which also stars Jake Johnson, follows Dex as she solves (and sometimes mildly commits) crimes and other cases in Portland, Oregon, while she takes care of her younger brother (Cole Sibus), who has Down syndrome, and tries not to gamble her way into poverty. The pilot episode deftly mixes action, drama and comedy, and Smulders remains the magnetic leading lady she was for nine years on "Mother."
'The Unicorn' CBS, Sept. 26 (Thursdays at 8:30 EDT/PDT)
This new comedy is not about mythical horse creatures, but rather Walton Goggins' Wade, a widower who's reluctantly re-entering the dating pool as a rare middle-aged "unicorn" because he's not divorced or a cheating husband, has his own loving family and is earnest. It's a great setup for great romantic comedy, and has a stellar cast, including Rob Corddry and Michaela Watkins, along with the adorable Goggins, who can make almost anything funny.
'The Politician' Netflix (Sept. 27)
Prolific creator Ryan Murphy's first Netflix series preserves his stylish flair. "The Politician" stars Ben Platt ("Pitch Perfect," "Dear Evan Hansen") as a pathologically driven high-school student who is convinced he will become president of the United States. The first step on his journey is president of his senior class, and he will do anything to win. Co-starring Gwyneth Paltrow as Platt's mother, "Politician" is more akin to early seasons of "Glee" than recent seasons of "American Horror Story;" "Politician" has just the right amount of surrealism and melodrama without going over the edge, at least in early episodes.
'Back to Life' Showtime, (Oct. 6, Sundays at 8:30 EDT/PDT)
Fans of dark British comedies "Fleabag" and "Catastrophe" will be drawn to this new series created by and starring Daisy Haggard ("Episodes"). The understated but affecting series follows Miri, a middle-aged woman who returns to her parents' house after 18 years in prison. "Life" is awkward, sweet, sad and witty, and wisely takes its time to unfurl Miri's past, initially withholding the reason she was sent to prison.
'Living With Yourself' Netflix (Oct. 18)
In this new comedy from "Daily Show" writer Timothy Greenberg, the great Paul Rudd stars as Miles, a depressed, struggling and unmotivated man who can't even seek fertility doctors. He seeks out an unconventional treatment for his malaise at a strip-mall spa, and receives much more than he bargained for. Without spoiling the first episode's major twist, let's just say the riotously smart series gives you a double dose of Rudd.
'Modern Love' Amazon (Oct. 18)
This effervescent romance, based on the New York Times column, is as sweet as apple pie without becoming sickly. "Love" is structured as an anthology series about love. That could mean a relationship between an overprotective doorman and an apartment resident, or someone with bipolar disorder worried about revealing it to their new flame. The joyful series stars Anne Hathaway, Tina Fey, John Slattery, Dev Patel and Cristin Millioti.
'High School Musical the Musical the Series' Disney+ (Nov. 12)
An extension of Disney Channel's "High School Musical" franchise, this mockumentary chronicles students' efforts to put on a production of the musical. The tongue-in-cheek approach offers enough new and old music to satisfy fans but creates modern new characters to anchor the stories. Aimed at teens (or nostalgic millennials) instead of Disney Channel's kid and tween audience, "High School" is self-aware and self-effacing. It does almost everything right that NBC's ill-fated "Rise" did wrong, and is genuinely funny. "The Mandalorian" (which was unavailable to preview) will get much of the attention when Disney+ launches, but don't write off this sitcom as just for kids.
'His Dark Materials' HBO (expected in November)
The world of Phillip Pullman's classic fantasy trilogy comes to life, in far more detail (and with better writing) than the failed 2007 film "The Golden Compass." With each planned season based on one of Pullman's novels, "Materials" (already renewed for a second) gives more depth to the story of Lyra (Dafne Keen), the bright young girl living in a world slightly different than our own (human souls live outside their bodies in animals called "daemons"). Co-starring Lin-Manuel Miranda, James McAvoy and Ruth Wilson, the steampunk-style fantasy world might satisfy HBO viewers who miss the high fantasy that "Game of Thrones" brought them for so long.

Texto completo: An American spy forced to flee Russia after President Trump spilled key classified information was reportedly a key mole inside the Kremlin whose departure marked a major setback for intelligence efforts, according to a New York Times report.
The spy was pulled out of Russia in 2017 amid concerns that Trump would endanger his safety due to his cozy relationship with Putin (photo) - a shocking new sign of how the mercurial president is hurting U.S. interests, the newspaper reported.
The informant had given the CIA a window into the highest levels of Kremlin decision-making including Russia's efforts to meddle in U.S. elections in 2016 on behalf of Trump, to the Times said.
The operative initially resisted efforts to leave Russia out of fears his family could face retaliation. But he eventually agreed to leave and is now in hiding in the U.S. under government protection.
After the spy's dramatic departure, American intelligence had much less insight into Putin's push to influence the 2018 midterms and any effort to boost Trump's reelection push in 2020.
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who headed the CIA at the start of the Trump administration, denied the report without being specific.
"Suffice it to say that the reporting there is factually wrong," Pompeo said Tuesday.
The ouster of the CIA operative was also dismissed as "pulp fiction" by President Vladimir Putin's aides even as details emerged that he was an invaluable asset who funneled information to American handlers for decades.
Putin aide Dmitri Peskov pooh-poohed the spy drama as "pulp fiction" and said the spy was a low-level Kremlin worker who had no access to Putin and left his post in 2017.
"This is more the genre of pulp fiction, crime reading, so let's leave it up to them," Peskov said Tuesday.

Brown denies rape allegation

Texto completo: Patriots wide receiver Antonio Brown has been accused of rape by a former trainer.
Britney Taylor says Brown sexually assaulted her on three occasions, according to a lawsuit filed Tuesday in the Southern District of Florida.
Brown has denied the allegations. Darren Heitner, a lawyer representing Brown, told The AP his client plans to countersue.
Heitner said Brown and Taylor had "a consensual ... relationship."
The New York Times first reported the lawsuit.
"As a rape victim of Antonio Brown, deciding to speak out has been an incredibly difficult decision," Taylor said in a statement. "I have found strength in my faith, family, and from the accounts of other survivors of sexual assault. Speaking out removes the shame that I have felt for the past year and places it on the person responsible for my rape."
Taylor also said she will cooperate with the NFL and any other agencies.
Brown, 31, a Miami native, was released by the Raiders last week after clashing with the team throughout training camp. He agreed to a contract with the Patriots on Saturday, but didn't play in Sunday night's season-opening win against the Steelers.
Watch it: Odell Beckham Jr.'s taking a stand against the NFL on his lavish wrist wear.
Beckham said that he intends to keep wearing his $190,000 Richard Mille watch that he had on during Sunday's season opener against the Titans. The showy receiver believes the league has made an issue out of his jewelry only because it's him.
A league spokesman had said there's no rule prohibiting players from wearing jewelry. However there is a policy "prohibiting hard objects."
Jets get WR Thomas: The Jets acquired receiver Demaryius Thomas from the Patriots for a 2021 sixth-round pick.
Thomas, 31, a four-time Pro Bowler, played for Jets coach Adam Gase from 2010-14 when Gase was wide receivers coach and then offensive coordinator with the Broncos.
The Jets waived Kaare Vedvik two days after he missed an extra point and 45-yard field goal in a one-point loss to the Bills and signed Sam Ficken.
Defensive tackle Nathan Shepherd was suspended six games by the league for violating its PEDs policy.

Trump tactics threaten press freedom, trust

Texto completo: When it comes to freedom of the press in the United States, I truly believe we are at a crisis point. Throughout his presidency, Donald Trump gone after journalists and publications he doesn't like (at times even boycotting them). Journalists are being targeted and are part of his stump speeches on the campaign trail. He even encourages violence and aggression toward them.
Now the president and his allies are taking his war with the media a step further with a new tactic of digging up dirt on specific reporters. As described in a memo viewed and quoted by Axios, the group says it will circulate the damaging information to Trump-friendly media outlets and others as well.
The top "fake news" targets named in the tactical memo are CNN and MSNBC, "all broadcast networks," the New York Times, the Washington Post, Buzzfeed, Huffington Post, and their reporters and editors. Axios has also reported, based on unnamed participants, that pro-Trump groups are preparing to attack alleged bias by social media platforms as part of Trump's 2020 re-election strategy.
While these tactics are unconventional, it's more important to focus on the real issue at hand: Freedom of the press and how this will erode trust in the fourth estate. It is critical that the press be allowed to do its job, which means fact-checking and reporting. While today's news cycle has become hyper-partisan, it is still important for journalists to be held accountable – and for them to hold our government accountable.
It's no secret that during the Obama administration there were frequent complaints about right-of-center media outlets for pandering to a specific viewpoint, and they were sent to the back of the line or criticized for what was deemed unfair coverage. But it is hypocritical for the Trump administration to do the same thing (and to a much greater and more dangerous extent). So far we have seen the Trump administration single out journalists and outlets for what he believes to be "fake news," and even try to revoke White House passes from two reporters. But all outlets deserve the right to report on the happenings at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, because, after all, it is the people's house.
This rhetoric against the media has also become dangerous. In October, there was a series of scary moments when suspicious packages containing faulty pipe bombs were found on or near the properties of many Trump targets, from Barack Obama and the Clintons to CNN's studios. I would hate to jump to conclusions as to why explosive devices were sent to these places, and a judge did not accept the defense argument that Trump's rhetoric contributed to these crimes. Yet it is important to note the language that has consistently come from the White House about journalists and the media as well as Democrats.
Trump consistently belittles reporters he disagrees with and will shut them out from asking questions, but it's important that they keep asking and don't stand down. The First Amendment applies to everyone. Trump would be smart to recognize that the First Amendment he so ardently defended during the campaign also applies to his adversaries and those whose political opinions are different from his.
As the 2020 presidential campaign moves forward, journalists should not fear digging for the truth and should always strive for accuracy in their reporting. They are the guardians of a pillar of our democracy.

HILLGROVE ON END OF A RIVALRY BROADCASTER BELIEVES PITT-PSU WILL RETURN

Texto completo: Bill Hillgrove took a sip of beer.
It was Friday afternoon, less than 24 hours before Pitt played Ohio. No one at Dad's Pub&Grub in Braddock Hills knew the Panthers would beat the Bobcats, and at the time, no one cared. Not in the moment, at least. Everyone sitting at the bar - from Hillgrove, the voice of the Panthers, to the workers on lunch break - had their eyes peeled to SportsCenter as Antonio Brown's ongoing antics were dissected.
Thank God we traded him.
Not our problem anymore.
Hillgrove couldn't help but crack a smile. The 78-year-old thought he had seen it all.
Of course, he has seen a lot. Pitt's play-by-play radio broadcaster has called Panther football games since 1974 - his voice describing more than 500 games, 27 bowls and a national title.
The broadcaster's career isn't ending anytime soon. That's not where this story is going. Hillgrove said he'll keep calling games "as long as it's fun." "Why would I not?" he asked. "I'm like a golf pro. What do I retire to?"
However, a chapter of Hillgrove's life is coming to a close: He has accepted that next Saturday's Pitt-Penn State game will likely be his last from the booth.
The 100th meeting between Pitt and Penn State is the schools' final matchup for the foreseeable future. After a 16-year hiatus, a brief four-game renewal served as a reminder of one of college football's historic rivalries. But beyond 2019, there's no return in sight. Pitt athletic director Heather Lyke has expressed interest in continuing the series. But Penn State, as of athletic director Sandy Barbour's comments in 2016, can't make it work schedule-wise until at least 2030.
Hillgrove, frankly, isn't even optimistic it'll be that soon. The longtime Pitt figure believes it would take a drastic change in conference alignment to reunite Pitt and Penn State on the field.
"In my opinion - in your lifetime, not mine - there will be one more earthquake in the NCAA landscape," Hillgrove said. "Notre Dame will get caught up in it, and I'm hoping Pitt, Penn State and West Virginia all end up in the same geographic conference or division. I think that's going to happen."
Hillgrove, after suggesting significant alterations to Power 5 football (or Power 4 football?), took a bite of his macaroni and cheese and sat in silence. He let the idea float around the bar for a minute or two as The Beatles' "Come Together" played over the speakers, irony at an all-time high.
"I don't know what's going to create it," Hillgrove later admitted. "But a fault, in terms of earthquakes, would be the Big 12. They're the most strung out geographically, and from a power position, they're the weakest of the others. If they came apart and went to other conferences, you can see that earthquake happening."
As it stands, college football's major conferences are stable. So are their TV contracts.
The ACC and ESPN - which recently launched the ACC Network - agreed to a 20-year rights extension in 2016. The same year, the Big Ten signed a six-year deal with ESPN and Fox. The Big 12 cut a deal with ESPN (and, by extension, ESPN+) in April. You get the idea. "Conference shifts and people moving have been happening since the dawn of time. That's nothing new," Texas AD Chris Del Conte told the Sports Business Journal in December. "But right now, it's very calm. I don't see any movement right now."
Maybe that changes in the distant future. Or as Hillgrove put it, in a younger person's lifetime. Perhaps, someday, Joe Paterno's old plan for an eastern conference catches a second wind.
It's well-known that in 1981, Paterno - then serving as Penn State's athletic director, as well as its head football coach - pitched a conference for East Coast programs. It would have included Pitt, West Virginia, Syracuse, Boston College, Rutgers, Temple and Maryland, at least. But the league never came to be. Pitt basketball joined Syracuse and Boston College in the Big East in '82, and the conference started football in '91, adding West Virginia, Temple and Rutgers to the picture.
Paterno's dream disintegrated. But linking up with those schools wasn't out of the question. Former Big East commissioner Mike Tranghese told The New York Times in 2009 that the Big East had an opportunity to bring Nittany Lion basketball into the fold in '82, back when founder Dave Gavitt still ran the league. "Dave wanted to go to Penn State and extend the invitation," Tranghese said. "But he couldn't if we didn't have the votes. And we had eight teams and needed six votes and it was a 5-3 vote."
Hillgrove said he heard Paterno was interested years ago.
"From Dave Gavitt's mouth to my ears, not once but twice: Joe Paterno tried to get into the Big East. Twice. And twice he was turned down because he didn't bring a basketball market with him," Hillgrove said, wagging his finger. "Paterno likes everyone to think that Pitt scuttled the eastern conference plans, but that wasn't the case."
If Penn State basketball was welcomed into the Big East, Tranghese said, Penn State, Pitt, Boston College and Syracuse football "probably would have agreed to play and continue as independents." If that happens, does Pitt-Penn State take a crippling break from 2001 through 2015? Does the rivalry continue past 2019? Who knows?
What's for certain is, Hillgrove will remember Pitt-Penn State for what it was. He'll remember the Panthers' heartbreaking loss in '75, a 7-6 defeat due to a blocked extra point and three missed field goals. He'll remember Pitt's 24-7 win in '76, when Johnny Majors' side "arrived as a major power" and later won the national title.
Hillgrove will enjoy Pitt-Penn State while he has it, believing he won't have it for much longer.
"It's like someone stole Mother's Day," Hillgrove said of the series' hiatus and dreary future. "It used to be the best rivalry, the highest-rated rivalry. ABC loved it. End of the year, bragging rights for the whole offseason. ... I look forward to get up

Texto completo: Do you want affordable housing? If you’re young and can’t quite afford a house, you'll probably say, “Heck yes!”
But if you already own your dream home, you'll more likely say, “OK, just not near me. ”
These opposing attitudes are among the top national problems troubling our housing market.
Lower-income, first-time buyers clamor for the construction of affordable homes. But most existing homeowners want their homes to rise in value. They lobby their communities against construction, becoming NIMBY (Not in My Backyard) neighbors.
City councils usually cave to NIMBY demands, blocking development, particularly at the lower-cost end — jacking up home prices. Homeowners love it. Would-be, low-end buyers seethe. So do property owners seeking to sell to real estate developers.
Politicians’ main desire is re-election. Their voter and campaign funder base? Homeowners. So they mostly side with NIMBYs, making it tough for teachers, police officers, nurses and other service workers to buy in the communities they serve. In California, things are so bad that state legislators tried limiting local councils’ avenues to block construction. Approvals have finally started trickling in. But so have opponents’ lawsuits.
The frustrating truth: Affordable housing and appreciating home values are in natural opposition. So don’t wait for politicians to deliver the impossible. Whether you own or are hunting, weigh these steps now.
Recession sign? Workers are putting in fewer hours. Is that a sign a recession is coming?
What's covered after a storm: Tornadoes, hurricanes and earthquakes: What does home insurance cover after a disaster?
Aiming to buy?
Calculate what you can afford. Start by determining a monthly payment that easily fits your budget. Mortgage lenders will reverse calculate this into a targeted home price range. NerdWallet’s online tool can guide you here. Don’t stretch like so many did in 2005, speculating they’d sell at a profit in a few years. Housing isn’t a short-term play. Besides, while I anticipate stocks and the economy doing well for the next few years, when they eventually tank, home prices will almost surely follow.
Remember: Location is key
Ignore today’s trendy neighborhoods. Instead, envision neighborhoods owners will increasingly covet in decades ahead. Prefer up-and-coming neighborhoods to posh, established ones. Choose those with natural or legal barriers to development. That restricted supply will help your home's value.
If you already own in an ultra-posh neighborhood, consider selling to rebuy in an up-and-coming region millennials will crave when they’re middle-aged and paunchy. Also, refinance, especially if your rate is adjustable. Current 30-year rates average around 3. 55% — which is near record lows. Figure how much you can save by locking in these low rates using tools like BankRate’s. Then shop for the best mortgage deal.
Ignore outdated thinking
Ignore the many conventional, wise-sounding but wrong voices of yesteryear still arguing you should send in extra payments to pay down your mortgage faster. If your house’s long-term appreciation rate won’t be faster than today’s ultra-low and income tax-subsidized rates—you shouldn’t be buying it or owning it in the first place. If you should generate extra cash, plug it into liquid savings, like stocks and bonds.
Lack of liquidity ultimately causes more financial loss and mortgage default dilemmas than carrying a mortgage slightly longer.

Texto completo: There's a storm brewing in Cambridge, Mass., over substantial donations from the felon Jeffrey Epstein, who died in a jail cell last month as he faced federal charges for sex trafficking of minors in Florida and New York.
Epstein gave MIT's Media Lab half a million dollars - and he gave the lab's director, Joi Ito, more than twice that: $1.2 million for Ito's own investment funds.
Ito took the money years after Epstein became a felon in 2008 for soliciting prostitution from a minor.
And he socialized with Epstein, visiting him at his Caribbean home and elsewhere. Ito has apologized profusely in recent days. And so has MIT President Rafael Reif.
But that's not nearly enough. MIT should send a strong message by showing Ito the door of the Media Lab, which specializes in technology with a social-justice bent and prides itself on exploring ethical questions.
The ethics here are - or should be - clear-cut.
"Universities should know better than to be drive-through reputational laundromats," said journalist and author Anand Giridharadas, who has been associated with the Media Lab but decided to step away from an advisory role this week in protest of how the situation is being handled.
Ito was penitent in a meeting this week meant to air grievances and begin to heal disagreements, according to a New York Times report. He said "that he had visited Mr. Epstein's Caribbean island twice to raise money, which he has pledged to return or donate to causes that support sex-trafficking victims. He also acknowledged that he had 'screwed up' by accepting the money, but that he had done so after a review by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and consultation with advisers."
These measures don't acknowledge the scope of what happened, Giridharadas, author of "Winners Take All: The Elite Charade of Changing the World" told me by phone.
"Joi not only pursued Epstein's money and this kind of cash-for-redemption trade, but then personally benefited from MIT's misbegotten relationship," he said. "Even the corruption has corruption."
While it may seem an obscure subject to those outside the East Coast academic and media spheres, the Media Lab episode raises broad questions about how worthy institutions - museums, schools and think tanks, to name a few - raise money.
The names Koch and Sackler might come to mind.
A Washington Post article this week explored Epstein's philanthropic donations, including $6.5 million to Harvard made before his 2008 conviction, and the larger questions that arise in philanthropic gifts: "The financier's donations supported important research and helped scientists work toward discoveries, but they also provided a veneer of credibility to a convicted sex offender."
There are plenty of gray areas and ethical quandaries in this realm.
But Ito's continuing to direct the Media Lab shouldn't be one of them.
Consider the words of Arwa Mboya, a graduate student in the Media Lab, writing last month in the Tech, where she urged Ito to step down.
Describing herself as a young black woman from Kenya who is "on a very low rung" of the power ladder, she made a strong case that "minimally positive behavior" - apologies and returning money - is not enough.
"Why are we so ready to forgive and accept an apology that does not take true responsibility for the role played in the harm of these young women? Why is there no accountability for men with power? Why should I be concerned about Ito keeping his job when he was not concerned about the people that Epstein was hurting?"
MIT has not moved to distance itself from Ito. Nor, so far, have the powerful boards on which Ito serves, including the New York Times, the Knight Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation.
The university is investigating what happened, but Provost Martin Schmidt has described that effort, according to the Times, as an attempt to "identify lessons for the future" rather than "an investigation of any particular individual."
That sounds toothless - and far too typical of the "we'll look into it" school of dealing with offenses by the powerful against the powerless, as the #MeToo movement has taught us. (The Media Lab, strange to say, identified several leaders of the movement as the winners of its 2018 Disobedience Award.)
Ito calls himself an ethicist as well as a tech entrepreneur.
If so, he ought to be able to reason through this situation and realize that taking more than a million dollars from a known sexual predator should disqualify him from continuing to lead the organization, which benefited from the money. Especially when his own private ventures benefited even more.
If Ito can't figure that out, MIT ought to do it for him.

Texto completo: The world according to Jim (aka the ultimate Twitter thread, with everything in 280 characters or less):
• Going into Friday, the Dodgers had slugged an NL-record 250 home runs. The jewelers sponsoring the radio broadcasts give out a free bracelet for each homer. Have they run out of precious metals yet?
• So, when will they install the Dodger Stadium humidor?
• Sad to report that the Giants make their final visit to The Ravine this weekend and Madison Bumgarner isn’t scheduled to pitch. Like him or dislike him, the electricity when he faces the Dodgers is always fun.
• Then again, his favorite foils aren’t there. Max Muncy is hurt and Yasiel Puig is in Cleveland. But trust me: He’d find somebody else to annoy, or more accurately be annoyed by.
• It’s also the final visit to L.A. for Bruce Bochy as Giants manager. He may represent the enemy, Dodger fans, but he deserves your respect as the last of a managerial breed.
• There was angst here in 2017 when the Dodgers lost 11 straight and 16 of 17 and had their division lead shrink from 21 games to 9 in early September. Yet they reached Game 7 of the World Series. Are Dodger fans even more touchy now, fearful of more postseason doom?
• The boos Kenley Jansen hears from the home crowd every time he gives up a hit or walk should be a clue.
• But here’s another reminder: Every fan base in baseball hates its bullpen. (As this week’s Exhibit A, I give you the Mets.)
• Before Dave Roberts opted to skip Hyun-Jin Ryu’s turn next week, I suggested Ryu should come down with another convenient neck inflammation, the Dodgers’ all purpose injured list malady. His fatigue was that evident.
• Come to think of it, isn’t Kenley’s neck a little sore, too? (You know, whiplash from watching the ball fly over the fence.)
• Suggested reading, if you haven’t gotten to it already: “K: A History of Baseball in Ten Pitches,” by New York Times national baseball writer Tyler Kepner (who was, incidentally, a former Angels beat writer for The Press-Enterprise way back in the day).
• And a tip: When reading it, have a baseball nearby so you can fiddle with the grips he describes.
• Last week’s close USC victory over Fresno State shouldn’t have been that much of a surprise. Fresno State under Jeff Tedford is one of those Group of Five teams that deserves more recognition than it gets.
• They are the kind of program, in other words, that I’ve ranked above name schools as an AP Top 25 voter. (Which is part of why I’m no longer an AP Top 25 voter. I got tired of the weekly whining from fans of Power Five conference schools.)
• But this week it’s serious for the Trojans, and against Stanford we will discover a whole lot more about freshman Kedon Slovis. (It may be a little bit fairer fight with the Cardinal’s KJ Costello out, though replacement Davis Mills is a 20-year-old junior.)
• What was worse last week? The USC students with chests painted to spell “Fight On,” only the “G” was missing when the cameras found them? Or ESPN’s Rod Gilmore using the telestrator to illustrate where the “G” was supposed to go and botching it?
• FIHGT ON, indeed.
• UCLA has enough trouble selling football tickets. I’m not sure it helped that Saturday’s opponent at the Rose Bowl, San Diego State, beat Weber State 6-0 last week. Large multitudes may have decided to skip this one.
• Crowd counts aren’t always an accurate reflection, since college football attendance is down almost everywhere (even the SEC). But with UCLA, a continued lag in wins and customers might call the whole Chip Kelly Experiment into question.
• It was apparent all summer that Melvin Gordon had no leverage in his quest for a contract extension with the Chargers. Does he realize yet he’s tangling with the wrong organization when it comes to stubbornness?
• This, from the Rams’ Eric Weddle the other day about the Jared Goff extension: “It sets the standard that if you do things right on and off the field and you play at a high level, they’re gonna reward you.”
• He didn’t specifically reference Dean Spanos. But to anyone who remembers the events leading to Weddle leaving the Chargers after the 2015 season, the linkage was obvious.
• Remember when Southern California had its own wing of the Broadcasting Hall of Fame? Vin Scully, Chick Hearn, Dick Enberg and Bob Miller were quite a Mt. Rushmore, and Ralph Lawler made it a starting five.
• We could have four from the next generation, too: Joe Davis (Dodgers TV), Alex Faust (Kings TV), J.B. Long (Rams radio) and Brian Sieman (Clippers TV). (Sieman, the Clippers’ radio voice since ’07, would be the elder statesman of the group.)
• Davis and Orel Hershiser are really fun to listen to – but when Orel says “we,” “our,” and “us,” This Space cringes. Even on a (limited distribution) team-controlled channel, homer broadcasts just don’t go over well in the nation’s No. 2 market.
• Bottom line: What would Vin do?
• If you missed it, and you probably did, the Sparks clinched the third seed and a first-round playoff bye Thursday night. There are a lot of things with the WNBA that need fixing, but the quality of basketball absolutely is not one of them.

Margaret Atwood is not who you want her to be

Texto completo: Margaret Atwood never meant for this to happen, but she doesn’t mind that The Handmaid’s Tale has become a symbol of political protest.
Abortion activists have donned the characters' red dresses and white bonnets at every feminist gathering from the Women’s March to protests of anti-abortion legislation, and some readers take the dystopian story so seriously, in fact, that billionaire makeup mogul Kylie Jenner got harassed online for throwing a “tone deaf” Handmaid’s Tale-themed birthday party when “women’s rights and autonomy are particularly under attack.”
Atwood is well aware that her 1985 novel, now a popular TV show, means more to a lot of people than she ever intended it to. “I think using the handmaids’ costume as a protest mechanism is brilliant. You can’t be thrown out, you’re not making a disturbance, and you’re not saying anything, but you’re very visible and everybody knows what you mean. So it has been a brilliant tactic,” she told the New York Times. As for whether she’s had any influence in the rise of red-and-white clothed protesters across America, she admits, “I have no control over it.”
Atwood may think the use of her book to champion current feminist causes is “brilliant,” but she doesn't quite see the parallels her readers have drawn from the book to 2019. In her writing, she's not critiquing modern America, but much of human history:
“And all of the things that are now such topics of conversation and such topics of agony, they were all being talked about [in 1985]. The rise of white supremacy, that layer has never gone away, it’s always been there, but somebody opened a door. Religious cults subordinating women was being talked about. Baby stealing is an age-old human motif. Forcing women to have babies, it happens in the Trojan War, for heaven’s sake.”
Her bestselling novel is dystopian, but it is not, as many would argue, specifically prescient for our times. Neither, for that matter, is 1984.
Atwood has just finished a sequel to The Handmaid’s Tale, which comes out Sept. 10. The Testaments has already been named to the Booker Prize shortlist, and as much as readers may like it to a book about President Trump, it’s not.
When the New York Times’ Alexandra Alter asked if Atwood wrote the book to address the new parallels of “the erosion of reproductive rights,” etc., Atwood responded: “No, no. It’s always bubbling away in any country. White supremacists are there and then they come out when conditions are favorable, as they are in the United States right now.”
She’s not quite the feminist some would want her to be either. She won’t adopt the term without first clarifying, “So what kind am I? Because I’m interested in fairness, I’m of an egalitarian kind, in which equal means equal, it doesn’t mean superior. So you don’t get extra points.”
Readers will continue to draw their own conclusions about her work, perhaps without realizing that its totalitarian state, Gilead, critiques not mainstream Christianity, but religious fundamentalism. For her part, though, Atwood takes the proper role of an author: She’ll let readers draw their own conclusions. “I don’t want to be too specific,” she said, “because you’re just dictating to the reader, and I would rather let them do their own thinking.”

Searching for Romance, 30 People Lost Millions

Texto completo: It often started with a hope for love, then quickly turned into a promise of gold. In one tragic case, it ended in death.
A woman had struck up a romance on a dating website with a man who said he was a United States soldier stationed overseas. He claimed to have more than $ 12 million worth of gold from Syria but needed help bringing it to the United States, so she sent him $ 93,000.
He sent back a photograph of an Israeli diplomat she was supposed to meet at the Baltimore airport who was going to bring her "two trunks with 'family treasure'," according to a criminal complaint. But he never showed up. The next day, she killed herself.
The United States attorney for New Jersey has said that the woman's death was part of a complex and brazen fraud that swindled more than 30 people out of about $ 2.1 million.
The scheme, officials said, was run by two people in New Jersey and their associates in Ghana. It usually involved someone posing as an American service member on a dating website and "wooing" a target "with words of love," according to the complaint.
While internet frauds have persisted for years, the breadth of the swindle stands out, as well as the fact that it led to arrests.
On Wednesday, the F.B.I. arrested one New Jersey man, Rubbin Sarpong, for conspiracy to commit wire fraud. If convicted, he could face up to 20 years in prison and $ 250,000 in fines. A lawyer for Mr. Sarpong did not respond to a message seeking comment.
The case also comes amid growing scrutiny of the proliferation of this type of fraud and struggles by tech companies and the military to stop them.
The New York Times reported in July that similar swindles were rampant on Facebook, Instagram and other platforms. Hundreds of profiles were found that impersonated military service members and veterans, including the nation's top generals.
Following The Times's reporting, Representative Adam Kinzinger said he was considering legislation to force Facebook and other companies to do more to prevent such frauds. The congressman, who is also in the Air National Guard, said scammers have used his likeness for years to defraud people online.
On Thursday, Mr. Kinzinger, an Illinois Republican, criticized Facebook for its announcement that users in the United States could now create dating profiles on its platform. Facebook said the service, Facebook Dating, was already available in 19 countries -- including Brazil, Canada and Vietnam -- and it was aiming for a European release next year.
"Rather than compound this issue with a dating platform, Facebook should focus its attention and resources on putting a stop to the scams and fake accounts," he said in a statement.
Facebook, which owns Instagram, has said it requires people to use their real identities on its sites, though it does not require proof. To eliminate impostor accounts, the company has said it invested in more human reviewers and new software to automatically spot fakes. Facebook has said it blocked billions of fake accounts over the past year, though its estimate for the number of active fakes has continued to increase to roughly 120 million.
A Facebook spokeswoman did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Thursday.
Mr. Sarpong's arrest this week comes on the heels of a separate case last month in which federal authorities charged 80 people, accusing them of involvement in a Nigerian crime ring that stole at least $ 6 million via email, romance and other internet swindles. Fourteen people were arrested in the United States, but scores of other suspects are not in the country.
The two recent cases are unusual because scammers are often able to stay out of reach of American law enforcement since they are based abroad, often in West Africa, said Patrick Peterson, chief executive of Agari, a cybersecurity firm that tracks internet fraud.
"What makes this very unique," he said, "is Mr. Sarpong lives in New Jersey, and his co-conspirators are still safe and sound in Ghana, with hundreds of thousands of dollars in proceeds."
Mr. Peterson said the two cases suggested that American authorities were trying to do more to combat such romance frauds, which data shows are increasing. The F.B.I. said it received nearly 18,500 complaints from victims of romance or similar internet frauds last year, with reported losses exceeding $ 362 million, up 71 percent from 2017.
Law enforcement is "starting to crack the code on how to do this repeatedly and at scale, and they're trying to invest more because the losses are so high," Mr. Peterson said.
In New Jersey, the fake relationships moved fast and did not last long. Many had similar themes: an introduction through a dating website; a soldier overseas; gold bars worth millions; and a few pesky bills to be paid before both the suitor, and treasure, could materialize.
The fraud started in January 2016, officials said. That's when a woman said she began talking with a man claiming to be a petty officer in the United States Navy, stationed in Canada. He asked the woman to send him $ 3,000. She later told authorities she wound up losing about $ 50,000.
In November 2016, another victim was contacted. Over the course of four months, this person sent nearly $ 200,000 to a man who said he was in the military and needed help getting "approximately $ 10 million dollars in gold bars and cash out of Syria," according to the complaint. The impostor spoke to the victim through the dating website Plenty of Fish, and Google Hangouts.
In October 2017, another victim was contacted by two people. One claimed to be an American soldier in Syria, the other claimed he was a diplomat helping the soldier "in getting gold to the United States," according to the complaint. By December, this person started to send money, ultimately providing about $ 144,000.
Most of the swindles featured impostors posing as soldiers. Some did not. For example, in February, one victim was contacted by a person who said she was living in Florida and awaiting "a large inheritance, mostly in gold, from her father's estate," the complaint said.
To get the inheritance, the victim was asked to give money to a second person, a lawyer in Ghana, in order to pay "court costs, airway bills, document fees, export fees and taxes," according to the complaint. Between April and June, the victim paid more than $ 300,000, officials said.
Of the $ 2.1 million obtained, about 40 percent went to Mr. Sarpong, officials said. While Mr. Sarpong hid behind a parade a fake online personas that took in millions, officials said, he also boasted about his finances on Instagram, under his own name.
Officials said Mr. Sarpong used social media "to communicate about the conspiracy and its proceeds." Some pictures on Instagram that were highlighted by officials show Mr. Sarpong with large stacks of dollar bills. Many included the hashtag #RichLifeStyle.

Texto completo: The orphan wasn't even a week old. Its eyes were still closed, its ears still curled, but the tiny black-and-white kitten leaned in eagerly as Samantha Jackson carefully filled a small syringe with formula and offered it up. Immediately, it started to drink from the makeshift bottle, lifting first one paw, then the other, kneading the air, as Jackson gently petted its back.
"Good job, buddy," she said softly.
Its eyes would open soon, Jackson explained. "It's just the cutest thing when they open them and look at you like 'Oh, that's what you look like!' " she said.
Thank goodness for that cuteness, because fostering a neonatal kitten is demanding.
In addition to feedings as frequent as every two hours, around the clock, the fragile kittens must be kept warm (because they can't yet regulate their body temperature) and carefully monitored for illness. They also need to be stimulated with a baby wipe to go potty.
But Jackson, who works full-time from home as a medical coder, doesn't foster just one kitten at a time. That day, she was also caring for 19 more, which had taken over the dining room table and kitchen of her Maple Grove house, giving her a constant rotation of mewling mouths to feed.
Jackson is a volunteer with Bitty Kitty Brigade, a new Twin Cities rescue group for the tiniest, most vulnerable orphaned kittens -- those up to five weeks old that have become separated from their mothers.
The nonprofit was founded by two Minnesota women this spring to fill a gap in the local animal shelter and rescue community. Since March, it has fostered more than 130 nursing kittens.
"This isn't an easy gig, but it's a pretty great one," said Bitty Kitty Brigade co-founder Mandy Dwyer. "They wouldn't be alive without the
work that we do, so it's incredible to be able to witness them growing, thriving, toddling around, snuggling, learning to play and being adopted into loving homes."
Most rescues and shelters aren't equipped to give orphaned kittens the intensive care they need. That's why home foster care is vital.
In many places, such tiny kittens end up being euthanized. That's not the practice at the Animal Humane Society's four metro-area locations, said Mary Tan, the society's public relations manager. But Tan said the Humane Society is thrilled to be able to partner with the brigade instead of scrambling to find someone to take in such vulnerable animals.
"You need special people who can be home with these tiny kittens," said Tan. "And we have bottle-baby fosters, but I tell you, they're difficult to find," said Tan.
The local Humane Society now refers people who find orphaned kittens to Bitty Kitty Brigade and alerts the brigade about kittens at the Humane Society that need intensive care. Local vets, animal control centers and other rescue groups also send kittens to the brigade.
Bitty Kitty Brigade is part of an expanding national network of rescue initiatives that have appeared in the past decade -- from the Bottle Baby Nursery Program at Texas' Austin Pets Alive to the Best Friends Kitten Nursery in Salt Lake City.
Fueled in part by heart-melting photos of kitties on social media, in-home, volunteer fostering of neonatal cats is growing rapidly. And kitten crusaders like Hannah Shaw (aka Kitten Lady) have become social media stars. (Her recently released how-to book, "Tiny But Mighty: Kitten Lady's Guide to Saving the Most Vulnerable Felines," also landed on the New York Times bestseller list.)
Caring for the neediest
The dining table in Jackson's spacious house is covered with a row of clear storage bins, cozy fabric-covered heating pads inside. The bins function as warm, safe crates for the tiny animals. (Jackson and her husband eat while sitting on the couch.)
On the floor nearby, she created enclosures for a half-dozen more kittens, which are a few weeks older and getting ready to eat "meatshakes," a combination of formula and kitten food.
She's turned her entire mudroom into a play zone for her little fosters, outfitted with towers, tunnels and even a tiny tepee to hide in. Jackson, who volunteers as Bitty Kitty's medical coordinator, has two dogs but no cats, aside from the steady stream of rescue kittens she fosters until they're adopted.
Not everyone who fosters for Bitty Kitty has so much space to devote to the cause. Brigade co-founder Joan Barrett, a software architect, said she's able to take in several baby felines at one time despite the size of her tiny Minneapolis kitchen -- and her four pet cats.
Both Dwyer and Barrett had been volunteering with other rescue groups, and knew how much work it was to foster "bottle baby" kittens before forming the Bitty Kitty Brigade. What they didn't know is that so many other people in the Twin Cities would be up for the challenge.
"For our first year, I kind of assumed we'd do, like, 12 kittens, and it would be the three of us," Dwyer said, indicating herself, Barrett and Jackson.
Instead, they've quickly built a network of more than 60 foster volunteers, whom they train to feed and care for the kittens. They also regularly help people who find kittens to determine if they've been orphaned or if the mama cat is just out hunting. (Keeping kittens with their mother offers the best chance for survival.)
The basic cost for raising a single kitten until they are 12 weeks old is $350. The brigade offsets some of those costs by charging $225 for each adoption. Donations and grants fund the rest.
Some volunteers, like Jackson, take in kittens when they are at their neediest. Others foster older, weaned kittens that don't need as much care.
But Dwyer is still amazed by the number of volunteers who are willing to put in the extra effort required by the smallest of kittens.
"We had so much more interest from bottle feeders than I ever expected, which is awesome," she said.
One perk: Bottle-feeding fosters get to name their foster kittens.
Rescue heartbreak and joy
The women of the Bitty Kitty Brigade say they hope to open and staff a 24-hour kitten nursery, like the one that Shaw, the nationally known "Kitten Lady," runs out of her San Diego home. Shaw regularly shares photos of her tiny wards on her Instagram account, which has garnered nearly 1 million followers.
Dwyer has discovered that sharing photos of impossibly adorable kittens on social media helps drive volunteering, fostering and adoptions for needy animals. A professional photographer, she often snaps glamour shots of the kittens in the brigade's care, posting them to Instagram or Facebook.
Brigade members also share videos about their latest fosters, documenting the difference that time and TLC can make for tiny cats.
Sometimes, though, the stories don't have a happy ending.
In July, Jackson first posted Facebook videos about an orange Manx kitten named Max, which had been very sickly but was recovering. As July turned into August, however, its progress stalled and the kitten worsened and died.
Dwyer said the loss of one of these fragile kittens only strengthens the resolve of brigade members. They take heart that 89% of their tiny charges have beaten the odds and survived.
"We are comforted in knowing that these kittens were given every possible chance. What ultimately carries us through, though, is all the kittens that do make it," Dwyer said. "We're basically growing them from scratch."

Texto completo: Plenty of drug company executives have drawn fire for their high salaries or the cost of their medicines.
Praveen Tipirneni, CEO of Waltham-based Morphic Therapeutic, is taking flack for a cartoon he drew about the biotech industry that bears a striking resemblance to one published in The New Yorker magazine in 1986.
A Globe story last Thursday focused on Tipirneni's recent hobby of drawing whimsical cartoons that poke fun of the often abstruse world of biotechnology. One cartoon, published alongside the story, depicted an executive standing next to a scientist in front of a whiteboard. The executive, with arms crossed, scrutinized chemical formulas scrawled on the board.
“Close enough," he tells the scientist. “From here on in, it's who you know."
Howard Scott, a freelance writer in Pembroke and longtime subscriber to The New Yorker and the Globe, said he saw the cartoon at breakfast and thought it bore an uncanny resemblance to an old New Yorker cartoon. He has dozens displayed on the walls of his home office.
“I looked at the picture and I said, 'My God, I know that cartoon,' " Scott, 75, said. “I went to my office three steps away."
There, on his wall, was the one he had in mind. It was drawn by Eldon Dedini and depicted two men standing in almost the identical position in front a blackboard covered with mathematical equations.
“This is fine as far as it goes," one man, with his arms crossed, told the other. “From here on, it's who you know."
Scott included both cartoons in a letter to the Globe and wrote, “What is the line of cartoon plagiarism? Did Tipirneni cheat?"
Tipirneni said Wednesday that he didn't deliberately copy The New Yorker cartoon. But, he said, “I've been looking at cartoons all my life, and I think that one did stick in my mind. The resemblance is very striking there, so it must have."
Dedini drew 630 cartoons for The New Yorker and about 1,200 cartoons for Playboy before he died in 2006 at age 84, according to a New York Times obituary. The one he drew of the men in front of the blackboard is sold online and emblazoned on many products, from coffee mugs to tote bags.
A spokeswoman for The New Yorker declined to comment.
Tipirneni, who has a bachelor's degree from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, a medical degree from McGill University in Montreal, and an MBA from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, said he began drawing cartoons about a year ago.
He tweets them to people in the industry, features them in company presentations, and published several in a booklet for donors to the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle. But he said he doesn't make money off them and this was the first time anyone had raised questions about their provenance.
“I'm a little embarrassed about the whole thing," said Tipirneni, whose firm is working on treatments for fibrotic diseases and other disorders. “We're kind of trying to be seen as a serious science company."
Still, fans of his cartoons include some powerful people in biotech, such as Philip Ross, vice chairman of J.P. Morgan's health care investment banking division. Ross was quoted in the Globe article saying another cartoon Tipirneni drew was “almost like The New Yorker of biotech."
Now Tipirneni said he plans to be more careful when he draws cartoons.
“I guess it has to be a little less spontaneous," he said. “Clearly, I need to spend a little more time."

Unleashing the (Digital) Artist Within

Texto completo: "Any one who can learn to write, can learn to draw," John Gadsby Chapman wrote in his 19th-century instruction manual, "The American Drawing-Book." This can-do sentiment dates back to an era when lead pencils and chalky pastels were standard. Today's artists -- and wannabe artists -- also have the option of easy-to-use digital gadgets.
If you mainly doodle, your device's notes app may suffice. But if you're serious about sketching in pixels as a way to relax, to focus and to express your creativity, a responsive art app with a suite of precision tools is a more fulfilling choice. Here's how to get started, even if you don't know how to draw (yet).
Step 1: Select Your Stylus
If you want fine lines, you'll need to ditch your fingertip for a stylus. But not all styluses are the same. Nor are their prices. Inexpensive models use simple capacitive touch to interact with the screen, and pricier styluses have wireless connections and pressure-sensitive tips. Just make sure your choice works with your device.
If you want designed compatibility, Microsoft has its $ 100 Surface Pen for its Surface tablets, and Google's $ 99 Pixelbook Pen is made for its Pixelbook. Have an iPad? Wirecutter, a product review site owned by The New York Times, recommends the Apple Pencil; prices range from about $ 99 to $ 129, depending on the Pencil model.
If those options don't fit your budget, Wirecutter also likes the $ 10 Adonit Mark, which works with any touch screen. Adonit makes several stylus models in a range of prices, and the Friendly Swede sells a 4-in-1 Stylus for $ 25 on Amazon.
Step 2: Choose a Drawing App
Visit your app store and search for drawing programs. For the cost-conscious, Autodesk SketchBook is a versatile app that can take a project all the way from a basic line drawing to a finished illustration with color, textures and shadows. It's now free for individual use and runs on Android, iOS and Windows 10 touch-screen devices.
Adobe offers its free Adobe Photoshop Sketch, as well as Adobe Illustrator Draw (for vector-based art that can be resized without losing quality) for Android and iOS. And Procreate ( $ 5 for iPhone; $ 10 for iPad), is an extremely powerful and well-reviewed art app for iOS hardware.
Using Windows 10? Microsoft's Paint 3D (or classic Paint) offers basic drawing tools and a shape library for making art from stock objects.
Step 3: Dive In
Some drawing apps can feel overwhelming at first, especially if you're new to making digital art. Look for an integrated tutorial to point you to the pen, brush, shape and color tools tucked under the menu icons. Then just start freestyling with your stylus.
It may take a while to get the hang of the software, but be patient and allow yourself time to explore and experiment with your digital art supplies. (Need more help? Jump to Step 5.)
Step 4: Take Art Lessons
If you have the tools but fear you lack the talent, let technology be your teacher. Look for "drawing lessons" in the Education section of your app store to get you started with the fundamentals and build your fine motor skills.
ShadowDraw (free, with new lessons as in-app purchases) for the iPad and Apple Pencil is one program that teaches drawing forms by having you follow along the animated pen strokes of another artist in an updated take on the "copying the masters" approach.
Although it can be finicky, SketchAR is another inventive program with a collection of instructional aids; it's free with in-app purchases (for extra lessons and tools) and works on Android, iOS and Microsoft HoloLens. For drawing directly on the screen, SketchAR includes a library of animated lessons to follow. The app can also convert your photos into outlines that you trace with your stylus to train your hand and eye.
Step 5: Read the Friendly Manual
Feeling lost in a screen of cryptic menus and complex tools? Look for support-site guides that walk you though less-obvious tasks -- like varying the line weight of the pencil tool, working with image layers or adjusting the program's sensitivity to the stylus.
Autodesk Sketchbook's support page is full of tips. Adobe has an online Help Center and builds basic guides into its apps. Procreate has an extensive handbook available for download as a PDF or as an Apple iBook. The web is full of video tutorials for art apps and drawing instruction. And, if you really want to go old school, there's a downloadable digital copy of "The American Drawing-Book" in the Internet Archive.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Above left, drawing programs like Autodesk SketchBook offer a selection of pencil, pen, brush and color-picking tools. Styluses for touch-screens come in many styles and can cost from $ 10 to $ 130.

Tracking the People Behind the Disinformation

Texto completo: How do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? Matthew Rosenberg, who covers political disinformation and is based in Washington, discussed the tech he's using.
You're covering disinformation in politics ahead of the 2020 election. That's a busy beat, aided by the prevalence of social media.
Where to begin? That we live in a world that seems to be awash in disinformation? That no one seems to have a good answer for countering it? That Americans are being bombarded with warnings that foreigners -- the Russians! the Chinese! the Iranians! -- are coming to confuse us with all sorts of misleading nonsense?
On top of disinformation, the beat includes hacking and election security and political digital malfeasance in general -- yes, campaigns know a lot more about you than you think.
It's enough to make anyone feel paranoid. So I find it's helpful to take a deep breath and break it down.
Let's start with disinformation, which implies intent: Someone is trying to mislead when spreading it. Misinformation is simply information that's wrong, though the person spreading it may not realize that.
Neither is a new phenomenon. For as long as humans have been, well, human, we've been misleading one another, and politicians have typically been among the worst offenders. But now, of course, falsehoods spread at the speed of social media, and the internet makes it easy to take deception to the next level.
Russian trolls can pose as Black Lives Matter activists. Democrats can help elect one of their own by pretending to be conservatives. A Republican political operative can anonymously troll Democrats with fake campaign websites that seek to pit liberals against one another. And any event, no matter how small or insignificant, seems liable to produce its own community of truthers.
Covering it all is tricky. Writing about every little conspiracy theory and fake news story circulating in the dark corners of the web risks amplifying the nonsense. Better to focus on the people behind the disinformation. Technology can help find them. But once you know who they are, it is about old-fashioned reporting -- drawing them out and getting them to explain why they are in the disinformation game, their motivation, whom they are working with and who is paying the bills.
What tech tools do you use to discern or trace disinformation?
In all honesty, I rely on the expertise of others. There's a big community of researchers who have serious engineering chops and are building all kinds of helpful tools. They're finding bot networks, tracking online political advertising and flagging nearly identical social media posts by people who seem to have no apparent connection to one another.
Me? I once learned enough code to try building a Twitter bot. It didn't work.
Even the best, custom-built tools can get you only so far. The technology can help spot a particularly nasty conspiracy theory that is making its way from 4chan to Twitter, or uncover how the Trump campaign has posted more than 2,000 ads on Facebook about immigration that include the word "invasion." But once you find the disinformation, you need to dig into it.
The tools for that work are simple: You need a phone, and you need something to write with.
How do you protect the confidentiality of your sources and the security of your communications with them?
Before I got into the disinformation game, I covered national security in Washington and spent 15 years as a foreign correspondent in places where the government is really good at listening to your communications, like Pakistan. On those beats, a lack of security can get a source thrown in prison or killed.
Discretion is crucial. The first rule of source protection is Do Not Talk About Your Sources. It is also the second rule.
Meeting sources in person is always best. But since it is often not feasible, there are tools to mitigate the risks. Apps for encrypted calls and messaging are essential. I rely on Signal, as do most of my sources. For encrypted emails, Protonmail is popular. Strong passwords are a must, too, and I use a password manager to store all those long strings of letters, numbers and symbols. It also helps to turn off location tracking on your phone, and to not use ride-hailing services like Uber when going to meet sources.
Then there are burner phones. They're useful, and you get to sneak around like a secret agent when you're buying one. To make sure it cannot be traced, you need to pay in cash, never register it with your own name or real email and never connect it to your home or work Wi-Fi network. I have two at the moment. One is a cheap smartphone, and the other is a flip phone.
What other tech do you find useful for your job?
CrowdTangle is incredibly useful for tracking how information spreads on social media. SimilarWeb is great for web analytics. DomainTools is essential for online forensics. LexisNexis is crucial for finding phone numbers and home addresses.
If I had to pick one account to keep, it would be my professional account on LinkedIn. The network is invaluable when you are looking to track down people inside a specific organization or industry. And it is amazing how people will sometimes use their LinkedIn pages to describe in detail specific projects they worked on, including highly classified government programs. There's no single better place online to ferret out sources.
You broke the Cambridge Analytica story last year. Have you modified your own social media use since?
I've definitely had my paranoid moments. After the Cambridge story broke, when Facebook's stock price was in free fall, I got to thinking about how Facebook had 11 years' worth of my private messages, photos and posts. I panicked and started deleting things. It took about an hour for me to chill out and realize that if I wasn't going to delete my whole profile, a couple of half measures were not going to make a difference.
I've since found that keeping the profile was more useful than not. I still have old friends messaging me there, and I need it for reporting. Facebook is simply too good at connecting people. It's why it makes so much money off our data.
I have cut back on social media, though not because of the Cambridge story or other reporting on big tech companies. Some of my reasons were not particularly unique: I found it less and less satisfying, and I began to worry about the immense amount of time I was wasting. If you think Instagram is a time suck, wait until you're the oldest person on TikTok.
But the real tipping point was when I found myself having to explain what a conspiracy theory was to my son and daughter after they mentioned something they had heard on YouTube. They were 11 and 8 at the time. At that age, I had no idea what a conspiracy theory was, because I had no reason to know. It was time, I realized, to start setting a better example.
Outside of work, what tech do you love and why?
I just spent an obscene amount of money on Sonos speakers. They were my birthday gift to myself. The app is not great -- why, Sonos, cannot I not just play music straight from Spotify or Apple Music? But the speakers sound great. My neighbors may not feel the same way.
I spend a lot of time outdoors, and I love my Leatherman -- the needle-nose pliers alone are worth their weight in gold when you need them. I've had it for 25 years (gulp), and it has the smooth action of a well-worn tool.
I cook a lot as well, and I own the mother of all rice cookers. It has lots of settings that I never use and tells me what is happening as the rice cooks, in a woman's voice that speaks Korean.
Mostly, though, I have been trying to pare back my tech use. Cast iron and stainless steel rule in the kitchen, and I write down recipes in an old black-and-white composition book. When I go out, I've gone back to my old habit of grabbing a magazine or a book; better to read an interesting story than scroll through mediocre witticisms on Twitter.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Texto completo: Comedic actor and director Carl Reiner begins his day the same way lots of folks do.
“Every morning, I pick up my newspaper, get the obituary section and see if I’m listed. If I’m not, I have my breakfast.”
Reiner, 97, makes this observation in the 2017 HBO documentary “If You’re Not in the Obit, Eat Breakfast,” a survey of some of the world’s most vital nonagenarians, including Hollywood greats Dick Van Dyke and Betty White.
The director of such comedy classics as “Oh, God!” with George Burns and “The Jerk” with Steve Martin, Reiner will never have to worry about the contents of his obituary because his estimable career warrants the attention of the New York Times, which already has written Reiner’s obit, to be published quickly in the event of his untimely death.
But what about the rest of us? Who is going to chronicle the equally noble, though not widely notable, contributions and accomplishments of Joe and Jill Taxpayer?
LNP will.
Or at least we will publish your obituary. When it comes to writing the obit, you’re on your own.
That’s not entirely true. The obituary writing process tends to shake out something like this: You die unexpectedly (even for the aged and infirm, death is often unexpected), and the people who love you, while navigating their grief, try to pull together the details of your life as best they can without the benefit of having you around to consult. A well-meaning funeral home director runs your family through a basic template, assembling all of the vital statistics: time, place and manner of death, residence, age, birthplace, parents, siblings, children, occupation, church and social memberships, hobbies, an enumeration of survivors and, finally, funeral information.
That amalgam of functional, if too often lifeless, data points is sent to LNP, which prints it at a cost of $28.62 per column inch.
That’s not cheap, nor should it be. The cost reflects the gravity of the task, or rather the value of the opportunity: An obituary is the last chance (for some, the only chance) to make an indelible mark on the world. It is an opportunity to write history — your history — and store it in the public record.
If you are content with a flat reporting of your life’s deeds, then by all means let those who come after you choose the particulars of your life that they deem worth remembering. But if your life requires more than a two-dimensional accounting of facts, start crafting your obituary now.
To help in the task, we asked perhaps the world’s foremost expert on the subject, New York Times obituaries editor Bill McDonald, to give LNP readers a piece of advice on how to approach what can seem a daunting task for the uninitiated.
To flesh out a life, McDonald said, choose a fine brush.
“(At The New York Times), we try to give you the broad picture of somebody and why they are important, but also a little more of the minutia of a life, which I think humanizes people,” he said. “We try to stay away from the tributes — you know, ‘He was a wonderful father and brother.’ We understand that you’re going to get that from family in a death notice, but anyone will say that about a loved one. So you’re not telling anybody anything they don’t already know or couldn’t surmise. To me, you want to write a rich, detailed narrative, as much as you can.”
To get a sense of what McDonald means by “a rich, detailed narrative,” pick up a copy of Wednesday’s LNP or go to LancasterOnline to read the obituary of Margaret L. Newson, minister’s wife and quiet force of nature, who died July 24 at age 92.
Like many women of her generation, Newson was a homemaker, but history will remember her as so much more because someone took the time to explain what that often challenging role meant to her. “Her tidy and orderly house became a welcome haven for family, friends and parishioners,” her obituary reads. “She managed a daunting schedule of homework (for her four children), music lessons, newspaper routes, countless school and sports events, church activities and a husband who never had weekends off. She nursed the sick and paid the bills.”
When her children went off one by one to college, each “would receive a handwritten letter from her weekly, without fail, with $5 tucked inside.”
The obituary contains her personal philosophy — “Buck up. Do a little each day. Look at the improvements!” — and even a quote from her late husband of 66 years. The Presbyterian minister said of his lifelong love, “She’s strong as an oak yet gentle as a lamb. … She’s one of a kind, a very, very rare jewel.”
Newson’s obituary paints a picture of a three-dimensional human being. The incidentals, like the money-laced letters to her children at college, often say the most.
While Newson clearly benefited from a loved one with a keen sense of storytelling, most of us don’t have writers in the family. If you want your story told your way, you likely will have to shoulder some of the responsibility. (And in the age of social media, first-person obits are all the rage.)
So get out pencil and paper, folks, because it’s time for a writing exercise. Nothing too difficult. Just answer a few straightfoward questions.
------------
Ask yourself:
Who do you love?
What brings you joy?
What do you consider your greatest accomplishment?
What has been your greatest challenge in life?
Have you made a difference? If so, how and to whom?
What have you learned?
These questions have nothing and everything to do with specific life events. They address the initiative and intention that binds together the facts of a life. Answering them will help you choose the details that matter.
Now get busy. Be bold, be honest and choose your words carefully.

Texto completo: Next time you fly -- or take a long road or train trip -- with your children, consider stocking your carry-on with toys and games that will not only entertain them but maybe even teach them a little something. Here are a few suggestions, aimed mostly at younger children, but often fun for older ones and adults, too.
Pro tip: Whatever your go-to travel toys end up being, reserve them for trips so that they retain their special-occasion allure.
Melissa & Doug On the Go Water Wow! activity pad
These coloring pads' water-filled pens and reusable pages -- they turn bright hues when wet -- let preschoolers "paint" without mess on the plane or in the car.
Toca Nature app
In this learning app, children explore and shape an imaginary land, watching the flora and fauna change -- which helps them become more observant travelers, too.
RushHour board game
This analog game offers delightfully tough logic puzzles. Translation: It'll help keep your grade-schooler occupied through the inevitable real-life traffic jams and travel delays.
Boogie Board Scribble n' Play
An upgrade from the old Magna Doodle, this LCD drawing board is more colorful, more accurate, and easier to erase -- and just as self-contained and mess-free.
Sushi Go!
This quick-paced "pick and pass" card game is simple enough for children as young as 5 to master, but tricky enough for older players to enjoy.

What's Going On in the Amazon?

Texto completo: The emails started arriving last week.
"I've been waiting to hear about the fires in the Amazon," wrote Molly Krause, a listener in Aurora, Colo. "It's a huge problem that is not getting adequate attention. Can you please do an episode to shed light on what is going on?"
What began as a handful of requests became a kind of collective plea.
"I've been preoccupied with the fires ravaging the Amazon, and I can't help but sense they have gone underreported in the American media," wrote Mike Rusie from Wilmington, Del. "My father, for example, scoffed at the matter and implied that they weren't a big deal."
We, too, wanted to better understand the fires in the Amazon. Social media had portrayed them, in flashing red lights, as a singular global crisis. Times reporting had put them in deeper historical perspective. After assessing the gap between those two portrayals, we realized there was a chance to make an episode that would answer a simple question: What was really going on down there?
Producers Clare Toeniskoetter and Michael Simon Johnson began digging into the story with Ernesto Londoño, the Brazil bureau chief. What they found was that the modern history of the Amazon was one of constant tension -- between conservation and development; between international pressure to protect the rainforest and Brazilians who believe it's their resource to use as they please.
None of that began with this year's fires. And, as Ernesto explained, the scale of the fires was not entirely unique.
"What was different this year," he told us, "is you had all these alarming and widely shared posts on social media, some of which were using pictures that were many, many years old that weren't really an accurate reflection of what was happening on the ground."
But it turned out, of course, that there is a crisis. It's just not exactly the crisis many were reading about on Twitter and Facebook. It is a crisis of a decades-long battle over the Amazon as a source of oxygen versus a source of income, and of a new president in Brazil who ran his campaign on it being the latter.
Talk to Michael on Twitter: @mikiebarb .

Hearing from the Farmer sisters
In Monday's episode, Mike Baker shared his conversations with Maria and Annie Farmer, the sisters who made the earliest known sexual assault allegations against Jeffrey Epstein 23 years ago, but whose stories weren't widely heard until now. Mike told us about his time with them:
"When I showed up to interview Maria at her new home, I arrived at about the same time as a FedEx truck that was delivering a box of old belongings. Inside were photos and art pieces from the period around when she says her assault occurred. While I was with her, she began going through those files, and the process contributed to the emotional toll of an already tough day. So we took breaks. I left the house for a bit. We later went to dinner with her mother and discussed other things, like the art Maria did as a child and what leftovers their dogs would want to eat. Some questions I pocketed for another day.
"Maria and Annie ended up spending hours talking with me over several days. I'm grateful for that. The process was challenging for me, but I can't even begin to relate to how draining it must have been for them."

Next up on "1619"
Every Saturday for the next few weeks, you'll hear the new Times podcast "1619" on "The Daily." In tomorrow's episode, Matthew Desmond and Nikole Hannah-Jones tell the story of how cotton slavery built American capitalism.
The cotton plantation was America's first big business, and enslaved people became America's first modern workers. Behind this system, and integral to it, was a brutality that resonates into the nation's economic life today.
If you don't want to wait until tomorrow, we're also releasing "1619" as a standalone series, with new episodes published on Fridays. You can listen to the latest at nytimes.com/1619podcast or by searching for "1619" wherever you get your podcasts.
______
On 'The Daily' this week
Monday: "I don't know why none of the other adults told the truth," Maria Farmer, who reported Jeffrey Epstein two decades ago, told Mike Baker. "Why did I have to do it all? And why did I get punished for it?"
Tuesday: Peter Goodman on the U.S. trade war with China: "There is simply no way that you can separate the two largest economies on earth in an era of globalization without significant numbers of people winding up poorer."
Wednesday: "This is certainly a story about climate change. And it's a story about President Bolsonaro," says Ernesto Londoño of the Amazon fires. "But it's a far more complicated story than we've been hearing."
Thursday: "From day one, they've been bleeding money." In the 10 years that Uber has existed, it has never once turned a profit. Mike Isaac explains how that's possible.
Friday: In Britain and Italy, political battles are playing out between the establishment and the populists. "Everybody thinks they're representing democracy," Katrin Bennhold tells us.

CONSERVATIVE GROUPS URGE CONGRESS TO SCRAP SURPRISE BILLING LEGISLATION: One of the only chances Congress is likely to have this year for a bipartisan solution to curbing unexpected, high medical bills won’t get the support of outside conservative groups.
Eight organizations joined together Thursday to send a letter to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell stating opposition to the proposals put forward so far to help shield patients from “surprise medical bills.” These massive charges come after patients receive medical care outside their network and often in an emergency room, and happen even in cases where patients do their best to make sure their insurance will cover the care they need.
While conservative groups didn’t call out specific legislation in their letter, they referred to provisions that make it clear they won’t be getting behind bills that already have gained momentum among lawmakers.
The groups, including Heritage Action for America, Americans for Prosperity, Freedom Works, and National Taxpayers Union, complained that the solutions Congress has proposed “use the heavy hand of government to force medical providers to abide by contracts governing payments into which they have not entered.”
They derided proposals to set a benchmark payment on what hospitals are allowed to charge. That provision, included in the Lower Health Care Costs Act, already passed the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee. The groups also criticized a proposal to allow a third-party arbiter to determine prices. That provision isn’t in the HELP bill but was part of the STOP Surprise Medical Bills Act, led by Senators Bill Cassidy of Louisiana and Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire.
Several lawmakers want the arbitration provision added to the HELP Committee bill. If that happens, the benchmark plan would stay but then if either the medical provider or the insurer wanted to appeal the amount, they could do so using an arbitration process.
To conservative groups, employing such methods would amount to “government rate setting” and “price controls,” and are a no-go. Instead, they want to see more competition and transparency over prices, and give patients more power to choose their care.
“Government rate setting will further distort an already distorted market,” they wrote. “Similarly, forcing parties into binding arbitration when payment disputes arise or forcing non-network providers into contract matching require government interference into private contracts.”
There has been no word about whether McConnell will bring the Lower Health Care Costs Act to the floor, but Senators Lamar Alexander of Tennessee and Patty Murray of Washington, who lead the HELP Committee, said in a statement before the August recess that they would continue working to move the bill forward.
Conservatives would rather see the plan scrapped and the issue studied further.
“There is some evidence that suggests the problem of surprise medical billing could be caused in part by existing federal mandates,” they wrote. “This should be researched further.”

US RESISTS URGING BY EXPERTS TO PROVIDE FLU SHOTS TO MIGRANTS: Top infectious disease experts say the U.S. government has a responsibility to provide preventive care such as flu vaccines to migrants immediately after they are taken into custody, but the federal agency involved says disease prevention is not its job.
“As a law enforcement agency, and due to the short term nature of CBP holding and logistical challenges, operating a vaccine program is not feasible," the U.S. Customs and Border Protection said in a statement to the Washington Examiner. "Both ICE and HHS have comprehensive medical support services and can provide vaccinations as appropriate to those in their custody.”
Our immigration reporter Anna Giaritelli spoke with top infectious disease experts, who stressed that the flu was deadly and that not being vaccinated posed a risk to public health.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION GIVES VERMONT HOSPITAL AN ULTIMATUM: FOLLOW THE RELIGIOUS FREEDOM RULE OR LOSE FUNDING: After The University of Vermont Medical Center reportedly forced a Catholic nurse to assist in an abortion, the Trump administration is forcing the hospital to comply with a religious anti-discrimination rule allowing religious exemption from certain medical procedures. The hospital risks losing $1.6 million in federal funds.
ISAKSON TO RESIGN AS HE STRUGGLES WITH ADVANCING PARKINSON’S DISEASE: Georgia Republican Johnny Isakson will resign from his position as senator due to “mounting health challenges” stemming from Parkinson’s. He disclosed in 2015 that he had been diagnosed and said his "main symptoms are the stiffness in my left arm and a slowed, shuffling gait." Since then, he has suffered a fall, resulting in four fractured ribs, and has had surgery to remove a growth on his kidney. “I have concluded that I will not be able to do the job over the long term in the manner the citizens of Georgia deserve. It goes against every fiber of my being to leave in the middle of my Senate term, but I know it’s the right thing to do on behalf of my state,” Isakson said. Governor Brian Kemp will appoint a temporary replacement before a special election is held in 2020 to fill the vacant seat.
Isakson isn’t the only politician to endure Parkinson’s: Former Minnesota senator and presidential hopeful Eugene McCarthy left the Senate in 1971 and died of advanced Parkinson’s at the age of 89 in 2005. More recently, Democratic congressman José Serrano announced in March he will not seek reelection after being diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease.
FDA ISSUES WARNING ABOUT LIVER FAILURE AFTER USING HEPATITIS C TREATMENTS: The Food and Drug Administration has received reports of severe liver injury or failure after patients have taken FDA-approved hepatitis C treatments, which are not meant for people who already have moderate to severe liver damage. Dr. Debra Birnkrant, director of the Division of Antiviral Products at the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research said Wednesday that “there are other effective FDA-approved treatment options available for those patients with those conditions. Approved [hepatitis C] treatments can save lives and when prescribed as indicated, these medicines continue to be safe and effective.”

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – Former FBI Director James Comey violated bureau policy by disclosing the contents of confidential memos detailing his interactions with President Donald Trump, but the Justice Department has declined to file charges in the case, according to an internal review by Justice's inspector general.
In sharply worded rebuke, the inspector general concluded that Comey, who was abruptly fired two years ago, broke with bureau rules by both authorizing the disclosure of the memos and by failing to notify the FBI that he had stored some of them at a home safe. Yet prosecutors found no reason to bring criminal charges.
"We found no evidence that Comey or his attorneys released any of the classified information contained in any of the memos to members of the media," the 83-page report found, adding that the former director's actions nonetheless "violated department and FBI policies and his FBI employment agreement. "
Within minutes of the report's release, Comey took to Twitter, asserting that the report had absolved him of any wrongdoing.
"I don't need a public apology from those who defamed me, but a quick message with a 'sorry we lied about you' would be nice," the former director said.
"And to all those who've spent two years talking about me 'going to jail' or being a 'liar and a leaker' ask yourselves why you still trust people who gave you bad information for so long, including the president," he said.
Trump and Republican allies in Congress have been Comey's primary adversary since the memos' contents were made public, with the president repeatedly referring to him as "a liar" and calling for his prosecution.
The White House issued a scathing response to the report, again calling the Russia investigation a "witch hunt. "
"James Comey is a proven liar and leaker. The Inspector General's report shows Comey violated the most basic obligations of confidentiality that he owed to the United States Government and to the American people," read a statement by White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham. "Comey disgraced himself and his office to further a personal political agenda, and this report further confirms that. "
Comey had recorded his contacts with the president in seven memos, including a Jan. 27, 2017, dinner in which Trump requested that the FBI chief then-overseeing the Russia inquiry pledge his loyalty to Trump.
“I need loyalty, I expect loyalty,'' Trump allegedly told the director, according to Comey's written notes of the meeting.
In another Feb. 14, 2017, meeting documented by the director, the president allegedly asked Comey to shutdown the FBI's then-pending inquiry into Trump's national security adviser Michael Flynn.
Flynn ultimately pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak.
Following his firing, Comey told a Senate committee that he authorized the release of some the memos' most explosive contents by asking an associate to provide the information to The New York Times. Comey told lawmakers that he had hoped the disclosure would prompt the appointment of a special counsel to oversee the Russia inquiry.
In interviews with Justice investigators, Comey justified his action, claiming that it was something he was “uniquely situated to do” as a private citizen and that by speaking up he could “change the game. ”
Comey expected his effort would pressure leadership of the Justice Department, which he didn’t trust, according to the report.
He asserted that the memos' contents held “incredible importance to the nation, as a whole” and that he took the action because "I love this country. "
Comey said he didn’t notify FBI leadership in advance of sharing the memos' contents, because he didn't want to put his colleagues "in an impossible situation" by asking them to approve his effort.
The former director acknowledged, as he did in testimony before a Senate committee two years ago, enlisting Daniel Richman, a friend and law professor, to pass along the contents of one of the memos to a New York Times reporter, unleashing a political and legal firestorm.
The report recounts a dramatic scene inside FBI headquarters during Comey's June 8, 2017, testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee when officials first learned that the former director had gone through Richman to make some of the contents public while watching the hearing on television.
James Baker, then the bureau's general counsel, told investigators that he remembered “literally running down the hallway” to his office, along with then-counter-intelligence agent Peter Strzok, to find Richman’s phone number so that they could direct him to preserve the material that Comey had given him.
While speaking with the two FBI officials, Richman agreed to give them the memo, and he “volunteered . . . that if you’re collecting that one, you should get the (other) three” he’d received from Comey, according to the report.
FBI agents later removed Richman’s desktop computer from his New York home on June 13, 2017, and returned it eight days later, when they asked him to permanently delete the picture of a Comey memo from his phone, according to the report.
The report's reference to Strzok also is striking for different reasons.
Strzok, one of the primary agents involved in the FBI's then-pending investigation into Russia's interference in the 2016 election, was ultimately removed from the inquiry and dismissed from bureau, after the Justice Department inspector general discovered that he had exchanged text messages disparaging Trump with another FBI lawyer.
Disclosure of the texts prompted Trump and his Republican allies in Congress to wage a new war on the integrity of the Russia investigation.
Following Comey's firing, former FBI Director Robert Mueller was appointed to lead the inquiry which concluded in March and chronicled a broad Russian effort to sway the election in Trump's favor, a campaign that appeared to welcome the assistance and aides who later lied to pretend they hadn't.
Mueller, however, found insufficient evidence to link the president or his associates in a conspiracy with Russia. He also did not make a determination about whether Trump's myriad attempts to derail the special counsel's inquiry – including the president's failed efforts to remove Mueller and Comey's firing – constituted criminal obstruction.
Attorney General William Barr later intervened, ruling that Trump's conduct was not criminal.
On Thursday, Republican lawmakers continued their public scoldings of Comey.
“The Inspector General’s report is a stunning and unprecedented rebuke of a former director of the FBI," said Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S. C. "This is the first of what I expect will be several more ugly and damning rebukes of senior DOJ and FBI officials regarding their actions and biases toward the Trump campaign of 2016. "
The inspector general also is reviewing whether the FBI abused its surveillance authority during the Russia inquiry.
Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio, the top Republican on the House Oversight and Reform Committee, called the report a disappointing reminder that Comey put partisanship and personal ambition over his patriotism and legal obligations to the American public.
“By leaking his confidential communications with the president in an attempt to save face in the wake of his firing, Mr. Comey believed he was above the rules of the DOJ,” Jordan said. “His actions were disgraceful and part of a wider effort within the Obama Justice Department to undermine President Trump. ”

Here to Help; One Thing You Can Do To Counteract Climate Change

What would happen if everybody in the United States cut back on driving?
We're not talking about getting rid of your car, just using it a little bit less. It turns out that even driving just 10 percent less -- if everyone did it -- would have a big impact on greenhouse gas emissions.
That's because Americans drive trillions of miles every year, helping to make transportation the biggest contributor to United States greenhouse gas emissions.
In 2017, light-duty vehicles in the United States (including cars, S.U.V.s, pickups and most of the vehicles used for everyday life) produced 1,098 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents. That's about one-fifth of the country's total emissions footprint.
A 10 percent cut, therefore, would be roughly 110 million metric tons of carbon dioxide, or the same as taking about 28 coal-fired power plants offline for a year.
To achieve such a reduction, every American driver would, on average, have to cut about 1,350 miles per year.
While not easy, that target is realistic for most people, said Tony Dutzik, a senior policy analyst at the Frontier Group, a nonprofit research organization.
A low-hanging fruit is shorter rides, Mr. Dutzik said. Over one-third of all car trips are less than two miles, so walking, biking or taking public transport for some of those trips could add up. Planning ahead to combine errands and avoid unnecessary trips could help, too, he said.
"Emissions per rider in a full bus or train are vastly lower than a car," Mr. Dutzik said. He also suggested car pooling or occasionally working from home, if possible.
Gretchen Goldman, research director for the Center for Science and Democracy at the Union of Concerned Scientists, said she uses an app called Transit to help her find ways to travel that don't involve a car. It aggregates bus, train, bike-share and other alternatives to show you transportation options.
Dr. Goldman emphasized that she doesn't want people to feel guilty for using their cars. She noted that the current transportation system in the United States -- including relatively cheap gas prices and poor access to public transportation -- encourages car use.
For that to change, she said, "We need policy changes."

Greta Thunberg's New York Arrival
By John Schwartz
Greta Thunberg has crossed the Atlantic.
The 16-year-old climate activist, who inspired a global movement through her school strikes, spent two weeks aboard a racing yacht, the Malizia II, crossing by sail to avoid the significant carbon footprint that goes along with flying. Ms. Thunberg departed from Plymouth, England, on Aug. 14. (She has taken the year off from school to expand her work.)
Using the solar panels that provide power to the electrical equipment on board, she has provided regular updates on the trip to her 1.1 million Twitter followers. On Day 4, she stated happily: "Life on Malizia II is like camping on a roller coaster!" On the 25th, however, she shared a video that showed that the seas were turbulent: "it's very rough, very high waves." She made the crossing with a team that included her father and a documentary filmmaker, Nathan Grossman.
In the United States, her schedule will be packed. She plans to attend a global youth strike on Friday, Sept. 20, after speaking out with young Americans who are suing the United States government to get action on climate change. The next day, she will participate in the United Nations youth summit, along with an estimated 600 others from all over the world. On the following Monday, she is scheduled to address the United Nations climate summit. Beyond that, she has said she would like to attend the United Nations climate summit in Chile in December, with stops along the way in the United States and Canada.
The trip has led to critics of climate activism pointing out that the Malizia team will fly two crew members to the United States to bring the boat back, making the voyage anything but emissions-free.
Holly Cova, a spokeswoman for Malizia II, said, "We recognize this is an imperfect solution," but because the additional crew members were necessary for a coming race, the emissions from their flights would be offset, she said.
Ms. Thunberg was undeterred by the attacks. The critics are "doing everything they can to switch the focus from the climate crisis to me," she said. "That is what you have to expect when you talk about these things."

Deutsche Bank Holds Trove of Trump Files

Texto completo: Deutsche Bank's disclosure on Tuesday that it has tax returns related to President Trump's family or business set off a frenzy of speculation about what those materials might reveal.
But a trove of other data and documents that his longtime lender is sitting on might prove more revelatory to investigators digging into Mr. Trump's finances. That includes records of how Mr. Trump made his money, whom he has partnered with, the terms of his extensive borrowings and what transactions he has engaged in with Russians or other foreign nationals.
For nearly two decades, Deutsche Bank was the only mainstream financial institution consistently willing to do business with Mr. Trump, who had a long record of defaulting on loans. The bank over the years collected reams of his personal and corporate information.
Two congressional committees have subpoenaed Deutsche Bank for a vast array of records related to Mr. Trump -- including any tax returns since 2010. The investigators are hoping the materials will shed light not only on the president's finances but also on any links he has had to foreign governments and whether he or his companies were involved in any illegal activity, such as money laundering for people overseas.
Here is what might be lurking in Deutsche Bank's electronic vaults about the president, his family and his businesses.
Deutsche Bank has a lot of detailed information.
After the two House committees subpoenaed the bank, Mr. Trump sued to block it from complying. The case is pending with a federal appeals court.
In a court filing on Tuesday, Deutsche Bank confirmed that it has at least some of the tax returns that were demanded by the congressional committees. The filing didn't disclose whose tax returns the bank possesses, or for what years, but current and former bank officials have told The New York Times that Deutsche Bank has the first several pages of Mr. Trump's returns for multiple years.
Beyond that, congressional investigators are seeking dozens of other items (the list on the subpoena is six pages of single-spaced type). The request would cover most, if not all, of the extensive documentation Deutsche Bank has amassed about Mr. Trump's businesses and personal finances. That includes information about his corporate balance sheet, his income from various assets and documents that map out how his businesses are set up.
While Deutsche Bank has been lending to Mr. Trump since 1998, the most detailed information would cover the period since 2011, when the company's private-banking division struck up a relationship with the future president and his family.
Those documents can tell us a lot, but in pieces.
For a president who has kept his business affairs largely hidden from public view, the materials would together provide the most complete picture yet of Mr. Trump's finances.
Mr. Trump broke with decades of precedent in refusing to release his federal tax returns, and for more than three years Democrats and journalists have been trying to get their hands on them.
The summary pages of the returns alone would not illuminate Mr. Trump's income sources or his business partners. On the other hand, the tax-return summaries likely would show whether Mr. Trump has paid any taxes in recent years. (We already know that Mr. Trump for years may have avoided paying federal income taxes.)
But the tax documents, coupled with the other financial materials that the bank has, would likely fill in some of the gaps about the true extent of Mr. Trump's fortune, which he has described as being in the billions of dollars.
In addition, materials that the congressional committees have subpoenaed -- including anything relating to the due diligence the bank conducted before agreeing to lend him money -- could contain new information about where and with whom Mr. Trump, his companies and his family have been earning money.
The files may shed light on any dealings with Russia by Mr. Trump or his family.
Since before Mr. Trump was elected president, critics of the president have speculated that Russian companies or individuals were secretly providing him with financial assistance, possibly via Deutsche Bank.
It isn't hard to understand how such speculation got started. Deutsche Bank has a long history of operating in Russia, working with Kremlin-linked companies and laundering money for wealthy Russians.
Mr. Trump has a history in Russia. He once staged the Miss Universe pageant there, and he also sold a mansion to a Russian billionaire for $ 95 million. During the 2016 campaign, Mr. Trump's company was looking to build a tower in Moscow -- with the help of a Russian bank, VTB, that has long-running ties to Deutsche Bank.
And, of course, Russia interfered in the presidential election, seeking to tilt it in Mr. Trump's favor.
So far, though, no evidence has emerged that shows Deutsche Bank's extensive lending to Mr. Trump -- a total of well over $ 2.5 billion worth since 1998 -- was connected to the Russian government, companies or individuals.
Numerous current and former Deutsche Bank executives, including those with direct knowledge of the loans, have said the loans made since 2011 were financially attractive to the bank because Mr. Trump agreed to personally guarantee much of them -- in other words, if he were to default, Deutsche Bank would be able to seize his personal assets, including tens of millions of dollars that he kept in accounts at the bank.
Still, Deutsche Bank's internal files will most likely contain additional information about at least some dealings with Russia -- although not necessarily involving Mr. Trump himself.
Congressional investigators subpoenaed any materials about suspicious activity that the bank detected in the accounts of Mr. Trump, his company or his family members, including Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump's son-in-law and adviser. In 2016, Tammy McFadden, a former anti-money-laundering compliance officer at the bank, flagged transactions connected to Mr. Kushner as potentially suspicious.
Those transactions involved money flowing to Russian individuals, and Deutsche Bank's files almost certainly include more information.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Texto completo: “Saturday Night Live" is returning next month, and NBC just dropped the fall lineup — which is chock full of stars like Kristen Stewart , Woody Harrelson , and, most notably, Eddie Murphy .
The show will feature Harrelson with musical guest Billie Eilish on Sept. 28; Phoebe Waller-Bridge and musical guest Taylor Swift on Oct. 5; “Stranger Things" actor David Harbour and musical guest Camila Cabello on Oct. 12; Stewart on Nov. 2; and Murphy on Dec. 21.
Murphy's return is especially notable because the comedian, who was an “SNL" cast member from 1980 to 1984, hasn't performed on the show in more than three decades — he last hosted in December 1984, shortly after leaving the show.
But, according to The New York Times, Murphy got into a feud with “SNL" after a joke about his career was made by David Spade : “Look children, it's a falling star; make a wish," Spade had quipped, as a photo of Murphy appeared on the splitscreen above him.
Spade recounted the verbal lashing he received from Murphy in his 2015 memoir, “Almost Interesting," describing the incident as “so much worse than I had imagined."
“He just got caught in friendly fire and my deep desire to make an impression on my bosses and keep my job. How pathetic," Spade wrote.
However, Murphy appeared on the “SNL" 40th anniversary special in 2015, saying the show was “such a big part of who I am."
The show, which has seen a resurgence in interest in today's political climate, won an Emmy in 2018 for best variety sketch series.Jaclyn Reiss

New 2020 poll shows tightening race between Sanders, Warren, and Biden

Texto completo: A new national poll suggests the race for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination may be tightening, with a virtual three-way tie between former vice president Joe Biden and two more progressive rivals, Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren.
Despite the dead heat — Sanders and Warren each with 20 percent support among Democratic voters and Biden with 19 percent — the Monmouth University Poll released Monday may hint at a concerning trend for the candidacy of Biden, the poll's previous front-runner, whose support declined from 32 percent when the Monmouth poll was taken in June.
Sanders of Vermont and Warren of Massachusetts both picked up several percentage points of support since June. Voters were asked whom they would support among 23 Democratic candidates.
Patrick Murray, who runs the polling institute at Monmouth, in West Long Branch, N.J., said the poll suggested the race for the Democratic presidential nomination was tightening.
“The main takeaway from this poll is that the Democratic race has become volatile," Murray said. “Liberal voters are starting to cast about for a candidate they can identify with. Moderate voters, who have been paying less attention, seem to be expressing doubts about Biden."
Murray cautioned that the results were just “one snapshot from one poll." The poll of 800 voters included 298 people considered registered Democrats or Democratic-leaning and had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 5.7 percentage points within that group.
Warren's favorable ratings also improved, while Biden's slipped and Sanders's remained stable.
The Monmouth poll found Biden's support had eroded in states that hold earlier primaries, dropping from 26 percent to 20 percent since June.
Most of the other candidates for the Democratic nomination held firm in the Monmouth poll, albeit with far lower numbers than the three leaders.
Senator Kamala Harris of California remained steady with 8 percent support. Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey gained slightly, from 2 percent in June to 4 percent in August. Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., got 4 percent, compared with 5 percent in June.
The national poll was conducted by telephone from Aug. 16 to 20.
New York Times
White House clarifies Melania Trump has never met Kim
President Trump on Monday claimed that first lady Melania Trump has "gotten to know" North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, prompting the White House to clarify that the two have never met.
Trump made the comment at a news conference at the Group of 7 summit in Biarritz, France. While answering a question about Iran, the president took a detour to discuss the country's real estate potential, then pivoted to North Korea.
"I also say that, by the way, with respect to North Korea, Kim Jong Un — who I've gotten to know extremely well; the first lady had gotten to know Kim Jong Un, and I think she'd agree with me — he is a man with a country that has tremendous potential," Trump said.
White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham issued a statement soon after noting that the first lady has never met Kim.
"President Trump confides in his wife on many issues including the detailed elements of his strong relationship with Chairman Kim — and while the First Lady hasn't met him, the President feels like she's gotten to know him too," Grisham said.
The president first met with Kim in Singapore in June 2018. At the time, Trump said that even though the first lady wanted to accompany him, she was under doctors' orders not to fly because of a medical procedure she'd had the previous month.
Earlier this year, Trump and Kim held their second summit in Hanoi. The first lady was also not present for that meeting, which was abruptly cut short amid disagreements on the trade-offs between the United States providing relief from sanctions and North Korea's steps to dismantle its nuclear weapons program.
In June, Trump and Kim met for the third time, at the demilitarized zone between North and South Korea. While the president's daughter and son-in-law, Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, accompanied him on the visit and also briefly crossed into North Korea, the first lady was not present.

Prosecutors near decision on whether to indict McCabe
Federal prosecutors in Washington appear to be in the final stages of deciding whether to indict Andrew McCabe, the former deputy FBI director and a frequent target of President Trump, on charges of lying to federal agents, according to interviews with people familiar with recent developments in the investigation.
In two meetings last week, McCabe's lawyers met with the deputy attorney general, Jeffrey A. Rosen, who is expected to be involved in the decision about whether to prosecute, and for more than an hour with the US attorney for the District of Columbia, Jessie K. Liu, according to a person familiar with the meetings. The person would not detail the discussions, but defense lawyers typically meet with top law enforcement officials to try to persuade them not to indict their client if they failed to get prosecutors to drop the case.
An indictment of a former top FBI official is extremely rare and would be the latest chapter in the saga of McCabe, who was fired last year over the issue now under criminal investigation — whether he failed to be forthcoming with internal investigators examining the FBI's dealings with the news media.
An indictment would be certain to draw praise from Trump, who has made his attacks on McCabe a centerpiece of his yearslong campaign to discredit the Justice Department and the FBI over the Russia investigation.
But prosecutors may face headwinds if a case were to go to trial. One prosecutor quit the case and has expressed frustration with how it was being managed, according to person familiar with her departure, and a key witness provided testimony to the grand jury that could hurt the government's case.
Additionally, Washington juries are typically liberal, and prosecutors could end up with jurors sympathetic to McCabe who believe that he, not the president, is the victim of a political witch hunt. McCabe's lawyers would probably emphasize his long history at the FBI and his role protecting the country.
Though the meetings between McCabe's lawyers and top law enforcement officials suggest that prosecutors seem intent on moving forward with the case, they could also decide to pass on an indictment. Spokeswomen for the Justice Department, the US Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia, and for McCabe all declined to comment.
McCabe, a 21-year FBI veteran, was fired in March 2018 after then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions rejected an appeal that would have let him retire within days with a full pension. McCabe has said his dismissal was politically motivated and meant to undermine the special counsel's Russia investigation by trying to discredit him as a witness.
The case against McCabe, 51, is centered on the findings of a scathing Justice Department inspector general's office report last year that found that he had lacked candor on four occasions when questioned by the office's investigators. Prosecutors appeared to be focused on McCabe's answers about whether he authorized the disclosure of information to a Wall Street Journal reporter in October 2016 for an article about an investigation into the Clinton Foundation.
When initially questioned by FBI agents in May 2017 about the disclosure to the reporter, McCabe said he had not approved it and did not know who did. Other evidence contradicted his assertion. Then in late July, two investigators with the inspector general's office interviewed McCabe about the disclosure to the newspaper. They determined he had not been truthful, saying he had essentially made the same false denial as he did previously in May, “except this time the false denial was made in an audio-recorded interview."
The inspector general referred his findings to federal prosecutors in Washington in the spring of 2018 after concluding his investigation.
New York Times
Sarah Sanders unveils website as she eyes possible bid for governor
Former White House press secretary Sarah Sanders on Monday unveiled a campaign-style website highlighting her close ties to President Trump, a moved that stoked speculation that she will make a 2022 bid for governor of Arkansas.
The site, which Sanders announced in a tweet, describes her as a "trusted confidante" of Trump and quotes him calling her "irreplaceable," a "warrior," and "very special person with extraordinary talents."
Visitors are invited to sign up for e-mail updates on Sanders's activities.
Trump has encouraged Sanders to make a Republican gubernatorial bid in her home state, saying she would be "fantastic." Last month, Sanders's father, former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee, confirmed her interest during a radio interview in which the Republican said she would start exploring a possible run following some down time.
Sanders prompted speculation about her plans last month by making an appearance at a retreat in Aspen, Colo., hosted by the Republican Governors Association.
Sanders served as Trump's press secretary from July 2017 until late June, when she resigned. Fox News announced last week that it had hired Sanders as a contributor. The conservative network has a long history of providing a platform for Republicans hoping to maintain their visibility before launching campaigns for office.
Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson, a Republican, was reelected to a second term last year. He is barred by term limits from running again in 2022.

House panel subpoenas former White House aide Rob Porter
The House Judiciary Committee subpoenaed former White House aide Rob Porter on Monday, the panel's latest attempt to try to move public opinion in favor of impeaching President Trump.
Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, Democrat of New York, said in a statement that the panel had issued the summons to Porter, seeking his testimony on Sept. 17.
"The committee intends to hold hearings and obtain testimony over the coming months as part of its efforts to hold the president accountable as we move forward with our investigation into obstruction, corruption and abuse of power by Trump and his associates," said Nadler. "This will help the committee determine whether to recommend articles of impeachment against the president or other Article 1 remedies. No one is above the law."
The committee's summons to Porter comes as it plans to continue laying out a case that Trump obstructed justice. The Judiciary Committee, which has impeachment jurisdiction, is considering whether to draft articles of impeachment against the president in the fall as 133 House Democrats have called for starting proceedings to oust the president.
On Monday, Representative Raja Krishnamoorthi, an Illinois Democrat who sits on two panels investigating the president, became the latest to join the call for impeachment.
Politico first reported the news of the Porter subpoena.
Porter, the former White House staff secretary who left amid allegations of domestic violence in previous relationships, was a central witness in former special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation. He saw Trump lash out at former White House counsel Donald McGahn for not firing Mueller, according to the special counsel report.
Trump also asked Porter to try to get McGahn to create a false record saying Trump never asked him to fire the special counsel. And he tried to get Porter to find a way to have a particular Justice Department official he seemed to prefer to oversee the Mueller probe after then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused himself, according to the report.
Porter has denied the accusations of domestic abuse.

STAFF REPORTS
A national organization dedicated to increasing and retaining reporters and editors of color in the field of investigative reporting will now be based at UNC-Chapel Hill, the School of Media and Journalism announced last week.
The Ida B. Wells Society for Investigative Reporting works to educate news organizations and journalists on how the inclusion of diverse voices can raise the caliber, impact and visibility of investigative journalism as a means of promoting transparency and good government.
The society is named after Wells, a pioneering black investigative journalist in the late 19th and early 20th centuries and early leader in the civil rights movement.
"Diversity, equity and inclusion in media and journalism are essential to a healthy democracy and a relevant industry. We're proud to support an initiative of this caliber to help make newsrooms more reflective of the communities they report on," MJ-school Dean Susan King said.
The Ida B. Wells Society is spearheaded by veteran journalists Nikole HannahJones, a 2003 Carolina graduate who is a staff writer at The New York Times Magazine and who envisioned the magazine's The 1619 Project; Ron Nixon, the international investigations editor at The Associated Press; and Topher Sanders, who covers race, inequality and the justice system for ProPublica.
"We're ecstatic to be at a university that understands and supports our mission. Having a partner like the MJ-school is going to mean a lot not only to the society, but to all the journalists who we are involved with in the years to come," Sanders said.
The society offers investigative reporting training workshops throughout the United States and is developing a yearlong fellowship program based in New York City.
Workshops cover the use of advanced technology, interviewing techniques and the latest data-gathering and fact-checking resources and build on story pitching, project management and narrative storytelling skills. The society's co-founders will advise and mentor MJ-school students and share their investigative journalism expertise at Carolina in a classroom setting.
King noted that their mission dovetails nicely with the school's focus. "Reese News Lab is an innovative setting for journalism that encourages students to explore design thinking and hone data storytelling skills, making it a natural home for the Ida B. Wells Society," he said.
"Together, we will prepare a generation of innovative, data-savvy and ethical investigative journalists for the diverse newsrooms that are essential to a thriving democracy."
Hannah-Jones, who was a Roy H. Park Fellow as a graduate student at the MJschool from 2001-03 and who delivered the MJschool commencement speech in 2017 - the year she was named a MacArthur Genius Grant Fellow - shared her enthusiasm for the relocation to Carolina.
"I'm very proud that we've moved to the MJschool," she said. "It's such a place of journalistic excellence. It means so much to me. And I love that we're moving to the South. Having a presence there - where so many black journalists are and the people that we write about live - is critical."

Gun control is not the solution you think

Texto completo: Gun control is not the answer to America's gun violence.
In the recent mass shootings, the shooters purchased their weapons legally. Likewise, the policies promoted by gun control activists would not impact mass shootings. Last year, the RAND Corp. conducted a survey of academic research and did not find any of the policies they looked at would reduce mass shootings: "We found no qualifying studies showing that any of the 13 policies we investigated decreased mass shootings."
As usual with so many of these killers, there was nothing too outstanding about them (though as of late they do seem motivated by some horrendous white nationalist beliefs — sadly, protected by the First Amendment).
Preventing the sale or ownership of so-called assault rifles, a term for which there is no technical definition, will not end these mass shootings.
Even if the stereotypical-looking "assault rifles" are prohibited, other weapons and types of semi-automatic firearms can be used in shootings.
Justice John Paul Stevens — like many lawyers, legal analysts, scholars and others — had believed that the Second Amendment truly applied only to civilians having guns to use in a militia. This had been based on a reading and interpretation of the 1939 U.S. v. Miller decision, in which sawed-off shotguns were seen as having no military purpose (the justices were apparently unfamiliar with the history and use of sawed-off shotguns in the military) and thus could be restricted.
More recent Supreme Court decisions concluding that the Second Amendment allows personal possession of guns for personal defense nullified this militia interpretation, both legally and historically. Justice Stevens admitted this in a New York Times essay, in which he concluded that the Second Amendment would have to be rewritten in order for it to explain his stance.
If the response to any mass shooting is flight, hide or fight, why not make sure that the fighting aspect of it works? Armed combat is more effective than unarmed combat. Businesses, despite their qualms, should allow legal concealed carry on their premises and should allow their employees to carry as well.
Louis Haas is a professor of history at Middle Tennessee State University. This column originally appeared in the Nashville Tennessean.
What others are saying Harvey Rosenthal, USA TODAY: "So many people with mental illness have shared with me the great distress and anger they feel about how we are being portrayed and treated, and the identification we feel with other marginalized groups who have been similarly targeted. It's time to stop defaming and blaming us and to get serious about addressing the growing climate of fear, prejudice, anger and violence in our country. To get there, we'll need inspirational leadership that unites us rather than separates us from each other. It's leadership of this kind that will indeed make us all safer."
Bob Barnes, Florida Today: "Of all the (constitutional) amendments ... only the Second Amendment comes under pressure for obliteration or change. What you may not know is that fighting against the Second Amendment is only a 20th century phenomenon. At some point, even the most ardent of people opposed to guns are going to have to ask the most logical question: 'Why are there such well-organized and well-funded groups opposing the Second Amendment?' ... Challenge anything relating to the Second Amendment, gun control or 'doing something.' But base that challenge on facts, not hyperbole or misleading information."
Andrew P. Napolitano, Fox News: "A person willing to kill innocents and be killed by the police while doing so surely would have no qualms about violating a state or federal law that prohibited the general ownership of the weapon. ... With all of this as background, and the country anguishing over the mass deaths of innocents, the feds and the states face a choice between a knee-jerk but popular restriction of some form of gun ownership and the rational and sound realization that more guns in the hands of those properly trained means less crime and more safety. Can the government constitutionally outlaw the types of rifles used by the El Paso and Dayton killers? In a word: No."

Women for Trump talk aiding President; Event aims to mobilize supporters

Texto completo: CUYAHOGA FALLS, Ohio - Inside the pavilion, the biggest headlines in mainstream media - a possible recession, strained trade talks with China, the President's quixotic interest in buying an autonomous Danish territory - don't exist.

Even the reason for the evening's gathering - to mobilize suburban women who support President Trump after suburban women helped turn the U.S. House blue in the midterms - struck some as a false premise.

That's fake news, said Donna Lillo, 62.

Still, there has to be something Republicans can do to boost Mr. Trump's support among women, a voting bloc his campaign is trying to energize heading into 2020.

Ms. Lillo, a retired veterinary technician, shook her head.

Some people say they don't like his tweets. I like everything he says. He sounds like me, that's why I connect with him, she said.

Mr. Trump's promises to build a wall at the southern border with Mexico, the strong economy, and his bluntness are what appeal to Ms. Lillo, who on Thursday carried a souvenir: a pass from a Trump rally in Akron held three years ago to the day.

I like that he's in for the fight. He's had a great life, he didn't need to do this, she said. The fact that the left attacks us so much - they don't like him, but they don't like us. We're the deplorables.

For Ohio's Women for Trump meetup that drew more than 100 on Thursday, organizers chose Cuyahoga Falls, a suburb of Akron in Summit County, one of seven Ohio counties where Democrat Hillary Clinton beat Mr. Trump in 2016, and where Democrats were able to flip a statehouse seat by a razor-thin margin in the midterms.

It's also the kind of area where Mr. Trump and his allies are hoping to coax reluctant Trump-supporting women out of hiding.

I think we should all wear them proudly, right? Ohio Republican Party chairman Jane Timken said at the event, urging the women to wear their red Make America Great Again hats.

The Trump Victory Leadership Initiative, an arm of the Trump campaign focused on training in voter registration, held Women for Trump events on the 99th anniversary of the 19th Amendment, which granted women the right to vote. Mr. Trump's female surrogates, including White House counselor Kellyanne Conway and former Fox News host Kimberly Guilfoyle, fanned out across 13 battleground states, including Michigan and Pennsylvania.

In Ohio, the meeting drew local party officials and loyal supporters, who heard from Ms. Timken, the first woman to lead the state party, and Madison Gesiotto, a lawyer, conservative commentator, and Miss Ohio 2014, who is one of six national Women for Trump co-chairs.

Ms. Gesiotto, who emphasized economic gains under Mr. Trump and tax cuts impacting women with families, at one point urged everyone to text EMPOWER to 88022. Reaching for their phones, the entire room obliged.

Mr. Trump's campaign has good reason to target women. More than half of the white women who voted in 2016 voted for Mr. Trump, according to New York Times exit polling, demonstrating a key base of support that helped him win the White House. But an Aug. 19 NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll, showed 63 percent of college-educated white women and 49 percent of noncollege educated white women will definitely or probably vote for a Democrat over Mr. Trump in 2020.

In Ohio, Mr. Trump's approval rating is underwater with women 41 to 54 percent, according to the latest Quinnipiac poll on the Buckeye State. Among white women, he has a 48 percent approval rating, with 47 percent disapproving of the job he's doing.

While Ohio didn't flip any congressional seats in the midterms, the state has nine pivot counties that voted twice for President Barack Obama and then for Mr. Trump. Those counties will be crucial to the 2020 election and serve as a bellwether for national attitudes about Mr. Trump - whose most loyal supporters aren't buying into the data showing Democrats gaining traction with women.

I think the midterms were an anomaly. I think there was a lot of voter corruption, said Susan Platt, a 64-year-old teacher from outside Tiffin. Mr. Trump has claimed, without evidence, that millions of people have voted illegally.

I'm not worried about this, Ms. Platt said. He's got this.

David Pepper, chairman of the Ohio Democratic Party, said the election is far from locked up.

They know this is a big threat, he said. Women in the suburbs who are voting for Democrats is the biggest trend in Ohio politics.

The crowd at Thursday's event skewed toward white middle-aged women, with few women of color in attendance.

He's not racist, said Jessica Harris, who is 63 and black. The Democrats are trying to pull this race card and I'm sick of it ... I think he's the right man for where we are right now, because we need a strong leader to fight against China.

After voting for Mrs. Clinton in 2016, Ms. Harris said she became a Republican a year ago when she started watching Fox News and following conservative commentator Candace Owens.

I drove all this way from Cleveland. I might be the only [black woman], but I don't care, she said. I'm representing.

LeeAnn Johnson, wife of Republican Ohio Rep. Bill Johnson and a leader of Women for Trump in Ohio, made a pitch to women specifically on health care.

I make the health care decisions in my family, as do most mothers, especially working moms and single moms across America. It's frightening to me to think that the government can determine my family's health care, she said, referring to some Democrats' plans for single-payer health care.

Bertha Vargas, a retired teacher from Massachusetts who was visiting her two sisters in Ohio, said immigration is one of her top issues. She emigrated from Peru decades ago, but said some of her family couldn't get here legally so they remained in South America.

If I had been in my old country, I never would have achieved as much as I did in this country, she said.

‘Free press’ has hatred for president

Texto completo: ‘Free press’ has hatred for president The Daily Herald opinion of Friday, Aug. 16, echoes the same theme of a year ago, namely President Donald Trump describes the "free press" as "enemies of the people." The theme has not changed, neither has the "free press" MSNBC, CNN, New York Times, Washington Post, etc. These commentators, expert analysts, entertainers and talk show hosts harbor enormous hatred for Trump.
To shape public opinion, the press has called the president unspeakable names and accusations; mentally unfit to be president, collaborated with the enemy, become a dictator, etc. They lied, conjectured and manufactured false accusations. One "expert" analyst suggested treason. Treason is punishable by death. Outrageous.
For two years it was the Russia collusion hoax. The Mueller report ended that. Obstruction of justice, fizzled. Next came the perennial favorite smear: He is a racist. This baseless accusation is currently raging. All this time not one favorable comment about the president? Where is fairness, integrity and balance?
Tune in anytime to CNN or MSNBC for verification. In a nutshell that is the state of our "free press."
When the "free press" dedicated itself to remove from office our legitimately elected president, using slander and vicious lies, and turned on the very citizenry that it was constitutionally entrusted to protect against actual government abuse, it has indeed betrayed the public trust and has turned itself into "the enemy of the people." Period.
The Opinion is correct that such adversarial relationship between President Donald Trump and the "free press" is bad for democracy. But a coup to oust a duly elected president is far worse. That is treason. Until the "free press" frees itself from its bond of hate, the threat to democracy remains. An Opinion on the responsibility of the free press is much awaited.

A heroic service Meet the woman behind the program for boy's funeral

Texto completo: As soon as she heard a 4-year-old Baltimore boy had been found in a dumpster, Shawnie O'Neal knew she had to do something.
The West Baltimore native makes her living designing memorial programs, particularly for the untimely deaths wrought by Baltimore violence. She decided to create a program for Malachi Lawson, the boy who loved "Paw Patrol" and Mickey Mouse. She would waive the fee she would typically charge for her design and printing services, which in this case would be nearly $500. And she definitely was going to have it laminated.
"I didn't want people to throw this away, like they threw him away," she said.
Malachi was burned in a bath and left untreated for nine days before dying in his bed, according to charging documents. His body was found in a dumpster more than 10 miles from home. His mother, Alicia Lawson, and her wife, Shatika Lawson, have been charged with several crimes including, involuntary manslaughter and child abuse.
"He had so much courage to even survive all that time," O'Neal, 46, said of Malachi. "I couldn't help him that day, but I could let him know he was appreciated."
Her business is Memorial Programs by Shawnie O. in Franklin Square. Her memorial programs don't resemble the template set at most funeral homes. The deceased are depicted on red carpets, surrounded by stars, or nestled among twinkling diamonds, or ensconced among pink roses and doves. The custom designs are aimed at creating a lasting memory of the deceased and helping grieving families, O'Neal said.
Personalized funeral touches are a nationwide trend, according to Jack Mitchell, secretary of the National Funeral Directory Association. The Baltimore funeral home owner said the development began with baby boomers and has expanded with millennials.
"We've been seeing a trend of defying what we term as the traditional funeral," Mitchell said. "People want to make it something that's going to be more personal."
With interest in social media and snapping photos continuing to grow, it's no surprise to Mitchell that families are using O'Neal's services.
O'Neal estimates most programs she creates honor homicide victims - often young men. Baltimore's annual homicide count hasn't dropped below 300 victims since 2015. The city has already surpassed 215 people killed this year.
"It's imperative that people's last thing on Earth be memorable," O'Neal said. "And that's what we're here to do. I want you to dig into a program like it's a New York Times best-seller."
For Malachi's program, O'Neal's vision was a comic book, so mourners could remember the child as powerful and heroic.
Malachi's relatives let O'Neal almost single-handedly design the program, which took eight hours to create and six more to laminate. The over 100 mourners at the funeral Aug. 13 received a colorful, six-page booklet splashed with collages of Malachi, an obituary in "his" words and comforting lines like "remember an angel never dies" and "heaven is cool."
It included photos of the boy with Alicia and Shatika Lawson, accused in his death. A quotation was attributed to them - taken from a poem O'Neal found that was suggested for children's funerals.
Malachi's relatives provided the photographs. O'Neal said it didn't feel it was her place to exclude Alicia and Shatika.
A member of Malachi's extended family did not immediately respond to a request for comment this week.
In other instances, the bereaved are more specific about what they'd like to see. Regardless, customers always see and approve the final creation before it's printed, O'Neal said.
Nearly 20 years ago, O'Neal was a Baltimore City schoolteacher when her oldest son started playing basketball. She couldn't stand the uniforms, and her son's coach challenged her to improve them. She did - and in the process, began to find herself.
The Coppin State graduate quit teaching and started her own business full-time in 2004. Originally, she focused on T-shirts. But after she created a funeral program for her grandmother - depicted among flowers - she changed direction.
Since then, she's made thousands of programs. Some showcase photos of the recently deceased on replica covers of a Ravens football program, Essence, GQ or PlayStation magazines.
O'Neal has three employees. Typically, they'll meet with loved ones, learn about the deceased and gather photos. O'Neal analyzes images and contemplates who the person was. How did they pose? Was there a pattern to what they wore?
While a colleague works on collages and inside pages, O'Neal focuses on the front and back covers. As she searches for the perfect font, her Shih Tzu, August, sits at her feet.
The Sade station on Pandora Radio gets O'Neal in the zone. On really hard days, when the grieving families and Baltimore's violence can't escape her thoughts, she listens to gospel.
"Sometimes, I just need to know it's going to be OK," she said.
For Malachi's program, she said, she worked in silence.
Though O'Neal partners with some funeral homes, most of her business is word of mouth.
Rosalind Jones heard about O'Neal in 2012 and asked her to create a program for her father's funeral. Since then, Jones has enlisted O'Neal for four more funeral programs, graduation announcements and party decorations.
"You never get the same thing," Jones said. "It's something that fits the circumstances and fits the person. And it's something that you'll always remember."
Jones, a lifelong West Baltimore resident, has become a friend.
A mother of two sons, 17 and 26 years old, O'Neal can't help but dwell on Baltimore's violence. Sometimes, in her dreams, she envisions losing them.
"I know the death rate has increased because I don't get my days off," she said. Her business averages about 45 programs a month, O'Neal said.
O'Neal's aunt, Serrina Boone, works with her niece and can remember more than once dropping off programs at 1 or 2 in the morning.
"We honor their needs and make sure they're fulfilled," Boone said about the business. "The need is there, and we picked up on that need."
Recently, O'Neal invested in a van for Memorial Programs by Shawnie O. If a family member can't get downtown for a consultation, her team can still provide services.
"You have to meet people where they are," she said. "It's hard to put a price tag on death. But I have the spirit for this."

Texto completo: Woodstock was big and messy, thrilling and stirring - and summed up finally by Jimi Hendrix, whose festival-closing set included his towering, take-a-knee reading of the national anthem. It was' an admixture of disaffection and patriotism, bold as love and Black as hell. But Hendrix was one of the few Black musicians at an event that has become a cultural touchstone for white America.
A hundred miles to the south of that sprawling rural rock 'n' roll assembly, Black folks were building their own musical commons. The Harlem Cultural Festival of that year, which would come to be known as "Black Woodstock," had, on its surface, little in common with the upstate hootenanny. Held in Harlem at Mount Morris (what is now Marcus Garvey) Park, it was a self-consciously urban affair, a concert series rather than a one-off, and already in its third year.
Co-sponsored by the New York City Parks Department and Maxwell House, the General Foods subsidiary, that year's festival consisted of six free Sunday afternoon concerts held between June 29 and Aug. 24. The total attendance was some 300,000 people strong.
With the Caribbean singer Tony Lawrence at its helm, the festival was a sustained, communal activity and cultural interaction in which enterprising street vendors got what The New York Times referred to as their "legitimate hustle" on. A vibrant cross section of city folk - brothers in dashikis (like Jesse Jackson, who spoke at one of the concerts), young sisters in smart shifts and older ones in church hats, men in fedoras and well-pressed, button-up shirts - all listened with a combination of focus and ease.
"The scale and the diversity of the audience" was a thing to behold, said Neal Ludevig, the curator and co-producer of this year's 50th anniversary "Black Woodstock" event.
Iterations of the Harlem Cultural Festival were held in 1967 and 1968, but the 1969 events were the apex. Atop the rocks and down in the grassy field, they were showing up to watch a roll call of Black popular music luminaries move through tight sets covering beloved repertoires.
This was Harlem's sonic playground, and it featured the likes of the gospel crossover sensation Edwin Hawkins, the blues icon B.B. King, the avant-garde jazz activists Abbey Lincoln and Max Roach, the South African trumpeter Hugh Masekela, the groovy Black pop ambassadors The 5th Dimension, the Motown up-and-comers Gladys Knight and the Pips and a youthful Stevie Wonder. The comic vets Moms Mabley and Pigmeat Markham supplied the standup relief. And the crowds responded - looking on reverentially, dancing with one another around the edges of the park.
Photos from The Times' archive capture the reverberations of an event that was a casual thing of beauty, where Black folks moved en masse through the streets and into the park, improvisationally responding to one another, forming circles of joy and conviviality and reveling in outdoor leisure.
One shot from the 1967 festival stands out for its crisp-ness and arresting power. It features a girl - donning high summertime attire, a sleeveless top and shorts, hair braided to the back - hugging the railing to the stage, leaning in - looking. She's watching something before her. Someone is holding her attention, maybe dazzling her imagination.
Excerpts from the TV producer Hal Tulchin's 40 hours of footage of the 1969 festival (which remain largely unseen) show a reverential crowd, keeping time with Nina Simone, the "High Priestess of Soul," as she opened her four-song set on Aug. 17 with a new single, "Revolution." It was a country-meets-Tin Pan Alley protest jam informing white folks that "The only way that we can stand in fact / Is when you get your foot off our back" - bluntly capturing the sentiment of the moment. (Simone closed out her performance by reading the fiery poem "Are You Ready, Black People?" The Last Poets' David Nelson's spoken-word call-to-action, asking of the crowd, "Are you ready to smash white things, to burn buildings?")
Tensions had been running high in the city from spring into summer as the first anniversary of Martin Luther King Jr.'s assassination passed and 21 Black Panthers were indicted on charges of planning a bombing campaign across Manhattan to mark the occasion. The police even refused to provide security for the event, and the Panthers stepped in to fill the void.
The people showed up to a concert experience that thrived amid grief and persistent rage. Backed by a reform-minded Mayor John Lindsay, who'd built avenues of trust in Harlem by walking its streets on more than one occasion, the festival stood as a symbol of hope and everyday place-making. Lindsay's belief that "We can lick the problems of the ghetto, if we care," morphed into the concert poster's slogan, "Do you care?" Lindsay was introduced as "the blue-eyed soul brother," and the gospel great Mahalia Jackson - who would join the vocal powerhouse Mavis Staples for a duet - spoke confidently of his impending victory.
Those who turned out in Harlem bucked the malicious stereotype of "the Black mob." They gathered peacefully with no incident - conjuring an energy akin to that of their Bethel, New York, hippie brethren - open and ready to ride the wave of a local Black sound Utopia. They were the living embodiment of Sly and the Family Stone's "everyday people." From 1972's Wattstax in Los Angeles to 1973's Soul at the Center events at Lincoln Center, from Diana Ross' heroic 1983 rain-soaked performance in Central Park to Dave Chappelle's 2004 rousing neo-soul-fights-neoliber-al-gentrification Block Party, the idea of the large-scale African-American pop concert as community revival, sustenance, triumph and renewal is a recurring phenomenon.
The Harlem Cultural Festival was arguably one of the first of its kind to promote Black pop as a transformative urban event, as a site to be inhabited as well as a sound to be experienced, and the key to new neighborhood connections and collaborations. As the curator Ludevig observed, there remains the "irreplaceable notion that you cannot replace the live experience ... there's something about being in a space and experiencing it firsthand ..." that is utterly singular and potentially restorative in the life of a community. For Black folks, the added power and energy of coming together in a place where one could not only see, hear and feel Blackness onstage but also participate in a marketplace of neighborhood business owners was its own form of sustainability.
Such a legacy lives on most notably in today's venerable and beloved Afropunk festival (which is not affiliated with the 50th anniversary Harlem Cultural Festival event). Now a global phenomenon in its 15th year, Afropunk's Brooklyn extravaganza began as "a social experiment," according to Matthew Morgan, one of the founders. To Morgan, the center of community "is a marketplace, a business, and a way for people to trade," which is why his concerts, like the Harlem event half a century ago, place so much emphasis on not just music but Black business and "socioeconomic empowerment."
It's a spirit as old school as peace and love. But here it's infused with Afrofuturist language and sensibilities of the now, a belief in the insurgent possibility of "the Black hacker" who "disrupts the network," "codes the culture" and "erodes the grid erected as a cage," as Morgan puts it, all in the pursuit of vibrant new-world building.
Surely some of the seeds for such a movement were planted in 1969, particularly when Simone chose as her final song a felt and pointed rendition of another new number, one she'd written in honor of her dear friend, the playwright Lorraine Hansberry, who had died some four years earlier. A love letter to the next generation and a book of instruction, "To Be Young Gifted and Black" was the kind of anthem meant to reach that little girl in the crowd who was hanging on her every word. "Open your heart to what I mean," sang Simone. "We must begin to tell our young / There's a world waiting for you / Yours is the quest that's just begun." Out on the field, as she emphatically reminded the masses that "your soul's intact," the universe was wide open. - (The New York Times)

Overstock CEO gave info to DOJ for John Durham's review of Russia investigation origins

Texto completo: Former Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne said he has provided information to the Justice Department for its investigation into the origins of the Russia investigation.
In multiple interviews Thursday, following his exit from the e-commerce retailer he led for two decades, Byrne described how he was an informant for the FBI and later turned to Attorney General William Barr when he felt that he had become part of a "deep state" plot.
Byrne told Fox News that he has provided documents that made their way to U.S. Attorney John Durham, whom Barr has tasked with leading the review of the DOJ's and FBI's conduct in the early stages of the inquiry into the Trump campaign's ties to Russia.
In an interview with CNN, Byrne said he fed his information to the DOJ on Apr. 5 and Apr. 30, after which it was revealed that Durham had been asked to determine if there was any wrongdoing at the genesis of the Trump-Russia probe.
The 57-year-old multimillionaire resigned as CEO on Thursday, saying it was best for Overstock. The company saw its shares plummet more than 30% after he publicly detailed his involvement in the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.
Byrne claimed that beginning in 2015, the FBI reached out to him for help in conducting law enforcement activities. He said he later discovered that he was being used in a "political espionage" effort targeting Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton, Sen. Marco Rubio, and Sen. Ted Cruz. Byrne also said he liked former President Barack Obama and did not vote for Trump.
Byrne said he received orders down the pipeline from former FBI agent Peter Strzok, who played key roles in the Clinton emails and Russia investigations. Strzok was removed from special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation after it was discovered he exchanged anti-Trump text messages with former FBI lawyer Lisa Page, with whom he was having an affair, and was fired last year. Byrne said federal officials confirmed with him that it was Strzok who gave him orders.
Claiming the bureau was "hijacked from the top," Byrne also named former FBI Director James Comey and Deputy Director Andrew McCabe as being aware of his role. He told CNN host Chris Cuomo, who asked about proof, that he is "highly confident" Barr will be naming the three former FBI officials in an indictment in the near future.iFrame ObjectThe Washington Examiner reached out to the FBI, DOJ, and Strzok's lawyer. The FBI and Strzok's lawyer declined to comment, while the DOJ did not immediately return the request for comment
Byrne said he is not the only "whistleblower" coming forward, and asserted that Clinton's supporters in Hollywood were targets of spying.
As Byrne faced questions from skeptical interviewers on Thursday, CNN reported that a U.S. official confirmed that Byrne shared information about the early stages of the Russia investigation during a meeting earlier this year. This source said Justice officials found part of Byrne's story to be credible because what he was saying was not widely known.
Byrne is the latest person to emerge as a possible FBI informant used over the course of the counterintelligence investigation into Trump's campaign. Another one of these individuals is Stefan Halper, a 75-year-old Cambridge professor who reportedly had discussions with at least three Trump campaign members: foreign policy aides George Papadopoulos, Carter Page, and Trump campaign co-chairman Sam Clovis. The New York Times reported in April that the Justice Department inspector general was looking into his actions to see if he exceeded the scope of his assignment.
Byrne first revealed a couple weeks ago to the Washington Examiner his claim that he engaged in a sexual relationship with Russian spy Maria Butina at the encouragement of the FBI, but did not rekindle the romantic aspect of their relationship when asked to do so as the Russia investigation progressed. Byrne said he had been swept up in “political espionage" and a "deep state" plot. Butina was sentenced in April to 18 months in prison for conspiring with a senior Russian official to infiltrate conservative American political circles and influence U.S. relations with Russia.
Byrne, who claimed he was offered a $1 billion "bribe" to keep quiet, said he received advice from billionaire investor Warren Buffett, whom he called his "rabbi," and chose to come forward because he felt guilty, tying the decision to the recent wave of deadly mass shootings.
“The issue is, I realized that these orders I got came from Peter Strzok, and as I put together things, I know much more than I should know and tried to keep silent,” he told Fox Business. “This country has gone nuts, and especially for the last year when I realized what I know, every time I see one of these things, somebody drives 600 miles to gun down 20 strangers in the mall, I guess I feel a bit responsible.”iFrame ObjectiFrame Object

Daily on Healthcare, Presented by American Association of Kidney Patients: 'Medicare for all' plan politically poisonous to Senate Democrats in key races

‘MEDICARE FOR ALL’ POLITICALLY POISONOUS TO SENATE DEMOCRATS IN KEY RACES: Senate Democrats, increasingly bullish on their 2020 chances, want no part of "Medicare for all" proposals being pushed by far-left populist presidential contenders, writes our senior campaign reporter Kerry Picket.
Four recent polls show that a majority of Americans do not support the proposal after finding out it would do away with their private health insurance.
Originally championed by Bernie Sanders and co-sponsored by fellow Democratic presidential primary contenders, the "Medicare for all" legislation is seen as a loser proposal that could hurt down-ballot Democratic races in both chambers.
It’s a particularly sensitive area in the Senate, where Democrats are looking to end the Republicans' 53-47 majority. House Democratic leadership also has steered clear of bringing a "Medicare for all" bill to the floor out of fear that it could hurt their members in swing districts and endanger their chances of keeping their majority in the chamber.
“I think it’s a losing message for 2020, and I think the Democratic presidential candidates have to realize that this is not a far-left country nor is it a far-right country,” Anthony Brindisi, a freshman congressman in a New York swing district, told reporters. “I think we’re all very vulnerable the further to the left some of the presidential candidates go.”
Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin of Illinois recently told the Washington Examiner that nominating a candidate such as Sanders or Elizabeth Warren could "jeopardize" the party's chances of winning over independent centrist voters in the general election.
In Colorado, where Republican Senator Cory Gardner is seen by Democrats as vulnerable this election cycle, "Medicare for all" is not widely accepted by the party faithful. Former Governor John Hickenlooper, who has announced he will run against Gardner, raised concerns about “Medicare for all” ahead of his presidential race, which ended last week. Colorado Democratic Senator Michael Bennet, another presidential primary candidate, has distanced himself from the proposal.
There's also some recent precedent to Democrats distancing themselves from the proposal.
During the 2018 midterm election, Kyrsten Sinema, then a Democratic congresswoman from Arizona, ran a successful Senate campaign and flipped a Republican seat while running in opposition to "Medicare for all."
“I do not support 'Medicare for all,'” Sinema told reporters at the time. “I'm really focused on solutions that are realistic and pragmatic and we can get done.” Read more.

BIDEN PROMISES UNION WORKERS THEY’LL BE ABLE TO KEEP PRIVATE HEALTH PLANS: Presidential hopeful Joe Biden promised union members uneasy about Medicare for All that they will be able to keep their negotiated plans under his healthcare proposal. "You've worked like hell, you gave up wages for it," Biden said at the Iowa Federation of Labor conference. Biden has promised to improve the Affordable Care Act and opposes the Medicare for All Act.
OPINION: SANDERS' NEW SPECIAL CARVE OUT FOR UNIONS UNDERMINES CASE FOR HIS SOCIALIZED HEALTH PLAN: By the Washington Examiner's Phil Klein. The Democratic presidential contender has altered his healthcare proposal to assuage unions, who are wary about losing generous health insurance plans that they negotiated, often at the cost of higher salaries. But introducing a carveout for a favored special interest group undermines the moral case for his plan and his candidacy — and would ultimately prove untenable.
HHS HOPES TO REVIVE A RULE TO PUT DRUG PRICES ON PHARMA TV ADS: The Department of Health and Human Services said Wednesday it would seek to reverse a federal judge’s decision to block the rule announced in May that mandated pharmaceutical companies display their drug’s list prices in commercials if prices exceed $35 per month. District Judge Amit Mehta ruled in July that HHS did not have the authority to pass the rule. The agency submitted a notice of appeal to the DC district court in an effort to revive the May rule.
TRUMP TO WIPE OUT FEDERAL STUDENT DEBT FOR DISABLED VETERANS: President Trump will "eliminate every penny of federal student loan debt owed by American veterans who are completely and permanently disabled” in a new executive memorandum that he announced Wednesday. The order will benefit about 25,000 wounded veterans, and forgiven debt will not be federally taxed. Trump said he is also working to convince states to eliminate state taxes on forgiven debt.
TRUMP MOVES TO ALLOW INDEFINITE DETENTION OF MIGRANT CHILDREN: The Trump administration announced Wednesday that it would do away with the 20-day limit to detain migrant children, which allowed families to stay together outside of detention centers while their cases are considered. Trump has long derided this policy as a “catch and release” program. White House officials said they will introduce their own version of the Flores Settlement, which requires that children be held in the least restrictive settings possible, and will work to keep children with their parents.
CONSUMER DNA TESTS REVEAL SEVERAL DOCTORS USED THEIR OWN SPERM TO ARTIFICIALLY INSEMINATE WOMEN: Multiple children have been born whose DNA doesn’t match that of an anonymous or selected donor, but rather that of the doctor who helped their parents perform the procedure, according to a New York Times investigation. For example, Eve Wiley was 16 when her mother told her that she had been conceived through artificial insemination. Wiley, now 32, took a DNA test years later and found her biological father was actually Dr. Kim McMorries, the man whom Wiley’s mother had asked to help find a sperm donor.
INTERNET SENSATION DOUG THE PUG JOINS THE FIGHT AGAINST TEEN VAPING: Famous pup Doug the Pug will be featured in an anti-Juul advocacy PSA that will air during the MTV Video Music Awards on Monday. The 30-second ad, entitled “Tested on Humans,” will feature other animals including a lion, an elephant, and several lemurs. “No one knows the long term effects of Juuling, so any human who uses one is being used as a lab rat,” one of three rats says while holding a sign that reads ‘RATS AGAINST HUMAN TESTING.’”

Texto completo: A recession looms, and the nation’s CEOs are growing fearful.
It isn’t the potential of downturn itself that has them alarmed — downturns come and downturns go, but whatever happens, chief executives, like cats, tend to land on their comfortably padded feet.
Instead, the cause of their fear appears to be something more fundamental. As Alan Murray, the CEO of Fortune, writes in a cover story chronicling the C-suite anxiety: “More and more CEOs worry that public support for the system in which they’ve operated is in danger of disappearing.” They’re worried that when the next recession breaks, revolution might, too. This could be the hour that the ship comes in: The coming recession might finally prompt the masses to sharpen their pitchforks and demand a reckoning.
Company executives are right to worry. A downturn will mark the end of a record period of uninterrupted economic expansion. The U.S. economy has been growing for more than a decade, stock indexes recently hit new highs, and the unemployment rate is at a 50-year low.
And yet the vast majority of Americans will not look back on the past decade as years of fat and plenty. This was a gilded expansion, a decade of creaking wage growth and profoundly unequal outcomes. The number of Americans receiving food stamps is 40% higher now than in 2008, yet we have twice as many billionaires as we did a decade ago.
This was an expansion driven by outsized gains to a handful of “superstar” firms in “superstar” cities. Economic devastation reigned in rural areas alongside catastrophic success in urban ones — an expansion marked by housing crunches and infrastructure nightmares that every level of government seems incapable of addressing. Corporate profits grew as if there were no tomorrow, but they didn’t trickle down to everyone else. Instead, dividends and stock buybacks got bigger while CEO pay went through the rose-gold roof. The rest of us got smartphones, money-losing conveniences — Uber, WeWork, Netflix and meal delivery apps — and mountains of student debt.
And so, when recession comes, we’ll be right to ask: Was that it? Is this the best it gets? And if so, isn’t it time to go full Elizabeth Warren — to make some fundamental, radical changes to how the U.S. economy works, so that we might prevent decades more of growth that disproportionally benefits the titans among us?
But the CEOs now have a plan to head off revolution. They want you to know: Actually, they really do care about the world. Like, a lot.
This week, in a statement widely feted by well-meaning Davos types, the Business Roundtable — an association of chief executives of nearly 200 companies, including Apple, Amazon, General Motors and Walmart — declared that the era of soulless corporatism was over. The Business Roundtable once held that a corporation’s “paramount duty” was to its shareholders. Now, the Roundtable is singing a new, more inclusive tune. A corporation, it says, should balance the interests of its shareholders with those of other “stakeholders,” including customers, employees, suppliers and local communities.
In other words: no more Mr. Terrible Guy. Corporations are people, my friend, and it turns out that they’re really nice people, both interesting and interested, and we really must have them over for dinner sometime.
I spent a tedious few minutes this week trying to come up with an analogy to convey how thoroughly empty I found the Roundtable’s gesture to be. I think I got one: Imagine a co-worker has been stealing your lunch from the office fridge for years. Then, one day, he strolls in with a big grin and grand announcement. Maybe he unfolds a scroll and blows a trumpet. He has realized that “lunch maximization” might not have been the best approach after all, and he will now try to be aware of the wider consequences of some of his actions. Yes, he still really wants your lunch. Yes, he will probably still fight any efforts to prevent him from taking your lunch. But you should know that he also feels a tinge bad about how it’s all worked out. So, no hard feelings?
I mean: Yay? It’s nice that CEOs have vowed to turn over a new leaf. But their statement lacks any call for greater structural changes in the U.S. economy — changes to how companies are taxed or regulated, or how executives are paid, or how they should be judged.
And because a public corporation’s most direct incentives — including the CEO’s pay — remain tied to stock performance, there’s no reason to believe that corporations will voluntarily move away from pleasing shareholders alone, despite the new, high-minded ideals. In fact, the fanfare surrounding the Roundtable’s empty statement could be read as an effort to stave off structural economic reform rather than accelerate it. It’s a way for the CEOs to tell us that they’re on the case, so we don’t have to resort to something unthinkable, like a Warren presidency.
If I sound cynical, it’s only because I’m not a complete idiot. In the Donald Trump era, America’s CEOs have become masterful at talking out of both sides of their mouths. They’ll rush to issue virtue-signaling denunciations of the latest outrage from Trump in order to please their woke, restless customer bases, while on the down low, they’ll champion his tax cuts and regulatory dismantling. And when the president gets too rowdy, they’ll tell him to knock it off over a friendly dinner.
It’s all a game to the moguls in charge. Their greatest fear is that we’ll stop playing.

His iPhone Is a Work Tool, and Only a Work Tool

Texto completo: How do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? Conor Dougherty, who covers economics from San Francisco, discussed the tech he's using.
What tech tools do you rely on most to do your reporting?
This isn't very remarkable or unexpected, but I spend a lot of time on news apps. Throughout the day I cycle through The San Francisco Chronicle, The Los Angeles Times, The Wall Street Journal, East Bay Times, three of California's Bees (Sacramento, Fresno, Modesto) and, of course, The New York Times.
I also read and listen to a lot of books, so I spend a lot of time on the Audible app. In the case of really important books that I'm using for research, I'll buy the print book and shift between reading it in print and listening on my phone. (I have a monthly subscription to Audible and a lot of unused credits, so it feels as if my audiobooks are free even though they're anything but.)
That's a lot of news.
Yes, I've packed my phone with news so that I use it less.
Wait, what?
Yeah, so, there's a catch. The catch is that I have zero social media on my phone. Like a lot of people, I've been trying to look at my phone less and to have a better work/life balance. In the past I tried some of those phone monitoring apps but didn't find them helpful. Instead I hit on what you might call a design solution, which is to curate my phone so that it's mostly a work tool.
I cover California and the economy and have to read news for work, so the mental bargain I've made with myself is that I can use my phone as much or as long as I want -- so long as I'm reading books or news. Aside from news, Audible, and service-type things like maps and airline apps, I have nothing on my phone. I even disabled the browser. I find this keeps me mostly sane and mostly productive.
How so?
A decent definition of technology is any sort of machine or process that helps people do more or better work, so my basic rule of phone curation is: Things that help me work stay on my phone and things that don't, don't.
Technology is a hard balance for everyone these days, but it's especially hard for reporters, who in the pursuit of readers and stories can convince themselves that Twitter wars ("being part of the conversation") and YouTube holes ("cultural research") are productive uses of time. My biggest problem with social media is that sometimes I used it for work and sometimes I used it to goof off, and somewhere along the way I lost track of which was which.
Don't get me wrong: I love wasting time. I just prefer to waste it on things like beer, skateboarding and video games (some of my favorite weekend activities) instead of an argument with someone I've never met (and who probably isn't even who they say they are) on Twitter.
I still use my phone too much, but I use it less than I did before and naturally get bored of it because I don't have an endless stream of feeds as you do with social media. Even though news apps are updated constantly, there are really only a handful of significant stories on any given day, so I have some semblance of completion after I've cycled through a few of them.
Plus, most reporters spend a lot of time on social media, and not that many read lots of hyperlocal news. I get a lot of great story ideas just scanning various small papers and trying to put the pieces together and looking for emerging trends. I once wrote a story about a single house in Berkeley, Calif., whose long and complicated story held various important lessons about how California dug itself into a horrific housing crisis. The germ of that idea came from reading about a bunch of contentious City Council meetings.
But reading is only part of your job.
Indeed. I also interview a lot of people and lately have developed an expensive addiction to transcription apps.
I've tried several, but the one I use the most is Rev. It costs about $ 1 per minute, more for rush orders. I find that I do better interviews when I don't have to stress out about writing quotes exactly right, but transcription takes forever. This solves that. It's probably the most useful tech tool I've ever come across. I can't say enough good things about transcription, with the only downside being cost.
Are you worried about privacy?
Not really. I use Rev only to transcribe on-the-record interviews. I turn off my recorder when people go off the record.
So your phone has reading tools and reporting tools. Do you have writing tools, too?
Actually none. With the exception of breaking news, which I write with a keyboard and in a fugue state, I start all my stories longhand on yellow legal pads.
Longhand!
Writing is all about getting started and keeping going, so whatever system helps you do that is the best system for you. In my case that's paper, preferably yellow, but I can be flexible on that one.
When I'm typing on a keyboard, I have that thing that a lot of people have where they compulsively backspace and correct things until each sentence is clean, which is great in editing but messes up the flow of first draft composition. Word processors are sort of paralyzing to me. Whenever those squiggly green and red lines pop up to remind me to check grammar and spelling, I find myself sitting there and fiddling until the marks go away and I can begin a clean new sentence.
At one point I looked into getting the Freewrite keyboard, but it seemed a little expensive, and at this point I've gotten so used to writing my first drafts longhand that I feel that typing would mess up my rhythm.
You're very particular.
I'm very social and easily distracted -- I love chatting with my colleagues, though I'm not sure if they love it back -- so when it's time to really go for it, I try to create conditions that help me do better and more efficient work.
The best conditions are what I might call manufactured silence. In the days before a big deadline, I have this little system where I print out all my notes and go into a conference room with a stopwatch ( $ 5.99 on Amazon) and put on a set of ear protectors (the kind people use at a gun range) and outline the story on paper, then write the first draft longhand. No phones or computers allowed.
Later I enter what I've got into a word processor, which doesn't feel like a waste of time because it's sort of like the first round of self-editing.
Anything else?
Sticky notes are also great. I put a lot of sticky notes in my books.

Texto completo: As a freshman in college, after the Las Vegas shooting in 2017, I wrote a poem titled "Please Mr. President" that was published in The New York Times and then the Daily Herald.
I clung to an idealism meant for storybooks, addressing an envelope with my poem to the White House, half-believing that our president would read and share my words.
He didn’t. I’m still not sure why I was surprised.
I’d directed my hope and plea for change at our president. Two years later, I’ve come to realize that my hopes and pleas mean nothing to the people in power.
When I was 14 years old, standing in my kitchen, my parents told me about the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School. We reached the absolute worst — a massacre of children — in 2012, and then because the leaders of our country placed priority on other matters, we watched Las Vegas happen.
We watched Parkland happen. And then Sante Fe. And then Pittsburgh. And then Virginia Beach.
Most recently, we learned that 22 people were gunned down in El Paso, Texas, and another nine in Dayton, Ohio.
I have friends in Dayton and in Texas. I was scared for them.
I was scared for all of us.
Each time a tragic event occurs, we follow a script that begins with well-meaning words from people in power and ends without action. During a vigil in Dayton, Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine’s words were overshadowed by people shouting, "Do something."
This discussion has been under way for a long time, but it’s difficult to move forward when progress is stalled by one excuse or another. It’s difficult to prioritize empathy, integrity and a sense of moral responsibility in a dialogue where money seems to supersede everything else.
Lately, politicians and civilians alike have resorted to blaming particular groups of people, hoping to pinpoint the problem and shift blame. We don’t have time for that. We have allowed the analysis, blaming and media coverage of mass shootings to become a partisan issue.
Yet it always has been, and will remain, a moral issue in which politics has no place. Set aside the right and left for a moment and realize that our own people are dying because of these divisions.
America, we must bind together and demand that this violence ends. We are blessed to look at that flag of red, white and blue fluttering in the breeze and remember the strength and power it represents.
America, we have so much potential for good, but we each have to want it.
A little over a week ago at Wrigley Field, I rose for the national anthem, feeling hopeful and hopeless at the same time. I watched our American flag fly at half-staff in light of the Ohio and Texas shootings.
In a moment void of partisan politics, I listened to acoustic guitar notes and patriotic lyrics waft over the baseball diamond. I watched 40,000 baseball fans rise together, bound by a pride and love for our nation.
It was one of the most beautiful things I have ever seen.
It was during those few moments that I realized we each owe it to ourselves and our country to start demanding changes immediately.
The time for politicians’ well-meaning words is over. People are tired of well-meaning words because well-meaning words represent a fear to do something more.
America, I don’t want to appeal to the emotions of Congress or the president. I want to appeal to you. To your emotions and your hearts.
To the parents who send their kids on buses to school, trusting each day that their children’s education will not be compromised because of gun violence. To the families taking their kids to the movies, to concerts, to shopping malls, praying that their city won’t be in the headlines the next day because of gun violence.
I don’t think it wise for any of us to wait for Congress to change its predictable pattern. It has been given ample chances to step forward and make concrete changes to prevent gun violence. It won’t bring changes to the table on its own.
And if it won’t, then America, we must.
The movement for change starts from the ground up, and it starts with the people. And not just the people or towns affected by gun violence but every person in every city. So let’s start with the small steps.
We can fill the inboxes of congressmen and women with requests for new laws. We can write letters to senators asking for sessions on gun regulation. We can speak peacefully and directly to our governors about taking action to solve this problem instead of talking about it, just as a group of people did during Gov. DeWine’s speech.
Countless gun reform groups are already advocating for change. Everytown for Gun Safety, started in 2006, has nearly 6 million supporters. America, we can join them.
For the safety and protection of our citizens, we each must step forward and speak until the people in power cannot ignore us.

Free college deserves debate

Texto completo: The more we debate in the open about things like college affordability, college access, skills gaps and entitlements the better. A broad discussion on ideas is welcomed, but then we must address the practical matters to make sure the proposed solution solves the right problem.
As president of Lakeshore Technical College, an open-access institution, I have a firm belief in the value of higher education — more people should go to community colleges like LTC, not fewer. In fact, it is hard to argue against post-high school education being anything but critical to achieving the American Dream.
The Georgetown Center for Education and the Workforce estimates that in 1979, workers with a high school diploma or less filled about 65% of good manufacturing jobs. Today, only 30% of those jobs go to workers without a college credential. This trend will continue as all employers, not just manufacturers, automate and processes become more integrated.
A topic of frequent discussion in the Democratic presidential primary has been "free college." Higher education is a meaningful topic, and getting more people to college is a focal point this presidential election season.
As the discussion on "free college" unfolds, we will want to understand, of course, how a program of this nature would be funded, but we should also pay careful attention to four things.
First, the primary driver for "free college" proposals is college affordability — there is more than $1.6 trillion in outstanding student loan debt. College graduates and college dropouts carrying this massive debt are not able to meaningfully participate in the economy and are delaying major financial milestones. This is problematic, but when we look deeper at this problem we see a greater amount of student debt resulting from attendance at for-profit colleges. In 2015, the Atlantic published an article identifying for-profit colleges as "fueling the student loan crisis." More recently, a New York Times article identified graduate schools as the biggest offenders in creating enormous student debt. If select institutions (for-profit colleges and graduate schools) are largely responsible for the crisis, it seems like the solution to the problem should be more targeted.
Second, would all programs at every college be free? If so, should they? We have a significant workforce shortage here in the Lakeshore community and across the country. Do we need philosophy and literature graduates? We absolutely do, but we need computer science, CNC technicians, electro-mechanical technicians and HVAC technician graduates more. Having a conversation about targeting financial aid to meet the most pressing workforce needs of our country is worthwhile. Tennessee had this discussion when it implemented the Tennessee Promise, which provides scholarships for the state's 13 community colleges and 27 colleges of applied technology.
Third, there are programs in place locally accomplishing the intent of free college through public/private partnerships. LTC's Promise scholarship program for high school seniors, Federal Pell Grants that cover all tuition for eligible financial aid applicants, and companies providing tuition reimbursement programs for their employees all fulfill the need for "free college" for the most economically disadvantaged in our community. What value-add does a sweeping federal policy bring?
Fourth, financial aid is limited to students pursuing traditional college degrees. Would "free college" follow the same model? If so, "free college" would not address the needs of a larger percentage of our workforce and employers. Most of our employers need specific skills, attainable through short-term credentials, but those credentials are not eligible for financial aid. Why would we want to pay for more college credits than may be needed ? Taxpayers will want a solution that is effective and efficient, and it's important to know that the traditional college route may not be the best one.
The more we debate in the open about things like college affordability, college access, skills gaps and entitlements the better. A broad discussion on ideas is welcomed, but then we must address the practical matters to make sure the proposed solution solves the right problem. We look forward to hearing more detailed policy discussions in the future.

Tree-planting initiative shows us what we can accomplish

Texto completo: We've come to expect that reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) - the U.N.'s panel of climate experts from around the world - will not lead with good news, and the report released last week was no exception.
The New York Times' headline on its story about the IPCC report was "Climate Change Threatens the World's Food Supply, United Nations Warns." The report discussed how loss of productive soil threatens food production in many countries, and that climate change - with the higher temperatures it's causing and extreme weather to which it's contributing - will make matters worse.
The report was not all doom and gloom, however. It offered several suggestions, most of which will require systemwide changes, such as more efficient agricultural practices and less food waste. But one of the suggestions is very straightforward: plant more trees. Lots of them.
In fact, the IPCC said that most of the modeled pathways that limit warming below disastrous levels "require different combinations of reforestation, afforestation, reduced deforestation, and bioenergy (high confidence)."
We've always known that trees are good at sequestering carbon, because they absorb lots of carbon dioxide and can live for decades. What is becoming increasingly clear is that massive tree-planting around the world can help fend off climate disaster. A new study found that planting one trillion trees would cut carbon in the atmosphere by 25%, an immense reduction.
Now, planting one trillion trees is a huge undertaking. We know that planting that many trees will not happen anytime soon.
But the people of Ethiopia planted 350 million sapling trees in a single day last month. The Ethiopian Prime Minister's Green Legacy Initiative aims to plant 4 billion trees by the end of 2019.
In the United States, it's been a long time since we had such a major tree-planting initiative.
The Civilian Conservation Corps planted more than 3 billion trees in the 1930s and 1940s. The CCC is responsible for over half of the reforestation, both public and private, done in the country's history.
Using the CCC as a model, youth conservation programs in the western U.S. have become very proficient at planting trees, especially in state and national parks. I've estimated that $10 million could fund the planting of 40 million trees in a single year. The trees planted in three years would sequester carbon equal to the emissions of more than one million cars.
Trees are not a silver bullet for the climate crisis. Significant emissions reductions are the most important part of a strategy to avoid a climate crisis.
But planting trees can help. Most of all, it's something we all can do now, without government action - at our own homes and in our communities. As Live Science said recently, if we want to save the world from climate change, we should "grab some seeds, or some seedlings, and start planting trees like there's no tomorrow."

Wells Fargo charged fees on closed accounts

Texto completo: Xavier Einaudi did not want to wait for Wells Fargo to send him a check.
The bank informed Einaudi that it was closing all 13 of the checking accounts it provided his roofing company, CRV Construction, for a reason it called “confidential.” The letter said the accounts would be closed on June 27, and he would be mailed a check for the balance in his accounts.
Einaudi went to his branch and collected the money, so he did not have to wait for a check to arrive in the mail. But the accounts did not close on the preset date.
For weeks after the date the bank said the accounts would be closed, it kept some of them active. Payments to his insurer, to Google for online advertising and to a provider of project management software were paid out of the empty accounts in July. Each time, the bank charged Einaudi a $35 overdraft fee.
Einaudi called the bank’s customer service line. He went to his local branch. Nobody could help him. “They told me, ‘The accounts are closed out — we cannot do anything,’” he said.
By the middle of July, he owed the bank nearly $1,500.
“I don’t even know what happened,” he said.
Current and former bank employees said Einaudi got charged because of the way Wells Fargo’s computer system handles closed accounts: An account the customer believes to be closed can stay open if it has a balance, even one below zero. And each time a transaction is processed for an overdrawn account, Wells Fargo tacks on a fee.
The problem has gone unaddressed by the bank despite complaints from customers and employees, including one in the bank’s debt-collection department who grew concerned after taking in an estimated $100,000 in overdraft fees over eight months. It is not clear how many people have been affected, but aggrieved customers have brought complaints to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, griped on the discussion sites Reddit and Quora and voiced their displeasure through the “Community” section of Wells Fargo’s website — a public comment feature that is now disabled.
A spokesman for the bank said he could not comment on specific accounts for privacy reasons, but said the bank reviews accounts to protect customers and was “committed to doing so in ways that minimize the risk and impact to our customers.”
“As a company, we are focused on continually improving this process,” said the spokesman, Jim Seitz.
Wells Fargo takes employee complaints seriously, Seitz said, and encourages clients to engage directly with it to fix problems. “Wells Fargo works hard to foster a culture that is centered on doing what is right for our customers and exhibiting high ethical standards and integrity,” he said.
Wells Fargo has been trying to rebuild its credibility after a series of scandals. The bank has paid more than $15 billion in settlements since the financial crisis to resolve investigations into misdeeds including the creation of fraudulent accounts in customers’ names and requirements that auto-loan borrowers pay for unnecessary insurance.
The bank is searching for a new chief executive after its previous chief became a lightning rod for critics in Congress, and it is still operating under restrictions imposed by the Federal Reserve that bar it from increasing its assets until it improves its oversight practices.
Wells Fargo’s customers have complained about reopened accounts, but banks can have a good reason to reactivate an account. Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase warn their customers — albeit in fine print — of the possibility that their accounts could be reopened if, for example, the bank receives a deposit bound for a closed account.
When Wells Fargo decides it will close an account, it usually informs customers in a letter that lists two important dates. The first is the date deposits can no longer be accepted. The second, which is two weeks after the first, is the date after which no more withdrawals will be honored and the account will be closed.
“Any payments you make to others that are automatically withdrawn from your accounts will be discontinued after your accounts are closed,” the letter says. The New York Times reviewed four such letters.
But two current and two former employees said Wells Fargo had set up its computer system to keep such accounts open if they have a balance — whether positive or negative — even after the closing date.
Most banks program their systems to stop honoring transactions on the specified date, but Wells Fargo allows accounts to remain open for two more months, according to current and former employees. Customers usually learn what happened only after their overdrawn accounts are sent to Wells Fargo’s collections department.
If the customers do not pay the overdraft fees, they are reported to a national database like Early Warning Services, which compiles names of delinquent bank customers. That often means a customer cannot open a new bank account anywhere, and getting removed from the lists can take hours’ worth of phone calls.
One current Wells Fargo employee who spoke on the condition of anonymity said two workers in a debt-collection office complained about the problem through the bank’s anonymous ethics hotline late last year. One, a member of a 40-person office, had collected an estimated $100,000 as a result of the practice, making up 5% of the employee’s total collections over an eight-month period.
There are several ways the balance of an ostensibly closed account can fall below zero. They often involve an unexpected payment from the account, such as a gratuity later tacked on to a restaurant bill paid with a debit card. But fraud is another common culprit, according to current and former employees.
Matthew Valles, a former employee who is suing the bank claiming he was wrongfully fired, said he tried to raise an alarm about the overdraft problem in 2017, because it seemed to most frequently affect fraud victims, who often had little or no money to begin with. And a current employee recalled receiving a complaint from a fraud victim who said he was told he owed $4,000 in fees after his checking account was closed.
Fraud victims are particularly vulnerable to the overdraft problem: Those that are tricked into depositing bogus checks, for example, can easily end up having their accounts closed with a negative balance because they unwittingly spend the money before the fraud is discovered.
Wells Fargo has faced scrutiny before over its handling of accounts of fraud victims. The bank disclosed in August 2017 that the federal consumer bureau was investigating it for closing fraud victims’ accounts without determining whether they had done anything wrong.
The overdraft problem hits those who are financially challenged the hardest, yet they are the least likely to realize they have been wronged, said Chris Peterson, a law professor at the University of Utah who is also a senior fellow at the Consumer Federation of America.
“They don’t know who to complain to,” he said. “They don’t know how to explain what the problem was, and they don’t have the time and resources to deal with getting involved.”
Einaudi still does not know why his accounts were closed, despite repeated requests since early May. He knew he was incurring overdraft penalties only because the inaccessible business accounts were still visible when he logged into his personal accounts.
Another Wells Fargo customer, Anna Tchorbadjiev, is receiving calls from the bank about debits and overdraft penalties it says she owes since her checking account was closed in February.
Tchorbadjiev, 23, said she learned her account had been closed when she visited a Wells Fargo branch in Manhattan to withdraw some cash before brunch with friends. (Seitz said: “We take appropriate steps to notify our customer of account closures in advance.”)
Tchorbadjiev, a freelance assistant to real estate brokers who also works as a model, had $40,000 in her account. She refused to leave without the full amount. Eventually, bank employees handed her a paper bag containing stacks of bills.
“Just a straight-up paper bag like people use for lunch,” Tchorbadjiev said. “It was almost like something out of a movie.”
Weeks later, representatives of Wells Fargo began calling. They said Tchorbadjiev owed $3,000 in debits and overdraft fees incurred since her visit, and the bank had reported her to a national database.
Tchorbadjiev said it took her a month of phone calls to get the report removed so she could set up an account elsewhere. In the meantime, the bank keeps calling about what it says she owes.
“I’m not going to deal with them,” Tchorbadjiev said.

Aragon Ballroom to become Byline Bank Aragon Ballroom

Texto completo: Changing the name of historic Chicago landmarks doesn't typically go over well with the locals. Consider how many Chicagoans still call Guaranteed Rate Field, home of the White Sox, "Comiskey Park."
Cue Live Nation's Wednesday morning announcement via press release that the Aragon Ballroom, the storied Uptown ballroom turned roller skating rink, boxing venue, "discothèque" then concert venue, will become the Byline Bank Aragon Ballroom.
"For more than 100 years, Byline Bank has been committed to putting its customers first, and investing in the neighborhoods in and around Chicago," the statement reads in part. "This partnership will be more than a name change, demonstrating both Byline Bank's and Live Nation's commitment to investing in and preserving the legacy of this historic Chicago music venue for years to come."
As of late 2017, Live Nation held a controlling stake in Lollapalooza promoter C3 Presents and ownership of the Aragon after a hostile takeover from Jam Productions -- adding it to the more than 200 venues it operates globally. The concert promoter also manages 500 musical acts, and in 2017 it presented more than 30,000 shows and sold a half-billion tickets, according to the New York Times.
The Aragon hosts over 70 events each year, welcoming an estimated 250,000 live-music fans annually, according to reports.
"At Byline, we see the true value of a community bank as finding ways to meet the financial needs of our neighbors and the businesses and institutions who serve them," said Alberto J. Paracchini, president and CEO of Byline Bank. "As the name-in-title sponsor of the Byline Bank Aragon Ballroom, we're excited to be part of such a historic Chicagoland tradition and (we) look forward to building many more memories in this amazing space together."
Live Nation President Jason Wright added in a statement, "Byline Bank is committed to building relationships within the community, which is why we felt they are such a natural partner for this historic venue. Together, we will be able to establish genuine bonds with members of the community who have a passion for live music through seamless brand integration."
Live Nation's "seamless brand integration" within Chicago's live music community is ongoing. In May 2018, the entertainment conglomerate was in talks with developer Sterling Bay to bring as many as five venues to the the proposed 70-acre, $5 billion-plus mixed-use project, Lincoln Yards on the North Side.
At the time of the initial announcement, Sterling Bay managing principal Andy Gloor said in a news release, "Chicago already has a reputation as an entertainment hub and we are excited for the community to have easy access to a variety of new events with some of the biggest names in music."
The Tribune reported that the venues could potentially range from a 100-seat amphitheater to a 6,000-to-8,000-seat venue. Dean Marks, principal and general counsel at Sterling Bay, told the Tribune the smaller venues could cost about $50 million combined.
The same year, owners of local venues such as Hideout and Empty Bottle protested, forming the Chicago Independent Venue League, claiming the development threatened their existence. The proposal was rejected in January 2019 by Ald. Brian Hopkins of the 2nd Ward, who called for the prospective entertainment district to be "replaced by restaurants, theaters and smaller venues that will be scattered throughout the site."
Hopkins added: "Live Nation will have no ownership interest in any of these venues."
Ahead of this year's Lollapalooza music festival, Tribune critic Greg Kot asked Mayor Lori Lightfoot about the health of Chicago's local clubs and the future of the Lincoln Yards development.
"I am a huge supporter of local clubs," she told the Tribune. "I like listening to music in a much more intimate setting if I had my druthers. So I'm sensitive to that.
"The arrival of Lincoln Yards gave the clubs an incentive to get organized like never before. I live in Logan Square, and I drive by the Double Door vacancy (in Wicker Park) and think, 'What a loss.' I cut my teeth in clubs like the Elbo Room and other smaller venues in Chicago, so I want to see them continue to thrive."
Responding to whether or not the development was a threat to the scene, Lightfoot added that she initially saw it as a "problem," but she also sees local clubs organizing to push back by forming the CIVL coalition as a "good thing."
"I supported that effort," Lightfoot said. "It demonstrated the vibrancy of a local club scene to provide opportunities for local artists.
"I don't know that we know (if Lincoln Yards will include new music venues), but I know they've made a commitment to the clubs in response to CIVL, led by Katie and Tim Tuten of the Hideout. Whatever is put in there, and as long as I'm mayor, we're going to make sure that nothing there has an adverse impact on those local clubs."

Texto completo: The work of progress is unfinished in Ferguson and in the rest of the country. No one is coming to save us from racist violence: We have to save each other.
This month marks the fifth anniversary of the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed Black teenager who was killed by Darren Wilson, a white police officer who was never brought to justice. (His family settled a civil lawsuit in June 2017). The grand jury decided not to indict him and Wilson resigned. Michael Brown's father wants the investigation reopened.
Less than a month after Brown was killed, the Civil Rights Division of the U.S. Department of Justice under then-Attorney General Eric Holder opened an investigation. The investigation resulted in the publication of the Ferguson Report. In it we learned about the significant revenue Ferguson, Missouri, took from its Black citizens in the form of fines and fees that propped up the municipal court system. We also learned about the unfair treatment meted out by the criminal justice system to the Black citizens of Ferguson.
Five years later, there have been improvements in Ferguson, along with setbacks. That is also true for Black and Latinx people in the rest of the country. Today we see a world where Latinx people are targeted as "invaders" by the president - and that language appeared in the El Paso shooter's suspected manifesto. We have a president who targets women of color who are members of Congress.
Attorney General Bill Barr states that he is "deeply concerned about the rise in hate crimes and political violence" but has done nothing to combat it. He has not asked the Civil Rights Division to investigate the increase in hate crimes. Barr in his confirmation hearings testified that the criminal justice system treats Blacks and whites fairly. We can't expect any help from him.
Some good has come after Ferguson. A Black prosecutor was sworn into office in Ferguson earlier this year. In a Democratic primary in 2018, Wesley Bell defeated Robert McCulloch, the white prosecutor who declined to charge Wilson. Five years later the police department, according to the New York Times, has increased the number of Black officers from four to 21. And yet, as the Times reports, Blacks are still ticketed at higher rates than whites in traffic stops. Since 2013, the likelihood of Blacks being stopped has increased, while that of whites has decreased.
In 2015, the state of Missouri passed a law that limited the percentage of revenue that could be raised from fines and fees. The results have been dramatic - municipal courts statewide collected 45% less in fines compared with 2013. The number of warrants issued statewide decreased by 18%. One of the champions of the bill was a Republican who is now the state's attorney general. Missouri voters passed a $12 minimum wage in 2018.
There is at least one more silver lining in all this, though perhaps an ironic one. President Donald Trump's long history of bigotry is uniting more Americans across racial lines.
For example, according to Pew, most Blacks, Hispanics and Asians say Trump has made race relations worse, compared with just under half (49%) of whites.
A majority of Americans say race relations are bad: 71% of Blacks, 60% of Hispanics and 56% of whites.
More than half of whites along with Asians, Blacks and Hispanics view being white as an advantage when it comes to a person's ability to get ahead.
But there is still more work to be done.
Almost eight in 10 Blacks say America hasn't gone far enough in giving Blacks equal rights with whites compared with almost four in 10 whites, and almost half of Hispanics. If the last five years have taught us anything, it's that we cannot stop now and we can never give up. - (CNN)

Texto completo: Miembros de las fuerzas militares venezolanas estarían siendo reprimidos por órdenes de Nicolás Maduro.
De acuerdo con el NEw York Times, el régimen de Maduro ha usado el aparato represivo del Estado contra sus propias fuerzas de seguridad para mantener el control sobre estas. La reciente muerte del capitán Rafael Acosta Arévalo es uno de los ejemplos.
“El abuso contra los oficiales ha crecido porque representan una amenaza real para el Gobierno de Maduro”, indicó el general Manuel Cristopher Figuera , exdirector de Inteligencia de Venezuela, quien desertó en abril y vive en EEUU, en un artículo publicado este martes por el New York Times.
Indica además el rotativo que de acuerdo con denuncias de varias organizaciones, como la Coalición por los Derechos Humanos y la Democracia , que señala que hay 117 oficiales, entre activos y retirados, detenidos en cárceles venezolanas.
El artículo subraya el caso de Acosta Arévalo, que murió a finales de junio bajo custodia del Estado venezolano por su supuesta implicación en una conspiración para dar un golpe de Estado , lo que fue condenado por EEUU.
Trump congela dinero y bienes del gobierno de Venezuela en EEUU, incluyendo PDVSA
El Gobierno de EEUU culpó al presidente Maduro y sus “asesores cubanos” por la muerte, a la vez que reiteró el apoyo al pueblo venezolano, según un mensaje publicado el pasado 1 de julio por la secretaria adjunta de Estado de EEUU para Latinoamérica , Kimberly Breier, en su cuenta de Twitter.
El Times recuerda que el militar fue sepultado el 10 de julio, en contra de los deseos de su esposa y rodeado de guardias de seguridad en una operación controlada por el Gobierno.
También de que los cinco familiares a los que se les permitió asistir no pudieron verlo porque su cuerpo estaba envuelto en un plástico marrón.
De acuerdo con el rotativo neoyorquino, algunas secciones del informe de su autopsia, que fueron filtradas, señalan que Acosta sufrió un traumatismo por fuerza contundente y electrocución , y que las autoridades han admitido el uso de fuerza excesiva en su caso.
El Gobierno venezolano detuvo a dos militares en relación con su muerte y señaló que los oficiales usaron fueron excesiva cuando el capitán se resistió al arresto, recuerda el Times.
Igualmente cita en el artículo los casos de otros militares que fueron torturados como el de Juan Carlos Caguaripano, un capitán de la Guardia Nacional que en 2017 dirigió un asalto fallido en una base militar, quien sufrió lesiones en los testículos debido a los golpes que recibió en la cárcel.
El preso más conocido de Venezuela y un plan de fuga planeado al milímetro
El artículo asegura que en los últimos dos años, a medida que se agrava la escasez de alimentos por el derrumbe de la economía petrolera, las fuerzas de seguridad del Estado han llevado a cabo por lo menos cinco operaciones para derrocar o asesinar a Maduro.
El Gobierno asegura que ha frustrado al menos una docena más de complots, incluido el plan con el que se vinculó a Acosta y otros cinco detenidos, lo que el Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela (PSUV) , la organización política de Maduro, utiliza para justificar la vigilancia constante, detenciones arbitrarias y las torturas a los que considera sus enemigos.
Entre los vigilados, los 160.000 soldados que conforman las Fuerzas Armadas de Venezuela, señala además al Times al citar denuncias de Naciones Unidas.
Destaca también que la Coalición por los Derechos Humanos, con sede en Caracas y que representa a varios de los militares arrestados, ha documentado 250 casos de tortura cometidos por las fuerzas de seguridad venezolanas contra oficiales militares, sus familiares y activistas de la oposición desde el 2017.
Estos abusos fueron dados a conocer el pasado mes en un informe publicado por Michelle Bachelet, alta comisionada para los Derechos Humanos de la ONU.
Asimismo, el artículo apunta que aunque Maduro ha tratado de garantizar la lealtad de los altos mandos militares con promociones y contratos lucrativos, los oficiales de rango medio y bajo y sus familias se ven cada vez más afectados por la crisis.
“El hambre llegó a los cuarteles y se infectaron con disidencia”, dijo al diario Ana Leonor Acosta , abogada de la Coalición, quien asegura también que las Fuerzas Armadas están llenas de paranoia, desconfianza y división.

Texto completo: More than two dozen activists gathered in Foley Square on Monday calling for federal action to stem the flow of illegal guns.
Five hundred and twenty one people were shot in New York City this year as of July 28 - up from 501 people in the same time last year, The New York Times reported.
At Monday's rally, Harlem Mothers S.A.V.E. co-founder Jackie Rowe-Adams called those statistics "out of control" and said illegal guns were largely to blame.
Her group works to combat gun violence and support those who have been affected by it. Rowe-Adams lost two sons to gun violence, according to the group's website.
"Today we stand here saying, 'our children are under attack,'  " she said. "Enough is enough."
Rowe-Adams and other activists hope to see the repeal of the Tiahrt Amendment, which keeps the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives from releasing its firearms-tracking database to anyone outside of law enforcement.
They also want to see the repeal of the Dickey Amendment, which states that funding given to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to prevent injuries can't be used to advocate for gun control.
Assemb. Inez Dickens, whose district includes parts of Harlem, called for federal legislation targeting the spread of illegal guns.
"Right now, you could go on any block in Harlem, practically, and purchase a gun," she maintained. "There's no need for a young person, or anyone, to be able to purchase a gun on the street."
City Comptroller Scott Stringer, meanwhile, said the Trump administration, backed by the NRA, was "hellbent on putting guns in the wrong hands."
"When I wake up in the morning, when I know my kids are in school, the worst nightmare I have is that somebody's going to call and say, 'shots fired,'  " he said. "We have got to start investing in our community and investing in our children."
In his own address at the rally, which came just over a week after mass shootings in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio, State Sen. Robert Jackson (D-Washington Heights) denounced gun violence as "a continuous action that's killing our community."
"Not only the black community, the Latino community, all communities. It's killing all of us. And we must stop it," he said. "Those individuals as legislators that do not want to take action - vote 'em out."

Texto completo: ROME - Maiken Offerdal of Norway and her teenage sons were just sitting down on Rome's famed Spanish Steps on Wednesday when they heard two shrieks of a whistle.
A police officer walked over and tut-tutted: No sitting, he said sternly.
Never mind the long tradition of lounging on the fabled spot - a scene perhaps best evoked by Audrey Hepburn and Gregory Peck in the 1953 film "Roman Holiday" - sitting on the Spanish Steps is now subject to a fine of 400 euros ($450) under new municipal rules that ban a variety of activities in the city's historic center.
The regulations are intended to "guarantee decorum, security and legality" by prohibiting actions that are "not compatible with the historic and artistic decorum" of Rome's center, according to the city's website.
So Anita Ekberg's famed dip in the Trevi Fountain in Fellini's "La Dolce Vita"? That would cost her as much as 450 euros today.
Those faux Roman centurions who pose for pictures - for a fee, of course - in front of the Colosseum? Forget about it. Rickshaw drivers? They'll need to find new routes.
Penalties for graffiti were toughened, as were those for the off-hour sale of alcohol. The new regulations also tighten enforcement of the prostitution laws and the mistreatment of animals, among other things.
The rules, passed by Rome's government, which is controlled by the Five Star Movement and led by Mayor Virginia Raggi, went into effect last month. Officers have been lenient so far: No fines have been issued for improper sitting, a spokeswoman for Rome's municipal police said.
Warnings, though, are becoming plentiful.
Dozens of startled people, most of them presumably tourists, were reprimanded on a broiling Wednesday afternoon by a small force of municipal police officers who admonished step-sitters by blowing twice on their whistles and gesturing stiffly to stand up.
The transgressors sheepishly complied.
One so chastised was Valerie Dimitrieva, a visitor from Kazakhstan, who said she had sat on the Spanish Steps during past visits to Rome without incident.
"Being whistled at - it was a bit embarrassing," she said.
A tired-looking father with a stroller in his hands and a toddler on his shoulders, was coming down the steps when he was stopped by a cry of "Hey Mister." The stroller, an officer said, cannot touch the steps. The father grudgingly complied.
The officer who chastised him was unapologetic.
"You see one stroller - we see millions of them. This is a historic monument that has to be preserved," he said, declining to give his name because he was not authorized to speak to reporters. He asked to be identified as "a municipal police officer who loves Rome."
The Spanish Steps - 174 of them - were built in the 18th century. With the Santissima Trinità dei Monti Church presiding majestically at the top, they are one of Rome's most popular tourist attractions.

Patricia Murphy: How about a crime bill for white people instead of black people?

Texto completo: At nearly every Democratic presidential event I’ve been to this year, the candidates have talked about the devastating effects of the 1994 crime bill on the black community.
The legislation, which President Bill Clinton signed and Joe Biden, then a Delaware senator, pushed through the Judiciary Committee, was written as a response to an explosion in violent crime in urban areas across the country. In New York City, for example, there had been 2,245 murders in 1990. (There were 289 last year.)
But with sentencing provisions like “three strikes and you’re out,” the law also disproportionately sent black men to prison, many for the rest of their lives. During the last presidential debate, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, who lives in a low-income neighborhood in Newark, told Biden that the crime bill “destroyed communities like mine.”
So it’s absolutely true that it’s time to rewrite the crime bill and push for more criminal justice reform. But 25 years later, the crimes that keep Americans up at night are not out of some scene from “Law & Order.” They’re happening in all of the places that used to be normal and joyful - sending your child to first grade or going to church on Sunday or shopping for school supplies at Walmart - all places that have become targets for American mass shooters in recent years.
Instead of just unwinding the old crime bill that took aim at black and brown communities, it’s time to pass a new crime bill for the mostly white, almost entirely male, population of mass shooters who are steadily transforming our country into a shooting range to make up for their own sick frustrations with life.
The first thing a new bill should do is to make guns harder to acquire and mass-casualty weapons impossible to possess. Think it can’t happen in Washington? It already did - in the 1994 crime bill. For all of the law’s unthinkable consequences, it also enacted nearly all of the gun reforms we are discussing as “too radical” today, including a 10-round limit on high-capacity magazines and an assault weapons ban. Not so radical, right? Those provisions expired after 10 years as a part of a compromise to get the bill passed. But they were all passed into law, and that’s the point.
Second, a new crime bill should also require background checks. Oh wait, that already happened too - when Congress passed the Brady bill in 1993 to create the first background checks on guns purchased through federally licensed firearms dealers (which currently make up about 78% of sales). Earlier this year, the Democrat-led House passed a bill to expand those background checks to nearly all purchases and transfers, but the Senate has taken no action.
Republicans like South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham have said that instead of expanding background checks, they would like to see “red flag” laws that would let police or family members keep guns out of the hands of people deemed a danger to themselves or others. That seems perfectly reasonable - but there is no reason to choose one over the other.
Along with guns and mental health provisions, a third focus has to be the tech element, which didn’t even exist in 1994. The New York Times reported over the weekend that the gunmen in the mosque attack in New Zealand, the synagogue attack near San Diego and the Walmart shooting in El Paso had posted white nationalist screeds on 8chan, the unmoderated, unregulated message board, in the moments just before they began their rampages.
The creator of 8chan, Frederick Brennan, told the Times that the site should be banned, but only Jim Watkins, the website’s current operator, or his web hosts can do that right now. One host has blocked 8chan, but Congress should levy criminal and civil liabilities on any web operator, host or registrar that allows digital content that significantly contributes to mass shootings. If a jury can hold McDonald’s liable for $2.86 million in damages for selling too-hot coffee to a customer, the people who breed this kind of risk for domestic terrorism should be held accountable too.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said his Republican colleagues are “prepared to do our part” to respond to the El Paso and Dayton shootings, but after two decades of inaction, it’s hard to imagine what “our part” even means. Although the House passed its background check legislation in February, the Senate hasn’t moved an inch. In 2013 and 2015, senators also voted down the Manchin-Tooomey amendment to expand background checks.
But it’s not just Senate Republicans who are to blame. House Republicans need to give their Senate counterparts a running start to do anything controversial. Look no further than the February vote on background checks - where just eight House Republicans voted “yes” - as the reason the measure is dead in the Senate today.
It’s not clear anymore what Republicans are afraid of when it comes to passing even modest gun safety measures that were U.S. law 15 years ago. Maybe they’re afraid of the NRA? But at this moment, the NRA leadership is eating its own under accusations of fraud and theft. Are they really so scary anymore?
Maybe GOP lawmakers are just worried about losing their jobs. But the 2018 midterms had a lesson for Republicans blocking gun control measures - you are probably going to lose your seat anyway. Why not go down for a moment of bravery instead of a moment of cowardice? The change would do us all good.

Texto completo: A rose to the Iowa Department of Public Health and county health officials for using social media to alert Iowans who have been exposed to sexually transmitted diseases.
Iowa law requires clinics to notify public health officials whenever a patient is confirmed to have contracted chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis or HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. Investigators then contact the patients and ask them to identify recent sex partners. Some patients say they would like authorities to handle that awkward task.
Officials use social media and other online services — the same services some people use to find dates — to track down patients' past sex partners and encourage them to seek testing and treatment. That helps prevent diseases from spreading. And it is especially important when the number of Iowa chlamydia cases jumped 39% from 2010 to 2018, gonorrhea cases soared 168% and syphilis cases went up 316%.
Let's also add a thistle to Iowans having sex with people they met online and failing to use condoms. That's not just dumb, it's dangerous.
A rose to the Iowa Department of Natural Resources for cracking down on scofflaws who don't have life jackets on water crafts. On a single day in July, more than 300 people, mostly paddlers, were fined for failing to have the safety device on board.
A life jacket is required on all canoes, kayaks and paddle boards. Children under age 12 must wear them. Nearly half of Iowa's boating deaths in recent years were paddlers and four paddlers not wearing life jackets have died this year.
"It's so important to have a life jacket on or at least available, as small paddling craft can easily tip and throw a paddler into the water," Nate Anderson, an Iowa DNR conservation officer, said in a news release. "If you are sitting on the life jacket instead of wearing it, it won't be there when you really need it."
Citing people helps ensure Iowans know and follow the law, which will save lives.
Another rose to the DNR for doing its best with a limited budget and devastating floods to maintain and keep open our state parks. This includes Waubonsie State Park in southwestern Iowa, recently featured in a New York Times article.
"I figured it'd be a few lonely trees surrounded by corn," wrote the author. "What I found truly astounded me, and emphasized what I love most about state parks: You never know what you're going to find."
What he found in the nearly 2,000-acre park: "an ancient forest on a plateau, an island of mysterious trees in the middle of a vast agricultural region. A secret in plain sight."
Waubonsie is the result of melting glaciers that rushed down the Missouri River, leaving silt that piled up into huge mounds called the Loess Hills. Only two places in the world have such topography. One is here and one is in China.
Iowans should take advantage of our parks before summer gets away from us.
A thistle to the Altoona City Council for its secrecy in an agreement with Facebook that would give the company $40 million in tax incentives. City officials would not share the details of the agreement before a May meeting, declined a Des Moines Register reporter's request to view them, and made them available for a mere 12 minutes during the meeting. Facebook, which was seeking a 20-year tax exemption for yet another data center, was not even named on the agenda.
Altoona Mayor Dean O'Connor said the city has been bound in what it can say publicly by the nondisclosure agreement it has with Facebook.
Well, don't enter such agreements. And don't bend over backward to subsidize a multibillion-dollar company while keeping the city's taxpayers in the dark. If such secrecy is not a violation of an open meetings law, then legislators should revisit the law to make sure it is.

Texto completo: There hasn't been much to love about the summer of 2019. It has been a season of record heat and spiraling hate, mass shootings and border detentions, of Jeffrey Epstein, Moscow Mitch, Boris Johnson and go back to where you came from. Grasshoppers invaded Las Vegas, a blackout consumed New York and an outbreak of Ebola might have crossed a tipping point in Africa.
And so it feels almost too small to note that, floating somewhere in the garbage fire, there was also something wonderful and true. I keep wondering: Whatever did we do to deserve the blessing of "Old Town Road," Lil Nas X's infectiously joyful rap-country smash that just crossed a record 18 weeks at the top of Billboard's Hot 100 chart?
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
America may be split over the meaning of its national anthem, but there was no argument about the anthem that ruled this summer: Everywhere you went, wherever you looked, we were all riding til we couldn't no more. The song's twangy, earworming jubilation crossed generations and genres, infecting kids on TikTok and grandparents on Facebook, sparking elementary school gym sing-alongs and enough hilarious memes to break the internet.
[Farhad Manjoo will answer your questions about this column on Thursday at 3:00 p.m. Eastern on Twitter: @fmanjoo ]
Then there's the song's creator, Lil Nas X, the cowboy-hat-loving, meme-flipping, gay 20-year-old who has handled his sudden success just as smoothly as he handled his horses in the "baccc" -- with glee, warmth, and such an earnest openness that I'm almost tempted to call him a hero for an age otherwise lacking in moral pillars.
You might pooh-pooh that idea: Farhad, it's just a two-minute pop song, let's not beat this horse dead. To which I counter: Can't nobody tell me nothing.
Mostly, I just love Lil Nas X and his tweets.
But if I were to put on my op-ed columnist bow tie and force myself to have a few big thoughts about "Old Town Road," I'd say there's something quietly profound here. The unlikely story of the song's creation and culture-spanning success suggests some reason for optimism about the power of digital culture to forge a shared perspective in the years ahead.
For as long as the internet has been around, the story of media has been one of fragmentation and atomization. Thanks to all these new formats, new business models, and new distribution technologies, we've been drowning in an unprecedented level of choice in movies, music, TV shows, books and, especially, sources of news. As a result, everything is personalized and polarized -- we're all split into social-media-selected tribes, where our consumption of news and culture feels constantly shaped by a privacy-invading algorithmic determination of one's innermost sense and sensibility.
And yet, in the last few years, something counterintuitive has been happening with mass media: It's been getting more mass. It's not just "Old Town Road." Across the cultural industries, blockbusters are getting blockbustier: Despite the barrage of choice, more of us are enjoying more of the same songs, movies and TV shows. We are not nearly as siloed as we tend to think we are.
Just as Lil Nas X was breaking records in music, Disney was smashing them in movies. Last month, "Avengers: Endgame" crushed the record held by "Avatar" for the highest grossing movie of all time, and it's just one of several billion-dollar hits Disney is releasing this year.
Even television, where the streaming war has inundated viewers with choice -- a record 495 scripted shows were made in 2018 -- has a lot of blockbusters. An average of 44 million people across the world watched each episode of the final season of "Game of Thrones" this year. And NBC's "The Office" was streamed for 52 billion minutes on Netflix in 2018, according to Nielsen -- that's about 15 hours of "The Office" for each of Netflix's 60 million subscribers, a hit so phenomenal that NBCUniversal paid a reported $ 500 million to license the show for its own upcoming streaming service.
Why are hits getting bigger? In movies, the story is all about the growing size of the international box office. David A. Gross, who runs the consulting firm Franchise Entertainment Research, told me that with its animated hits and superhero flicks, Disney has been especially good at making movies that tap into a global shared consciousness. "These are universal stories," he said.
In music and TV, it's the streaming business that's changing everything. Chris Molanphy, who writes a brilliant music chart-watching column for Slate, told me that streaming has led to quirkier hits that seem to come out of nowhere, and that stick around for longer -- cuts like Gotye's "Somebody That I Used To Know" from 2012, or 2017's "Despacito," by Luis Fonsi, Daddy Yankee and Justin Bieber, which spent a then record-tying 16 weeks at #1.
"In the 1980s, the whole music industry was more top-down regulated -- retail managers at record stores and program directors on radio had their own agendas, and they had a much bigger hand in what got popular," Mr. Molanphy said. "Old Town Road," by contrast, got its start on TikTok, where it became a viral phenomenon as part of something called the "Yeehaw Challenge."
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
The song did face moments of top-down strangulation, like when Billboard removed the song from its country-music chart for not being country enough. But rather than get caught up in the culture war, Lil Nas X just glided over it, releasing a remix with Billy Ray Cyrus that crushed all would-be chart competitors.
There's a cynical way to regard the rise of big hits like "Old Town Road" -- that we are all amusing ourselves to death, as the scholar Neil Postman once warned.
I don't think that's right, though. While the internet has made a mess of our politics, it's starting to do something remarkable for our culture businesses. Marty Kaplan, who studies entertainment at the U.S.C. Annenberg School for Communication & Journalism, argued that we're getting bigger blockbusters at the same time as we're expanding the "long tail" of media choice. We're getting riffs on the familiar -- like Disney's many sequels and luxurious reboots of old hits -- but we also keep getting new formats, new artists, and novel business models. There's little to complain about: Until everything blows up, digital entertainment is leading to greater innovation, artistic freedom, growing diversity, and a rising sense of widely shared cultural experiences.
Oh, and "Old Town Road"? As they say on Twitter, even after 18 weeks at the top, it still slaps.

The Washington Post just published the worst error-riddled disaster you’ll probably read all year

Texto completo: It is painful reading all the corrections added to a July 23 Washington Post article about black families and southern farmland. But one cannot help but stare at a train wreck.
And the article, titled “Black families once lived off their southern farmland. Their descendants are struggling to hold onto it,” is certainly a glorious train wreck. It contains 15 separate corrections. The list of errors is almost as long as the article itself, clocking in at an impressive 579 words.
The very first thing the reader sees when he goes to the article are the following lines: “Corrections: A previous version of this article contained many errors and omitted context and allegations important to understanding two families’ stories. This version has been updated.”
The Washington Post then goes into excruciating detail listing off every one of the original article’s inaccuracies and errors. It must be seen to be appreciated. It looks like this:
• The first name of Emanuel Freeman Sr. was misspelled. • Contrary to what was reported in the initial article, Freeman Sr.’s grandson, Johnny, did not refuse to move off a Halifax, Va., sidewalk for a white woman; he was talking to her, which drew the ire of some white locals, including the Ku Klux Klan. When a crowd gathered at the Freeman home where Johnny fled, gunfire was exchanged, and one family member’s home was set ablaze. • The 2017 U.S. Agricultural Census compared farmland owned and operated, not simply owned, by white and black farmers. • The number of children Freeman had with his second wife, Rebecca, was eight, not 10. • Ownership of Freeman’s property was not transferred to heirs when Rebecca died. In fact, he used a trust before he died to divide his property among his heirs. • The partition sale of the Freeman estate was in 2016, not 2018, and it included 360 acres of the original 1,000, not 30 acres of the original 99. • The story omitted key details that affect understanding of ownership of the land. Melinda J.G. Hyman says “Jr.” and “Sr.” were left off the names of father and son on documents, and the land was mistakenly combined under Rebecca’s name, meaning some descendants did not receive proper ownership. After requesting a summary of the property, Hyman says, she found her great-aunt, Pinkie Freeman Logan, was the rightful heir to hundreds of acres, but they were not properly transferred to her. In 2016, Hyman says, 360 acres of the original 1,000 were auctioned off after a lengthy court battle, a decision she says she and some other family members dispute. • The article omitted Hyman’s statement that actions by law firm Bagwell & Bagwell constitute apparent conflicts of interest and omitted firm owner George H. Bagwell’s response denying that allegation. • A description by agricultural lawyer Jillian Hishaw of laws governing who inherits property when a landowner dies was a reference to the laws in most states, not more than 20 states. She was also generally describing these laws, not referring to Virginia law. • A study the article said compared the prevalence of estate planning by older white and older black Americans was published in the Journal of Palliative Medicine, not the National Library of Medicine, and was about possession of advance health directives, not estate planning. • Tashi Terry said, “Welcome to Belle Terry Lane,” not “Welcome to Belle Terry Farm.” The property is named Terry Farm. • Aubrey Terry did not buy 170 acres with his siblings in 1963; his parents bought the 150-acre property in 1961. • The eldest Terry brother died in 2011, not 2015. • The article omitted Tashi Terry’s account of some incidents that led to a lawsuit seeking a partition sale of her family’s farm and her allegations against Bagwell & Bagwell, which the firm denies. • A law proposed to protect heirs from losing land in partition sales is called the Uniform Partition of Heirs Property Act, not the Partition of Heirs Property Act. “Tenants in common” are not solely defined as those living on a property; they are all those who own a share in the property. The act would not require heirs living on a property to come to an agreement before it can be sold, but would instead provide several other protections.
At this rate, it is a wonder the author even got her name right. Speaking of which, the author of this hot mess is one Korsha Wilson, who the Washington Post bills as a “New York-based food writer.” Her work has appeared also in the New York Times, Bon Appétit, Saveur, and Food & Wine, according to the Washingtonian’s Andrew Beaujon.
By the looks of what happened to Wilson’s Washington Post article, she should probably stick to writing about food.
Kudos to the newspaper for being so thorough and forthright in tackling the many, many problems in Wilson’s article. But it is hard not to wonder what Beaujon also wondered: How did this happen in the first place? How did such a disaster get through the Washington Post gatekeepers?
The "Democracy Dies in Darkness" newsroom is not interested in discussing the matter.
Executive editor Martin Baron said in a boilerplate statement provided to the Washington Examiner: “We are embarrassed by the widespread errors in this freelance article. We have published a detailed correction of each error and updated the story based on re-reporting by Post staff.”
This is the exact same statement that was provided to the Washingtonian. Word for word.
Beaujon makes the additional point that the paper’s canned statement fails to address how the article "went through and whether it was representative of how the Post handles contributions from freelancers whose training and propensity with regard to accuracy can be difficult to judge.” Indeed. It is not enough just to correct the mistakes. It would be worth knowing how this happened, and how the paper plans to prevent it from happening again.
But if Beaujon expects the paper to answer any of these questions, he has got another thing coming (he likely knows that, too). It is easier getting a comment or a response from a member of Congress than it is getting one from a newsroom. It is one of those delightfully ironic facts of life.

Texto completo: David Corcoran, a distinguished journalist who began his career at The Record and served as its editorial page editor for a decade, died Sunday at his home in New Mexico. The cause of death was leukemia, said his wife, Bonnie Stetson. He was 72.
Corcoran moved to The New York Times in 1988 after 19 years at The Record. At the Times, he advanced quickly, starting as a copy editor and eventually working on the weekend, OpEd, graphics, New Jersey and education desks before leading the Science Times section, from which he retired as editor in 2014.
He then moved to Cambridge to become associate director of the Knight Science Journalism Program at MIT, where he launched the "Undark" podcast and mentored research fellows and science writers.
"He was a supremely graceful writer and a meticulous and insightful editor," said Charles Strum, a retired associate managing editor at the Times who was Corcoran's friend and colleague for 48 years, "the last of a breed of editor/scholars with a gentle touch and a literary gift."
A man of many parts, Corcoran was a published poet, a restaurant critic who wrote more than 250 reviews of New Jersey restaurants, a podcast pioneer, the linchpin for a network of Times and Record alumni, an avid runner and a baseball fan.
He joined The Record in 1969 as a fresh graduate of Amherst College, when the paper was held in high reputation in journalism circles and had its pick of young, talented reporters and editors.
One editor in charge of hiring was reputed to reject unsuccessful aspirants with the words, "The Record is in the position of being able to hire the best young journalists in America — but you are not among them."
Corcoran made the cut, however, and began by covering Englewood. In a newsroom of 30 or so young reporters, he stood out for his thoughtfulness and kindness, said Martin Gottlieb, then a colleague covering Fort Lee and eventually The Record's executive editor.
It was "a tough beat," Gottlieb said, with tensions about race and the public schools, and it required sensitivity on the part of the young reporter.
Corcoran "exuded a justifiable air that he could get to the heart of things, represent things fairly and get to the underlying issues," Gottlieb said.
He was "one of the brightest lights in the galaxy of young and intelligent journalists that came of age at The Record in the 1970s," said Mike Kelly, a columnist for The Record who was hired as a reporter at that time.
"He possessed all the gifts that a solid journalist needs: innate curiosity about all things, a great memory of facts and people and an intelligent sense of the deeper meaning and implications of even the most ordinary of stories."
Corcoran became an editorial writer in 1974 and worked closely with James Ahearn, a mentor whom he succeeded as editorial page editor.
In a recent tribute to Ahearn, Corcoran described his writing as "vivid and crisp and wry, serious and rigorous but never portentous or solemn" — words that could equally be applied to his own columns and opinion pieces.
Recalling Corcoran's time at The Record, Malcom Borg, the newspaper's former owner, said, "I remember him as a very thoughtful, careful writer and editor who was precise about everything. He was a really good man."
Borg's last contact with Corcoran occurred when the latter solicited remembrances of Ahearn and informed alumni about Ahearn's memorial service, which he was too ill to attend.
"He didn't even mention that he was sick," Borg said.
At the Times and in his many other interactions as an editor, instructor and champion of young journalists, Corcoran was remembered as both joyful and generous.
"Farewell David Corcoran, dearest of editors," was the name of a tribute page created on the science blog "The Last Word on Nothing."
"He could cut through to the heart of things," said Alan Finder, a colleague at both The Record and the Times, "but he always did it in a gentle way."
After Corcoran's diagnosis last September with acute myeloid leukemia, a cancer that starts in the bone marrow, a former colleague at the Times circulated an informal newsletter about his condition among his friends.
Many treatments were tried, including a clinical trial as recently as last month.
But his strain of the disease was particularly aggressive, Stetson said. Corcoran returned to their home, which had a view of the mountains, last week, and died peacefully Sunday evening, she said.
"The main thing about David is he was the most considerate person in the world," said Stetson, a school psychologist with whom he reconnected in recent years. "He just took care of people. He took care of me until his last breath."
Corcoran is survived by two brothers, John Corcoran of Tivoli, New York, and William Diebold of Portland, Oregon; his former wife, Kerrie Olick of Pomona, New York; and three children, Thomas Corcoran and Daniel Corcoran of Nyack, New York, and Kat Corcoran of Minneapolis.
A memorial service will be planned later this year in Nyack, where Corcoran grew up, Stetson said.

Texto completo: There’s a new left-wing movement. To promote urban density and combat suburban sprawl, activists want to eliminate zoning laws across the country that restrict many neighborhoods to single-family housing. It’s been written up in the New York Times, and Portland has actually gone ahead with it. So, consider yourself warned: You can expect this curious campaign to come to your town at any moment.
It’s curious because liberals normally embrace regulations telling people what they can and can’t do with their property. But here they are denouncing one of the most pervasive regulatory schemes in the country, looking to clear the way for multistory urban density. How odd to have environmentalists pushing for laissez faire land use, urging that developers be unshackled to bulldoze trees.
This reflects a hatred of the ‘burbs, an antipathy that can best be illustrated by that icon of suburban summer, the Weber grill.
Let us count the ways the Weber offends: 1) There is the burning of charcoal, a carbon footprint no-no. 2) The flame is usually applied to meat, an affront to the sensibilities of the Veganistas. 3) Firing up the grill in one’s own little patch of green is an unapologetic, if not outright jingoistic, expression of American culture.
Recall the theme of hamburgers in the Whit Stillman movie Barcelona. The pretty girls of Spain have contempt for America in no small part because they think Norte Americano cuisine is represented by hamburgers. “Here, hamburguesas are really bad,” laments the character Ted. “It’s known that Americans like hamburgers, so again, we’re idiots. But they have no idea how delicious hamburgers can be.” The young American men living abroad are in no position to correct their impression that burgers are an atrocity because they live in an urban apartment building. There’s no place to grill.
It isn’t until the Spanish lovelies visit the young men in the States that they are finally presented with proper burgers straight off the grill.
A skeptical beauty takes a bite. “Incredible!” she declares.
“You see,” says the American manning the grill, “we’re not such idiots.” He might as well be wearing a MAGA hat.
Eliminating zoning rules may go against the regulatory instincts of the Left, but there will be many opportunities for bureaucratic bossies to have their way. Again, the Weber grill is illustrative.
Newly dense population will call for all sorts of new and necessary regulations, such as safety rules to protect people living in high-rises from being trapped in a tower turned inferno by careless grilling. No wonder the New York City fire code (section 307.5) devotes 650 words explicitly to limits and prohibitions on “Portable outdoor barbecues.” Balcony fires are right out. The code also governs grilling on the plazas in front of apartment blocks. In the unlikely event a building allowed open flames on its property, the code requires a “portable fire extinguisher complying with the requirements of FC906 with a minimum 4-A rating, shall be provided for any portable outdoor barbecue, and shall be readily accessible whenever the portable outdoor barbecue is in use.”
I have no intention of answering to a fire marshal about whether I am complying with the requirements of FC906. Which is one reason I’m happy to live in a house with a yard. If for no better reason than the defense of my Weber and the freedom for which it stands, I am going to be paying attention to any sneaky efforts to eviscerate single-family-home zoning rules here in the District of Columbia.
In the meantime, I am going to do something that would be criminally foolhardy anywhere but in one’s own yard with one’s own grill: I am going to make the perfect Steak Pittsburgh. I’ll get a nice hot fire of hardwood charcoal going, then drop a stick of butter on the grate. It will melt and soon combust. Into that butter-fueled conflagration I’ll toss a thick strip steak. Soon it will be butter-charred on the outside and rare on the inside.
This being my own yard behind my own house, I intend to enjoy it in the shade of trees I planted myself.

T-U parent buys media giant Gannett

Texto completo: NEW YORK -- Two of the largest U.S. newspaper companies have agreed to combine for roughly $1.4 billion, creating a new industry giant that hopes to manage the crisis of print's decline through sheer size.

GateHouse Media, a fast-growing chain that owns the Times-Union, is buying USA Today owner Gannett, promising to speed up a digital transformation as readers shift online. The companies say they are committed to "journalistic excellence" -- while also cutting $300 million in costs every year.

The resulting company would be the largest U.S. newspaper company by far, with a print circulation of 8.7 million, 7 million more than the new No. 2, McClatchy, according to media expert Ken Doctor.

Local papers, faced with the complex and expensive

process of building digital businesses to replace declines in print ads and circulation, have been consolidating madly in recent years. Although papers with national readerships like The New York Times and The Washington Post have had success adding digital subscribers, local papers with local readerships find it much more difficult. Hundreds of such papers have closed, and newsrooms have slashed jobs.

According to a study by the University of North Carolina, the U.S. has lost almost 1,800 local newspapers since 2004. Newsroom employment fell by a quarter from 2008 to 2018, according to Pew Research, and layoffs have continued this year.

Both GateHouse and Gannett are known as buyers of other papers. Bulking up lets companies cut costs -- via newsroom layoffs and other measures -- and centralize operations. The combined company would have more than 260 daily papers in the U.S. along with more than 300 weeklies.

Those cuts could give the owners "a cushion of time" to figure out how to improve their digital businesses, longtime industry analyst Rick Edmonds of the Poynter Institute wrote Sunday.

But it's no panacea. "I don't think, just by these companies merging, they're going to somehow magically find a new business model, make everything all right and produce robust journalism at a local level," Butler University journalism professor Nancy Whitmore said. Still, a bigger, combined newspaper company could sell more national ads and boost their ad revenue, she said.

GateHouse's owner, New Media, is taking on new debt to get the deal done -- a $1.8 billion loan from private equity firm Apollo Global Management. That will have to be paid back.

"We've been hearing for years and years about the glories of cost efficiencies," said Northeastern University professor Dan Kennedy, a proponent of local ownership for media outlets. But it's unclear, based on past media mergers, whether those savings will benefit the papers, its employees or their readers, he said.

He wonders whether combined companies make more or fewer cuts than they would have if they had remained separate.

Several experts said they do not expect the Justice Department to have an issue with the deal, as the two companies have papers in different markets. The companies expect it to close this year.

The combined company would take the Gannett name and keep its headquarters in Gannett's current home of McLean, Virginia. GateHouse's owner New Media is buying Gannett Co. for $12.06 a share in cash and stock.

Consolidation is nothing new to either company. Gannett's last big U.S. print purchase was in 2016, when it bought papers in the Journal Media Group chain for $280 million, including the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel and The Commercial Appeal in Memphis. Gannett also owns dailies in major cities such as the Detroit Free Press and Arizona Republic.

Its more recent merger efforts have been unsuccessful. It failed in an unsolicited bid for newspaper chain Tribune. Gannett then fended off an unwanted bid by MNG Enterprises, better known as Digital First Media, a hedge-fund backed media group with a slash-and-burn reputation for cutting jobs and letting papers wither.

GateHouse, a little-known name to U.S. readers, is also controlled by an investment company, but it doesn't have the same scalding reputation as Digital First. It is owned by the publicly traded New Media Investment Group, which is managed by investment firm Fortress Investment Group. Fortress, in turn, is owned by Japanese tech giant SoftBank. Gannett and New Media said Monday that Fortress will no longer manage New Media after 2021.

GateHouse has grown quickly in recent years, and its buying spree includes the Palm Beach Post, bought last year for $49 million, and the Austin American-Statesman, on which it spent $47.5 million. It publishes 154 daily newspapers, most in small- and mid-sized towns.

Gannett shares added 29 cents, or 2.7%, to close at $11.04. New Media stock lost 81 cents, or 7.6%, to $9.89.

No President Trump, violent video games don’t lead to mass shootings

Texto completo: At least 30 people died this weekend in two disturbing mass shootings. Bizarrely, some Republicans are responding by talking about video games.
In his Monday morning address, President Trump blamed “violent video games” as a cause of mass shootings for supposedly contributing to a “culture that celebrates violence.” This echoed earlier claims by Republicans such as Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, both of whom blamed the boogeyman of violent video games.
Patrick said “We’ve always had guns. We’ve always had evil. But what’s changed where we see this rash of shooting? I see a video game industry that teaches young people to kill.” And McCarthy concurred: “The idea of these video games, they dehumanize individuals to have a game of shooting individuals and others.”
Their concern is understandable, and there are reasonable concerns to be had about video games and the influence they have on our culture. But the idea that they lead to violence is completely wrong, and has been repeatedly debunked by almost all subject area experts and ample amounts of research. It’s irresponsible for Republican leaders to continue to push a narrative so clearly wrong-headed, and their misdirection only sets back our efforts to find a real solution to gun violence.
Tweet
Video games just aren’t the problem.
The New York Times pointed out that in places such as Japan, video game use is rampant, with the majority of the population involved in some form of gaming, but gun violence is almost unheard of. And just this year, research from two Oxford scholars found “confirmatory evidence that violent video game engagement, on balance, is not associated with observable variability in adolescents’ aggressive behaviour.” An older study from the Secret Service found that only roughly 1 in 10 mass shooters had a history of regularly playing violent video games.
And experts confirm that these studies are in line with most research.
As the New York Times summarized, “Media scholars say the claims about video games and violent movies — a common one in the wake of mass shootings — does not hold up to scrutiny.” The liberal paper was also sure to point out that even the famed conservative Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia acknowledged that there’s no link between violent video games and actual aggression. He once wrote that “any demonstrated effects are both small and indistinguishable from effects produced by other media.”
It’s easy to see why there’s no actual connection between video games and mass violence. People watch violent movies and television shows all the time, read horror novels, or yes, play violent video games. But exposure to violence doesn’t turn someone into a killer, if anything, it might do the opposite. I’ve spent years watching Law and Order: Special Victims Unit, and it has opened my eyes to just how horrible sexual violence is — doing the very opposite of promoting it or otherwise encouraging aggression.
So in the aftermath of tragedy, there’s nothing to be gained by blaming false boogeymen. We can have real, serious conversations about the possibly addictive and anti-social effects video games are increasingly having on young men. But responsible dialogue can’t begin until our leaders stop blaming Call of Duty for mass shootings, and open their eyes to the real issues of mental health, missed red flags, and media malpractice actually at hand.

Epstein became lost in his own perversely tragic fantasy

Texto completo: The more we learn, the more Jeffrey Epstein resembles an evil comic book character for the developmentally arrested intellectual — the charming-but-lurid mastermind with a plot to take over the world by impregnating scores of women on a remote desert estate.
Last Wednesday, The New York Times reported that the financier/convicted sex offender/philanthropist — and now accused sex trafficker — is also a "transhumanist," who had big plans for humankind. Epstein apparently told one scientist that he hoped to seed the human race with his own DNA by impregnating 20 women at a time at his New Mexico ranch, named "Zorro."
Transhumanism is the theory that the human population can be enhanced through technologies such as artificial intelligence and genetic engineering. Or eugenics by any other name. Epstein seems to have believed that he was that rare breed that ought to be replicated.
The carriers of Epstein’s apparently rarefied spermatozoa wouldn’t be the younger, underage sexual partners he allegedly prefers. Instead, according to the Times’ reporting, his maternal vehicles would be adult women whose intellectual qualifications would have been established through academic achievement.
For salon dinners he hosted at his Manhattan manse, Epstein often invited scientists as well as a sampling of attractive, accomplished women. Some of the scientists theorized that the women were being vetted as potential candidates for Epstein’s very special black book, according to the Times.
One can only imagine the conversations at such soirees: So, Penelope, what do you think of transhumanism? Oh, you do? And how do you like the desert air?
The male invitees weren’t your run-of-the-mill scientists but were some of the most renowned, innovative minds in research and academia. Among them was Steven Pinker, the Harvard cognitive psychologist and popular science author, who seems to have seen through Epstein, calling him an "intellectual impostor." Pinker told the Times that Epstein would abruptly shift topics and make juvenile remarks. To the layman’s eye, such behavior suggests a purposeful deflection when the topic at hand is reaching a point beyond the speaker’s comfort range.
Others on Epstein’s guest lists apparently were seduced by his charm and intellect, as well as his wealth, which he reportedly dangled as bait for funding-starved researchers. He was generous, often donating to a variety of interests and causes, including the Clinton Foundation. But he wasn’t convinced that helping the starving masses was productive in the right sense, arguing that providing food and health care to the poor would only heighten the risk of overpopulation.
Pinker, who said he was present when Epstein floated this idea at a gathering at Harvard, dissented, arguing that the evidence points to the contrary. Gods don’t like to be contradicted, and Pinker was thereafter told he’d been "voted off the island" and banished from future gatherings.
Speaking of which, Epstein’s private island in the Caribbean — which he dubs "Little St. Jeff’s" — is of renewed interest thanks to an NBC News report last week. Apparently, a blue-and-white striped, block-shaped building on it bears no resemblance to the octagonally shaped design that had been approved for a music hall, according to permit records.
What the structure does resemble, however, is a pharaoh’s headdress. Might this have been intended as a mausoleum for Epstein’s remains? That is, other than his head and penis, which he reportedly wished to have frozen. Also a fan of cryogenics, believing that frozen human parts and bodies could be resurrected in the future, Epstein is no ordinary bloke. Indeed, he is a perversely tragic figure.
Burdened with supra-human fantasies and the means to explore them, it seems that Epstein became lost in his own fable. Wandering the skies in his private jet, enamored of his own mind and image, he forgot that he was merely mortal and may have flown too close to the sun. Confined now to a jail cell (with further punishment perhaps to come) — and removed from his luxurious kingdom, his freedom and the company of luminaries who suffused his ego with admiration — his suffering must be immense.
And so richly deserved.

Attacking Obama is Democrats' worst strategy yet

Texto completo: With 66 weeks to go until the election, the Democrats tasked with saving a sinking ship of state have shown that they would rather drown in a sea of self-righteousness than steer the Donald Trump-rotted hulk to a fresh shore.
You know the presidential debates this week were a disaster for Democrats because Republican attack ads are already parroting the lines used by the leading candidates: Take away people's private health care, decriminalize the border, socialism!
And rather than effectively prosecute the easy case against the worst president ever, the Democrats went after one of the best: Barack Obama. This is a winning strategy only in a world where everyone gets a trophy, which is to say, much of the younger Democratic base.
Debates are supposed to refine and reduce a party's message. The unwinnable and unpopular are shown to be just that. Crazy falls away. Good ideas rise. A story emerges. A governing strategy is presented.
In savaging one another, all but a handful of the 20 Democrats on display this week ignored one of the best things the party has going for it: Trump is actively trying to take away health care from millions. His administration is litigating to kill all of Obamacare, which would gut cherished protections for preexisting conditions. The Democrats crushed the 2018 election on a message to save this enduring part of Obama's greatest legacy.
But progressive Democrats have replaced that winning message with a losing message of their own: eliminating the private health insurance of more than 150 million Americans. This is how Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders expect to win.
Perhaps in a world where Mitch McConnell would let a modern idea see a vote on the floor of the Senate, replacing all private health insurance with a government-run system would be worthy of vigorous debate. And maybe it's a debate the Democrats could even win. But as of now, it's wildly unpopular.
As Sen. Amy Klobuchar said, "We are more worried about winning an argument than winning an election." To which Warren has replied that someone should not go through all the trouble of running for president without big ideas. True. But nor should someone go through all the trouble of running for president and not have the right ideas needed to win.
Sanders, as wild-eyed, scowling and angry as an Old Testament prophet on the downside of the prediction racket, is a sloganeer. Like all sloganeers, he has simplistic ideas; they sound best when shouted through a bullhorn. He should run for president of the socialist party of his choosing, and leave the Democrats to fight for the American majority.
Two things are going on in a debate: There are the personal clashes, atmospherics and zingers, always the focus of the pundit class, which views politics as theater, and then there are the statements and projections of policy, which voters pay attention to. Warren may be the best debate athlete, but she's promoting unwinnable positions on health care, open borders and how to pay for all the trillion-dollar things she wants to make free.
Meanwhile, Obama, of all people, is now a target for cannibalistic candidates from the left. No Democrat is more popular. A Pew survey last year found that more people named him the greatest president of their lifetime than any other. He wasn't attacked directly by name this week, but his policies - the audacity of common sense - were.
"If you cross the border illegally, you should be able to be sent back," said Joe Biden, espousing a position mocked by many Democrats. "It's a crime." This was Obama's position. Trump has taken it to a cruel and catastrophic new level, separating families and keeping children in cages. But because enough Democrats want to decriminalize border crossings, Trump can still get the edge on this issue.
The Beltway magpies projected a Biden collapse after the first debate. A month later, he still leads the field by a healthy margin. As long as Biden keeps defending the best of Obama's legacy, he will continue as the Democrat most likely to rid the world of Donald Trump.
But he may still falter on acuity and focus. And by rattling off a number at the end of the debate that sounded as if he were giving out his personal PIN code, Biden clearly had a senior moment.
That leaves room for Mayor Pete Buttigieg. The youngest candidate in the field shows the most wisdom of the ages. He's bright, articulate and forceful and projects a toughened American optimism. When he shamed Republicans for refusing to stand up to Trump, he showed that he's one of the few candidates rising to history's call - hearing the same clarion that guided Barack Obama.

Texto completo: President Trump's private company has received a subpoena for documents related to a hush money payment to adult-film star Stormy Daniels, indicating renewed law enforcement interest in the payoff.
The subpoena from Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus R. Vance Jr. arrived at the headquarters of the Trump Organization in New York on Thursday, according to a person familiar with the order. It came just weeks after a judge in New York said federal prosecutors had effectively concluded a campaign finance investigation into the hush money.
Trump's former personal lawyer Michael Cohen pleaded guilty last year to campaign finance violations and other crimes, acknowledging as part of an agreement with prosecutors that he arranged payments in 2016 to two women to keep their allegations of affairs with Trump from becoming public before Election Day. Cohen, who is serving a three-year prison sentence, said the payments were arranged at Trump's direction. The president has denied the affairs and any wrongdoing.
On Friday, a lawyer for the Trump Organization called the new subpoena, which was f irst reported by the New York Times, a form of harassment.
"How many times are we going to go over the same ground again and again?" attorney Marc L. Mukasey said in a statement. "It's harassment of the president, his family, and his business using subpoenas and leaks as weapons."
Vance's office declined to comment. The Times reported that the district attorney is examining whether any senior officials in the Trump Organization filed falsified business records about the payments in a violation of state law.
The district attorney's inquiry is among a number of New York-based investigations into the president and those in his orbit. Federal prosecutors in Manhattan and Brooklyn have been examining possible foreign influence on Trump's campaign. Meanwhile, New York Attorney General Letitia James (D) is suing Trump and his children, accusing the family's charity of "persistently illegal conduct."
James's office has also interviewed more than two dozen former workers at Trump's golf clubs, asking about allegations that Trump's company exploited them because they lack legal immigration status. And her office has subpoenaed records from Deutsche Bank, one of Trump's main lenders, after allegations from Trump's former attorney that Trump misled lenders about the size of his fortune.
Cohen has repeatedly maintained that Trump directed him and other Trump Organization executives to make the hush money payments.
"It was my own weakness and a blind loyalty to this man that led me to choose a path of darkness over light," he said at his sentencing in December. "Time and time again, I felt it was my duty to cover up his dirty deeds."
Last month, in a letter to U.S. District Judge William H. Pauley III, federal prosecutors in Manhattan said the government had "effectively concluded its investigations" into who else besides Cohen could be criminally liable as part of the hush money scheme.
In response, Jay Sekulow, the president's current attorney, said, "Case closed."

Texto completo: We are told that no votes were altered by foreign hackers during the last presidential election, but there are other ways to change a vote. Most votes today are obtained through Madison Avenue-style marketing that mass communicates a carefully crafted position for each candidate.
Our 2016 presidential election was the largest advertising campaign in the world with total expenditures of around $2.4 billion. Marketing and advertising use mass communication theory to manipulate public opinion which ultimately determines how we vote.
Public opinion is formed primarily on television, but the internet is rapidly becoming the new media of choice. Traditionally we regulated all political advertising at the source, but in the unfolding Internet Age, which is in its infancy and basically unregulated, this is increasingly more difficult.
We should recognize this as the latest form of international warfare with no side having a superior technological advantage over the other. It is the only level playing field in modern military warfare as taught by our Military War Colleges. The systemic and massive Russian cyber-attacks detailed by the Mueller report show that we must keep foreign governments and bad actors from interfering in our elections if we want to keep our democratic elections fair and secure.
Candidates running for office influence public opinion and win your vote by repeating different forms of a consistent message on mass media. Over the years the battle for our votes and minds has shifted from newsprint to radio, then television and now to the internet. Previously all media were produced or transmitted from specific point sources where false or misleading information could be edited before being shown to the public. But the internet is so new that it's like the Wild West, where virtually anyone can promote anything unfiltered for accuracy.
Between late 2015 and 2017 more than 3,000 ads were purchased by accounts tied to the Russian government's Internet Research Agency alone. Inflammatory and divisive messages by Russian agents reached 126 million Facebook users, appearing 131,000 times on Twitter, and 1,000 YouTube videos were uploaded according to internet companies as reported by the New York Times. USA Today reported that divisive and racial ad buys starting in 2015 and saw a significant buildup in the months and weeks prior to the election in 2016.
Polarization can occur when the messages appeal to basic human instincts such as, "My tribe thinks like me, but I do not like that other tribe because they think differently." After six hours of congressional testimony we know Russian operatives and possibly others targeted political extremes with repeated negative messages in a massive attempt to manipulate our opinions and votes and to suppress voter turnout.
A series of three to five direct-mail ads several weeks apart consistently produces a 2-5% customer response, according to a study published in The Arizona Republic. That means about 2 to 6 million Facebook users and countless Twitter followers and YouTube viewers were possibly affected by Russian efforts. It means a million or more votes were possibly affected by Russian interference. The razor-thin margins of victory in Florida, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin were each less than two percent of the vote and clinched the election.
No matter which side of the aisle you are on, all Americans want our democratic elections to be fair and accurate. In future elections these attacks might be against your candidate. Welcome to the new warfare.

Texto completo: What's on TV
THE FAVOURITE (2018) 8 p.m. on HBO; stream on HBO platforms. Olivia Colman stars as Queen Anne in Yorgos Lanthimos' "The Favourite," which is making its TV debut tonight. Colman, who won an Academy Award for her performance, portrays Queen Anne, the last monarch of the House of Stuart, as she faces ill health and waning political credibility. But the film's primary focus is the love triangle between Anne; Sarah Churchill (Rachel Weisz), the Duchess of Marlborough and a close adviser to the queen; and Sarah's rival, Abigail Hill (Emma Stone), a chambermaid turned close confidant. A.O. Scott, who chose the film as a Critic's Pick, wrote in his New York Times review: "Weisz and Stone are both brilliantly witty and nimble, but Colman's performance is nothing short of sublime. She commits absolutely to Anne's ridiculousness, and also to the contradictory facets of her humanity."
BURT REYNOLDS BLOCK Starts at 6 a.m. and goes all day on HDNet Movies. Feeling nostalgic? Settle in for "Happy Burt Day," an all-day Burt Reynold marathon. The day begins with the 1966 Spaghetti Western "Navajo Joe." Next up is "Fuzz" (1972), then "Gator" (1976) and "Malone" (1987). Reynold's 1973 hit "White Lightning," where he plays an ex-con who agrees to help federal agents hunt down a criminal in exchange for his release, starts at 1:40 p.m. After that, it's "Semi-Tough" (1977) and "The End" (1978), and the day ends with "Striptease" (1996).
What's Streaming
DERRY GIRLS Stream on Netflix. This series follows a group of five friends in 1990s Northern Ireland at the height of the ethnonationalist conflict known as The Troubles. But for the crew of four girls (Saoirse-Monica Jackson, Louisa Harland, Nicola Coughlan and Jamie-Lee O'Donnel) and one boy (Dylan Llewellyn), that violence is very much in the periphery -- they're more concerned with breaking rules and scheming to achieve some sense of freedom from their strict Catholic parents and the disciplinarian nuns at their school. The second season has much the same tone as the first; expect nods to Bill Clinton's visit to Ireland and a weekend camping trip to heal Catholic-Protestant relationships among youths.
FOUR WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL Stream on Hulu. The four-part mini-series created by Mindy Kaling and Matt Warburton isn't quite like the classic 1994 film of the same name. The only tangible connection, The Times's Margaret Lyons points out in her review, is that they both take place in London. The show, though, is technically a romantic comedy and begins with Maya (Nathalie Emmanuel) leaving her messy work and personal life in the States behind to attend her college roommate's wedding in London. While across the pond, she reconnects with old friends (Rebecca Rittenhouse, John Reynolds and Zoe Boyle) and grapples with love, loss and scandal.

Texto completo: Edward Snowden, the National Security Agency contractor who leaked a trove of secret documents in 2013, has written a memoir expected to come out Sept. 17, his publisher said Thursday.
The publisher, Metropolitan Books, an imprint of Macmillan Publishers, is releasing the book, "Permanent Record," in the United States, though it will be published in more than 20 countries, including Britain and Germany, on the same date. A Metropolitan spokeswoman declined to say how much Mr. Snowden was paid.
"Permanent Record" discusses how Mr. Snowden helped create a system of mass surveillance the N.S.A. used to collect information on hundreds of millions of United States citizens and others, as well as the "crisis of conscience" that led him to rebuke the system he helped create, according to a statement from the publisher. Mr. Snowden consulted with several people on the structure of the book but wrote it himself, the spokeswoman said.
In a video posted to his Twitter account Thursday morning, Mr. Snowden expressed regret for his role at the N.S.A. "Everything that we do now lasts forever, not because we'd want to remember, but because we're no longer allowed to forget," he said. "Helping to create that system is my greatest regret." The video also notes that the book's Sept. 17 release date is Constitution Day, which recognizes the date the United States' foundational document was signed in 1787.
From his exile in Moscow, Snowden has become a bit of a pop culture icon, praised by people who say he was protecting citizens' privacy. In 2014, The Guardian and The Washington Post shared a Pulitzer Prize for their reporting on Mr. Snowden. He's the subject of "Citizenfour," an Academy Award-winning documentary, and has been featured in video games and even a play via video. He probably won't make public appearances to promote the book but may appear in further videos, the Metropolitan spokeswoman said.
"Edward Snowden decided at the age of 29 to give up his entire future for the good of his country," John Sargent, the chief executive of Macmillan Publishers, said in the statement. "He displayed enormous courage in doing so, and like him or not, his is an incredible American story."

Serving as a lifeline Docuseries will show how sport provides hope

Texto completo: There are obviously vast differences been Chinle, Arizona and Allentown, Pa.
One is in the heart of Navajo Nation, the largest tribal area in America. The other is one of biggest cities in Pennsylvania.
There are hardships in both venues, but the new Netflix docuseries "Basketball or Nothing" will hit home with those who understand how high school basketball - whether it's played at a school in the desert or in a rough-and-tumble city on the East Coast - can offer a lifeline to kids who have virtually nothing else.
The six-episode series debuts on Netflix on Friday morning, and each of the 30- to 37-minute episodes can be viewed in one sitting.
One of the executive producers of "Basketball or Nothing" is Todd Donnelly of Bethlehem, the director of business development for the Radnor-based Workshop Content Studios, which produced the series.
Donnelly said the company had worked on the project for nearly three years and said it was all worth it, especially after Netflix came on board.
On the surface, it's the story of the Chinle High basketball team, but at its core it's about the human spirit and the power to overcome obstacles.
"The idea is to educate our overall population that there are things we can do better as a society," Donnelly said. "But it didn't matter how tough it was for some of these kids; their resiliency shined through. It was so positive and enlightening.
"Regardless of their situation, they weren't going to allow their plight to dictate how good a team they were going to be and what kind of player they were. They were not the 'woe is me' type of kids. They were just glad to get to play basketball."
The series also explains how a high school team can play in a palatial facility that would be the envy of most Lehigh Valley squads and yet have kids go home to next to nothing.
"They have a four-sided scoreboard and yet they live in tough conditions," Donnelly said. "They live in a very small town and there are not a lot of options for them in the job market. There's just not a lot of opportunity there."
The story took time to develop.
"We had to do a lot of background and get approvals from the Navajo Nation and the schools," Donnelly said. "That took some time. We didn't want to rush stuff. We wanted the people of Chinle to understand that we were there to tell a great story and not take advantage."
Donnelly learned there was a lot of similarity between the struggles of those in inner cities and those living on the reservation.
"That's not from a sports standpoint," he said. "It's more from a culture, economic and family dynamics standpoint."
Donnelly said the kids in Chinle have to deal with a lack of quality food, lack of good health and a general lack of essentials - running water, electricity, etc. - that most families take for granted.
All Chinle has, it seems, is a talented, hard-working and entertaining basketball team that attracts as many as 6,000 fans to games played in a state-of-the-art gym in a town populated by 4,500 people.
There are no college or professional teams for the people to get behind. Chinle basketball is the only show in town and people travel great distances to see it.
The players on the team are rock stars and the style of play, dubbed "rezball," is as popular as "Showtime" was in Los Angeles during the Magic Johnson era or the triangle offense in Chicago when Michael Jordan ruled.
Because the team lacks size, with its tallest player topping out at 6-foot-1, Chinle must use its up-tempo, aggressive "rezball" style to have a chance.
The series documents the 2017-18 season when Chinle entered as a state champion, but the cameras go well beyond the gym and locker room and into the players' homes to show how it's a struggle for them to get through every day.
Patrick Donnelly, the former Lehigh University baseball player who played basketball at Liberty High School, is in marketing and development for Workshop Content and got to work on the project with his father.
"It's truly an underdog story," he said. "These kids come from nothing and have difficult lives. Alcoholism and drugs are a big part of it, but that basketball court and basketball in general are their safe haven. It's an escape."
Donnelly compared it to "Last Chance U," another Netflix series that deals with young athletes trying to make it in football.
"It's very emotional, very dramatic," he said. "There's a lot of storytelling to go along with the basketball. I took to this story because it's associated with sports. I loved every second of it, and what's cool is that [pro golfer] Rickie Fowler is also executive producer on the series with us."
Matt Howley of Philadelphia was the driving force behind the project and served as producer and director. Howley became aware of the Chinle basketball team by reading a story on them in the New York Times and wanted to tell their story on a different platform.
"I hope people find it to be inspirational," Howley said. "I hope they're inspired by these kids not only finishing high school, but some of them earning college scholarships. It is a story of resiliency of the kids and a culture. They get a lot thrown at them and they keep grinding."
Howey said his biggest challenge was gaining trust.
"They said people had come in before and filmed for a couple of days and told a story of drugs, alcohol and suicide and profited off that," he said. "They said they didn't want that again, so it took time to get close to the kids. The athletic director told me they're not going to care about this project until they care about you."
Without cameras rolling, Howey said the crew took time to talk and listen and know the kids and their families over 50 days of filming.
There were logistical challenges as well considering some of the kids lived as much as an hour away from the school and some of the road games required three hours of travel.
Despite the hardships, Howey said it was the most rewarding experience he's ever had.
"Once we got to know the kids, we fell in love with them and we stay in touch to this day by texting," he said. "We feel like we're family now. We only had a four-person crew and we were all touched by what they're going through.
"Without a doubt, it was a life-changing experience for all of us and hopefully it will have that kind of impact on the people who watch it."

Texto completo: Taking a back seat to the Apollo 11 moon landing in our coverage of things celebrating a 50th anniversary this year leaves Morris the Cat in uncharted territory.
"He was a TV star," says Tom Van Winkle, executive director of the Hinsdale Humane Society, where the advertising feline was discovered. Morris became a household name in 1969 by strutting his stuff in the first of 58 commercials for 9Lives. "It’s pretty amazing how it still resonates with people," Van Winkle says.
It’s likely that Morris was surrendered by his owner or possibly rescued off the street in 1968. But the orange-striped Tabby won over animal trainer and handler Bob Martwick of Lombard, who stopped by the shelter in Hinsdale looking for a cat to appear in commercials for 9Lives cat food. Martwick brought the calm, some would say aloof, stray cat to a meeting with the creative team at the Leo Burnett advertising agency in Chicago, and Morris made an unforgettable impression.
"He jumped on the table … and he walked right up to the art director, the big cheese, and bumped him in the head. And then Morris just sat back," Martwick said during his many media interviews about the cat. "The art director said, ‘This is the Clark Gable of cats.’" Voiced by actor John Erwin, who also provided the voice for the popular He-Man cartoon character in the 1980s, Morris was the wisecracking, sardonic, finicky cat, who had little tolerance for anything except 9Lives cat food.
"Oh, I remember the Morris commercials. He definitely had a special personality that most cats don’t have," says Van Winkle, who now has enough Morris goodies at the Hinsdale Humane Society for a Morris shrine.
"This is a portrait from 1974," Van Winkle says of a large framed photograph of Morris that was taken in the photo studio at the L.S. Ayres department store in Indianapolis during one of the cat’s celebrity appearances.
"This was made by the company that makes the Emmy," he says, showing off a golden trophy in the image of Morris.
That trophy was given to one of nine cats from around the nation competing to be the 9Lives cat of the year in a lavish competition held in the famed Beverly Hills Hotel. Celebrity judges included Betty White and Ed Asner, remembers Jennifer Petterson, who started her public relations career in the 1980s with the third generation of Morris the Cat as part of her work with the Edelman communications firm of Chicago. Petterson and her staff flew in coach and carried the director’s chair with "Morris" written across the back, while Martwick and Morris, in a carrier tucked under the seat, flew first-class.
"You could see tufts of his fur through the carrier," remembers Petterson, who now lives in La Grange. "You didn’t dare say who he was because people would go gaga."
Petterson, who now runs her pettersonpr.com consulting firm, was one of a select few who got to hold Morris, aside from Martwick. A no-nonsense guy who still kept the crew cut he wore as a Navy pilot during World War II, Martwick also helped discover Spuds MacKenzie, the beer-selling dog of Anheuser-Busch.
"He was a lovely man, but was quiet and looked stern," says Petterson, who also worked with dog stars such as Beethoven, Lassie and the dog on "Frasier."
The original Morris died in July of 1978 at the age of 17, and his obituary in The New York Times noted Morris was "laid to rest near Mr. Martwick’s home," apparently in a backyard ceremony befitting his unpretentious roots. Martwick died in 2001 at age 75.
All subsequent replacement look-alike Morrises have been rescue cats, and the current Morris can be found on Twitter at @MorrisApproved, on Facebook, and on YouTube with his "Cat’s Eye View" on the 9Lives Cat Food channel, which notes that "America’s choosiest cat gives back" in an effort to "Live Well & Prospurr."
In 2015, Morris was one of 10 brand mascots alongside the Green Giant, Ronald McDonald, Mr. Clean and others to be honored with "A Salute to Advertising’s Greatest Icons" at the Museum of Broadcast Communications in Chicago.
During his half-century career, Morris has received thousands of fan letters, and included his paw print on his responses. He endured countless puns about his purrfect life and his catapulting to stardom. He traveled the nation, promoting feline health and animal shelters, and visiting hospitals and schools. A later Morris launched his "Morris for President" campaign in 1988 by stumping with Eleanor Mondale, took a second shot at the White House in 2012, and might actually win if he joins the 2020 race.
The original Morris had a part in Robert Altman’s 1973 film, "The Long Goodbye," and appeared alongside Burt Reynolds and Dyan Cannon in "Shamus." Morris also is listed as the author of three books.
In addition to selling cat food, later versions of Morris worked with the American Veterinary Medical Association in Schaumburg in establishing February as Cat Health Month, and led the Morris Million Cat Rescue adoption campaign in 2006.
That activism for less fortunate cats helps explain why Morris is so fondly remembered today.
"It’s still a sense of pride for the shelter and the community that this famous cat came from us," Van Winkle says. "It’s pride for the whole community because a rescue animal made it big."

Texto completo: You know its going to be a long, hot summer if, on the day before you assume the political leadership of the United Kingdomas Boris Johnson did on July 23one of the worlds most authoritative newspapers, the New York Times, prints a column that begins with the phrase, Boris Johnson, to whom lying comes as easily as breathing
As searing as that opening line was, it wasnt the columns most pointed point. That came when it suggested that Prime Minister Johnsonformerly known as Mr. Brexitmight have trouble dealing with his European Union (EU) counterparts because, well, It doesnt help, of course, that its officials regard Mr. Johnson as a dangerous buffoon.
Keep in mind that these are the Europeans playing nice. When theyre not playing nice they simply say nothing, like right now in response to the White Houses demand that US-EU trade talks include agriculture.
Silence, when it comes to trade talks, isnt golden.
Another sure sign of summer heat is the inability of most federal officials to see the broad, clear picture in front of them once the smell of burning jet fuel hits either end of Pennsylvania Avenue in late July.
For example, with Congress itching to leave on its annual August recess, U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue announced changes in rules governing the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program (SNAP) to cut an estimated $2.5 billion and 3 million Americans from the program.
Its Secretary Sonnys second run at SNAP; he made a similar attempt during the 2018 Farm Bill fight. Congress roundly rejected his idea and left it out of the final, bipartisan bill. Now, just a year later, Perdue claims he has the authority to implement the cuts despite the Farm Bill that his boss, President Donald J. Trump, signed.
Worse, Perdue could not have picked a more perfectly awful time to make his legally questionable, politically clumsy move.
First, no sooner had Perdue assumed legal powers not given him by the Constitution, the President took to Twitter to notewrongly, as is often the case with his tweetsthat Farmers are starting to do great again, after 15 years of a downward spiral.
As every farmer knows and every fact makes clear, there has been no 15-year downward spiral for farmers for decades. In fact, U.S. net farm income hit an all-time record, $123.4 billion, just six years ago before bottoming out at an estimated $62 billion in 2016.
After that whopper, though, the President did get the next fact exactly right: The 16 Billion Dollar China replacement money didnt exactly hurt!
No, it didnt. Nor did the estimated $9 billion farmers also received in similar trade mitigation subsidies in 2018.
In fact, if the entire $16 billion in China money that the President alluded to was paid to farmers this fiscal yearand it wont because the paymaster, USDAs Commodity Credit Corp., must wait for the new fiscal year on Oct. 1 to replenish its drained accountsthe Trump replacement cash would represent 23 percent of 2019s forecasted net farm income of $69 billion.
Twenty-three percent. How thats something to brag about when it flies in the face of most farmersand every Americansunderstanding of free markets and free trade?
Worse, the Presidents self-congratulatory tweet gave the Washington press corps another shot to compare White House policy directed at its rural political supporters$16 billion in unfunded, non-Congressionally approved subsidieseven as it makes an end run to cut Congressionally-required, legal benefits to the poor by $2.5 billion.
It was such a slow, fat softball that even the myopic, mostly non-athletic White House press folks hammered it out of sight. The selective socialism of Donald Trump: Farmers, yes. Poor families, no, declared a headline in the July 23 Washington Post.
Great. This long, hot summer just keeps getting longer and hotter.

Texto completo: Frankfurt -- After more than $ 30 billion in fines, numerous indicted executives and a guilty plea in the United States, you wouldn't think there was much more to learn about the Volkswagen emissions scandal.
Wrong. Nearly four years after Volkswagen confessed to systematically evading pollution rules for a decade, facets of the scandal are still coming to light. Newly uncovered documents viewed by The New York Times show that Volkswagen's Audi luxury-car unit was more deeply involved in developing the emissions cheating scheme than previously known, and continued to sell vehicles with illegal software even after the scandal became public.
The documents, first reported earlier this month by German broadcaster Bayerische Rundfunk and the Handelsblatt newspaper, show that Audi managers and engineers in the Bavarian city of Ingolstadt were just as willing as their counterparts at Volkswagen in Wolfsburg to cheat in pursuit of the company's goal of becoming the largest carmaker in the world -- perhaps even more so.
"We won't make it without a few dirty tricks," an employee in Audi's diesel motor development department wrote in an email to colleagues in January 2008, summarizing road tests that confirmed diesel models couldn't meet emissions standards. Audi managers and engineers bluntly discussed what was in effect a criminal conspiracy, using terms like "defeat device" or "cycle beating" that clearly connote illegal attempts to defeat the testing procedures used by regulators.
The Audi documents are the latest in a steady drip of revelations that have complicated Volkswagen's attempts to move beyond the scandal and reposition itself as the carmaker that will make emission-free electric cars affordable for the masses.
On Thursday, the company was one of four carmakers that agreed with California on a plan to reduce carbon dioxide emissions -- in defiance of Trump administration efforts to roll back such standards. But almost four years after the Environmental Protection Agency formally accused Volkswagen of wrongdoing, the company has refused to disclose the results of its internal investigation of the scandal. Instead, information emerges piecemeal, generating fresh headlines each time.
Audi said it was constrained from commenting because of pending criminal investigations. It may appear "as if we don't want to communicate," the company said in a statement, adding that in some cases it has been specifically forbidden by American authorities from discussing evidence. "The communication of many issues was and is not in our hands," the Audi statement said.
In Germany, Audi is not forbidden from discussing evidence, said Andrea Mayer, a spokeswoman for prosecutors in Munich. "Whether it's clever or not is their decision," she said. "We don't prohibit it."
By withholding information, Volkswagen and Audi arguably prolong their agony. "It's been established pretty clearly, if anecdotally, that companies that come clean quickly and fulsomely are better off in the long run," said Alexandra Wrage, president of Trace, a consulting firm in Annapolis, Md., that helps companies avoid getting entangled in corruption. "But many still opt for opacity."
'Deadline situation critical'
Most of the recent set of documents were prepared in 2007 and 2008. Audi and Volkswagen were on the verge of a major attempt to regain past glory in the United States by selling Americans on the virtues of "clean diesel." If it succeeded, it would help Volkswagen surpass Toyota as the world's biggest automaker.
But development of new diesel technology was behind schedule, endangering the whole project. The new models at the heart of the campaign couldn't meet United States emissions standards, which were stricter than Europe's.
"Deadline situation critical," warned an internal Audi presentation in 2007.
Trapped between Volkswagen's aspirations and the laws of physics, Audi engineers devised an ingenious but illegal workaround. They installed software in the engine computer that could recognize the telltale signs of an official emissions test. If regulators were looking, the software would temporarily ramp up pollution controls to be compliant. In everyday use, the cars produced emissions far above legal limits.
Emissions cheating already had a precedent at Audi, according to another document. In May 2003, an Audi software developer circulated a parody of the Erl-King, a classic poem by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. "Defeat device, come hither!" the poem read in part. (It sounds better in German.) Also: "CARB won't notice." CARB is a reference to the California Air Resources Board, the state's clean air enforcer; it did notice, and its investigators were largely responsible for forcing Volkswagen to confess.
At the time of the poem, according to evidence presented in United States courts, Audi was already using illegal software in Europe. The new documents show that the decision to do so was driven by marketing concerns.
Vehicles like the Audi Q7 S.U.V. were equipped with a kind of catalytic converter that used injections of a chemical solution to neutralize emissions of nitrogen oxides -- harmful gases that have been linked to asthma, bronchitis, heart problems and cancer.
The chemical solution, sold commercially as AdBlue, required a separate storage tank. Audi was worried that American car owners, unused to diesel technology, would not accept the inconvenience of having to occasionally refill the tank. So Audi tried to design the cars such that they'd only need refills when owners visited dealers for regular servicing every 10,000 miles.
"Under no circumstances" should customers be forced to refill the tank in the intervals between service, an Audi email in April 2008 warned. "That would be a disaster for the entire Clean Diesel strategy in North America!" the author wrote in bold type.
The dilemma for Audi engineers was that the tanks planned for the cars wouldn't hold enough fluid to last 10,000 miles. The obvious solutions -- a bigger tank or a second tank -- were rejected. A bigger tank would have robbed valuable interior space. A senior manager vetoed installation of a second tank for cost reasons, according to a 2007 PowerPoint presentation.
Another presentation from 2008 offered a way around the problem. The car would have two operating modes, according to the document. One would reduce nitrogen oxide emissions by at least 90 percent, while consuming a lot of AdBlue. But that mode would only be used in conditions that corresponded to an official test. The second mode, used most of the time, would ration consumption of AdBlue and produce higher emissions.
The presentation noted that the approach was a form of cycle beating, the automotive equivalent of cheating on an exam. "Highly critical in the USA!" the document warned.
As Volkswagen later admitted in a plea agreement with the Justice Department, Audi deployed illegal software anyway.
Defeat devices on the market as late as 2017
The unidentified PowerPoint author was right about how risky the strategy would be in the United States. Two former Volkswagen officials are serving prison terms for defrauding federal officials, while German and American authorities have filed criminal charges against numerous others. Fines and legal settlements have cost Volkswagen more than $ 30 billion so far, and numerous lawsuits are still pending.
Rupert Stadler, Audi's former chief executive, is considered a suspect by German prosecutors. Mr. Stadler, who has denied wrongdoing, spent four months in pretrial detention last year after prosecutors accused him of trying to obstruct the investigation.
So ingrained was the use of illegal software that Audi continued to use it even after American authorities formally accused Volkswagen of emissions cheating in September 2015. In December 2017, according to documents that did not become public until earlier this month, German regulators ordered Audi to recall 150,000 Q5 midsize S.U.V.s with 3-liter diesel engines because they contained defeat devices. Some of the vehicles were brand-new, the documents indicate. They were not sold in the United States, however.
In a statement, Audi said that because of the complexity of the software, it took time for the company, working with regulators, to identify problems. The company said it has taken steps to prevent further cheating -- for example, by separating software approval from software development, establishing a whistle-blower system, and requiring all employees to take courses in compliance.
"We have undertaken a great deal," Audi's statement said, "to ensure that something like the diesel crisis never happens again."

Texto completo: Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts has received one million donations to her campaign for president, her team said on Friday, making her the only Democratic candidate aside from Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont to announce reaching that threshold in the 2020 cycle.
The milestone further solidifies Ms. Warren's standing as a top fund-raiser after a slow first three months in the presidential race, during which she raised just $ 6 million. Despite having sworn off private fund-raisers, Ms. Warren raised $ 19.2 million in the second quarter, placing her behind only Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. during that period.
Ms. Warren posted a video on Friday that showed her calling the supporter who made the millionth contribution. "I'm calling to say a double woo-hoo thank you," she said. "This is how we're going to do it."
In an email sent to supporters about the accomplishment, Ms. Warren's campaign manager, Roger Lau, described her presidential bid as a "100 percent people-powered campaign."
[Which Democrats are leading the 2020 presidential race this week?]
"This is exciting proof of the momentum that we see on the ground across the country," he wrote. "Powerful special interests and other campaigns are watching to see how ready we are to fight for big, structural change. And by hitting this first milestone, you're helping to show them that change is coming sooner than they think."
Mr. Sanders announced that he had crossed the million-donation threshold in April, and his campaign said Friday that it had reached two million donations on July 11. Through the end of June, he had raised about $ 36 million this cycle, more than Ms. Warren's $ 25 million total. But his haul in the second quarter, $ 18 million, was slightly less than Ms. Warren's in that period, which ran from April through June.
Attracting small donations from a large number of individuals has taken on even greater importance this cycle as the Democratic National Committee has made grass-roots fund-raising a qualification standard for the debates. To earn a spot on the debate stage in September, candidates must have received donations from at least 130,000 unique contributors, a bar that, as of Friday morning, only eight of the 24 candidates had met, according to a New York Times analysis. (Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders are among those who have surpassed that number.)
[Cory Booker and Kamala Harris challenged Mr. Biden's record on race ahead of the next debate.]
On Friday, Ms. Warren's campaign did not specify how many individuals had made donations this cycle, only that one million donations were made over all. Donors can make multiple contributions over the course of the campaign.
Ms. Warren's strong fund-raising in recent months coincided with a rise in polling that has firmly placed her in the top tier of candidates. She has been propelled in part by her steady stream of policy plans, which have brought attention to her campaign and helped shape the debate in the Democratic primary.
Ms. Warren will be onstage next to Mr. Sanders in the next debate on Tuesday. The two candidates, the leading progressives in the field, debated on separate nights last month.

We're having fun, right? Do we really need to label this 'impeachment'?

Texto completo: "Impeachment isn't a binary thing that you either are or you aren't. What we've been saying and what we've been doing is starting a process where we're engaging in an investigation to see if we should recommend articles of impeachment."
- Rep. Mary Gay Scanlon (D-Pa.) on July 26, regarding President Trump

Is this an impeachment proceeding?
I mean. Call it a - mmm, do we need to define what this is, at such an early stage?
We're having fun, aren't we? You and I, and our subpoena power? This time together, is it really more valuable if it's Definitely Heading Toward Impeachment than if it's just something we're doing for us, right now, without worrying about where it goes? Can't we just savor what we have now and not rush to squeeze it into some sort of box? Can't this just be meaningful, you and I and Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.) asking questions and sometimes getting answers and sometimes not getting answers, but still learning, still growing! Can't this be enough?
After all, I did hear that Jerry secretly told some intimates (who subsequently told the New York Times about it, so you know he's serious) that he could see this heading toward impeachment. That is how seriously he's taking it! Just because he is too shy to say so in so many words does not mean he hasn't thought about it.
Why, just Friday, he and several other members said, publicly, that this might be the start of something that could ultimately wind up on the road to an inquiry that could lead to proceedings for an impeachment! So - I think we're on the same page, right? I don't know why you'd push for an upfront commitment bigger than that.
Meanwhile, we had that Mueller testimony. See, that gave me pause. I expect - you know, I don't want to say "I expect fireworks" from my testimony, because I know how unrealistic that is, and I know that impeachment even in an ideal world is just as much about dull things, like if the president obstructed justice, as it is about that simple, ineffable feeling between a country and its president. That sounds so crude and selfish and idiotic when it comes to something like determining fitness for office, but - I guess I must be old- fashioned. I wanted a feeling that the hearing did not quite give me, a feeling like we had with Richard M. Nixon, and, I guess, must also have had with Bill Clinton?
(To be honest, I always forget that the Clinton thing happened when I talk about how sacred and serious a commitment this is.)
Besides, impeachment? What an outdated system, maybe not even suited to our desires now, more like something our parents, or Newt Gingrich, would want. Why not use an election to remove him from office instead, if that is what we really want? That takes the pressure off us, so we can just enjoy our time together, watching administration officials fail to testify, or testify incompletely.
I want you to know I'm serious, though. I do think the president obstructed justice, and I am willing to do anything almost-but-not-quite-impeachment-like to show it. Besides, I am not sure Nancy Pelosi entirely approves! How about we call this an impeachment but know it isn't? Just when we're alone, maybe?
Or "impeachish"? "Impeachmeh"?
I mean, just, can you imagine walking around every day telling people we are really starting impeachment proceedings? Telling people who didn't want it to happen? I'd just have to be really sure, is all. And, yeah, I could be ready for it, but - can't we focus on infrastructure?
Is that cool? Great. I will tell people that we are continuing investigation of the president's malfeasances and we will consider what we have to consider including - well, you know. I knew you would get it. You're not needy, like some other parties I could name.

Texto completo: Manuel Gámez, el hombre hondureño cuya hija, Heydi Gámez García, murió luego de intentar suicidarse, podrá permanecer 30 días mas en Nueva York con su familia antes de detener que volver a un centro de detención , ha reportado la cadena de noticias CNN.
Gámez fue detenido por las autoridades de inmigración en junio cuando intentó cruzar la frontera, lo que sumió a su hija de 13 años en un delicado estado emocional.
El migrante hondureño fue llevado a un centro de detención de migrantes en Houston, Texas, pero recibió un permiso especial el pasado 13 de julio para darle el ultimo adiós a su hija, quien había sido declarada con muerte cerebral luego de que intentara quitarse la vida en Nueva York, donde vivía con unos familiares.
El permiso que las autoridades le habían concedió a Gámez iba a expirar este sábado, no obstante, las autoridades le han dado 30 días mas para que permanezca con su familia luego de que la menor fuera desconectada del soporte vital la semana pasada.
Aníbal Romero, abogado de Manuel Gámez, ha dicho que la extensión de 30 días le permitirá a su equipo legal ganar tiempo para buscar la manera con la que el migrante pueda quedarse en Estados Unidos.
Gámez, de 34 años, había vivido previamente en Nueva York por ocho años, pero tuvo que volver a Honduras en 2014 para encargarse de su hija, a quien había dejado con los abuelos.
El hombre ha dicho que tuvo que retornar a su país de origen porque miembros de la MS-13 mataron a su padre luego de que este se negara a pagarles al ser extorsionado.
Gámez envió a su hija a Estados Unidos en 2015 para protegerla de la violencia en Honduras pero decidió quedarse en el país centroamericano en caso de que deportaran a la menor.
En septiembre de 2015, luego de pasar casi dos meses en centros de acojo de menores, la niña, de 9 años en ese entonces, pudo llegar a Nueva York, donde la recibieron unos familiares. Su tía, Zoila Gámez, quien también decidió dejar Honduras, logró reunirse con ella meses después, ha reportado el diario The New York Times.
El padre emprendió el camino de vuelta a Estados Unidos en 2016, luego de que a la menor le concedieran el asilo debido a las amenazas por parte de pandillas en contra de su familia.
A diferencia de la travesía en la que se había embarcado nueve años atrás, Gámez terminó detenido en McAllen, Texas.
Gámez le dijo a los agentes de inmigración que temía por su vida. Sin embargo, las autoridades le respondieron que su miedo no era creíble y lo deportaron en noviembre de 2016.
El migrante hondureño fue detenido una vez más en septiembre de 2017 cerca a Santa Teresa, Nuevo México. Fue deportado después de pasar 45 días bajo custodia .
Con cada intento fallido, la menor empezó a perder la esperanza de reunirse con su padre y a presentar síntomas de estrés emocional.
En junio de este año, Gámez fue arrestado por la Patrulla Fronteriza luego de entrar ilegalmente al país. Según los familiares de la menor, la noticia de la detención le causó gran impacto, al punto que perdió el apetito y no quiso salir de su habitación por varios días.
No obstante, la situación se tornó aun mas complicada el pasado 3 de julio, cuando trató de quitarse la vida. Fue una de sus tías, preocupada por su estado emocional, quien entró a la habitación para ofrecerle algo de comer y se encontró con la aterradora escena: la niña colgada de un cable.
Según los médicos, la menor estaba “neurológicamente devastada”. La adolescente ha sido declarada con muerte cerebral. Su padre, quien emprendió el viaje a Estados Unidos varias veces sin éxito, recibió el 13 de julio un permiso especial de 14 días para poder despedirse de su hija moribunda.
Cuando Gámez aterrizó en el aeropuerto de Newark desconocía el estado de la niña.
Al enterarse del grave estado de salud de la menor, el padre hondureño decidió desconectarla luego de darle el ultimo adiós.
Los órganos de la menor fueron donados por la familia Gámez.
“Como padre no tienes esperanzas ni sueños para ti mismo, todos tus sueños son para tus hijos,” le dijo Gámez a The New York Times antes de la muerte de la niña.

Here to Help; One Thing You Can Do: Learn About Carbon Offsets

Texto completo: Welcome to the Climate Fwd: newsletter. The New York Times climate team emails readers once a week with stories and insights about climate change. Sign up here to get it in your inbox.
By Jillian Mock
Air travel, especially long trips, is one of the worst things an individual can do for the climate. For many, though, swearing off flying isn't a viable option. That's where carbon offsets can come in. But how do you actually buy and use these offsets?
Carbon offsets compensate for your emissions by canceling out greenhouse gas emissions somewhere else in the world. The money you pay to buy offsets supports programs designed to reduce emissions. Those might include projects to develop renewable energy, capture methane from landfills or livestock, or distribute cleaner cooking stoves.
If you decide to buy offsets, you have a lot of choices. Some airlines give you the option to buy them through their sustainability programs. Many online companies and nonprofits also offer them.
To make sure your money ultimately goes to worthwhile projects, look for certifications by auditors or standards groups like The Gold Standard or Green-e. Companies and nonprofits that deal in carbon offsets will list these certifications on their websites if they have them. Some standards groups also have databases of projects that have been verified by third-party auditors.
There is no fixed price on carbon, and the cost of an offset varies from project to project, depending on how expensive it is to run a given program, said Sarah Leugers, director of communications at The Gold Standard. In general, though, carbon offsets probably cost less than you think.
Consider a trip from New York to Los Angeles. Flying 2,500 miles in economy class will burn about 0.29 metric tons of carbon per passenger, according to the International Civil Aviation Organization's carbon emissions calculator. And it will cost about $ 3.26 to offset the approximately six hour, one-way flight using the travel offset calculator by Cool Effect, a nonprofit organization. If you round up to a full ton of carbon, you'd still only spend $ 3.30 to $ 13.18 on the Cool Effect website, depending on the project.
Not all carbon offset programs are created equal, as made evident in a recent investigation of forestry projects by ProPublica. To shop smarter, check to see how much money goes to the organization's overhead rather than to the project you want to support. And, keep an eye out for projects with collateral benefits, like contributing to sustainable development, improving air quality, or strengthening biodiversity.
If you're really worried about the carbon impact of your travel, the most effective thing to do is avoid flying as much as possible. But, when that's not realistic for you, carbon offsets can be a relatively inexpensive way to mitigate the damage.

On the front line of climate diplomacy
By Hiroko Tabuchi
As Japan's senior climate change negotiator, Hideo Suzuki has faced some seemingly impossible problems.
His country has come under fire for its energy policies, including plans to expand coal use to make up for its floundering nuclear energy program. Japanese banks have also been criticized for financing of coal projects overseas.
But what's an even bigger challenge facing Mr. Suzuki and his colleagues? Mr. Suzuki said the climate stance of the Trump administration has been dominating the diplomatic conversation for quite some time.
The administration has vowed to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement, scoffed at dire predictions about the effects of climate change, and, at home, has rolled back a slew of environmental regulations.
If there's no changing President Trump's mind on the urgency of climate change, what's the world to do? That's a timely question, because top negotiators will be gathering in for two big climate summit meetings this year, first in September in New York and again in Santiago, Chile, in December.
Mr. Suzuki said the answer might be to just move on. Rather than keep battling the United States over the Paris accord, he said, climate negotiators stand to make more progress by shifting their approach.
"What's important is to focus on specific efforts to reduce carbon dioxide emissions," he said. "What can we agree on? What about climate innovation?"
Decarbonizing steel and other heavy industries should be one area of focus, he said, as well as cleaning up transportation with policies that promote electric vehicles and fuel-cell cars, or investing in carbon-capture technology.
"I think America is still on board with that," Mr. Suzuki said.
One example of how America could be on board is a raft of new federal tax credits for industrial carbon capture are expected to spur its use across a range of industries, including steel, cement, chemicals and fertilizers.
That, Mr. Suzuki said, is the critical question for the climate talks that culminate in Santiago: How much can developing nations reduce their emissions, and how much can richer countries aid that effort through financing green technologies that will eventually benefit everyone?
"That's ambition," he said.

From the mailbag
Hello, and welcome to a new Climate Fwd: occasional section! We get tons of email every week and, while we can't answer every note, we read them all. And, some of them are pretty smart. So, we thought, why keep them to ourselves? The internet was made for sharing.
Last week, our One Thing contributor Tik Root wrote about trees and suggested that planting ficus could be a good option in Southern California. That's true on several levels. They're beautiful, they're drought resistant, and they grow tall and provide plenty of shade. Several readers sent messages, though, to point out that they also have extensive root systems that can damage underground pipes and cables.
"I hope this isn't a bias against the Left Coast," one reader wrote. We promise you, it wasn't. We just like to keep newsletter items short and sweet. But, for the record: Beware of ficus roots in residential areas.
Speaking of the Left Coast, we were also asked why we didn't include a link to this United States Forest Service Climate Change Tree Atlas, which documents the current and possible future distribution of 134 tree species (and 147 bird species) in the Eastern United States.
Well, because it doesn't cover a certain part of the country. But, it's sill amazing. So check it out.
Thanks for reading Climate Fwd: and have a great week.

Texto completo: What is going on? Russian spies are assassinating people in other countries, directing internet companies to troll our social media and trying to undermine our political process almost in plain sight.
At the same time, agents acting at the behest of the Chinese Communist Party are stealing our proprietary information and technology. North Korean spies have become New Age bank robbers, while Iranian spies have attempted to assassinate dissidents in Denmark and a Saudi diplomat in the United States. And the United Arab Emirates has hired former government hackers to spy on dissidents and civil rights activists.
The spy business is clearly booming.
But it is not just government spy agencies. We are also witnessing the democratization of spy tools and techniques that used to be the sole purview of a highly select group of intelligence services. Less sophisticated services in other countries are now getting into the act.
As The New York Times reported in April, surveillance technology built for China’s political system is now being used — and in some cases abused — by as many as 18 other countries, including Zimbabwe, Uzbekistan, Pakistan, Kenya, the United Arab Emirates and Germany. That is just one example of the globalization of the espionage economy.
It is not just nations. Numerous nongovernmental groups and private individuals are also purchasing spy tools and techniques for illicit purposes. Cybercriminals are a case in point. True hacking expertise was once primarily the domain of computer gurus and sophisticated intelligence services, but today such know-how is easily obtained on the black market.
Similarly, even less sophisticated drug cartels, terrorists and other criminal networks can deploy high-quality cameras and voice-recording devices for nefarious purposes. Other intelligence tools are used to steal information and technology belonging to our companies and research institutions.
The easy availability of spying hardware and know-how, combined with the weakening of norms and laws in international relations, has made the world less predictable and more dangerous. Yet what has happened in recent decades is nothing compared to what is coming.
Big data, artificial intelligence, quantum computing and fifth-generation cellular networks will change our society in ways that we cannot begin to imagine, for better and for worse. Ever more powerful, easily accessible technology will supercharge competition between states — and empower intelligence services, criminals and terrorists.
There is a way for the United States to navigate these treacherous waters: better counterintelligence. Simply put, counterintelligence is about protecting something valuable — an asset, a system, a process, a way of life — from an adversary.
Effective counterintelligence begins with the American people and its public officials understanding that our country has a bull’s-eye on its back. Our position as the preeminent military and economic power in the world is under challenge as never before, as extremely capable and dedicated rivals seek to gain advantage over us. China, Russia, Iran, North Korea and other countries pose grave threats, and advanced technology is leveling the playing field.
This means that agencies across our government must become familiar with the objectives, capabilities and methodologies of our adversaries. In addition, clear national security policies should be rigorously carried out across the entire federal government to ensure that all agencies, especially those outside the intelligence community, understand the best ways to protect government employees and data. Successful counterintelligence also requires our corporations and universities to better protect their vital assets, such as cutting-edge scientific research, so that they do not fall into the wrong hands.
Individual citizens have a part to play in this fight as well. Our nation’s deep political divisions are a major vulnerability; foreign adversaries are trying to exploit them, as the 2016 election showed. To protect our democracy — and our place in the world — we need to restore a sense of national unity and purpose, treating more of our fellow citizens the way we treat our loved ones.
As we head into the 2020 presidential campaign, where our adversaries may once again try to poison our political debate, we would do well to remember something John F. Kennedy once said: “There are few if any issues where all the truth, all the right, and all the angels are on one side.”

Texto completo: La agencia de Inmigración y Control de Aduanas ( ICE ) mantiene una campaña en Twitter donde destaca el trabajo de sus oficiales para detener a inmigrantes indocumentados y procesar su deportación.
“Las operaciones que realizan nuestros oficiales de ICE proveen una vital seguridad pública que beneficia a las comunidades al mantener a extranjeros fuera de las calles” , destacó en un video Marc Moore , director la oficina de campo de ERO Dallas.
ERO es la división de ICE que procesa las deportaciones con órdenes por un juez.
El operativo al que se refiere la agencia ocurrió en el norte de Texas, donde se detuvieron a 75 extranjeros “criminales y fugitivos de inmigración”, señala el Gobierno.

La agencia ha publicó otro video sobre un operativo en San Francisco, California, que permitió la detención de 42 personas .
No quedan claras las fechas de esas movilizaciones, pero el director interino de la agencia Matt Albence , confirmó a The New York Times que entre el 14 de mayo y el 11 de julio hubo un operativo llamado “Cross Check” (“Verificación Cruzada”) , donde se capturó a de 899 inmigrantes en dos meses.
Ese periodo fue antes de las llamadas “grandes redadas” anunciadas por el presidente Donald Trump en 10 ciudades, donde solamente se capturó a 35 personas, según el propio Albence, quien afirmó que esa movilización se complicó debido a los informes de medios y a las alertas de activistas.

NYT analysis shows Trump could be re-elected

Texto completo: With the Sunbelt, Arkansas included, in the bag, the battleground will again be the industrial Midwest, the Times schematic suggested, with Wisconsin the state pivotal in the Electoral College balloting.
Perhaps our politics would be a lot saner if this newspaper was President Trump's favorite, though surely this newspaper would be more profitable. Mr. Trump would attack it every day, sometimes every other hour; and if the pattern elsewhere holds it would gain subscriptions and could raise advertising rates.
For now the president's preferred newspaper remains The New York Times. (In earlier years his biggest print pal was the National Enquirer, the supermarket tabloid that purchased a Playboy model's story of her alleged romance with Mr. Trump and then killed it, though the "kill" didn't stay dead.)
Most every morning he Tweets "FAKE NEWS!!" upon reading the Times' latest account of his administration and then condemns it anew at his next public event. It's actually a love-hate relationship: For example, Mr. Trump loves the Times when it reports that the economy continues to expand, only to hate it when, deeper into the same story, it notes that the recovery began in the Obama administration.
A couple of Times pieces of recent days, one an opinion column and the other a news-data analysis, make the case even better. The first was a column by Thomas Freidman, who writes often of the interplay of domestic and foreign affairs.
Freidman has credited Mr. Trump for taking a tough if clumsy approach to trade abuses by China, which the president likes to read. But Freidman disdains him in every other respect, as when he wrote that the U.S. "cannot afford another four years of Trump."
The president does not like to read that – even when it comes, as it did, in an essay expressing the not unreasonable fears of so many of his detractors that a second Trump administration is in the making. Love-hate, see?
Just two days later, in the lengthy and detailed Times analysis piece, there was little if anything for Mr. Trump to hate. Encouraging, even heartwarming for the president, it was bone-chilling to Democrats and his other adversaries.
The newspaper's best, most seasoned statisticians vacuumed the nation of polling information, prismed it through voting histories, made allowances for variables to the extent possible, and concluded that while Mr. Trump may trail most every possible Democratic opponent, "His position for re-election ... might not be quite so bleak." Indeed, "His advantage in the Electoral College, relative to the national popular vote, may be even larger than it was in 2016."
Put another way, a repeat of 2000 and 2016: a president installed by a minority of voters and a majority of the Electoral College.
Moreover, in the Times' calculations Mr. Trump "could have a distinct chance to win re-election while losing the popular vote by more than he did in 2016, when he lost it by 2.1 percentage points. The president's relative advantage in the Electoral College could grow even further in a high-turnout election ... It is even possible that Mr. Trump could win while losing the national vote by as much as five percentage points." (Italics added.)
But — how? Easy: a vibrant economy, some of it inherited, some of it fueled by deficit spending, and no matter that the rising tide has most definitely not lifted all boats; and by, yes, Mr. Trump's demonstrated willingness to nurture racial and ethnic prejudices.
With the Sunbelt, Arkansas included, in the bag, the battleground will again be the industrial Midwest, the Times schematic suggested, with Wisconsin the state pivotal in the Electoral College balloting. As of now Mr. Trump's approval rating there, while still below 50 percent, is higher than his national showing, and the paper's diagnosticians believe it could be even higher than the latest polls indicate.
So for Democrats, what? A massive nationwide voter registration campaign, followed on election day by a mobilization effort of similar scale? Not so fast: the largest pools of potential but unregistered voters, and eligible but unmotivated voters, reside mostly in states the president won in 2016 and/or is heavily favored next year, and a sweeping recruitment drive would do little to change the calculus.
Worse for Democrats, potentially: Voter registration programs can cut two ways, can boomerang, no matter how carefully targeted. Consider the sizeable number of citizens who twice voted for Barack Obama, then chose Mr. Trump over Hillary Clinton.
The Times analysis was careful to observe that the outlook could change, though Mr. Trump has yet to label the story fake news. As for Freidman's column, I was pleased to note that he subscribes to Barnes First Law of Politics: People don't vote with their brains, but with their gut. I would contest, vigorously, Freidman's mention of the president's political "genius." It doesn't take genius to do what Mr. Trump is doing. It takes something else.

Atwood and Rushdie Vie for Booker Prize

Texto completo: LONDON -- Margaret Atwood's novel "The Testaments," the highly anticipated sequel to "The Handmaid's Tale," was announced here on Wednesday as one of the books in the running for the Booker Prize, Britain's most prestigious literary award.
"A ferocious nondisclosure agreement" prevented the prize's judges revealing any of the book's plot, they said in a joint statement announcing the list of 13 competitors. But the novel is "terrifying and exhilarating," they added.
Atwood, whose novel "The Blind Assassin" won the Booker Prize in 2000, faces strong competition for the award. Other nominated books include Salman Rushdie's forthcoming "Quichotte," about a traveling salesman who drives across the United States, and "10 Minutes 38 Seconds in This Strange World" by Elif Shafak, about a prostitute in Istanbul.
Little is known about "The Testaments," except that it is set 15 years after "The Handmaid's Tale" and is narrated by three female characters. Last year, Atwood said in a statement that she wanted "The Testaments" to explore parallels between her imaginary dystopia -- in which women are treated as reproductive serfs -- and the current political climate.
The list of nominees is dominated by novels inspired by political crises, such as John Lanchester's "The Wall," set on an island surrounded by a concrete barrier to keep rising seas and immigrants out. The Mexican author Valeria Luiselli's "Lost Children Archive," about child migrants, has also made the cut. "The brilliance of the writing stirs rage and pity," wrote Gaiutra Bahadur, in a review of the book for The New York Times.
The nominated books "imagine our world, familiar from news cycle disaster and grievance, with wild humor, deep insight and a keen humanity," said Peter Florence, the chair of the judges, in a statement. "These writers offer joy and hope."
Other books on the list are less political, such as Oyinkan Braithwaite's comic thriller, "My Sister, The Serial Killer," about two siblings in Lagos, one of whom has a habit of murdering her boyfriends. It is "a bombshell of a book -- sharp, explosive, hilarious," wrote Fiammetta Rocco in The New York Times. "Only after you turn the last page do you realize that, as with many brilliant comic writers before her, laughter for Braithwaite is as good for covering up pain as bleach is for masking the smell of blood."
From its inception in 1969 until 2014, the Booker prize was limited to books by writers from Britain, Ireland and Commonwealth countries (plus South Africa and, later, Zimbabwe), but that changed in 2014, when it was opened to works by anyone writing in English. That led to fears it would be dominated by Americans.
In 2016, Paul Beatty's "The Sellout" took the prize, and, the following year, "Lincoln in the Bardo," by George Saunders, won. Both writers are American. After that, criticism of the rule change grew, and non-American authors complained they were being crowded out. In 2018, a literary society that counts Margaret Atwood, Ian McEwan and Zadie Smith among its members demanded the rule be reversed.
The closest this year's longlist comes to a book by an American writer is "Ducks, Newburyport," by Lucy Ellmann, who was born in Illinois, but moved to Britain when she was 13 and now lives in Edinburgh.
The nominees will be narrowed down to a shortlist of six that will be revealed on Sept. 3, and the winner, who receives around $ 62,000, will be announced at a ceremony in London on Oct. 14.
The nominees in full are:
Margaret Atwood, "The Testaments"
Kevin Barry, "Night Boat to Tangier"
Oyinkan Braithwaite, "My Sister, The Serial Killer"
Lucy Ellmann, "Ducks, Newburyport"
Bernardine Evaristo, "Girl, Woman, Other"
John Lanchester, "The Wall"
Deborah Levy, "The Man Who Saw Everything"
Valeria Luiselli, "Lost Children Archive"
Chigozie Obioma, "An Orchestra of Minorities"
Max Porter, "Lanny"
Salman Rushdie, "Quichotte"
Elif Shafak, "10 Minutes 38 Seconds in This Strange World"
Jeanette Winterson, "Frankissstein."

Texto completo: Iran said Monday that it had arrested 17 Iranian citizens on charges of spying for the United States and had already sentenced some to death, Iranian and Western news media reported.
At a news conference in Tehran; an official who identified himself as a director of counterespionage in the Intelligence Ministry described the arrests of people he said had been trained by the CIA, but he did not name them and gave few details of their alleged spying. The official declined to give his name, The Associated Press reported, and did not say how many of those arrested had been sentenced.
Iran has previously claimed, without elaboration or supporting evidence, to have broken up U.S. spy rings. It made similar announcements in April and again in June this year.
President Donald Trump, in a Twitter post, called the Iranian claim about the spies 'totally false."
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo also dismissed the report. In an interview with Fox News, he said that "the Iranian regime has a long history of lying" and blamed it on the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
"It is part of the nature of the ayatollah to lie to the world," Pompeo said. "I would take with a significant grain of salt any Iranian assertions about actions that they have taken."

In our opinion: Congress plays fast and loose with the debt ceiling

Texto completo: Americans may be tired of political gridlock in Washington, but the bipartisan compromise announced Monday to avoid a government shutdown and extend the debt ceiling is evidence that not all cooperation is good.
When both major parties agree to increase spending by $320 billion more than current caps allow without much in the way of cuts, as well as to push any further need to address the debt ceiling until well after the 2020 election, it doesn’t seem like a time to celebrate. Washington clearly lacks any downward pressure on the nation’s growing debt, something Republicans once provided with enough conviction to force government shutdowns.
This deal effectively ends the 2011 sequester that was the last semiserious attempt to rein in dangerous overspending.
We understand that both sides have a lot to gain from the compromise. Democrats finally would be rid of any fiscal constraints imposed by the sequester. They would avoid any deep cuts to programs. Republicans would get an increase in defense spending, which they could tout during next year’s campaigns.
And, as long as the economy holds out, neither side would have to face any unpleasant budget realities while seeking reelection.
We also understand the truth about debt ceilings. By the time they become an issue, Washington already has incurred obligations that Congress must fund. To miss payments to Social Security, for veterans benefits or to cover the interest on the ballooning national debt is not an option. The consequences of doing so would reverberate through the investment community and result in a host of economic problems.
But deals such as these do little to ward off the eventual day of reckoning — a dark future time when the nation’s debt rises so high the economy can’t reasonably generate enough revenue to cover it without inflation, tax increases or severe cuts.
As the president of the Club for Growth told the New York Times, “It’s pretty clear that both houses of Congress and both parties have become big spenders, and Congress is no longer concerned about the extent of the budget deficits or the debt they add.”
Governing is easy when politicians feel free to extend benefits and increase programs without having to confront the pain of raising revenue to cover the costs. But when the economy hits an inevitable down cycle, few politicians will have earned the moral authority to pull the nation back to a more responsible course, and Washington may lack the ability to increase spending to ease the pain.
This compromise could add trillions to the national debt. Yearly budget deficits already were projected to exceed $1 trillion, perhaps as early as the current fiscal year.
The United States has the world’s reserve currency. It enjoys a leadership role among nations that was earned through military victories and a commitment to individual liberty that has encouraged unprecedented prosperity.
That is a leadership position of vital importance to billions of people worldwide who look to the United States as a beacon of hope. To play fast and loose with this vital role is irresponsible. It threatens much more than just the interests within the nation’s borders.
We urge both parties to return to the negotiating table and get serious.

The New Normal Onscreen: Matter-of-Fact Abortions

Texto completo: At a recent conference outside Los Angeles, a national women's rights lawyer stood before a select group of Hollywood heavyweights to issue a demand and a plea. With a woman's right to choose in jeopardy, the lawyer, Fatima Goss Graves, said, more abortions should be portrayed in narratives onscreen. "The stories on abortion do not match our reality," she said.
The attendees -- agents, celebrities and producers at an invitation-only diversity summit held by the talent agency CAA -- took Goss Graves's message in stride. As it turns out, the industry has already begun shedding one of its longest-held taboos. In recent years, abortions are taking place or being talked about on television at record levels, often on shows created or written by women.
"You're definitely seeing more of the matter-of-fact 'I am pregnant, I don't want to be, I'm going to have an abortion,"' said Gretchen Sisson, a sociologist at University of California, San Francisco whose research includes tracking how abortion is characterized onscreen. "And it's gone way up in 2019."
So far, halfway through the year, nearly two dozen characters in streaming shows, movies and television have had or talked about having abortions, many unapologetically, a development that would have been a unthinkable a decade ago -- and one that has angered some abortion foes.
In the pilot for "Shrill," Abby, the single millennial played by Aidy Bryant, professes to feel "powerful" after having terminated her unplanned pregnancy. On one of the final episodes of "Veep" Anna Chlumsky's pregnant political aide lays into abortion opponents protesting outside a clinic, hollering, "I even prayed a little, and here I am." On "She's Gotta Have It," the ambitious Clorinda, played by Margot Bingham, defends her decision to the baby's father, saying anything she does with her body is her choice. Nine of the 11 people credited with writing those episodes were women.
These portrayals, like others on the series "Glow" and "Dear White People," are a marked departure from how abortion was depicted, or not, in story lines from the '80s through the early aughts. Characters facing unplanned pregnancies then usually agonized about what to do or, if the show was set in the past, weighed back-alley procedures. Babies were often carried to term or lost to miscarriage. Terminations led to psychological or physical problems or death. It's not that today's characters come to their decisions without deliberation, but that they are decisive and forthright, like Becky, the music executive played by Gabourey Sidibe in "Empire." "My situation is not getting any easier," she says at one point, "but I have decided to terminate."
Sisson focuses on television and streaming series that air and run in America, along with movies, though some small indie films, she said, might not hit her radar. For 1987, a time of far fewer shows, she counted three depictions of abortion in TV and film: One on "St. Elsewhere," another on "Dynasty" that led to infertility, and the botched procedure in "Dirty Dancing" that left the dance instructor played by Cynthia Rhodes gravely hurt.
But for 2018, Sisson found 18 instances of characters having, disclosing, considering or mentioning abortions. A little more than halfway through 2019, that figure was already at 21, and Sisson expects this year to match or outpace her tally from 2017, when the figure hit a high of 34.
That more characters are having abortions with fewer regrets jibes with research in the United States. Women who have had abortions overwhelmingly say they made the right decision, according to a study released in 2015. In another example of art beginning to imitate life, more onscreen characters of color are opting for the procedure. Sisson pointed to the effect of Olivia Pope, played by Kerry Washington, having an abortion a few years ago on "Scandal." (Shonda Rhimes told The Hollywood Reporter in 2017 that she was pressured by ABC to cut the scene but held firm; ABC would not comment.) "Shonda Rhimes opened it up so it can be on network prime," Sisson said.
Still, the recent surge in abortion story lines tends to be clustered on cable and streaming shows, and with the explosion of new series, it is unclear how much the percentage of depictions has changed as a whole.
"In terms of narrative broadcast prime time, over four years, it's been pretty thin," said Kate Langrall Folb, director of Hollywood, Health & Society, an initiative at the University of Southern California promoting accurate representation of health issues.
In addition, Sisson said that the use of Plan B contraception is not widely portrayed, and that adverse outcomes are still depicted on shows that are set before Roe v. Wade. There are also scant shows that focus on abortion providers, though a movie is in the works starring Michelle Williams as an underground abortionist before Roe vs. Wade.
Lara Shapiro, a writer whose credits include "The Americans" (she is also an acquaintance of this reporter), said producers repeatedly passed on a television pilot she wrote about a fictional '60s-era Roman Catholic doctor who reluctantly performs an abortion; the script itself opened the door to other jobs. "People like to read something that's provocative, but when it comes to putting themselves on the line, they have advertisers and politics and subscribers to answer to," Shapiro said.
That might change. Sisson found that the number of portrayals on television ticked up as more states and politicians sought to limit women's access to abortion and birth control.
For some creators and writers, the connection with current politics is explicit. Lindy West, a creator of "Shrill" (she is also a contributing Op-Ed writer to The New York Times) has said that normalizing abortion was of foremost importance; she also started the hashtag #ShoutYourAbortion.
Yet Rachel Axler, a co-executive producer on "Veep," said she and the other writers had been prompted to write in an abortion not because of the news cycle, but because it made most sense for Chlumsky's character. "For this character, this was absolutely the right thing to do," Axler said.
A 2018 episode of "Claws" similarly turned the tables on abortion opponents while also delving into competing perspectives. After Virginia, the nail technician played by Karrueche Tran, gets pregnant, characters weighed in via a Brady Bunch-style split screen. In the end, Virginia is accompanied to a clinic by her loving boyfriend. On the way out, the boyfriend tells gathered protesters, "We're getting married, everybody!" eliciting cheers. One abortion protester cries, "God is good; he heard our prayers!" But Virginia snaps back, "We still D-and-C'ed that."
Janine Sherman Barrois, the "Claws" showrunner, said the writers wanted to show Virginia making the decision and getting on with her day. "Maybe it's part of the zeitgeist, but I think it came naturally out of a room of writers who've grown up seeing how we've progressed," Barrois said.
West, Axler and Barrois all said they received no pushback from the networks and studios producing their shows. Hollywood's apparent normalization of abortion has aggravated but not surprised abortion foes, among them Cary Solomon and Chuck Konzelman, who wrote and directed the 2019 feature "Unplanned," based on the memoir of a clinical director at Planned Parenthood who became an anti-abortion activist.
"Hollywood's run by the left," said Solomon, "You won't see pro-life stories on TV."
Solomon and Konzelman said they did not bother approaching Hollywood financiers or studios to make "Unplanned," which they produced in secrecy. They said that TV networks refused to run ads for the film, which was initially listed as "propaganda" on Google.
"Unplanned" has since earned more than $ 18 million in the United States, and is enjoying brisk ticket sales in Canada despite meeting resistance there. "A vacuum has been created, and those people that believe other than what the left believes are outraged, and they feel like they're being silenced," Solomon said.
Another filmmaker, Nick Loeb, who directed the forthcoming "Roe v. Wade," echoed the notion that Hollywood was neglecting swaths of anti-abortion Americans at its economic peril. Loeb, who is also known for his legal fight with his former partner Sofia Vergara over frozen embryos, said distributors have already made offers, sight unseen, for his film, which stars Jon Voight, Stacey Dash, and Loeb as the anti-abortion activist Bernard Nathanson.
"Nobody's speaking for us, Hollywood doesn't speak for us," Loeb said of those who oppose abortion, "But when people make movies for us, they're loved and they're adored."

Texto completo: While scrolling through Facebook the other day, I came across the photo of a friend's little sister.
I met her once in person 30-plus years ago when she was still in middle school. For the past 10 years, I've followed her adventures virtually, a cute kid grown to be an accomplished woman.
In this particular pic, she was looking up at the camera, impish grin on her face, blue eyes sparkling, not unlike dozens of other photos she posts.
Except this one gave me pause. I know a lot of time has passed, but dang, she's at least a decade younger than I am. When did she start looking so old?
D'oh! I was fooled by FaceApp.
It wasn't long before FaceApp portraits starting flooding my social media feeds: a cousin and her husband looking a lot like our grandparents; a former colleague standing on the beach, his face shriveled like a raisin; four photos of Hermione Granger from "Harry Potter," one with a slight smile (the original), one with a full smile, one as Herman Granger and one as Grandma Granger.
Turns out you can do a lot more than just age yourself with FaceApp technology. Like surrender yourself to the Russians.
Not long after all these fun, funny photos started showing up, so did the tales of caution.
"While according to FaceApp's terms of service people still own their own 'user content' (read: face), the company owns a never-ending and irrevocable royalty-free license to do anything they want with it," John Koetsier wrote on forbes.com.
The Russian-made app, which uses artificial intelligence to manipulate photos, is hanging out at the top of the charts at the Apple and Google stores, but technology writers from The Washington Post, USA Today, the New York Times and Popular Science weighed in with warnings.
"Looking under the hood of FaceApp with the tools from my iPhone test, I found it sharing information about my phone with Facebook and Google AdMob, which probably help it place ads and check the performance of its ads," wrote Washington Post technology columnist Geoffrey A. Fowler. "The most unsettling part was how much data FaceApp was sending to its own servers, after which ... who knows what happens. It's not just your own face that FaceApp might gobble up — if you age friends or family members, their face gets uploaded, too."
So the question is, if you take a peek into the future and check out what you could look like in 30 or 40 years, will all your information be leaked to Russian spies?
Probably not, but you never know.
At least this is one cyber threat that doesn't concern me. I decided not to download the app way before I learned of its nefarious possibilities.
I don't need an app or artificial intelligence to show my face looking older than it should be.
I've got a mirror for that.

Texto completo: Portions of this were published previously in the March 3, 2019, article " Want More After 'Apollo 11'? Here Are 5 Space Documentaries to Stream. "
Fifty years ago, on July 20, 1969, Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin became the first humans to set foot on the moon. Their mission, Apollo 11, was the culmination of over a decade of space exploration by the United States and the Soviet Union: a "space race" that captivated the world, introducing laypeople to concepts in advanced rocketry and astrophysics while producing images and moments that still awe.
In the decades since, filmmakers have revisited the heyday of space travel in documentaries and dramatizations, trying to put these remarkable achievements into their proper human context. In honor of the Apollo 11 anniversary -- an event depicted recently in the feature film "First Man" and the documentary "Apollo 11" -- here are 11 of the best movies about real-life space exploration, all available to stream.
'The Right Stuff' (1983)
How to watch: Buy or rent it on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube.
Tom Wolfe's lively 1979 nonfiction best seller, "The Right Stuff," about NASA's "Mercury Seven" -- America's first astronauts -- is at once mythopoetic and lightly satirical. The writer-director Philip Kaufman adapted the book into an equally energetic and sly movie, with an outstanding cast that includes Ed Harris as John Glenn, Fred Ward as Gus Grissom, Scott Glenn as Alan Shepard and Sam Shepard as the pioneering test pilot Chuck Yeager. "The Right Stuff" captures the boys' club quality of early outer-space exploration and shows how these cocky adventurers fought to retain their dignity and humanity amid the red tape and media frenzy.

'For All Mankind' (1989)
How to watch: Stream it on Criterion; buy or rent it on Amazon, iTunes and Vudu.
The gold standard for NASA documentaries, this Oscar-nominated 1989 film is rich with the alien wonder of a trip to the moon. The director Al Reinert was granted access to footage shot by astronauts during the various Apollo missions, and he and his editors (led by Susan Korda) cut them into an approximation of a single voyage, with a focus on moments that are eerie and awesome. With its score by the ambient music pioneers Brian Eno, Roger Eno and Daniel Lanois -- and narration provided by the original Mission Control audio recordings, combined with reflective astronaut interviews -- "For All Mankind" evokes the grand science-fiction adventure of Apollo.

'Apollo 13' (1995)
How to watch: Stream it on Starz; buy or rent it on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube.
Tom Hanks gives one of his best performances in "Apollo 13," playing Commander Jim Lovell, who kept his cool and used his engineering know-how to help prevent a trouble-plagued lunar mission from turning into a tragedy. Gary Sinise and Ed Harris play two of Lovell's NASA colleagues, busily crunching numbers and brainstorming out-of-the-box solutions at Mission Control. Because this is a well-known true story about astronauts who survived a major equipment malfunction, the movie is not exactly a nail-biter. But it is an enormously entertaining and inspiring tribute to scientific acumen, and to grounded professionalism.

'Hidden Figures' (2016)
How to watch: Buy or rent it on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube.
Throughout the 1960s and '70s, the public faces of NASA tended to be white men. Then Margot Lee Shetterly's 2016 book, "Hidden Figures" -- and its movie adaptation -- diversified the story, offering the true accounts of three black women in the segregation-era South who provided technical and engineering support to the early NASA missions. Taraji P. Henson, Octavia Spencer and Janelle Monáe play the women, in a film that conveys the injustices and indignities of racism but also honors the phenomenal collaborative project that was the American space program.

'The Last Man on the Moon' (2016)
How to watch: Stream it on Netflix; buy or rent it on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube.
The story of the final Apollo moon mission -- and how it changed the life of its commander, Eugene Cernan -- is as powerful in its way as the better-known saga of Apollo 11. "The Last Man on the Moon" covers the public's growing frustration with the expense of the space program circa 1972. And it also gets into the technical complexities of that last trip and how an astronaut's job conflicts with family life. The film doesn't lack for great lunar footage, either. Apollo 17 had access to color video cameras far beyond what Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin worked with, and the images Cernan and his crew captured on the moon are stunning in their clarity.

'The Farthest' (2017)
How to watch: Stream it on Netflix; buy or rent it on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes and YouTube.
When NASA launched its two deep-space Voyager probes in 1977, the missions sparked conversations among scientists, artists, philosophers and ordinary people, all wondering what information about Earth should be sent out into the universe, and what might come back. The director Emer Reynolds's documentary "The Farthest" describes the work that went into crafting these enduring marvels of mid-70s technology, which are still zooming away. The film is a reminder of the idealism and optimism of the people who worked in the space program over 40 years ago, and it serves as a call to recapture their spirit and ingenuity.

'The Mars Generation' (2017)
How to watch: Stream it on Netflix.
Manned space exploration has slowed lately, but the nonprofit organization the Mars Generation has been working since 2015 to keep the next wave of astronauts and rocket scientists ready anyway. The documentary "The Mars Generation" introduces some brilliant, space-obsessed teenagers who take part in special camps designed to simulate what it might be like to travel to and even live on Mars. These kids are sometimes socially awkward, but they're always sweetly earnest. It's heartwarming to watch them work together toward a goal they may never achieve -- unless the public broadly supports another big, expensive project like the Apollo missions.
'Salyut 7' (2017)
How to watch: Stream it on Amazon; buy or rent it on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube.
This Russian production (with English subtitles) is often tagged as the Soviet Apollo 13, which is an apt description -- not just because it has the dazzling digital effects of a Hollywood blockbuster but also because it is about how courage and brains helped some dedicated cosmonauts and technicians save a dying space station in 1985. Don't expect anything like the recent HBO mini-series "Chernobyl," criticizing the entropic last days of Soviet-style socialism. "Salyut 7" is more rousing, focusing on daring spacewalks and clever problem-solving. It is also one of the few big-budget movies about the Russian space program, joining the 2013 biopic "Gagarin: First in Space" and the 2017 docudrama "Age of Pioneers."
'Mercury 13' (2018)
How to watch: Stream it on Netflix.
In 1960, the NASA adviser Dr. William Randolph Lovelace II began an experiment to see if ace female pilots could endure the series of physical and mental challenges he had originally devised for the Mercury Seven. He discovered that some women scored highly on the tests, prompting the privately funded "Woman in Space" program to begin petitioning the media and the United States government, arguing that America needed to overcome its deep-rooted sexism in order to compete with the Soviets. The documentary "Mercury 13" features interviews with some of these accomplished pilots and scientists, many of whom remain certain that the space program -- and perhaps the culture -- might have been different if NASA had been more open-minded.
'First Man' (2018)
How to watch: Buy it on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes and YouTube.
A gripping "you are there" dramatization of the first manned lunar landing doubles as a moving character sketch, depicting the deeper motivations of the outwardly stoic Neil Armstrong. Ryan Gosling plays Armstrong, who signed up for NASA's moon program while still racked with grief over the death of his toddler daughter. In "First Man," the Oscar-winning "La La Land" director, Damien Chazelle, and the Oscar-winning "Spotlight" co-writer Josh Singer take an intimate and impressionistic approach to the Apollo 11 story, letting audiences share Armstrong's experiences: patiently enduring NASA's competitive culture in order to get the chance to sit in a cramped, rickety space capsule.

'Apollo 11' (2019)
How to watch: Buy or rent it on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube.
For the documentary "Apollo 11," the director Todd Douglas Miller and a team of archivists and editors found rare footage of the original manned lunar landing mission and compiled it into "Apollo 11": an immersive and uplifting record of the voyage, from launch to splashdown, with no narration or interviews. The film lets audiences feel like part of the action, whether they're watching the rocket launch among the crowds, hanging out in Mission Control or sitting next to Neil Armstrong, discovering the wonders of the moon.

Texto completo: Our guide to film series and special screenings happening this weekend and in the week ahead. All our movie reviews are at nytimes.com/reviews/movies.
'AFTER HOURS' at Governors Island Parade Ground (July 19, 6 p.m.). When it comes to Martin Scorsese's 1985 feature, a SoHo loft would really be the ideal nontheatrical viewing space, but here's a chance to watch Griffin Dunne endure his madcap odyssey of emasculation within a river and several blocks' distance of the neighborhood where it's set. The screening is part of Film at Lincoln Center's free outdoor summer series. The movie begins after sundown, but there is entertainment, food and beer beforehand. No word on whether Catherine O'Hara will be operating a Mister Softee truck.

BARBARA HAMMER, SUPERDYKE at the Museum of the Moving Image (July 19-28). For more than 40 years before her death in March, Hammer was a pioneering figure in queer and experimental cinema, with films that showcased lesbian solidarity (such as "Superdyke" and "Audience," showing in the shorts program Declarations of Identity on Saturday) and dealt forthrightly with the human body (the abstract, 18-minute "Sanctus," in the Hall of Mirrors program on Sunday, draws on X-ray images of motion). "Nitrate Kisses" (on July 27 and 28), a full-length documentary and found-footage collage, features men and women reflecting in voice-over on gay history and identity in the 20th century. This retrospective showed at U.C.L.A. last year, when Hammer was able to attend in person.

INTIMATE EPICS at BAM Rose Cinemas (July 19-23). Just because it's long doesn't mean it's a spectacle. BAM presents six films that run more than three hours and are each in their own way character-driven. Paul Thomas Anderson's "Magnolia" (on Friday) weaves its threads together in a magnificent crescendo. Spike Lee's "Malcolm X" (on Saturday) imbues the biopic genre with uncommon depth and propulsive force. Chantal Akerman's landmark "Jeanne Dielman, 23, Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles" (on Tuesday) uses its running time to sensitize viewers to the title character's routine.
718-636-4100, bam.org
JAPAN CUTS: FESTIVAL OF NEW JAPANESE FILM at Japan Society (July 19-28). The honoree at this year's showcase of recent Japanese cinema is Shinya Tsukamoto, an actor (in Martin Scorsese's "Silence," he was crucified in the waves and left to drown as the tide rolled in) and the director of movies like "Tetsuo: The Iron Man" and "A Snake of June." His new samurai film, "Killing," will screen on Wednesday as the festival's centerpiece. The opening-night feature is Shinobu Yaguchi's "Dance With Me" (on Friday), a musical-comedy about an office worker who, thanks to hypnosis, is compelled to burst into a song-and-dance routine whenever she hears a tune. Both screenings are sold out, but you can add your name to the wait list at the box office an hour before each showing.

BURT LANCASTER at Film Forum (July 19-Aug. 15). It's possible that Lancaster's versatility came into fullest focus as he aged. That's at least one takeaway from Film Forum's four-week retrospective, which opens with a weeklong run (Friday through Thursday) of the 1946 version of "The Killers." Robert Siodmak's noir gave Lancaster his first film role as a doomed ex-palooka. Later on, Lancaster showed he could be pure acid as a treacherous newspaper columnist in "Sweet Smell of Success" (on July 26 and 27 and Aug. 1); contemplative as an aging Sicilian prince facing his own obsolescence in "The Leopard" (on July 28 and 31); enigmatic as a Connecticut man awash in self-delusion in "The Swimmer" (showing multiple times in early August); and poignant as a small-time numbers runner who becomes involved with a casino worker (Susan Sarandon) in Louis Malle's "Atlantic City" (on July 31 and Aug. 2).
212-727-8110, filmforum.org
THIS IS CINEMA NOW: 21ST CENTURY DEBUTS at Film at Lincoln Center (July 19-31). Directors who made their first features in 2000 or thereafter -- but have already left indelible marks on world cinema -- are the subject of this series, which pairs debuts as double features. The formal daring and cryptic narratives of the Thai auteur Apichatpong Weerasethakul's "Mysterious Object at Noon" and the Chinese director Bi Gan's "Kaili Blues" will be showcased back-to-back on Friday and Tuesday, for instance, while two recent breakout successes in the horror genre, "Get Out" and "The Babadook," will complement each other on July 27.
212-875-5601, filmlinc.org
'VARIETÉ' at Prospect Park Bandshell (July 20, 8 p.m.). The Alloy Orchestra, an ensemble based in Cambridge, Mass., that composes and performs wonderfully percussive modern scores for silent films, will accompany this outdoor screening of a classic from E. A. Dupont. Starring Emil Jannings as an aging trapeze artist, the movie was hailed by the critic Mordaunt Hall, writing in The New York Times in 1926, as "the strongest and most inspiring drama that has ever been told by the evanescent shadows." Lava, an acrobatic dance troupe, will perform before the movie.

Still Fighting, 2 Decades After Police Killed Her Son

Texto completo: [What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox .]
In the months after her son was killed in the Bronx by four police officers, she was consumed by grief each time she walked the unfamiliar streets of New York City. She wept often.
While riding the subway, she would think, "Did he take this train when he was alive?"
But now, 20 years after that life-altering event, the woman, Kadiatou Diallo, no longer dreads visits to the city. She comes to New York at least once a year to advance her charity and advocacy work or to spend time with and give guidance to other mothers who have also lost children in law enforcement-related incidents -- a support system she didn't have two decades ago.
"She's my hero," said Valerie Bell, the mother of Sean Bell, who was killed by police officers in Queens in 2006, hours before his wedding. "What she went through, and to stand firm for her son, she's still doing it now."
On Tuesday, Ms. Diallo paused for a few seconds during a telephone interview after she was told the breaking news that the Department of Justice would not prosecute a New York City police officer accused of killing Eric Garner five years ago in Staten Island.
Ms. Diallo recalled the infamous video showing Mr. Garner being put in a chokehold by Officer Daniel Pantaleo during his arrest and uttering the phrase, "I can't breathe," 11 times before his death.
"The world has watched those images," Ms. Diallo, 59, said from her home country, Guinea, in western Africa, where she was doing charity work. "I remember when that happened, I saw the video. I was down on the floor. It was so shocking and difficult to watch."
It was a painful reminder of what she had experienced.
On Feb. 4, 1999, her son, Amadou Diallo, was killed in the vestibule of a Bronx apartment building by four New York Police Department officers who had been searching for a suspect in a rape case. The officers -- who fired a total of 41 shots -- said they believed Mr. Diallo, 23, had reached to grab a gun when they approached him. Instead, Mr. Diallo had grabbed for his wallet.
The president of the N.A.A.C.P. at the time, Kweisi Mfume, called the shooting, "excessive force at its worst." Mr. Diallo's death led to numerous protests in the city, resulting in a politically fraught time for former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani.
Nearly 14 years before the start of the Black Lives Matter movement, Mr. Diallo's death became the rallying cry for those who believed the Police Department operated with racial bias.
Ms. Diallo arrived into this tense environment from Guinea five days after her son was killed. She cried his name while being helped to the crime scene by the authorities. The young mother was immediately immortalized in New York newspapers and on television and computer screens. She toured the country with the Rev. Al Sharpton, decrying police brutality.
But Ms. Diallo soon appeared hesitant to become a symbol for a narrative she did not totally understand.
"I didn't even know about race issues," Ms. Diallo said. "Everything was happening so quickly. I didn't have that someone who went through that experience. But I was able to stand up and just speak for my child. It was an awakening for me."
She had a reported rift with Mr. Sharpton, partly regarding who would represent her in a lawsuit against the city and the officers. The pressure on her to fight for a larger cause was immense. Ms. Diallo just wanted to move on, heal and seek reconciliation with the mayor and the Police Department.
"I came back to my senses, because the anger and the agony were gone," she told The New York Times Magazine in early 2000. "I don't want to do that anymore -- the speeches and things."
Instead, she started the Amadou Diallo Foundation.
The four officers involved in the shooting were indicted almost two months after the shooting. But in February 2000, a jury acquitted them of all charges.
Ms. Diallo and her ex-husband received a $ 3 million settlement in 2004 to their lawsuit against the city and the officers. Ms. Diallo was given half.
After the settlement, she completed a memoir, "My Heart Will Cross This Ocean," built a school in her son's name in Guinea and ran the foundation.
In the 20 years since her son's killing, Ms. Diallo has become the type of leader many had wanted her to be in the months after the shooting, and she's done it with little or no publicity. She's also mended her relationship with Mr. Sharpton.
When he holds events about policing, "he always reaches out to me," she said. "We also have a relationship, personally, because I attended his daughter's wedding. On Mother's Day, he always calls me."
She has also befriended people like Gwen Carr, Mr. Garner's mother. Ms. Diallo said on Tuesday that she planned to call her to offer support.
"I know what Gwen is going to tell me: 'Kadi, I'm ready to fight this. I cannot give up,"' Ms. Diallo said.
She added: "Our sons haven't received justice that they deserve to have. All we want is good policies, good laws to be passed and if someone did wrong -- they have to be accountable for what they did."
Ms. Diallo is also involved with the Justice Committee, a New York grass-roots advocacy group. One of its efforts is a campaign urging Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo to sign an executive order to appoint a special prosecutor to handle cases like Mr. Garner's.
"It's a setback, but it gives us more strength to carry on to change," she said of the ruling regarding Mr. Garner's case. "The history of the civil rights didn't happen overnight. This is our new civil rights."
Ms. Diallo attended Mr. Garner's funeral in 2014, but personally met Ms. Carr later that year at Riverside Church in Harlem, when both women were on a panel. Ms. Carr, in an interview earlier this year, said she felt "a real connection" to Ms. Diallo immediately, and that they have talked every week since.
Ms. Carr said she appreciated Ms. Diallo's presence after her son's death. "I was in a dark place," she said.
Ms. Carr said she vividly remembered following the news of Mr. Diallo's death and its aftermath, watching and reading about how Ms. Diallo navigated the chaotic time.
"I remember hearing one of my friends say, 'That is such a tragedy. I will never carry a wallet again,"' said Ms. Carr. "That wrenched my heart. I had such sympathy for her."
Ms. Diallo runs her foundation on her own, though a consultant helps to organize an annual fund-raiser.
The night before her son's death, Ms. Diallo said she spoke to him by phone. "Mom, I'm going to college!" she recalled him announcing. (She acquired a trademark on that phrase, and has used it for the foundation.)
Ms. Diallo was in New York earlier this year to preside over the first three scholarships awarded by her foundation to students at Guttman Community College in Midtown Manhattan who plan to pursue computer-related careers, just as Amadou had hoped to do.
Ms. Diallo said she has never felt "revengeful" toward the police.
"Let's move forward in one direction and fight for this good fight so we can save the children. That was my mission," said Ms. Diallo, who has a daughter and two other grown sons, and is a grandmother of three.
"That's what I still do. The other people who were cynical then, how do they see me now? This is 20 years later. I didn't run from it. I stay the course and I do what I can without bashing the police, without being revengeful."

LEADING OFF
Happy Thursday and welcome to Rhode Map, your daily guide to everything happening in the Ocean State. I'm Dan McGowan and I'm all-in on Tommy Fleetwood at Royal Portrush this weekend. Follow me on Twitter @DanMcGowan or send tips to Dan.McGowan@globe.com.
Rhode Island residents contributed at least $125,000 to Democratic presidential hopefuls during the second quarter of 2019, but two candidates stand out: South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg and US Senator Elizabeth Warren .
Buttigieg led the way by raising $38,000 in Rhode Island between April 1 and June 30, while Warren brought in $34,000. Nationally, Buttigieg topped the leaderboard with $24 million, and Warren was third with just under $20 million.
Former Vice President Joe Biden finished second nationally with $22 million, but a breakdown of his Rhode Island-specific donations weren't yet available on the Federal Election Commission's website early Thursday morning. It's conceivable that he would be in the mix locally with Buttigieg and Warren.
Buttigieg, Warren, and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders appear to have the early activist momentum in Rhode Island. Providence City Council President Sabina Matos is among Buttigieg's top backers, as the two were in the same class (2014) of the Aspen Institute-Rodel Fellowship program. Meanwhile, former state R epresentatives Aaron Regunberg and David Segal are urging progressives to consider both Warren and Sanders.
Other Democrats that received donations from Rhode Island residents in the second quarter were former HUD Secretary Julián Castro ($11,500), former Congressman Beto O'Rourke ($6,500), and US Senator Kamala Harris ($5,000).
One last tidbit: President Donald Trump brought in just $7,800 from Rhode Islanders. Only Vermont ($3,100) gave him less.

The war over America's past is really about its future [Corrected 07/20/2019]

Texto completo: The summer season has ripped off the thin scab that covered an American wound, revealing a festering disagreement about the nature and origins of the United States.
The San Francisco Board of Education recently voted to paint over, and thus destroy, a 1,600-square-foot mural of George Washington's life in San Francisco's George Washington High School.
Victor Arnautoff, a communist Russian-American artist and Stanford University art professor, had painted "Life of Washington" in 1936, commissioned by the New Deal's Works Progress Administration. A community task force appointed by the school district had recommended that the board address student and parent objections to the 83-year-old mural, which some viewed as racist for its depiction of black slaves and Native Americans.
Nike pitchman and former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick recently objected to the company's release of a special Fourth of July sneaker emblazoned with a 13-star Betsy Ross flag. The terrified Nike immediately pulled the shoe off the market.
The New York Times opinion team issued a Fourth of July-related video about "the myth of America as the greatest nation on earth." The Times' journalists conceded that the United States is "just OK."
During a recent speech to students at a Minnesota high school, Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., offered a scathing appraisal of her adopted country, which she depicted as a disappointment whose racism and inequality did not meet her expectations as an idealistic refugee. Omar's family had fled worn-torn Somalia and spent four years in a Kenyan refugee camp before reaching Minnesota, where Omar received a subsidized education and ended up a congresswoman.
The U.S. women's soccer team won the World Cup earlier this month. Team stalwart Megan Rapinoe refused to put her hand over her heart during the playing of the national anthem, boasted that she would never visit the "f---ing White House" and, with others, nonchalantly let the American flag fall to the ground during the victory celebration.
The city council in St. Louis Park, a suburb of Minneapolis, voted to stop reciting the Pledge of Allegiance before its meetings on the rationale that it wished not to offend a "diverse community."
The list of these public pushbacks at traditional American patriotic customs and rituals could be multiplied. They follow the recent frequent toppling of statues of 19th-century American figures, many of them from the South, and the renaming of streets and buildings to blot out mention of famous men and women from the past now deemed illiberal enemies of the people.
Such theater is the street version of what candidates in the Democratic presidential primary have been saying for months. They want to disband border enforcement, issue blanket amnesties, demand reparations for descendants of slaves, issue formal apologies to groups perceived to be the subjects of discrimination and rail against American unfairness, inequality and a racist and sexist past.
In their radical progressive view -- shared by billionaires from Silicon Valley, recent immigrants and the new Democratic Party -- America was flawed, perhaps fatally, at its origins. Things have not gotten much better in the country's subsequent 243 years, nor will they get any better -- at least not until America as we know it is dismantled and replaced by a new nation predicated on race, class and gender identity-politics agendas.
In this view, an "OK" America is no better than other countries. As Barack Obama once bluntly put it, America is only exceptional in relative terms, given that citizens of Greece and the United Kingdom believe their own countries are just as exceptional. In other words, there is no absolute standard to judge a nation's excellence.
About half the country disagrees. It insists that America's sins, past and present, are those of mankind. But only in America were human failings constantly critiqued and addressed.
America does not have be perfect to be good. As the world's wealthiest democracy, it certainly has given people from all over the world greater security and affluence than any other nation in history -- with the largest economy, largest military, greatest energy production and most top-ranked universities in the world.
America alone kept the postwar peace and still preserves free and safe global communications, travel and commerce.
The traditionalists see American history as a unique effort to overcome human weakness, bias and sin. That effort is unmatched by other cultures and nations, and explains why millions of foreign nationals swarm into the United States, both legally and illegally. These arguments over our past are really over the present -- and especially the future.
If progressives and socialists can at last convince the American public that their country was always hopelessly flawed, they can gain power to remake it based on their own interests. These elites see Americans not as unique individuals but as race, class and gender collectives, with shared grievances from the past that must be paid out in the present and the future.
We've seen something like this fight before, in 1861 -- and it didn't end well.

Texto completo: In a historic vote, the U.S. House of Representatives rebuked President Donald Trump by condemning as racist his statements attacking four congresswomen of color. But two Republican congressmen representing Asheville, including the leader of the influential conservative Freedom Caucus, didn't agree.
Rep. Mark Meadows of Transylvania County voted against the July 16 condemnation but a day later wouldn't say whether he thought the president's comments were racist, as they have been widely described.
Rep. Patrick McHenry of Lincoln County, who also voted no, didn't respond to a request for comment.
Meadows, the leader of the Freedom Caucus, and McHenry have districts that cover parts of Asheville.
In a tweet on July 14, Trump wrote of representatives Ilhan Omar, Ayanna S. Pressley, Rashida Tlaib and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: "go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came". After backlash from many who viewed his "go back" suggestion as racist, the president doubled down on his words, tweeting two days later, "if you hate our Country, or if you are not happy here, you can leave!"
Two days after the president's original tweet, the House voted on a resolution to condemn Trump's words as "racist comments that have legitimized and increased fear and hatred of new Americans and people of color."
The resolution passed July 16 in a heated, largely party line vote, 240-187. Four Republicans and one independent voted for the resolution.
"He's not racist," said Meadows said July 15, according to the New York Times. "I probably talk to him more than anyone else, and I can tell you he is certainly not a racist."
But in response to a July 17 query by the Citizen Times, Meadows declined to say whether he thought the controversial tweets and statements were racist.
In 2012, Meadows made similar comments about then-President Barack Obama at an event in Hendersonville.
"We will send him back home to Kenya or wherever it is," Meadows said of Obama. "We will send him back home, and in doing that I believe what we will find is that we will get a new commander in chief who will hopefully honor the Constitution, respect our military and stop cutting it."
When videos of these comments resurfaced earlier this year, Meadows faced criticism and allegations of racism.
A contentious vote The House debate over the resolution devolved into partisan feuding.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi took the floor to call Trump's comments "disgraceful, disgusting ... and racist." Representative Doug Collins, R-Georgia, jumped up to object to Pelosi's use of the word "racist" as a violation of House rules.
After minutes spent squabbling over Pelosi's words, the lawmaker presiding over the debate — Rep. Emanuel Cleaver II, D-Missouri, — rose from his chair and stormed out of the room.
"We just want to fight," Cleaver admonished, dropping his gavel. "I abandon the chair."
After the resolution passed, Meadows tweeted out a rebuke of the debate.
"House Democrats do nothing on the border for seven months, but are going to spend the entirety of today fighting for Speaker Pelosi's ability to break House rules and call the President a racist on the floor," he wrote.
Later, Meadows called the resolution a "political act", contending that "the majority can't accomplish anything legislatively, so they are trying to accomplish things politically."
After the vote, Trump commended the GOP lawmakers who voted against the resolution.
"So great to see how unified the Republican Party was on today's vote concerning statements I made about four Democrat Congresswomen," the president wrote in a tweet.

Woodstock 50 Still Has No Home

Texto completo: The organizers of Woodstock's 50th anniversary festival have lost yet another battle to stage their event, after town officials in Vernon, N.Y., rejected an appeal for permits, leaving the embattled concert without a venue just 30 days before its scheduled opening.
In a meeting on Tuesday evening, the Vernon Planning Board refused to give festival organizers permission to use the Vernon Downs racetrack. The board affirmed an earlier decision by the town's code officer that had found Woodstock's applications inadequate.
The organizers of the anniversary concert, known as Woodstock 50 -- among them Michael Lang, who promoted the original Woodstock festival in 1969 -- said in a statement late Tuesday that they were disappointed by the decision.
"We regret that those in Vernon who supported Woodstock have been deprived of the once-in-a-lifetime chance to be part of the rebirth of a cultural peace movement that changed the world in 1969 and is what the world needs now," the statement reads.
The decision by Vernon, a town about 35 miles east of Syracuse with a population of around 5,000, is the latest humiliation for Woodstock 50, and puts its future in grave doubt. With the event still advertised as running from Aug. 16 to 18 -- almost exactly 50 years from the legendary original festival -- it has no venue, and no tickets have been sold.
A spokeswoman for the festival declined to comment on its plans, saying only that the organizers were "considering all options."
Woodstock 50, originally planned for Watkins Glen, N.Y., was announced in January, and had a lineup featuring Jay-Z, Miley Cyrus, Santana, Chance the Rapper, John Fogerty and Dead and Company, among others. But it has been plagued with problems almost since the beginning, and along the way organizers have battled with a series of partners.
In late April, the festival's financial backer pulled out, declaring the event dead. Woodstock 50 later won a partial legal victory when a state court ruled that the investor -- a branch of the Japanese advertising giant Dentsu -- did not have the right to unilaterally cancel the event.
But by that point Woodstock 50 was in dire financial straits, and had lost vital partners like Superfly, a well-known production company. In June, Woodstock was ejected from its site at the Watkins Glen racetrack after failing to make a $ 150,000 payment.
The status of the festival lineup is also unclear. Most if not all of the acts have already been paid in full; according to a court filing, those fees totaled $ 32 million. But artist contracts were tied to the Watkins Glen site, and performers may have a right to refuse to appear elsewhere. The original Woodstock 50 pitch had been for a world-class anniversary event with attendance of up to 150,000; the revised plan for Vernon Downs was capped at 65,000.
Since late June, Woodstock 50 has made a series of permit applications in Vernon, but faced repeated denials from town officials, as well as opposition from the local population.
Last week, the sheriff of Oneida County said he could not guarantee public safety at the proposed event. A few days later, Vernon's Code Enforcement Office denied Woodstock 50's third permit application. The office's letter, a copy of which was obtained by The New York Times, cites numerous deficiencies in the 139-page application, including traffic and emergency access plans; at one point, in reference to a map submitted as part of a security plan, the letter states simply, "The legend is illegible."
Opposition from the public never let up. On Tuesday, Anthony J. Picente Jr., the Oneida County executive, wrote to the Vernon Planning Board urging them to deny Woodstock 50's application and saying that Lang and his partners had not acted responsibly.
"The only thing Michael Lang has retained from his original Woodstock," Picente wrote, "is the hallucinogenic effect."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Texto completo: We need serious solutions to end rape culture
Dear Editor: In 2013, a Montana judge sentenced only 30 days in jail to a 50-year-old teacher who raped his 14-yearold student (who later committed suicide), and defended his decision by saying that the girl was "older than her chronological age." Only 3% of rapists ever serve a day in jail, mostly because people are scared to tell someone. About 3.4 million rapes go unreported in the span of four years.
That proves rape culture isn't taken as seriously as it should be.
Some even think it's a joke.
Citizens publicly defend celebrities like Bill Cosby, Brad Pitt, Marilyn Manson, even Michael Jackson, who are accused of rape, just because they're famous.
They ignore what the victim has to say.
As a high school freshman, I think adults should do something more about this. There are parents who blame girls for posting sexy pictures of themselves and leading their sons into sin, instead of talking with their sons themselves about their own sexual expression. There are tons of people "slut shaming" girls, or judging their choice of clothing. People have turned it into women's job to not get raped instead of men's job to not rape.
Rape culture is all over social media as well. On Twitter, people have reported hashtags that supports accused rapists and blame victims. Reddit is home to threads with titles like "You just have to make sure she's dead" with a link to the story of a 13-year-old girl in Pakistan who was raped and buried alive.
All these examples are even more reason that we should take this rape culture more seriously.
Rape culture exists in all corners of society that barely anybody knows about.
? Haylee Ball, Brodhead
Solar panels aren't a solution for Madison
Dear Editor: Several recent letters here have called for solar panels on roofs as a way to "go green" without transmission power lines. With the electric power being generated at or near where it is used, no need for those ugly poles and high voltage lines.
That may work in the desert southwest, but not in Madison, because here we have trees and farmland. The rural areas grow food and the city streets are lined with trees. Most yards also have trees. In the summer the tree leaves shade the houses, including the roof, which cools them and reduces AC use. That also reduces the efficiency of solar collectors. In the winter, the sun is lower, days are shorter, and roofs are covered with snow, especially in well insulated houses.
If we are going reduce greenhouse gas emissions with wind and solar, that means putting the turbines where the wind blows (the Great Plains) and the solar collectors where the sun shines (the Southwest).
Another option is nuclear.

Put an end to bullying LGBTQ youth
Dear Editor: At North Bend High School in Oregon, gay and lesbian students were bullied with homophobic slurs. A transgender student had food thrown at them. According to The New York Times, when LGBTQ+ students got in trouble, their punishment was reading from the Bible.
For me, middle school was a bit like the high school in Oregon.
Every day I heard kids saying bad things about being LGBTQ+.
There was nothing I could do to stop it. Coming out to them would only make things worse for me. They didn't pelt kids with food in the cafeteria, and faculty members didn't make kids read from Bibles, but my peers sure made it known that they hated the LGBTQ+ community. I was eventually outed as bisexual by a close friend, and I had kids say some nasty things to me. I knew if I reported it to a teacher things would get worse. So I waited for the kids to stop, but they didn't.
By the end of the year, I had taken up much more than the school's limit of sick days.
The Human Rights Campaign published a survey called "Growing Up LGBT In America." The survey asked over 10,000 youth who identified as LGBTQ+ questions about their life at school.
Ninety-two percent of kids said they hear negative messages about being LGBTQ+.
Teachers and students need to join together to stop discrimination and bullying. First of all, being LGBTQ+ should be talked about more in school so it's not portrayed in such a negative light all the time. It should be a normal part of a school curriculum, leading to kids gaining a better understand themselves and to reduce bullying. According to the Human Rights Campaign 2018 LGBTQ Youth Report, only 5% of these kids feel like all of their teachers and peers support them. Let's change that.

High schools assign too much homework
Dear Editor: In ninth grade at my local high school, I was assigned homework just like all of the rest of the kids. Normally, students would be coming home with less than one hour of homework a night, but I was attending to double or triple that amount. That might not seem like a lot of time to the average community member, but when you consider after-school sports, jobs and responsibilities, time really adds up. Things need to change, starting with the amount of homework assigned.
According to the National Education Association, students should be doing about 10 minutes of homework per night per grade level. Many students are doing more than what is to be "prescribed to them" and don't have enough time to enjoy their lives outside of school.
I kept notes of my homework time the week of April 23, I found that I was spending on average three hours a night doing homework or studying for upcoming tests. This is just the start, but teachers think that with all of the school work and overwhelming study times is beneficial. Teachers and other adults, when you give us less homework, you allow us to get the sleep we need, and we will still show productivity with our school work.

Texto completo: Donald Trump got elected by criticizing America. His campaign slogan told us over and over, in speech after speech, on hat after hat, we were no longer great. His inaugural address referenced poverty, gangs, drugs, rusted-out factories, lousy schools and American carnage.
"For many decades, we've enriched foreign industry at the expense of American industry," he said. "Subsidized the armies of other countries while allowing for the very sad depletion of our military.
"We've defended other nations' borders while refusing to defend our own," he continued, "and spent trillions of dollars overseas while America's infrastructure has fallen into disrepair and decay.
"We've made other countries rich while the wealth, strength and confidence of our country," he said, "has disappeared over the horizon."
He evoked such dark and dismal themes repeatedly on the campaign trail and has returned to them as needed while in office.
Which makes Sunday's outburst all the more absurd.
On Sunday, the president wrote a string of tweets aimed at Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and her fellow representatives in the House: Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan.
"So interesting to see 'Progressive' Democrat Congresswomen, who originally came from countries whose governments are a complete and total catastrophe, the worst, most corrupt and inept anywhere in the world (if they even have a functioning government at all), now loudly ...
"... and viciously telling the people of the United States, the greatest and most powerful Nation on earth, how our government is to be run. Why don't they go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came. Then come back and show us how. ...
"... it is done. These places need your help badly, you can't leave fast enough. I'm sure that Nancy Pelosi would be very happy to quickly work out free travel arrangements!"
Pressley, Tlaib and Ocasio-Cortez were born in the United States. Omar was born in Somalia and became a U.S. citizen in 2000.
The tweets are racist and nativist. As New York Times columnist Charles Blow puts it, "The central framing of this kind of thinking is that this is a white country, founded and built by white men, and destined to be maintained as a white country."
"It sees a country from which black and brown people come as deficient -- 'a complete and total catastrophe, the worst, most corrupt and inept anywhere in the world' -- because, at its base, it sees black and brown people as deficient," Blow writes.
The tweets are also an insult to our intelligence.
Americans know dissent is woven into our history and protected by our Constitution.
We know our freedom of speech is preserved in the very first of our amendments. We know that very first amendment also preserves our right to peaceably assemble and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.
We know presidents, presidential hopefuls, faith leaders, abolitionists, suffragists, soldiers, veterans, civil rights activists, artists, historians, athletes, professors, students, pundits, historians -- citizens of every background and political persuasion -- have been criticizing this nation, nudging and prodding and striving toward that more perfect union promised in our Constitution's preamble, since our earliest days.
We know that nudging and prodding and striving are what keep us free and just and ever closer to a nation where more and more of its people enjoy that freedom and justice equally.
We know that the people willing to patiently nudge and loudly prod and tirelessly strive -- even when we don't agree with every word or policy they profess -- are the people we need more of, the people we look to for guidance, the people who see both our potential and our historical hunger to reach it.
So when the president tells our modern-day nudgers, prodders, strivers, "you can't leave fast enough," we know better. History has taught us better. He knows better too. He wouldn't have run on "Make America Great Again," he wouldn't paint such a dismal portrait of America in his inaugural address, he wouldn't so frequently and freely exercise his own right to criticize the government if he didn't recognize that freedom as a fundamental American value.
He just doesn't want that freedom to be accessible to all. He wants the criticism to remain steeped in nostalgia, not change. He doesn't want to hear it from people who don't look like he looks, who represent a shift in the rules about who holds the power, who makes the rules, who signs the laws in this country.
Thankfully, that's not how America works.
As U.S. Rep. Eric Swalwell from California tweeted on Sunday to Omar, Ocasio-Cortez, Pressley and Rashida Tlaib: "You are home. You are home. You are home. You are home. You are home. You are home. You are home. You are home. You are home. You are home. You are home. You are home. You are home. You are home. You are home. You are home."
And we're all better for it.

Former Chief of Shelter Nonprofit Made $3.6 Million

Texto completo: The leader of the nation's largest provider of migrant shelters for children was paid $ 3.6 million during the charity's most recent tax year, even as the nonprofit organization came under intense scrutiny for its high compensation packages for executives and for its decision to accept children separated from their families by the Trump administration.
Juan Sanchez, the chief executive of Southwest Key Programs, received that income, which included life insurance and retirement benefits, between September 2017 and August 2018. It was more than twice what he was paid the previous year, and it eclipsed the maximum amount of grant money that the government allows migrant shelters to use to pay an employee, which was $ 189,600 last year.
It was also considerably higher than compensation at other nonprofit organizations: The head of the much larger American Red Cross, for example, made about $ 686,000, according to its most recent tax return.
Mr. Sanchez announced in March that he was stepping down, after The New York Times detailed potential mismanagement and questionable spending at Southwest Key. Three other top executives, including Mr. Sanchez's wife, have also stepped down. That article prompted the Justice Department to launch an investigation into possible financial improprieties at the organization, which significantly benefited as the migrant crisis at the border deepened and was integral to how the federal government responded under both the Obama and Trump administrations.
Over the past decade, Southwest Key has been awarded almost $ 1.9 billion in federal funds to care for unaccompanied minors. About 4,000 children are now housed in its 24 shelters in Arizona, California and Texas, including a converted Walmart Supercenter in Brownsville, Tex., that has drawn criticism as a warehouse for youths.
Mr. Sanchez's compensation was made public in a tax filing from Promesa Public Schools, an affiliate of Southwest Key that runs charter schools, because Mr. Sanchez was until recently a member of the affiliate's board. The compensation was first reported by The Washington Post; The Times had requested the Promesa tax return five times since July 3, but Southwest Key's spokesman did not send it until Monday.
Southwest Key's own tax return is due to be filed this month. The organization, based in Austin, Tex., is required to provide it "upon request" to anyone who shows up and asks for it.
Southwest Key officials have repeatedly defended the high compensation packages, saying that they included a life insurance and retirement program for executives who had been underpaid in the past. In a letter to its staff last week, Joella Brooks, the interim chief executive, said that Southwest Key was ending that program, and that she and other leaders "agreed to return substantial portions of the life insurance benefits."
In a statement provided to The Times, Ms. Brooks also said Mr. Sanchez had "forfeited hundreds of thousands of unvested dollars" because of his resignation. She said that the money had been returned to Southwest Key.
But Mr. Sanchez has not entirely left the shelter business behind. He, a friend and Melody Chung, Southwest Key's former chief financial officer, still own a shelter in Conroe, Tex., through a shell company; the shelter is rented to Southwest Key. Asked by The Times last year about that potential case of self-dealing, in which the executives collected rent paid by the federal government, a Southwest Key spokesman said the partners would seek to sell their ownership stakes. The property has not yet been sold.
Some federal lawmakers have called on the government to cut ties to Southwest Key. Last year, in response to The Times's reporting, the Department of Health and Human Services said it had commissioned a review of the finances of shelter operators. Asked Monday about the review's status, a spokeswoman for the agency said she was looking into it.
The enormous compensation for Southwest Key executives came at a time when workers were complaining about a litany of shortcomings in the care of children at the group's shelters: low-quality food, a lack of books and other teaching materials, insufficient clothing and substandard medical care, according to dozens of interviews with current and former Southwest Key employees in recent months.
Licensed counselors described being given janitorial duties -- even being told to paint the walls in new shelters -- in addition to their often overcapacity caseloads.
Ms. Brooks said that Southwest Key hired outside experts to talk to hundreds of youths in the group's shelters, and that the youths reported that they felt safe. She said that to retain their licenses, shelters are required to provide adequate food, clothing and medical care. "Old allegations from former employees don't match what we and many others see happening in our shelters every day," she said.
While much of the senior leadership at Southwest Key has resigned this year, the organization's board of directors, which approved Mr. Sanchez's compensation, has remained largely intact. One member, Elizabeth S. Villegas, left the board last summer at the peak of the outcry over family separations. On Monday, she said it "wasn't a good fit for me anymore," but declined to go into further detail about her reasons for leaving.
Mr. Sanchez, now 71, was a small-town boy made big. He grew up poor in Brownsville, Tex., before becoming the first in his family to go to college, eventually graduating with a doctorate in education from Harvard University. He started Southwest Key in Texas about 32 years ago to help juvenile delinquents stay out of jail.
As the organization flourished, it shifted most of its attention to running shelters for unaccompanied migrant youths. And as more and more shelters opened, Mr. Sanchez and a small group of insiders were paid much more money.
For instance, Mr. Sanchez was paid $ 279,000 in 2012. His wife, Jennifer Sanchez, was paid about $ 123,000 that same year, and then about $ 500,000 as a vice president in the fiscal year ended in August 2017. Ms. Chung was paid about $ 194,000 in 2012 and $ 1 million in compensation in the year ending in August 2017.
Alexia Rodriguez, a vice president who oversaw the shelters, was paid about $ 112,000 in 2012. Also a board member at Promesa, Ms. Rodriguez pulled down a compensation package of almost $ 1.4 million in the most recent tax year.
All four stepped down this year. None could be reached for comment.

Texto completo: Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
Caitlin Dickerson, a reporter for the National desk, covers immigration for The New York Times. She has broken news about changes in deportation and detention policy. Ms. Dickerson reflected on her work at the Investigative Reporters and Editors conference in Houston in June . This is an edited excerpt from a presentation in which she discussed sourcing, or the practice of building sources of information for articles, and how that allows her to break news on her beat.
Covering immigration right now has required me to go back to my most basic, fundamental reporting skills, and essentially, to turn sourcing into an extreme sport. It feels right now as if I'm always interviewing someone, if not in the field, then on the phone. It's a pain, I think, for people in my life because it's become difficult for me to get through a dinner or birthday party without having to step out of the room to take a call.
I think anyone writing about this topic needs to have a really robust set of sources -- from current and former government officials to academics, partisan advocates and of course lots of immigrants and people who interact with immigrants in their communities. Because many of the complex investigative reporting techniques that my colleagues and I are used to relying on, like data analysis, don't really apply in this reporting environment. For example, the vast majority of family separations that were originally conducted were not even documented by the government. A list of separated kids didn't exist. So there was nothing for reporters to request and then analyze, like we would do normally.
One story I wrote in the aftermath of family separation that did begin with a data set showed that the detention of immigrant children had skyrocketed, in relative secret, to the highest levels in history. It was based on data that I got from a source in Congress. The story spread like wildfire and there was a strong desire for more information about the conditions that kids were living in -- especially in a massive tent city in Texas, where a lot of them were being held. I basically just went to town working the phones with congressional sources, with sources who worked for the shelters where kids had been staying before they got to the tent city. I also tried to contact people working in the tents, because reporters weren't allowed inside.
What I learned was that the conditions themselves weren't necessarily the largest concern. That's not to say they were ideal for children; but they had serviceable food, it was clean. Because it was a brand-new facility, it didn't have the kind of health and safety issues that we are used to seeing in the larger shelters, and certainly in immigration detention centers.
But what we learned that was concerning was that these facilities were essentially unregulated. So, unlike the shelters that exist all across the country -- which have to be licensed by the states in which they reside, and which have to provide adequate medical care, education and access to legal representation -- these facilities were subject to a very short list of what were not even rules, but just suggestions.
I learned this from the former government officials who had written the rules and who knew about the loopholes, who knew how to find them. Because at the time, I couldn't get any information out of the government directly -- they were telling you nothing. And if you went directly to the organization that was running the shelters, they were also telling you nothing.
It wasn't just the lack of regulation, but also, I think, the logistics of how children were getting to the tent city people reacted to really strongly, and is ultimately part of what led to the facility shutting down.
Logistics become really important when you are talking about kids in federal custody. So in this case, rather than telling the kids ahead of time that they were going to go to the tent city in Tornillo, the decision in at least one existing shelter system was to wait until the very last minute -- so, to tell them very late in the day, only hours before they were going to be moved, that they were headed somewhere else. But the kids didn't know where they were going. Then, the kids would have dinner, they would go to sleep, and they would be woken up in the middle of the night by shelter workers, loaded onto buses driven across the country. And then days later they would arrive at the tent city. The idea was used to avoid escape attempts or emotional outbursts -- but it ended up traumatizing the children, many of whom had already been separated from their parents, pretty significantly because it all happened so fast. They didn't have time to process the information or say goodbye to the few friends they had made in the place they had been living.
I think the details really struck readers and contributed to a strong backlash against what was happening in Tornillo, which ultimately resulted in the facility being shuttered.

Texto completo: One of U.S. Soccer's official sponsors has sided with the World Cup-winning United States women's team in its fight with the federation for equal pay, urging its partner, the governing body for soccer in the United States, "to be on the right side of history."
The sponsor, Procter & Gamble, declared its support for equal pay in a full-page advertisement in Sunday's editions of The New York Times. It is the first of more than a dozen U.S. Soccer partners and sponsors to side so openly with the team in the equal pay fight, and its support could increase the pressure on federation officials on the eve of mediation discussions to try to resolve the players' federal gender discrimination lawsuit.

Procter & Gamble, which supports U.S. Soccer through its Secret deodorant brand, also said it was making a donation of $ 529,000 to the women's national team's players association, which represents the team's interests in its dealings with U.S. Soccer. The figure was symbolic, the company said: $ 23,000 for each member of the 23-player World Cup roster.
"Inequality is about more than pay and players," Procter & Gamble said in the ad. "It's about values."
All of U.S. Soccer's sponsors have embraced the team since its 2-0 victory over the Netherlands in the World Cup final. Nike, for example, released a 60-second ad almost as soon as the title was secure on July 7; its message stressed equality for women's sports and support for women's empowerment generally, but unlike Secret, it did not explicitly call for equal pay for the women's team.
Megan Rapinoe, one of the team's co-captains, stressed the power of that kind of corporate support in an appearance Sunday morning on "Meet the Press," and she urged other companies to follow suit.
"These are some of the most powerful corporations, not just in sports but in the world, and have so much weight that they can throw around," she said. "And I think that they just need to get comfortable with throwing it around."
The women's team and U.S. Soccer have been in a public fight over equal pay and support for years. In 2016, the team filed a wage-discrimination complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, citing figures that its lawyers said showed the women players could expect to earn tens of thousands of dollars less than their male counterparts for the same work. A year later, after months of talks, the team and the federation agreed to terms on a new collective bargaining agreement that included improved pay and working conditions, but by this March the sides were publicly at odds again.
Frustrated by the lack of progress on their E.E.O.C. complaint, the players petitioned to withdraw it, and instead 28 members of the team sued U.S. Soccer in federal court, accusing the federation of years of "institutionalized gender discrimination." The discrimination, the team said, affects not only their paychecks but also where they play and how often, the medical treatment and quality of coaching they receive, and even how they travel to matches and the hotels in which they stay.
While Procter & Gamble is the first U.S. Soccer sponsor to enter the players' fight so directly, it is not the first corporation to make a financial commitment to the players. Days before the World Cup, Visa announced a five-year sponsorship that it said requires that at least half of its investment be directed toward the women's national team and other women's programs. And in April, the energy-bar maker Luna Bar promised each player who made the Women's World Cup roster a $ 31,250 bonus; the payments, Luna Bar said, represented the difference in the World Cup roster bonuses paid to the United States men's and women's teams.
Yet even those bonuses highlighted the complicated, and nuanced, debate about equal pay. In one of the most obvious differences, players on the men's and women's national teams compete under separate collective bargaining agreements with U.S. Soccer. The men, who benefit from much higher club salaries, have prioritized higher match and victory bonuses from the federation, while the women, who still make the bulk of their on-field income from U.S. Soccer, long had agreed to lower national-team bonuses in exchange for the security of guaranteed salaries. The biggest difference in compensation for World Cup success overall continues to be the bonuses provided to participating teams by FIFA, world soccer's governing body. Those bonuses are more than 10 times as high for men's teams as they are for women's squads.
The debate about equal treatment in women's soccer is not new. In 2012, it even played out in the seating arrangements when Japan's soccer teams flew to the London Olympics on the same plane: The women's team, which had won the World Cup a year earlier, rode in premium economy while the men sat in business class. But the momentum in the equal pay debate, driven by powerful voices on the United States women's team like Rapinoe, Alex Morgan and others, had been building behind the American players even before their victory in France.
In the week since the team claimed its second consecutive World Cup title, fans, companies and politicians have rushed to the players' cause: After the United States' victory over the Netherlands, fans chanted "Equal Pay!" inside the stadium, and days later the phrase was shouted repeatedly during the team's victory parade and celebration in New York.
In interviews, even Rapinoe has acknowledged that pay was only one kind of equality in "a complex argument." On the eve of mediation talks with U.S. Soccer over the gender discrimination lawsuit, comments like hers de-emphasizing pay as the team's solitary concern might be a signal to the federation that the players are not staking out a winner-take-all position. Having major corporations in their union's corner, though, can only help.
"For brands, and especially a brand that is also a U.S. Soccer sponsor, to support our players both financially and publicly is hugely significant and important," Becca Roux, the executive director of the national team's players association, said Sunday morning. "Equity and pay equity are systemic issues that need systemic solutions. Corporations are powerful, influential players within the system that can spur massive change for good."

Beyoncé, 'Spirit (From Disney's 'The Lion King')'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Beyoncé brings full gospel dynamics -- and sets aside the original Broadway score -- in her showpiece for the remake of "The Lion King." She belts, "Your destiny is coming close -- stand up and fight!" The song's intro chants "Long live the king" in Swahili, but Beyoncé's exhortation is not just for this lion king -- it's for every righteous striver facing doubts. Her vocal, urged on by a choir, builds in wave after wave, from breathy eagerness to full-throated cry, then topped by a different kind of humility at its peak: just piano and Beyoncé's soprano, envisioning a biblical transcendence, "to be one with the Great I Am." JON PARELES
Billie Eilish featuring Justin Bieber, 'Bad Guy'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
The good news is that even though pop music has iterated past him a couple of times over, Justin Bieber is nimble enough to keep up. On this new version of Billie Eilish's swinging "Bad Guy," Bieber sings with the same robot-doing-cabaret cadence as his host. He touches on his tattoos, his jewelry, his desire for more sleep -- a Sinatra for the SoundCloud era. JON CARAMANICA
Angelica Garcia, 'It Don't Hinder Me'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
A convincing Southern-rock stomper from Angelica Garcia, who has a ferociously quavering voice and an even more ferocious sense of purpose. "It Don't Hinder Me" is a statement of cultural pride and social resistance: "I want the cooking that my grandma made/I want the bed that I was yelled at to make." This sharp song is rowdier and swampier than Garcia's 2016 debut album "Medicine for Birds," a sign of a singer getting ever more comfortable, and ever less bothered. CARAMANICA
Lil Nas X and Billy Ray Cyrus featuring Young Thug and Mason Ramsey, 'Old Town Road (Remix)'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
As of now there is no American award -- not the Grammy, not the Pulitzer, not the Oscar or the Tony -- that could adequately reward the miracle that is the never-ending rollout of "Old Town Road." Each time it courts death, it pivots. This latest version is the one you'd ask for in a fantasy but never think was possible. Billy Ray Cyrus is still here, crooning. And then there's Young Thug, less nonsensical than usual, game to be in on the joke. But the crowning moment is at the end, with the arrival of the viral yodeling preteen Mason Ramsey, who shows up to sing about his Razor scooter, cows and his giddy-up. It's the perfect twist ending to this internet-born-and-enabled saga: meme recognize meme. CARAMANICA
Lola Marsh, 'Echoes'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
The Israeli duo Lola Marsh (the singer Yael Shoshana Cohen and the multi-instrumentalist Gil Landau) makes sweeping, cinematic music dripping in retro charm and reverb. There are hints of Dum Dum Girls, Elle King and Lana Del Rey in the group's new track "Echoes," a lush beach blanket bop wiggling with dramatic energy. CARYN GANZ
Ed Sheeran featuring Eminem and 50 Cent, 'Remember the Name'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Ed Sheeran: Successful enough and powerful enough and deep enough into his career to orchestrate an opportunity to rap on the same song as Eminem and 50 Cent; rhymes "misfit" with "Ipswich."
Eminem: Far enough removed from the peak of his success and the peak of his talent that the opportunity to rap alongside Ed Sheeran is not an automatic no; over-delivers, perhaps out of mild embarrassment.
50 Cent: Tries out a Sugarhill Gang flow, hopes no one is looking. CARAMANICA
Nérija, 'Last Straw'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Swelling, underwater electric bass; a grainy, distorted guitar that travels from woozy chords to neatly chopped rhythm; a high, corkscrewing horn part that could have been plucked off a radio signal in the Balkans, or maybe North Africa. You'd expect nothing less than this absorbing mix from Nérija, a septet to watch of young London musicians. The group includes the much-discussed young tenor saxophonist Nubya Garcia and the trumpeter Sheila Maurice-Grey, who wrote this tune and takes a rewarding solo across most of the track. Nérija has a debut album, "Blume," due Aug. 2. RUSSONELLO
Jenny Hval, 'Ashes to Ashes'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Here's a song about dreaming about a song about death: "It had the most moving chord changes/She was certain the lyrics went about burying someone's ashes and then having a cigarette." Jenny Hval starts it as a bemused incantation over misty chords; then the beat comes in, the keyboards start answering her with hooks, and her meta-pop musings verge on turning into pop themselves. PARELES
Anna Meredith, 'Paramour'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Anna Meredith writes chamber music with a minimalist's fondness for repeated motifs and a rocker's willingness to kick. The ingenious video for the instrumental "Paramour" diagrams it as a frenetic electric-train ride amid the hard-working ensemble -- clarinet, keyboards, cello, drums, tuba, electric guitar -- pointing up just how many motifs Meredith mobilizes and tosses aside in only five minutes. PARELES
Victor Gould, 'October'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Victor Gould never sounds totally at ease at the piano, but that doesn't mean he's not in control. He plays in shapely, looping harmonies, with debts to Hank Jones and Cedar Walton, but there's some physical conflict, some audible work, in each gesture. This is what sets him apart and underneath the sturdy, well-balanced flow of his arrangements, it's the real reward. "October" gives a glimpse of his skills as an arranger -- here, for jazz sextet and strings -- and his increasingly distinctive voice as an improviser. The track comes from Gould's new album, "Thoughts Become Things." RUSSONELLO

Trumps stupidity has terrible world consequences

Texto completo: As part of a wonderful vacation, last week I stood on the upper deck of a ship to watch the pilot boat led us out of Cherbourg, France. A fellow passenger who was enjoying the sights, too, said he thought the stone fortifications we were looking at in the harbor were probably built by Napoleon.
I took his word for it; I was just enjoying everything I saw. But as we continued to watch and draw closer, I noticed sets of solar panels on the stonework.
Who knew that Napoleon was such a visionary that he would have installed solar panels before anyone else on the planet?
I am guessing Donald Trump would know.
Now, at home, post Fourth of July, I discover Trump is trumping even my Napoleonic joke with his statement that our brave Founding Fathers had airports at their command in their revolutionary battle with the English.
As usual, each time Trump utters something that has no basis in truth (only each time he speaks), thousands of people around the planet jump in to comment about how he knows nothing.
I am certainly part of that chorus. After Trump makes one of his ludicrous remarks, like the time he said Puerto Rico could not be helped after hurricane damage because it "is an island surrounded by big water, ocean water, we can also watch in amazement as he explains his stupid statements.
Once he was forced to acknowledge that George Washington did not have airplanes at his command, he had to explain why he said such a silly thing. This time, he said he could not read the teleprompter.
Now I am not jumping in here to bring up the fact that Trump criticized Barack Obama for using a teleprompter. Obama was always well-spoken, factual and measured in his speaking. Three things Trump will never be accused of.
Orange One, you needed a teleprompter to tell you airports were unavailable to General Washington?
Trump still thinks he is a great performer, based on his days in television. His assessment of his television abilities is also wrong.
If you have not watched the footage about the airport, please note that he is not looking at the teleprompter as he mutters his message.
I am just a poor girl from Falls View with no medical credentials. But I think he was caught up in the rockets' red glare. I think that image sent his brain soaring (its one trip). Rocket man thought if they have rockets, they must have airports or launching pads.
Others may think this is another sign of dementia. And, I am sure there are many people in my camp: We know he is dumber than a box of door knobs. His dumbness knows no bounds and shows itself constantly.
Besides his complete lack of knowledge on any subject, we citizens also have to put up with his outright lies. He continues to say, even though many people have corrected him and surely he does know the truth, that his father was born in Germany.
He makes false statements based on his prejudices. In a brief walk through that category, we have Trump saying all Mexicans are rapists and all Muslims are terrorists.
Then there is the category of false political promises. Mexico will pay for the wall and coal jobs are coming back. Just two of many. Play this game at home and see what your favorites are.
He makes horrible statements about people of foreign birth who come to America for work, but he will not admit his hotels and golf courses benefit from the work of undocumented aliens.
His current wife sought work in America as an undocumented porn star.
His helpful suggestions category can be amusing. To stop fires in California, rake the forests like the Finnish do.
No one has the time or patience to go through his whole geography blunders category. It is so huge and never stops growing.
As we all know, he has no ability to spell. This category, likewise, is voluminous and growing with each new tweet.
Want to go to the science category for 10 points? Our planet is clearly warming and species are dying. But Mr. Wizard has no such knowledge. He is so obsessed with and prejudiced against migrants that he puts their children in cages. He needs to understand that the whole world will see more migration as people flee their homes where they can no longer grow crops to feed themselves because climate change makes their homelands unlivable.
He lies about his lays. He married one porn star and paid off others. The most recent information I have read says he is currently fighting allegations from 22 women who say he forced himself on them. The Grabber-in-Chief!
He lies about money and business. He is a record-setting loser in the financial world. But not to hear him tell it. New York Times reporters put pencil to his paper and discovered that from 1985 to 1994, he "appears to have lost more money than nearly any other individual American taxpayer.
Currently, his only financial success is taking advantage of the American taxpayer. With his Washington hotel, he has flaunted the emoluments clause in the Constitution daily since he took office. He also helps his children to make the most of their time in public life by shilling themselves and their products. The Guardian reported that a company his son-in-law co-owns has made $90 million from foreign investors since he joined the Trump train, and who knows how many shoes daughter Ivanka will sell before Daddy is booted out?
He lies about his health, and he is lying to himself about his appearance. I, for one, do not find the clear impression of his protective glasses across his face used while he takes a fake-bake orange tan attractive. I have read that he thinks his extra-long ties help to give him a slimmer appearance. So wrong.
He lies at work and at play. We know he cheats at golf. His cheating is so well known that Rick Reilly even wrote a more than 200-page book on the subject called "Commander in Cheat: How Golf Explains Trump.
He even lies about how much he gives to charity. When those lies became public, his charitable foundation dissolved under the scrutiny.
On the subject of religion, he does not know a Sunni from a Sikh.
From arithmetic to zoology, the Orange One has no demonstrable knowledge of any subject I am aware of.
If Trump returned to television as a carnival act, we could keep the set turned off and never be bothered by him again.
But his stupidity, his prejudices, and his lies have terrible world consequences.
He lies about what he knows and what he does not know. Mix in his prejudices, and we have a toxic mix to deal with.

Texto completo: Consuelo Martinez considers herself a devout Catholic who attends church every Sunday, but the looming threat of large-scale raids that could result in thousands of immigrants being deported has her questioning her ritual.
"Should I really go to church or not?" Martinez said in Spanish. "I don't know what will happen until I wake up that day."
Martinez, who spoke Friday at an immigration rally in Chicago, is a community organizer whose family includes people with varying immigration status. She's fearful about what might happen during the planned ICE enforcement.
"I ask you to support our immigrant communities ... be present during this week where we are most at risk," Martinez said.
Martinez is among activists in the Chicago area who for weeks have held meetings to educate immigrants about their rights and touted strategies for resistance. Those who oppose the ICE action plan to hold vigils at several locations around the Chicago area and beyond Friday evening, and thousands are expected to convene at 11 a.m. Saturday at the Daley Plaza to protest the planned sweeps.
The enforcement campaign comes weeks after President Donald Trump first tweeted about and then delayed the sweeps. Reports have indicated the raids are expected to target families who have received deportation orders but could include so-called collateral detainment of other undocumented immigrants who are present when agents show up.
But on Friday, Trump confirmed the raids will begin this weekend and told reporters that agents will focus on detaining people with criminal backgrounds. Trump has said such efforts will not only remove dangerous people from the country but serve as a deterrent for other foreigners who are considering migration to the U.S.
What might a raid look like if it comes to your neighborhood?
When is the special enforcement campaign scheduled to take place? ICE has not released specifics of their plans, but reports indicate the raids could begin as early as Sunday morning before sunrise. ICE raids typically take place between 3 and 5 a.m. because most people are home during those hours, experts said.
Where will the raids happen? News reports have indicated the raids will happen in major cities across the country, including Chicago. Federal immigration agents will likely have a list of addresses based on the last known home address for the person facing deportation, but agents could also use public databases to find where the person lives, said Erin Cobb, a Chicago-based immigration attorney.
Will this be a one-day action? Probably not. News agencies have reported they will begin Sunday and continue throughout the week.
Can ICE agents raid private homes? Yes, but only if they have a warrant signed by a judge with the subject's specific name and address on it. The agents cannot force their way into homes with a simple administrative warrant, experts say. Given these restrictions, advocacy groups have encouraged people to keep their doors closed to ICE agents and refuse to let them in their homes unless the agents slide a warrant signed by a judge under the door.
People who encounter immigration enforcement agents also have the right to contact a family member, to remain silent or to walk away if they aren't under arrest, said Ruth Lopez-McCarthy, an attorney with the Chicago-based National Immigrant Justice Center. The Rev. Beth Brown, of Lincoln Park Presbyterian Church, spoke at a recent rally and encouraged people to videotape any enforcement activities as a way to document if someone's rights are violated.
Can people be detained without a deportation order? Yes. ICE agents can ask to see immigration papers of anyone inside the home and arrest any undocumented occupants. These detainments -- known as "collateral" deportations -- have occurred during previous ICE raids, so advocacy groups expect them during the upcoming enforcement effort as well.
What about any children in the home? Children remain the greatest concern for advocacy groups. Reports have indicated that if the entire family is undocumented, family members -- including children -- may be housed in local hotels until ICE determines where to send them to await deportation. If the children are legal residents or U.S. citizens, the Department of Homeland Security's current guidelines allow the deportee parent to make arrangements for suitable child care before being taken into custody. If the parent can't find someone to take the child, the child could turned over to the Department of Children and Family Services. Whether ICE will follow its guidelines or the deportee parent will be able to find a documented relative or friend to answer their phone before dawn remains a concern for advocacy groups.
What happens after someone is detained? ICE typically takes a detained person to a processing center -- there is one in suburban Broadview and another in the South Loop -- where the person will be fingerprinted, photographed and asked questions, Cobb said. Where exactly someone is detained depends on which facility has open bed space. In Illinois, the federal government has contracts with four local jails to house people facing deportation, according to ICE's website. The government also contracts with jails in Kansas, Missouri, Kentucky, Wisconsin and Indiana to house people facing deportation who have cases out of Chicago's immigration court.
However, the New York Times has reported that ICE could use hotel rooms to detain people in the raids because of space limitations. There also aren't any facilities in the Chicago area that can house families together, meaning those detained could be sent to a facility in Texas before they are deported, experts say.
What happens when someone is returned to their home country? Deportees who are returned to Mexico are typically returned to a border crossing near Brownsville, Texas, said Reyna Torres Mendivil, Mexico's consul general for Chicago. They are given paperwork that allows them to obtain an identification card, open a bank account and travel throughout the country. The border documents also can be used for a free bus ride from the border crossing to the deportee's hometown. Deportees are also offered some social services, including a shelter where they stay to collect their bearings and, if possible, contact a relative in Mexico to come get them.
Can detainees try to stop their deportation? If the person's native country isn't Mexico or Canada, it typically takes the federal government a couple of weeks before the person is deported. However, experts say that process could be expedited during the raids if the government has made travel plans for those they plan to arrest.
Even if someone has been given a final deportation order, an attorney can still file a motion to reopen the case in immigration court and file an emergency motion to stop the deportation, Cobb said. The person can petition to have his or her case reopened for a variety of reasons, including family circumstances or because of significant changes in their native country that could make it dangerous to return.
What are potential deportees being encouraged to do? Since the president first announced the large-scale raids on Twitter, advocacy groups have encouraged people to prepare themselves and know their rights. That includes taking photos and video recordings of any ICE activity in their home. Targeted parents are also being encouraged to have child care plans in place in case they are taken into custody.
Cobb urged immigrants to consult with an attorney now about the specifics of their case to see what legal avenues are available. If a final deportation order had been filed, an attorney can try to file a motion to reopen the case before the person is detained.
The Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights has opened a hotline, 855-435-7693, where anyone can call to report immigration enforcement activities or to seek legal help.
Are these raids unprecedented? This would not be the first time ICE has executed sweeping immigration raids across the country. The Obama administration ordered more than 2 million people deported, including those swept up in series of raids between October and November 2015, according to a Politico report. His record led some advocacy groups to refer to him as the "Deporter in Chief." But given Trump's anti-immigrant rhetoric, advocacy groups say they have no idea what to expect.
"There's already a sense of fear," said Wendy Cervantes, the director of immigration and immigrant families at the Washington-based Center for Law and Social Policy. "Now there is going to be even more so."

Texto completo: Raised in Captivity
Chuck Klosterman
Penguin Press, 320 pp., $26

--
"He wasn't trying to be a jackass," begins one story in Chuck Klosterman's "Raised in Captivity," which marks the first short fiction collection by the pop culture critic. "He was trying to make conversation."
There may be no tidier way to summarize the often contrarian, pop culture-obsessed and awe-inspiringly granular writing of this longtime essayist -- and Klosterman admits as much in the brief piece "Just Asking Questions."
In it, one Klosterman-esque character (known only as "jackass") interrogates the other about describing an ex's infidelity with "his best friend" and questions whether the phrase is true or a trick of managing a painful memory given the scenario is something of a cliche. In building a case for his argument, jackass annoys his friend and -- depending on whether you're intrigued by these sorts of thought experiments -- maybe the reader as well.
Klosterman's curiosities aren't for everyone. But this is the kind of strange, sharply detailed and often slyly funny examination of cultural behavior and norms he does unlike anyone else.
Whether through books delving into his Midwestern youth and love for '80s hair metal ("Fargo Rock City"), personal relationships ("Killing Yourself To Live: 85% of a True Story") or conventional wisdom ("But What If We're Wrong? Thinking About the Present As If It Were the Past"), there is no subject too ephemeral or superficial to pull at from all angles. Little wonder Klosterman briefly wrote the New York Times Magazine advice column "The Ethicist," where he examined moral quandaries with a jeweler's eye and an eagerness to explore contradictions.
Also writing for outlets such as Spin, GQ and ESPN's short-lived sports-centric spinoff Grantland, Klosterman has tried his hand at fiction but with mixed results. The 2008 novel "Downtown Owl" was an affectionately drawn if at times downcast trip back to the '80s North Dakota of Klosterman's past, while 2011's "The Visible Man" felt more superficial, like an overwrought distillation of his fascination with ethical questions constructed around a character's ability to become invisible.
"Raised in Captivity" can display both of those qualities, though to be fair it's hard to feel like a conventional fiction experience is really what Klosterman is after. With most stories rising out of an unexpected situation or the consideration of a single question or idea over the span of just a few pages, the book's scattershot style earns its front cover label as "fictional nonfiction."
For instance, what would happen if a high school football coach pursued victory by running only one play, one designed to exploit the game's rules and probabilities? "Execute Again" views such a monomaniacal pursuit through the eyes of one of the coach's players, and Klosterman revels in imagining both the sort of person who commits to that idea and the subsequent fallout with a sports obsessive's eye and dark humor.
Or what if a medical implant allowed fathers-to-be to experience the pain of labor? "Pain Is a Concept by Which We Measure Our God" explores the idea to its logical conclusion, and Klosterman knows this sort of speculative fiction maybe sounds a little like "Black Mirror." ("I saw this British TV show on Netflix," a character begins before his doctor interrupts. "It's not like that," he says.)
With that kind of playful self-awareness, it's hard to begrudge the bite-size ideas explored here, especially peppered with Klosterman's sharp wit and deep-cut descriptions that will be exceptionally vivid to some but useless to those not already in his tribe. "He was unshaven and a bit slovenly, but not to the level of Aqualung," Klosterman writes in "Never Look at Your Phone," and while knowledge of Jethro Tull isn't required for "Raised in Captivity," it will round parts into higher definition.
Klosterman's interrogative nature sometimes means these stories yield little more than premises for wry jokes while others unfortunately feel cut off too soon.
"The Secret" imagines a government agency in some undefined, increasingly unsettled future where the odds behind flipping a coin are slowly shifting, and "If Something Is Free the Product Is You" looks at a prisoner's reflection on the value of a screwdriver with a well-drawn weariness. "If one story is enough, three stories are redundant. It doesn't matter how well those stories are told," he writes. "Details create contradiction and adjectives become anchors." But just as the character has rounded into focus, Klosterman is ready to move on to the next idea.
A few stories delve into social satire, most effectively in the snapshot of a grim future consumed by "deep fake" videos in "Reality Apathy" and in "The Enemy Within," which reimagines the internet's "cancel culture" as a physical presence with a sort of police force that reveals the false "wokeness" of a woman's boyfriend. What begins as an easy joke about a veterinarian's exposure to rabies in "Reasonable Apprehension" builds to a surprisingly effective indictment of the power imbalance between the sexes. But mostly, Klosterman's far less interested in resolutions than examining the conflict.
Consider these stories the products of the kind of conversations that can come up between old friends as the hours grow late. Some are rich enough to reward further exploration, while others trail off, but all are pleasant enough to have around. This friend just enjoys the push and pull of arguments, whether based in reality or not. And he doesn't care if he can sound like a jackass.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – Grupos proinmigrantes denunciaron este sábado que las redadas anunciadas por el Gobierno del presidente de Estados Unidos, Donald Trump, contra indocumentados “aterrorizarán a menores y separarán familias”.
La presidenta de la organización Families Belong Together, Jess Morales Rocketto, señaló en un comunicado que “la crueldad es el punto: las redadas masivas aterrorizarán a menores, separarán familias y creará el caos por el país”.
“La Administración (de Trump) está ejecutando una agenda cruel, supremacista blanca para traumatizar a familias en vez de tomar acciones para abordar las condiciones horribles que están matando a menores migrantes bajo custodia de EEUU”, dijo Morales Rocketto.
Por su parte, Mary Bauer, responsable de Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC, en inglés), hizo hincapié en un comunicado en que el Gobierno actual “está aterrorizando deliberadamente” a familias y comunidades de inmigrantes.
“El maltrato continuado de los menores en instalaciones de detención, los ataques a nuestro sistema de asilo y los asaltos a comunidades de inmigrantes mediante la amenaza de redadas muestran que la prioridad de esta Administración es aterrorizar a comunidades y no resolver los problemas migratorios de nuestra nación”, consideró.
Bauer indicó que “con la reciente aprobación de fondos adicionales para esas agencias (migratorias) sin salvaguardas adicionales, el Congreso también asume ahora la responsabilidad de estas tácticas continuas”.
“Estas agencias, que están maltratando intencionadamente a hombres, mujeres y menores y separando a familias, se han envalentonado por las acciones de los legisladores”, lamentó.
El presidente estadounidense, Donald Trump, confirmó este viernes que su Gobierno iniciará el domingo redadas masivas en unas 10 ciudades para deportar a “miles” de indocumentados.
En declaraciones a los periodistas en la Casa Blanca, Trump respondió afirmativamente cuando le preguntaron si es cierto que el Servicio de Inmigración y Aduanas (ICE, en inglés) empezará sus redadas este domingo, como adelantaron el jueves varios medios de comunicación.
La operación se centrará en las ciudades de Nueva York, Miami (Florida), Houston (Texas), Los Ángeles y San Francisco (California), Chicago (Illinois), Atlanta (Georgia), Baltimore (Maryland) y Denver (Colorado), de acuerdo con fuentes oficiales citadas por la cadena de televisión CNN.
Estaba previsto que también hubiera redadas en Nueva Orleans (Luisiana), pero el ICE comunicó a las autoridades de la ciudad que suspenderá temporalmente la operación debido a la tormenta tropical Barry, transformada ya en huracán.
Según funcionarios consultados por el diario The New York Times, ICE buscará primero a unos 2,000 inmigrantes que ya han recibido órdenes de deportación y que, en algunos casos, no se presentaron a las audiencias en los tribunales de inmigración.
En las últimas horas, grupos y ciudadanos opuestos a las redadas, han realizado manifestaciones en contra de Trump y sus políticas en estados como California, Washington, Utah, entre otros.

Starbucks Plans to Stop Selling Print Newspapers

Texto completo: It's the quintessential Starbucks experience: Walk in, order a piping hot cup of coffee and sit back with a newspaper.
Or, at least, that's how it used to be in an earlier era. Now, starting in September, you won't be able to buy any newspapers at the coffee giant's shops.
The company said this week that it would stop carrying print editions of The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, USA Today and local newspapers at its 8,600 locations across the country.
Starbucks did not give a reason for the change, but said it would also remove shelving fixtures that display whole-bean coffee and grab-and-go snacks.
"We are always looking at what we offer our customers in our stores and making adjustments to our portfolio based on changing customer behavior," Sanja Gould, a company spokeswoman, said in a statement Friday.
Starbucks expects the changes to be completed by the end of September.
Jordan Cohen, a spokesman for The Times, said in a statement, "Although disappointed by the decision, we're confident that given our wide retail distribution, readers will have no trouble finding The New York Times for sale at nearby outlets."
The newspaper had an exclusive arrangement for many years with Starbucks, but the chain began selling other papers in 2010.
The Journal was discussing other ways Starbucks customers could gain access to the publication, said Colleen Schwartz, a spokeswoman for Dow Jones, a sister company of The Journal.
It was unclear if sales had anything to do with Starbucks's decision.
Print circulation has declined across the country, according to data published in July by the Pew Research Center.
The organization estimated that in 2018, total daily newspaper circulation in the United States, which includes both digital and print platforms, was 28.6 million for weekdays and 30.8 million for Sundays. Those figures were down 8 percent and 9 percent from the previous year.
The Times's average print circulation in 2018 was about 487,000 on weekdays and 992,000 on Sundays, Mr. Cohen said. The Journal's average circulation is just over one million, Ms. Schwartz said.
Coffee and macchiato drinkers at Starbucks shops in Manhattan had mixed reactions to the news.
"I think it should still be available," Dustin Fitzharris said on Friday while sitting at the 15th Street and Seventh Avenue location. He suggested that perhaps some Starbucks customers want their news the old-fashioned way.
"Not everybody is on their computers," Mr. Fitzharris said. "Especially for a certain age demographic. An older demographic may not come in with their iPad or their computer. They will come in with a book or want to read the paper."
At the same location, David Perozzi said Starbucks made a good decision.
"I think it makes total sense; it's not a surprise," he said. "I don't think there is any upside to keeping the paper. If you look around in this Starbucks, there's no one buying a newspaper. It's just another casualty of change. Another casualty of the internet."
At least two customers said they had never seen newspapers at Starbucks.
"I'm in Starbucks every day in New Jersey and New York and I don't feel like I see a lot of newspapers on display," said Lisa Kelly, who was waiting for someone at the Eighth Avenue and 39th Street location.
She said that she usually goes to Starbucks once a day, sometimes twice, and that she would be inclined to read a newspaper if one were around.
"I've never seen them selling them," Jeff Grubb said at the same location. "Honestly, never. I've been to many Starbucks in my life. I think they should sell them. The Washington Post, The New York Times, they should be here."
"I think it would be smart of Starbucks to offer things to read," Mr. Grubb said. Starbucks, in his opinion, needs to up its "game" or it'll be "extinguished soon."
"They're like McDonald's now, it's kind of a thing of the past," he said.

Dozens of Venezuelan women die as smuggler boats sink

Texto completo: CHAGUARAMAS, Trinidad and Tobago - She slipped out of the house around dusk, without telling her mother. Sixteen and hungry, she followed the men who had promised her work and food.
Instead, they smuggled her out of Venezuela by sea, secretly planning to force her into a Trinidad brothel.
Put in a fishing boat, the girl, Yoskeili Zurita, said she sped away with dozens of other women, including her cousin. But the overloaded skiff took on water fast and capsized with the roll of a sudden swell.
Screams pealed across the water. Women cried out the names of children they had left behind. In the darkness, someone prayed.
"My cousin didn't know how to swim. She looked at me and said, 'I can't do this,'" said Yoskeili, who spent two days clinging to the overturned hull in the strait between Trinidad and Venezuela before fishermen found her. She never saw her cousin again.
The boat sank with 38 passengers in late April, most of them women. Only nine people survived, among them Yoskeili and other women who authorities now say were victims of a human smuggling ring.
The tragedy was shocking even in Venezuela, a nation accustomed to the ravages of a collapsing state, hunger, hyperinflation and rampant crime. For millions, survival means leaving, whatever the risk may be.
In the last four years alone, about 4 million people have abandoned the country, the United Nations estimates. They leave on foot, crossing a treacherous pass in the Andes Mountains. They sell their hair in plazas in border towns, huddle in refugee tents in Brazil and Colombia.
And they head off in leaky boats short on gas or spare parts, and sometimes get lost at sea.
As the women in Yoskeili's boat fought to survive, their state was nowhere to be found. The government, crippled by corruption, mismanagement and U.S. sanctions on its oil industry, told relatives the day after the wreck that it lacked even the fuel to mount a rescue. A state helicopter arrived four days late to join a search that had been left mainly to local fishermen.
And Venezuela's national guard likely played a hand in the deaths: Venezuelan prosecutors have charged two soldiers for being part of a criminal group that tried to smuggle the women to Trinidad.
Then in May, while the country was still coming to terms with the disaster, the tragedy repeated itself: Another smuggling boat sank into the waves with 33 passengers aboard, including at least three minors. Only the captain survived, disappearing before police could question him.
"How can this be allowed to happen again?" said Salvador Diaz, whose daughter had been on the boat with Yoskeili, hoping to reach Trinidad, when it sank.
Yoskeili now passes days alone in her room, at times wondering why she survived when so many other women drowned at sea.
One of them, Carmen Lares, a single mother, first lost her job this year, then lost her 3-month-old baby to malnutrition at the start of April as food ran short. Now she is gone as well.
Yoskeili replays the night over and over in her mind, remembering the crash of the waves against the hull, the women who could not swim and took off their clothes in the frantic hope that it would help them stay afloat, and the promises of the men taking her to Trinidad.
"They said when we got there, there would be plenty to eat," she said.

Texto completo: Jim Bouton, the irreverent Yankee who died at 80 Wednesday after a long battle with cerebral amyloid angiopathy, was a man of many layers. Criticized and ostracized by many of his former teammates after penning his seminal 1970 tell-all baseball book "Ball Four," he was also a tireless crusader for ballplayers' rights, an amateur painter, a political activist who joined a group of 65 (mostly African American) athletes voicing support of a boycott of the 1964 Olympic games in Mexico City, and a savvy business entrepreneur who invented and patented "Big League Chew," a gum alternative to chewing tobacco. Most of all, however, Bouton was a hopeless baseball romantic who could never quite let go of his dream to keep pitching in the big leagues, and, in later life, embarked on a mission to save historic 85-year old Wahconah Park in Pittsfield, Mass.
Born in Newark, N.J., Bouton spent most of his youth in Ridgewood. When he was about to start high school, his father had a job change and moved the family to Chicago. He later credited the move, going from a sleepy, small town in New Jersey to a highly-competitive 3,400 population big city high school with a field house and a stadium, as the best thing that could have happened to him insofar as his development into a big league pitcher. The right-handed Bouton signed with the Yankees as an amateur free agent in December 1958, and with an already-established blazing fastball and curve, moved quickly through their farm system before arriving in the majors as a 21-year old rookie in 1962. The following year, he was second behind Whitey Ford in victories for the Yankees, with a 21-7 record and 2.53 ERA, and was named to the American League All-Star team.
Flush with instant success, Bouton held out that winter for a $20,000 raise and quickly ran afoul of Yankee general manager Ralph Houk, who'd been his manager in '63. It was the first of many acrimonious contract negotiations Bouton had with the stern, old school "major" who'd been a combat hero in World War II and didn't cotton to his young pitcher's brash and irreverent nature. "Bouton and I didn't get along," Houk told me in a 2002 interview. "He was only for himself. He was the one guy I had who wasn't a team player. I realized that in '63 when he won the 21 games. There was a game in July when he had 17-18 wins and I took him out after he got in a jam with a three-run lead. We wound up losing the game and afterward he made a remark to a reporter that I didn't want him to win 20 games. He also said some bad things about Mickey (Mantle) in his book."
Nicknamed "The Bulldog" for his pugnacious manner on the mound - he'd throw so hard his cap often fell off his head - Bouton off the field regaled in the role of "class clown" in the Yankee clubhouse with his imitations of "Crazy Guggenheim," the popular character on the Jackie Gleason show at the time, and his pranks with fellow free spirit, Phil Linz. Bouton followed up his 21-win '63 season with an 18-13 mark in '64 and won two games against the Cardinals in the World Series.
Unfortunately for him, that proved to be the highlight of his baseball career. In '65 he developed a sore arm, going 4-15 with a 4.82 ERA, and never again regained the velocity in his fastball. He remained with the Yankees, pitching mostly out of the bullpen, until being traded to the expansion Seattle Pilots in August of 1969. His final record for barely 10 years in the majors was 62-63 with a 3.57 ERA.
It was while with the Pilots, Bouton decided to write a diary, modeled after a similar literary effort "The Long Season" by Cincinnati Reds reliever Jim Brosnan in 1960. Originally, Bouton had intended the diary to be a chronicle of his struggles to stay in the majors with an expansion team full of misfits by developing a knuckleball. But he couldn't help venturing back to his Yankee days with tales out of school about his teammates' boozing, pill popping and womanizing that shocked the baseball world and got him on the best-seller list along with a very public reprimand from Baseball Commissioner Bowie Kuhn. It was Kuhn, who probably had more to do with "Ball Four's" runaway success (more than 5.5 million sold in print) than anyone when he called Bouton up to his office in midseason 1970 and demanded that he apologize and recant some of the stories. When Bouton refused, he became a martyr in the public's eyes.
Much as Bouton later insisted "Ball Four" was really a tame book in comparison to some of the outrageous books written today, it was fair to say the Yankee management and his Yankee teammates did not appreciate tales of Mantle slamming the team bus window on kids seeking autographs and leading voyeurism missions with a telescope atop the Shoreham Hotel in Washington; or Yogi Berra hovering naked over the cold cut spread in the clubhouse, or the beloved and universally respected Elston Howard being depicted as a phony in one of the players' meetings. As punishment for his tome, Bouton became a pariah around Yankee Stadium, never invited back to Old-Timers' Day until 1998 after his son, Michael, wrote an impassioned letter in the New York Times pleading with Yankee owner George Steinbrenner to end his dad's ban.
But after coming back to the Stadium for the first time in '98 and receiving a huge ovation from the sellout Old-Timers' Day crowd, Bouton managed to antagonize Steinbrenner and the Yankee brass all over again a few years later by harshly criticizing the plan for the new Yankee Stadium that, in his view, was going to remove valuable parkland from a poor neighborhood. "I think former Yankees should not allow Steinbrenner to trash history," Bouton told the Daily News. "They should lie down in front of the bulldozers. I'd join them myself although I'm not sure the bulldozers would stop in my case."
Thirteen years after Bouton wrote "Ball Four," his first wife, Bobbie, in conjunction with the wife of Bouton's '69 Pilots teammate, Mike Marshall, wrote their own book detailing the infidelities of their two husbands. To his credit, Bouton acknowledged his failings as a husband and getting caught up in his own fame. "A lot of guys have been faithful to their wives in baseball. It didn't happen with me," he said. "But I don't think I can blame baseball. I don't think I became more egotistical at 38. I was egotistical in the third grade."
In the latter years of his life, Bouton endured tragedy and illness. On August 15, 1997, his daughter, Laurie, was killed in an accident on the Garden State Parkway when the car in back of her rear-ended her at over 60 miles per hour. Exactly five years later, August 15, 2012, Bouton suffered a stroke, robbing him of his ability to speak, read or write the way he used to. "The body knows, you know?" Bouton told Tyler Kepner of the New York Times. A few years later it was revealed he was suffering from dementia. In the few public appearances he made, his second wife, Paula Kurman Bouton, was at his side, helping him with his speech and his memory. She survives him as do his two sons from his first marriage, Michael and David.

Treatment of migrants is America's shame

Texto completo: On a subject as fraught as immigration, there's plenty of room for disagreement about border security, workplace enforcement, paths to citizenship and other policies. But when the topic is the well-being of kids crammed into federal immigration centers on the southern border, there ought to be no room for debate.
For young children, toddlers and infants guilty only of being carried or led into the United States, it's unconscionable for federal officials to banish them for days or weeks to squalor.
At the facility in Clint, Texas, according to a report by The New York Times and the El Paso Times (which is part of the USA TODAY Network), children have gone hungry and without hygiene, beds or adults to care for them. They've been buffeted by outbreaks of scabies, shingles and chickenpox.
Adult migrants, many fleeing Central American violence for asylum in the USA, are crammed for days or weeks in holding cells designed for a fraction of their number. The stench in standing-room-only conditions with temperatures in the 80s is a mix of unwashed bodies, untreated diarrhea and urine. That's according to the Department of Homeland Security's own internal watchdog.
For those watching, this is what a national disgrace looks like.
And how has President Donald Trump responded? With his characteristic deflection and denial. ("We're doing a fantastic job under the circumstances.") Border officials concede it's a crisis, albeit exaggerated by monitors and media, and they're simply overwhelmed by a 124% increase in migrants over the previous year.
Maybe so, but border officers warned superiors for months that detention conditions were crashing – to no avail. Only when the inhumanity was exposed in photographs, news accounts and rushed inspector general reports did officials suddenly begin finding alternative housing for some 2,000 confined children.
Trump declared an end to his family separation policy last year, falsely claiming it began under President Barack Obama. But strangely, inspectors still find young children held without parents. After a decade of not a single death, at least seven migrant children have died under federal care this year.
Thankfully, the number of children in custody has eased of late. Housing for adults has expanded with the use of tents, and $4.6billion in congressional funding will provide further relief.
For now, there's lasting damage – to the children. Many already traumatized by the violence they fled in their home countries risk severe mental health consequences after being separated from parents and subjected to squalor in U.S. immigration centers.
"Most kids will have lasting scars from what they have seen or are enduring," Harvard psychiatrist and bioethicist Wes Boyd, who has studied asylum seekers, told Axios.
Trump covets a place in history. With his administration's cruelty toward Central American migrants, he might well have earned it.

Texto completo: Maybe President Trump was right that we needed a "Salute to America" last week, because apparently some Americans have lost sight of the greatness of our country. Case in point: To mark Independence Day, The New York Times posted a video op-ed challenging what it called the "mythology" of American greatness. "America may once have been the greatest," the Times video declares, "but today, America, we're just OK."
The video is like a caricature of how conservatives think the left sees America — except it isn't a caricature; it's real. It's a straw man come to life. As evidence we're just OK, the video cites statistics showing that other developed countries, such as Luxembourg, Sweden and Norway, have lower poverty rates or better education and health care than America. And as for our "kick-ass democracy," the Times says, it's not that big a deal because "a lot of countries have freedoms."
The fact is, all the freedom those other countries enjoy would not be possible without the United States.
The reason that "a lot of countries have freedoms" today is because our Founding Fathers pioneered the principle of popular sovereignty, where governments answer to the people instead of the other way around. At the time of our founding, the world was ruled by monarchs. Our founders established the first country in history that was built on the idea of human liberty.
That dramatic explosion of freedom didn't just happen. It was the direct result of the rise of the United States as a global superpower. The U.S.-powered victory over Nazi tyranny in World War II and our triumph over Soviet tyranny in the Cold War defeated the hateful ideologies of fascism and communism, and unleashed a wave of freedom that has spread across the world. Today, 4.1 billion people live in democracies. (Of those who do not, four out of five live in China.)
Today, for all its flaws, America remains the freest, most innovative, most prosperous country in the history of the world. We invented the light bulb and the iPhone. We put a man on the moon and a rover on Mars. We are a nation of unparalleled military power and unlimited opportunity. There's a reason we have a crisis on our southern border; millions want to come here so that they can share in American prosperity.
Maybe Luxembourg scores better on some measures, but no one is counting on Luxembourg to secure the peace of the world. Without us, the world would be mired in the darkness of totalitarianism.
That is better than "just OK."

Texto completo: With U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement expected to conduct a nation-wide roundup of illegal immigrant families to deport them as soon as possible, some outspoken Democrats in Congress are issuing warnings to them through social media.
The New York Times reported the 2,000 that are being targeted have been ordered to be deported, some of them because they failed to appear in court, but continue to remain in the country illegally.
In tweets sent by New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar, they said they want to make sure people know their rights if ICE agents appear at their homes this Sunday.
Tweet
"Every person, including undocumented Americans, has rights if they are approached by ICE," Omar tweeted, adding, "These raids will dehumanize immigrants and tear families apart. This will not make our country any stronger. It will only traumatize children, destroy lives, and make our country less safe."
TweetTweet
The deportations were planned to take place earlier, but were pushed back as some appeared to have disagreements with the execution of the plan. Senior administration officials blamed acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan for leaking the plan to the press.
“I know he has not approved of this operation for months,” one person familiar with those private conversations said. “The president wouldn’t leak that. ICE wouldn’t leak that. There’s only a few people involved in these discussions … The only one who could have shared the details of those operations were Kevin.”
McAleenan denied he was the source of the leaks.Story URL

5 claves sobre las grandes redadas confirmadas por ICE

Texto completo: Altos funcionarios del Departamento de Seguridad Nacional (DHS) confirmaron que, a partir del domingo, agentes de Inmigración y Control de Aduanas ( ICE ) realizará redadas en 10 grandes ciudades.
El anuncio fue revelado a The New York Times, aunque Univision también informó de las movilizaciones con fuentes que hablaron bajo la condición del anonimato.
Activistas y defensores sugieren a todos los inmigrantes indocumentados mantenerse alerta ante los operativos, sobre los cuales se conoce:
1. Inicio.- El presidente Donald Trump afirmó que después del 4 de julio comenzarían las readas, las cuales son confirmadas para iniciar el 14 de julio . Cabe recordar que ICE no concreta sus operativos en un día, sino que hace movilizaciones en distintos días.
2. Objetivos.- “La Migra” estaría dirigida a extranjeros con órdenes finales de deportación que no acudieron a su audiencia en la Corte , por lo que un juez entregó su orden de expulsión “en ausencia”. Abogados y activistas señalan que estas personas, aunque sean detenidas, todavía podrían defenderse, pero deberán consultar su caso con un abogado. Cada que realiza operativos, ICE se enfoca a ciertas personas, pero puede detener a “cualquier sospechoso” de estar en el país como indocumentado, como lo ha informado en otras ocasiones.
3. La ciudades.- Los arrestos se planificaron originalmente en Atlanta , Baltimore , Chicago , Denver , Houston , Los Ángeles , Miami , Nueva Orleans , Nueva York y San Francisco , metrópolis donde se concentra el mayor número de inmigrantes legales e indocumentados. Diversos estudios señalan que las personas sin permiso de estancia en el país deciden vivir entre comunidades de inmigrantes legales como un factor de seguridad y pertenencia.
4.- El alcance.- La rama de Operaciones de Ejecución y Remoción (ERO) de ICE tiene una lista de objetivos inicial de 2,500 adultos y niños, pero el plan contempla la captura de hasta 10,000 migrantes , reportó The Washington Post. La gran mayoría de las familias, según reportes, han cruzado la frontera en los últimos 18 meses en busca de asilo y permanecen en el país, esperando una fecha de audiencia o desafiando las órdenes de deportación.
5.- Armar un plan.- Activistas y abogados sugieren a los inmigrantes en riesgo de deportación armar un plan de acción que contemple como mínimo : ayuda legal , cómo pagar una fianza y con quien dejar a sus hijos , en caso de tenerlos.

Texto completo: What's on TV
ROBIN HOOD (2018) 5:30 p.m. on HBO. Before playing Elton John in "Rocketman," Taron Egerton portrayed a version of Robin Hood who does things like fire a bow and arrow while airborne in this very contemporary, post-"Game of Thrones" reimagining of the classic tale, which sends its hero to fight in the Crusades before bringing him back to England for thievery. Jamie Foxx plays this version's Little John. Directed by Otto Bathurst from a script by Ben Chandler and David James Kelly, the film adds special effects and modern flair to the old tale -- but it was both a commercial and critical flop. The movie "huffs and puffs right off the bat, expending a lot of energy to tell you this isn't your father's, or your grandfather's, Robin Hood movie," A.O. Scott wrote in his review for The New York Times. "The plot is twisty in a perfunctory way, the action predictably explosive, the sought-after exhilaration nonexistent," he added.
GLADIATOR (2000) 8 p.m. on AMC. For intense sword-swinging that did better with audiences than "Robin Hood" did, revisit Ridley Scott's take on big-budget Hollywood historical drama. Russell Crowe plays the hero, Maximus, a Roman general who gets betrayed, is sold into slavery, and then ends up fighting for his freedom as a gladiator in the Roman Colosseum. While the movie was a huge commercial success and won several Academy Awards (including for best picture and best actor for Crowe), some critics were unenthusiastic. In his review for The Times, Elvis Mitchell wrote that "with each scene composed for an audience's delectation of the constant slaughter, the movie is both pandering and detached." He noted that it's "like a handsomely designed weapon: you can't take your eyes off it even though you may be repelled by its purpose." He also wrote that the movie is shot "as if it were a Chanel commercial."
What's Streaming
BEN IS BACK (2018) Stream on Hulu; Rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. In an interview with The Times last year, the actor Lucas Hedges answered a question about why he initially resisted taking the title role in this drama: "My dad giving me notes seemed just as uncomfortable as us talking about sex," he said. Hedges plays a son and brother here, in a film written and directed by his father, Peter Hedges. The story picks up with Ben returning from rehab to his suburban hometown. The movie's emotional core is the relationship between Ben and his mother, Holly (Julia Roberts), for whom supporting Ben without alienating the rest of the family is a momentous challenge.
PRISON SONG (2001) Stream on Vudu. For another famous pairing, see this second feature from the writer-director Darnell Martin, which casts Mary J. Blige and the rapper-producer Q-Tip as a mother and son (though Justin Spaulding plays a young version of the son in some scenes). The plot revolves around Q-Tip's character, a gifted but troubled young artist.

Utah’s Republican and Democratic leaders say they want assurances residents’ driver license data isn’t being misused

Texto completo: Republican and Democratic leaders from Utah’s Legislature on Tuesday said they will “closely monitor” reports that the state gave federal immigration officials access to driver license records and will take action if need be.
In a joint statement, the lawmakers simultaneously affirmed the importance of personal privacy and expressed confidence in the Utah Department of Public Safety, which maintains the driver information.
"We are eager to learn more of their efforts to ensure personal data of Utahns, including the use of driver's license information for facial recognition searches, are protected from misuse by any agency," Senate President Stuart Adams, House Speaker Brad Wilson, Senate Minority Leader Karen Mayne and House Minority Leader Brian King said in the prepared remarks. "While their work is important, equally important is the privacy of Utahns."
Utah’s public safety officials on Monday said they do not allow immigration officials or law enforcement agencies to use facial recognition software to trawl through state driver databases on open-ended fishing expeditions.
The Washington Post and The New York Times reported over the weekend that documents show Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the FBI mined driver license databases in several states — including Utah — using facial recognition technology, analyzing millions of motorists’ photos without their knowledge.
A Utah public safety spokeswoman said the agency does conduct limited facial recognition searches of its driver photo database — both of citizens and noncitizens — at the request of outside agencies including ICE for suspected criminals, one case at a time.
In their statement, legislative leaders said any search of state driving records should be “authorized by law, done in a careful and limited manner, and effectively balance privacy concerns with law enforcement and public safety needs.”
They also said they have asked the Government Operations Interim Committee to hold meetings if necessary.

Epstein's indictment should push Acosta out; Sun Sentinel Editorial

Texto completo: U.S. Labor Secretary Alex Acosta should quit or be forced out for having coddled a sex trafficker.
Monday's indictment of Jeffrey Epstein by a federal grand jury in Manhattan stands as a rebuke of the plea deal given this sexual predator 11 years ago when Acosta was U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida.
For several reasons, Epstein finally may face true justice, rather than the sweet deal he got from Acosta, with the help of then-Palm Beach County State Attorney Barry Krischer.
Reason One is the Miami Herald's series last November called "Perversion of Justice." Reporter Julie Brown revived interest in Epstein's case. The series detailed how Epstein lured underage girls - some in junior high school, some still in braces - to his Palm Beach home and sexually abused them.
It took courage for these young women to finally go public. It wouldn't have happened without a dogged reporter encouraging them to do so. "We were assisted" by "some excellent investigative journalism," Manhattan U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman said at a Monday morning press conference.
The Herald also revealed how Epstein's legal team quietly worked with Acosta to turn what could have been a life sentence in federal prison into just 13 months in the Palm Beach County Jail. Even then, Epstein got to spend 12 hours a day at an office, six days a week, under the terms of his work-release privileges.
Those lawyers included former Whitewater special prosecutor Kenneth Starr, Harvard Law School professor Alan Dershowitz and Jay Lefkowitz, who has represented President Trump and is a former colleague of Acosta's in private practice.
Reason Two is Geoffrey Berman, the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York. Berman was a federal prosecutor in the 1990s and earlier worked for the Iran-Contra special prosecutor. Like so many others, Berman could have passed on Epstein. He did the opposite.
The indictment charges Epstein with sex trafficking and sex-trafficking conspiracy. It alleges abuses at his Palm Beach home and at his $56 million townhouse on Manhattan's Upper East Side. As the billionaire money manager arrived from Paris on Saturday, federal agents were using a crowbar to carry out a search warrant of that townhouse. The New York Times reported they had seized "possibly thousands" of "sexually suggestive" photos of underage girls.
"The alleged behavior shocks the conscience," Berman said.
Epstein didn't just recruit the girls and then pay them, the indictment states. He told the girls to recruit other girls. He "created a vast network of underage victims for him to sexually exploit in locations including New York and Palm Beach."
The scope of Epstein's perversion may turn out to be staggering. The Herald cited dozens more victims than were listed during the first investigation. Berman asked any others also to come forward. "They deserve their day in court, and we are proud to stand up for them by bringing this indictment."
Acosta showed no such allegiance to the first group of victims. In February, a federal judge ruled that Acosta had violated the Crime Victims Rights Act by not telling the young women about the ludicrously light plea deal he had signed. However, U.S. District Judge Kenneth Marra's ruling let Epstein's slap on the wrist stand.
Thankfully, Berman says the deal doesn't apply to his office. "That agreement, by its terms, binds only the Southern District of Florida."
Intriguing questions remain. Will Epstein's alleged recruiters - whom the indictment calls "Employee-1," "Employee-2" and "Employee-3" - also face charges? The indictment notes that when Epstein traveled to Palm Beach on his jet, "an associate or employee would ensure that minor victims were available for encounters upon his arrival in Florida."
Also, Berman's public corruption unit has this case, even though it's about sex trafficking. Legal analysts said that assignment could allow for a wider range of charges against Epstein, such as money laundering. It also could mean charges against current and/or former government officials.
There's no telling how far this could reach if everything comes out. Epstein's circle includes Bill Clinton - a frequent passenger on Epstein's jet - Trump and Prince Andrew. Epstein owns homes in the U.S. Virgin Islands and New Mexico, in addition to those in Palm Beach and New York. Every investigation has shown that Epstein constantly needed new supplies of victims.
We hope all of it comes out, no matter who was involved. Though consequences are long overdue, it can't start without Reason Three - a new attitude from the Trump administration.
On Monday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called for Acosta's resignation. So did Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer. But they're Democrats. On Tuesday, Acosta was unrepentant, tweeting his pleasure with the U.S. attorney in New York pursuing the case "based on new evidence."
If Acosta won't go on his own, Trump or other Republicans should pressure him to leave or the president should fire him. Since the labor secretary helps to monitor sex trafficking, the Epstein agreement undermines Acosta's credibility, and thus, the department's.
Epstein could get 45 years in prison. It may take a long time - if it happens at all - for everyone in the Epstein conspiracy to face punishment.
For Alex Acosta, however, it can happen now. He should go.

THE U.S. GETS A MID-YEAR CHECKUP THE U.S. EXCELS IN SOME AREAS, FALLS FAR BEHIND IN OTHERS

Texto completo: It makes sense to look at how the nation is doing at mid-year, just as a team's performance in Major League Baseball is assessed at the July All-Star break.
In one sense - the economic one - the U.S. is doing fairly well. June's job creation rate was impressive and unemployment remains low. Wages edged up, although America's major problem of economic inequality has not been touched. A tiny elite still possesses a disproportionate share of the nation's wealth, with poverty hitting a large percentage of children, to our shame. The stock market, largely reflecting the well-being of the rich and entitled, remains buoyant. Long-term prospects challenge the financial wizards to predict, although the general consensus is continued prosperity.
Our trade relations with partners remain somewhat dismal, even with neighbors Canada and Mexico, for no good reason. Scrapping with them cuts counter to the advantages to be reaped by robust North American trade. Instead we are hobbled by President Donald J. Trump's jealousy of the young and popular prime minister of Canada, Justin Trudeau, and his insistence on seeking to turn immigration from and through Mexico into a winning election issue.
He favors Brexit, the departure of the United Kingdom from the European Union, because he would rather see a weakened Europe than a continent of economically strong, democratic allies. He wants Great Britain to choose the clownish Boris Johnson as prime minister, a decision that would diminish the value of the U.K.'s wisdom on international problems, such as Iran, leaving Mr. Trump free to set the course.
His approach to Asia has been erratic. He seems comfortable with the leader of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Kim Jong Un, but he has yet to make any real progress on DPRK nuclear disarmament, the ostensible goal with Mr. Kim. This peculiar friendship gives Japan and South Korea, both longtime allies, a case of nerves. They have to live next door to Mr. Kim and his stockpile of weapons. Trade punishment of Asian giants India and China does not make sense, particularly to American consumers, who have to pick up the costs of Mr. Trump's measures.
Remaining on the foreign affairs side, the biggest botch so far has to be our relationship with Russia. It needed work under President Barack Obama - it always does - but Mr. Trump's effort to cozy up with Russia during his 2016 election campaign introduced a toxic element into the relationship. American national sensitivities have now reached a point where general improvement in U.S.-Russia relations is no longer possible, due to widespread suspicion and partisan anger. A "straight" relationship, free of charges of Russian meddling - past and future, political and commercial - in our affairs would have presented opportunities for cooperation. Areas might have included nuclear weapons restraints, Syria, Ukraine and Venezuela, as examples.
Relations with China - client, provider and rival - seem hopelessly confused. A greater American effort to understand it is sorely needed.
Political relations within the United States, among Americans, might not be notably worse now than they would normally be in the year before presidential elections, particularly with a president in office as conflictual as Mr. Trump. As an adult, I have seen 15 of them. This one still lacks a Democratic candidate and I remain gloomy on that party's ability to choose a consensus candidate who can win. The party's "debates" put me to sleep.
I like Elizabeth Warren's plan-filled approach to what she would do as president, although she reminds me of a scolding teacher. Joe Biden seems to me like a yesterday's politician. Bernie Sanders is too quixotic.
We may have needed Mr. Trump to reshuffle the deck, but one term is enough. There's a story making the rounds that he is thinking of dumping Mike Pence as vice president and running with daughter Ivanka in his place. I don't think even Mr. Trump is dumb enough to try that one on the American people, but it is necessary to make the argument why not.
This campaign promises to be fun to some degree.

Texto completo: CLINT, Texas — Since the Border Patrol opened its station in Clint, Tex., in 2013, it was a fixture in this West Texas farm town. Separated from the surrounding cotton fields and cattle pastures by a razor-wire fence, the station stood on the town's main road, near a feed store, the Good News Apostolic Church and La Indita Tortillería. Most people around Clint had little idea of what went on inside. Agents came and went in pickup trucks; buses pulled into the gates with the occasional load of children apprehended at the border, four miles south.
But inside the secretive site that is now on the front lines of the southwest border crisis, the men and women who work there were grappling with the stuff of nightmares.
Outbreaks of scabies, shingles and chickenpox were spreading among the hundreds of children who were being held in cramped cells, agents said. The stench of the children's dirty clothing was so strong it spread to the agents' own clothing — people in town would scrunch their noses when they left work. The children cried constantly. One girl seemed likely enough to try to kill herself that the agents made her sleep on a cot in front of them, so they could watch her as they were processing new arrivals.
"It gets to a point where you start to become a robot," said a veteran Border Patrol agent who has worked at the Clint station since it was built. He described following orders to take beds away from children to make more space in holding cells, part of a daily routine that he said had become "heartbreaking."
The little-known Border Patrol facility at Clint has suddenly become the public face of the chaos on America's southern border, after immigration lawyers began reporting on the children they saw — some of them as young as 5 months old — and the filthy, overcrowded conditions in which they were being held.
Border Patrol leaders, including Aaron Hull, the outspoken chief patrol agent of the agency's El Paso Sector, have disputed descriptions of degrading conditions inside Clint and other migrant detention sites around El Paso, claiming that their facilities were rigorously and humanely managed even after a spate of deaths of migrant children in federal custody.
But a review of the operations of the Clint station, near El Paso's eastern edge, shows that the agency's leadership knew for months that some children had no beds to sleep on, no way to clean themselves and sometimes went hungry. Its own agents had raised the alarm, and found themselves having to accommodate even more new arrivals.
The accounts of what happened at Clint and at nearby border facilities are based on dozens of interviews by The New York Times and The El Paso Times of current and former Border Patrol agents and supervisors; lawyers, lawmakers and aides who visited the facility; and an immigrant father whose children were held there. The review also included sworn statements from those who spent time at El Paso border facilities, inspection reports and accounts from neighbors in Clint.
The conditions at Clint represent a conundrum not just for local officials, but for Congress, where lawmakers spent weeks battling over the terms of a $4.6 billion humanitarian aid package for facilities at the border. The lack of federal investment, some argue, is why the sites have been so strained. But the reports of squalor prompted several Democratic lawmakers to vote against the final bill, which did not have oversight and enforcement provisions.
By all accounts, the Border Patrol's attempt to continue making room for new children at Clint even as it was unable to find space to send them to better-equipped facilities was a source of concern for many people who worked there.
"I can't tell you the number of times I would talk to agents and they would get teary-eyed," said one agent, a veteran of 13 years with Border Patrol who worked at Clint.
Mary E. González, a Democratic state lawmaker who toured the Clint station last week, said that Border Patrol agents told her they had repeatedly warned their
superiors about the overcrowded facility, but that federal officials had taken no action.
"They said, 'We were ringing the alarms, we were ringing the alarms, and nobody was listening to us' — agents told me that," Ms. González said. "I genuinely believe that the higher-ups made the Clint situation happen."
A forward operating base Architects designed the Clint station as a type of forward base — replete with fueling stations, garages for all-terrain vehicles and horse stables — from which agents could go on forays along the border.
The station was never intended to hold more than about a hundred adult men, and it was designed with the idea that migrants would be detained for only a few hours of processing before being transferred to other locations.
Officials have allowed reporters and members of Congress on controlled tours of Clint, but prohibited them from bringing phones or cameras inside, and from entering certain areas. But through interviews with dozens of people with knowledge of the station — including lawyers, former detainees and staff members — The Times was able to model the main areas where children were held: the station's central processing area, with its cinder-block cells; a converted loading area and yard; and a warehouse on the property.
Parts of the site resemble what might be seen at many government buildings. Photographs in the hallway celebrate the work of the Border Patrol, showing agents on horseback and in all-terrain vehicles. A conference room features high-backed chairs upholstered with faux leather.
But the sense of normalcy fades away the deeper one goes into the station. A detachment of Coast Guard personnel, sent to assist overworked agents, stock an ad hoc pantry with items like oatmeal and instant noodles. Monitors in blue shirts roam the station, hired through an outside contractor to supervise the detained children.
Beyond the pantry, a door leads to the site's processing center, equipped with about 10 cells. One day this month, about 20 girls were crowded into one cell, so packed that some were sprawled on the floor. Toddlers could be seen in some cells, cared for by older children.
One of the cells functioned as a quarantine unit or "flu cell" for children with contagious diseases; employees have at times worn medical masks and gloves to protect themselves.
A part of the processing area was set aside for detained children to make phone calls to family members. Many broke into tears upon hearing the voices of loved ones, episodes so common that some agents merely shrugged in response.
Clint is known for holding what agents call U.A.C.'s, or unaccompanied alien children — children who cross the border alone or with relatives who are not their parents.
Three agents who work at Clint said they had seen unaccompanied children as young as 3 enter the facility, and lawyers who recently inspected the site as part of a lawsuit on migrant children's rights said they saw children as young as 5 months old. An agent who has worked for Border Patrol for 13 years — and who, like others interviewed for this story, spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the situation — confirmed reports by immigration lawyers that agents have asked migrants who are teenagers to help care for the younger children.
"We have nine agents processing, two agents in charge of U.A.C. care and we have little ones that need their diapers changed, and we can't do that," the agent said. "We can't carry them or change diapers. We do ask the older juveniles, the 16-year-olds or 17-year-olds, to help us out with that."
As immigration flows change, the scene inside Clint has shifted as well. The number of children in the site is thought to have peaked at more than 700 around April and May, and stood at nearly 250 two weeks ago. In an attempt to relieve overcrowding, agents took all the children out of Clint but then moved more than 100 back into the station just days later.
Unaccompanied boys are kept in a converted loading area that holds about 50 people. Until a few weeks ago, older boys were kept in a tent encampment outside.
Families, including adult parents, were also sent to Clint earlier this year, and Representative Will Hurd, a Republican whose Texas district includes Clint, said that 11 adult males "apprehended that morning" were also being held at the site when he visited on June 29.
Before the influx of migrants began to wane in recent weeks, the agents said they had kept the families in a warehouse normally used to house ATVs. It was converted into two holding areas initially intended to house 50 people each.
A chief agent under fire At least two Border Patrol agents at Clint said they had expressed concern about the conditions in the station to their superiors months ago. Even before that, senior Homeland Security officials in Washington had significant concerns about the El Paso Sector's brash chief patrol agent and his oversight of the facility over the past year, when tighter security along other sections of the border prompted a steep rise in migrant crossings along the section that runs from New Mexico through West Texas.
The situation became so severe that in January, officials at Customs and Border Protection, the agency that oversees the Border Patrol, took the unusual move of ordering the sector chief, Mr. Hull, to come to headquarters in Washington for a face-to-face meeting. The officials were concerned that Mr. Hull, an agency veteran who speaks with a pronounced Texas twang, had moved too slowly to put safety measures in place after the deaths of migrant children, according to a Homeland Security official. After the meeting, Mr. Hull moved forward with the new procedures.
But tension has persisted between Mr. Hull and officials in Washington, particularly in recent months, as the number of migrants continued to increase at his facilities. The officials believe that Mr. Hull and Matthew Harris, the chief of the Clint station, have been slow to follow directives and communicate developments at the facilities
in their sector, according to two Homeland Security officials.
Mr. Hull is seen as a hard-liner on immigration issues. He has often been heard saying that migrants exaggerate the problems they face in their home countries.
Officials at the border agency declined multiple interview requests.
Last month, the acting head of C.B.P., John Sanders, ordered an internal investigation into the Clint facility. The investigation — which is being conducted by the agency's Office of Professional Responsibility and the department's inspector general — has examined allegations of misconduct.
As part of the review, investigators have conducted interviews and watched hours of video footage to see how agents treated detainees. So far, investigators have found little evidence to substantiate allegations of misconduct. But they have found that the facility is several times over capacity and has horrendous conditions.
The uproar over the site is drawing scrutiny on Border Patrol facilities that are some of the least-regulated migrant detention centers in the United States.
That is in part because they are intended in most cases to hold migrants for no more than 72 hours, before they are turned over to better-equipped facilities operated by other government agencies with stricter regulations on, say, the number of toilets and showers required. But the 72-hour limit has been frequently breached during the current migrant surge; some children have been housed at Clint for weeks on end.
Lawyers who visited the Clint station described children in filthy clothes, often lacking diapers and with no access to toothbrushes, toothpaste or soap, prompting people around the country to donate supplies that the Border Patrol turned away.
But Mr. Hull painted a far different picture of his need for supplies in April, when the numbers of children held in Clint were soaring. Mr. Hull told commissioners in Doña Ana County in Las Cruces, N.M., in April that his stations had more than enough supplies.
"Twenty years ago, we were lucky if we had juice and crackers for those in custody," Mr. Hull said, as quoted in the Las Cruces Sun-News. "Now, our stations are looking more like Walmarts — with diapers and baby formula and all kinds of things, like food and snacks, that we aren't resourced or staffed for and don't have the space to hold."
An inspector arrives One day in April, a man from Washington arrived unannounced around midday at the Clint station. He introduced himself as Henry Moak, and told the agents inside that he was there to inspect the site in his role as Customs and Border Protection's chief accountability officer.
The Clint station was far over capacity on the day of Mr. Moak's visit, bulging with 291 children. Mr. Moak found evidence of a lice infestation; children also told him about going hungry and being forced to sleep on the floors.
One girl, a 14-year-old from El Salvador, had been in custody for 14 days in Clint, including a nine-day stretch in a nearby hospital during which Border Patrol agents accompanied her and kept her under surveillance. Mr. Moak did not specify in his report why the girl had been rushed to the hospital. When the girl returned to Clint, another child had taken her bed so she had to sleep on the floor.
Two sisters from Honduras, one 11 and the other 7, told Mr. Moak that they had to sleep on benches in the facility's hold room, getting their own cot only when other children were transferred out. "The sisters told me they had not showered or brushed their teeth since arriving at Clint station," Mr. Moak said in his report. Showers had been offered twice during the girls' time in custody, but the girls were asleep each time, his review showed.
Mr. Moak in the end stated that Clint was in compliance with standards.
One of a team of lawyers who inspected the station in June, Warren Binford, director of the clinical law program at Willamette University in Oregon, said that in all her years of visiting detention and shelter facilities, she had never encountered conditions so bad — 351 children crammed into what she described as a prisonlike environment.
She looked at the roster, and was shocked to see more than 100 very young children listed. "My God, these are babies, I realized. They are keeping babies here," she recalled.
One teenage mother from El Salvador said Border Patrol agents at the border had taken her medicine for her infant son, who had a fever.
"Did they throw away anything else?" Ms. Binford said she had asked her.
"Everything," she replied. "They threw away my baby's diapers, formula, bottle, baby food and clothes. They threw away everything."
Once at Clint, she told Ms. Binford, the baby's fever came back and she begged the agents for more medicine. "Who told you to come to America with your baby, anyway?" one of the agents told her, according to the young woman's account to Ms. Binford.
Border Patrol agents have said they have adequate supplies at Clint for most of the migrants' needs. The facility lacks a kitchen, they said, so the ramen, granola bars, instant oatmeal and burritos that serve as most of the sustenance for migrants has been the best they could do.
Children sometimes could be seen crying, said one Border Patrol agent, who has worked for seven years at the Clint facility, but it most often seemed to be because they missed their parents. "It's never because they're mistreated; it's because they're homesick," she said.
A father finds his sons Not long after Mr. Moak signed off on the conditions inside Clint, a man named Ruben was desperately trying to find his sons, 11-year-old twins who both have epilepsy.
The boys had crossed the border together in early June with their adult sister. They were hoping to reunite with their parents who had come to the United States earlier from El Salvador in order to earn enough money to pay for the boys' epilepsy medications. They require daily injections and a strict regimen of care to prevent the seizures they began having at age 5.
But the twins were separated at the border from their sister and sent to Clint.
The first time they spoke to Ruben on the phone, the two boys sobbed intensely and asked when they would be able to see their parents again.
"We don't want to be here," they told him.
Ruben asked that his last name and the names of his sons be withheld for fear of retaliation by the American government.
Only later did Ruben learn that the boys had been given at least some of their epilepsy medication, and neither one had had a seizure. But one boy reported breaking out in a skin rash, his face and arms turning red and flaky. Both had come down with fevers and said they had been sent temporarily to the "flu cell."
"There is no one to take care of you there," one told his father.
It took 13 days after the boys were detained to speak to their father over the phone. A lawyer who had entered the facility, Clara Long of Human Rights Watch, met the boys, tracked down their parents, and helped them make a call. The boys were stoic and quiet, she said, and shook her hand as if "trying to act like little adults" — until they spoke to their father. Then, they could answer only with one- or two-word answers, Ms. Long said, and were wiping tears from their faces.
Much of the overcrowding appears to have been relieved at Clint, and overall arrivals at the border are slowing, as new policies make migrants, mainly from Central America, return to Mexico after they request asylum, as the summer heat deters travelers and as Mexico's crackdown on its southern border prevents many from entering.
A Border Patrol agent who has long worked in the El Paso area said agents had tried to make things as easy as possible for the children; some bought toys and sports equipment on their own to bring in. "Agents play board games and sports with them," he said.
But the Border Patrol long "took great pride" in quickly processing migrant families, and making sure children did not remain in their rudimentary stations for longer than 72 hours, the agent said. Clint, he said, "is not a place for kids."
In the surrounding town, many residents were puzzled and sad at the news of what was happening to children in the station on Alameda Avenue.
"I don't know what the hell happened, but they've diverted from their original mission," said Julián Molinar, 66, a retired postal deliveryman who lives in a house facing the station. He served in the Army in Europe as the Berlin Wall came down, he said, and was dismayed that there was now talk of building a border wall near his home. As for the Clint facility, he said, "children should not be held here."
Dora H. Aguirre, Clint's mayor, expressed sympathy for the agents, who are part of the community in Clint and neighboring El Paso. "They're just trying to do their job as a federal agency," she said. "They are trying to do the best they can."

Texto completo: Feder: Jim O’Shea is back with new vision to fix journalism’s broken model Jim O’Shea’s latest effort to breathe new life into public-service journalism combines a forward-looking news media technology startup with a 137-year-old weekly newspaper in Chicago’s Hyde Park neighborhood, Robert Feder writes.
For years the former managing editor of the Chicago Tribune has been in the forefront of finding ways to fix what he calls the "broken business model" of a news industry corroded by bean counters. His 2011 book, The Deal from Hell: How Moguls and Wall Street Plundered Great American Newspapers, was a vivid indictment of the greed and arrogance of predatory owners.
O’Shea’s last grand venture was the Chicago News Cooperative, a fatally flawed experiment (in partnership with The New York Times) that folded in 2012 after a little more than two years.
Now he’s gone back to the drawing board to create CityXones, a tech startup designed to help local journalism organizations find a sustainable business model. O’Shea’s partners are Bill Parker, who worked with him at the Tribune and the CNC, and Marisa Bryce, an entrepreneur and lawyer with experience in Silicon Valley.

COURTS GRAPPLE WITH AMAZON'S LIABILITY FOR DANGEROUS PRODUCTS

Texto completo: A tragic accident and a faulty rhinestone dog collar are at the center of a court drama that could have far-reaching effects on how products are sold online.
In 2015, Heather Oberdorf took her dog for a walk outside her Pennsylvania home, attaching a retractable leash to a collar she bought from Amazon seller The Furry Gang. The collar broke when her dog lunged, and the leash snapped back, permanently blinding her in one eye, according to the complaint she filed in 2016.
In the first significant decision of its kind, a Pennsylvania appeals court ruled lastweek that Amazon can be held liable for selling the defective product the same way a brick-and-mortar store would be, despite the company's claim that it is only serving as a platform to connect buyers to third-party companies like The Furry Gang.
The decision is a significant departure from the outcomes of other recent court battles. Within the past three months, two other federal courts have ruled the opposite: that, despite taking a cut ofthird-party sales, Amazon can't be held responsible for damage caused by the products sold in its third-party "marketplace."
State and federal courts have rejected lawsuits against Amazon over everything from deadly supplements to exploding hoverboards for the same reason. The decision in the dog-leash case could change that.
"This case has potential to open the courthouse and allow these cases to finally get before a jury and Amazon's business practices to be out in the open," said Brian Balser, the attorney for the family of 18-year-old Logan Stiner, who died after ingesting a fatal amount of pure caffeine a friend had bought from a marketplace seller. In February, a federal appeals court in Ohio ruled that Amazon couldn't be held liable for his death.
If you've ever shopped on Amazon.com or Walmart.com, there's a good chance you've bought something from their "marketplaces." More than half of the products purchased on Amazon are sold by independent stores through the internet giant's website.
Many customers shopping on Amazon don't realize when they're buying "marketplace" products. Amazon's third-party listings have a small "sold by" tag, and third-party listings on Walmart have a label that says "sold and shipped by." Both sites often list them under "other sellers" on a product page.
In Wednesday's decision, Judge Jane Richards Roth wrote that by serving as the only way customers and sellers could contact each other, Amazon's platform "enables third-party vendors to conceal themselves from the customer, leaving customers injured by defective products with no direct recourse to the third-party vendor."
It can be incredibly difficult to find out who owns stores on Amazon. Last year, a New York Times investigation found 141 Amazon sellers tied to an LLC using the same address in San Francisco. One of the stores listed its return address as the Palo Alto home of a family that had no ties to the companies and that could not understand why they kept getting Amazon returns delivered to their house.
Neither Amazon nor Oberdorf was able to find anyone connected with The Furry Gang, the Amazon store that sold the leash. An Amazon spokesperson declined to comment about the case.
Amazon's Teflon coating in marketplace sales cases has been a thorn in the side of many groups seeking more corporate responsibility.
"We're trying to get Amazon to work like a bartender," who can be held responsible for overserving people who later drive drunk, said Scott Steinford, CEO of Trust Transparency Center, a market research and consulting firm for the dietary supplement industry, which has conducted several investigations into products sold on Amazon.
A few weeks ago, a judge in Alameda County Superior Court ruled that As You Sow, an activist group that pushes for corporate social responsibility, couldn't sue Amazon over skin whitening creams containing high levels of mercury being sold on the platform without the warnings about cancer risk required by California law. One cream sold through Amazon contained 38,000 times the level of mercury allowed by the FDA, according to As You Sow's complaint.
The judge in that case agreed with Amazon that the federal Communications Decency Act, intended to protect online platforms from defamation claims based on internet comments and blog posts, meant Amazon was not responsible for warning labels. Last week's decision in Pennsylvania agreed with that understanding of the law but argued the company can still be held liable for damages caused by defective products.
While the Pennsylvania ruling is based on state laws, many other states, including California, use the same basic legal theory when deciding who counts as a seller, meaning the decision could have ramifications throughout the country.
"We need to decide, is this a store? I think the answer has to be yes. Amazon is our new store," said Danielle Fugere, president and general counsel of As You Sow. "We need laws that require a company like Amazon to undergo due diligence like a brick-and-mortar store would."
These questions will only become more important as more retailers, including Target, open their websites to third-party sellers.
"They take the position that it's the customer's responsibility to do due diligence on products in the marketplace. But if there's a problem with a product, it only comes out when it's used," Steinford said. "It may take a large number of bad reviews for it to be clear that a product is unsafe."
Amazon must now decide whether to appeal the Pennsylvania case. The court ruled 2-1 in favor of Oberdorf.
"We do not believe that Pennsylvania law shields a company from strict liability simply because it adheres to a business model that fails to prioritize consumer safety," Judge Roth wrote in the decision. "The dissent's reasoning would give an incentive to companies to design business models, like that of Amazon, that do nothing to protect consumers from defective products."

Texto completo: One of the seven money habits I often talk about is simply "Make a Plan for Your Money." It's so basic, but so many people don't do it on a regular basis.
Another way of saying this — and hang with me here — is you need to make a budget. I know what you're thinking. Budgeting is so boring! I get that. But, honestly, budgeting gets a bad rap.
I'm as much a free spirit as anyone, so I understand that the thought of sitting down and talking about bills and expenses might sound a little dull. I also understand how a budget might seem very restrictive. But here's a secret about budgeting: Creating a budget will actually give you freedom with your money. It gives you permission to spend! It's one of the amazing principles about money I discuss in my book, Love Your Life Not Theirs.
When you know where every dollar is going, you're prepared. You know what's coming in and what's going out.
When most people start budgeting, they feel like they got a raise. They suddenly "find" money they didn't realize was there. One great result of this is you'll be able to start spending without guilt. All your money is accounted for, so you don't have to worry whether or not your bank account will cover your purchase.
No matter what you've heard, I promise that making a budget isn't difficult. First, simply list your monthly household income before the month begins. Next, list all your monthly expenses.
This should include all your bills, like rent, utilities, basic clothing needs and food, as well as your groceries, eating out, shopping...everything!
Finally, subtract all your expenses from your income. If you've assigned every dollar a name, you should have zero. This is a simple zero-based budget.
When you're making your budget, I recommend using a free app called EveryDollar. It's the best budgeting app out there. It will help you create a plan for your money, while making it easy stay on top of your budget throughout the month.
Don't get discouraged if you mess up a few times. You might need three or four months to get your budget the way you want it. But once you have a plan in place, you'll be amazed at how much more in control you feel about your money. You'll experience more freedom, less anxiety, and a better all-around understanding of your financial situation.
Here's my challenge to you: If you're not living on a monthly budget, give it a try. I bet you'll see a big difference, and you'll never go back to a budget-less life again!

Texto completo: In January, California ended a decades-old legal doctrine that put numerous people behind bars for murders they did not commit.
Yet six months after the new state law—Senate Bill 1437—took effect, some prosecutors are trying to overturn it, resorting to scare tactics and false distortions.
We are the legislators who wrote and supported this critical reform, and we need to set the record straight about it.
SB 1437 passed the Legislature last year with bipartisan support and was signed into law by then-Gov. Jerry Brown. It reformed California’s outdated and unfair felony murder rule, which had allowed people who did not kill to nonetheless be charged, convicted, and sentenced as murderers.
The old felony murder doctrine allowed prosecutors to charge all accomplices to a crime with first degree murder. It did not matter if there was no intention to kill, if the death was accidental, or if the accomplice had no knowledge that someone else would kill. Everyone was just as responsible, as if they had planned and committed the murder themselves.
The California Supreme Court, in a 1983 ruling, termed the state’s felony murder rule “barbaric.” And yet it remained on the books, and people were unfairly sentenced to long prison terms under this law.
We studied this issue for over a year before passing Senate Concurrent Resolution 48 in 2017. That measure recognized “the need for statutory changes to more equitably sentence offenders in accordance with their involvement in a crime.”
Then in the following legislative session we introduced SB1437 to correct what we concluded was a grave and needless injustice.
As SB1437 moved through the legislative process, we made significant improvements to ensure it was fair and that our reform did not let people who are responsible for a murder off the hook.
Based on input from district attorneys and other public safety advocates, we amended SB1437 to ensure that a criminal was held accountable for murder if they:
* Are the actual killer.
* Aided, abetted, counseled, commanded, induced, solicited, requested, or assisted the actual killer with the intent to kill.
* Were a major participant in the underlying crime and acted with reckless indifference to life.
And so it’s been disappointing to see some of California’s district attorneys now working to block the law’s implementation. They remain intent on pursuing murder convictions for people not guilty of that crime, despite the fact that it’s not in the interest of public safety nor is it just.
Yet they have challenged SB1437 in court arguing it’s unconstitutional on the grounds that it’s allegedly inconsistent with two ballot initiatives California voters passed decades ago.
Before introducing SB1437, we spent over a year carefully reviewing past statutes, court decisions, and, yes, voter-approved ballot initiatives, to ensure that the provisions in SB1437 did not overstep our role.
SB1437 falls squarely within the Legislature’s broad authority to make policy.
Prosecutors have also challenged SB1437 in the press with mischaracterizations. The president of the Association of Deputy District Attorneys for Los Angeles County, for example, recently told The New York Times that under SB1437, “We’re literally talking about letting murderers go free.”
That’s a false claim designed to stoke fear.
Thankfully, many prosecutors have properly applied the law, and courts around the state have upheld the reform as constitutional. As a result, many deserving people have been able to go home—some after serving decades in prison for murders they did not commit.
It’s not just those newly freed and their families who have recognized the justice served in these cases. In San Luis Obispo County, after a judge found SB1437 constitutional, a reporter went to the parents of the victim.
They said that while they still endure the pain of their son’s death, it did not justify an unfair sentence: “It certainly wouldn’t bring closure to me to see him punished as if he were the murderer,” the parent of one murder victim was quoted as saying
SB1437 is a just and overdue reform. We’re confident that California’s courts will uphold it.

Democrats should listen to this Obama border official on the overcrowded illegal immigrant detention centers

Texto completo: Here’s a quote every Democrat in Congress needs to digest: “[W]hen you sit down and talk to a lot of these folks, being detained in the border patrol facility, it’s not exactly a deterrence compared to what they’ve faced."
That comes from Obama-era commissioner of Customs and Border Protection Gil Kerlikowske in an Axios report Monday about what’s driving the hundreds of thousands of Central Americans that have overwhelmed the border and are overcrowding detention centers for illegal immigrants. Gil KerlikowskeDemocrats and much of the national news media last week attempted to ignite public outrage at the Trump administration for the overcrowded facilities and strained resources that have nearly left Border Patrol agents paralyzed as they try to care for the hundreds of thousands of children pouring in to the country, many of them dirty, disease ridden, and in need of urgent care.
The New York Times on Saturday continued feeding the hysteria with a profile on one of the detention centers in Clint, Texas, the inside of which the paper described as “the stuff of nightmares.” There were outbreaks of scabies, chickenpox, and shingles, the thick stench of soiled clothing and “cramped cells” holding children as young as five months old.
Yes, it sucks. Anyone who has listened to the warnings from the departments of Homeland Security, Health and Human Services, and Defense has known this for the better part of a year.
Our system at the border, such that you could even call it a “system,” was never meant to function as a welfare complex for the world’s poor. Detention facilities were intended to house single male adults caught crossing the border without authorization, until they were processed and then sent back to wherever they came from, usually Mexico. Now things have changed as illegal immigrants game our asylum laws. It’s children, sometimes in groups of hundreds. And American taxpayers are now expected by Democrats to provide each and every one of them with food, clothing, toiletries, and showering facilities, not to mention medicine and legal services. And that’s all before the vast majority of them are inevitably turned loose in to the U.S. anyway.
As the former Obama CBP commissioner said, compared to where they came from — countries that have all but collapsed under violence, corruption, and poverty — the detention centers are a minor discomfort they’re willing to endure.
What, then, is the point of turning them into Comfort Suites? There is none. Democrats largely know that, even as they pretend now that the real problem isn't our own broken immigration system, but the size of the welcome mat for countless poor foreigners wanting in to the country.
Sprucing up detention facilities at the border does nothing to address the issue. It's a band-aid. Only changes to the laws that govern the system can do that.Story URLPhoto Caption:U.S. Customs and Border Protection chief Gil Kerlikowske walks through a U.S. Customs and Border Protection temporary holding facility where he addressed the media, Wednesday, Dec. 7, 2016, in Donna, Texas.

Underwhelming expansion

Texto completo: Raise a glass to the longest economic expansion in modern American history. A full decade has passed since the end of the last recession, in June 2009, and the economy continues to grow. As of last Monday, the current expansion surpassed the previous record for uninterrupted growth, set between 1991 and 2001.
But this time around, no one is accusing Americans of irrational exuberance: These good times don’t feel particularly good. Economic growth over the past decade has been slow and fragile, and most of the benefits have been claimed by a small minority of the population.
The sense of disappointment is more than a feeling. Through the first quarter of 2019, the nation’s gross domestic product had increased by 25 percent during the current expansion. Between 1991 and 2001, economic output expanded by 42 percent. Between 1982 and 1990, output increased 38 percent. And between 1961 and 1969, output grew by 52 percent.
The distribution of the gains is even less satisfying.
Truck drivers still earned, on average, slightly less in 2018 than in 2009, after adjusting for inflation. Executive compensation, by contrast, went up, up and away. Chief executives of companies in the S&P 500 stock index — a list that includes most of the nation’s largest corporations — made an average of $14.5 million in 2018, increasing by $5.2 million in the past decade, according to data compiled by the AFL-CIO.
The wealthy have also reaped most of the gains from rising stock prices.
The least affluent 70 percent of American households had less wealth at the end of 2018 than at the beginning of 2007, according to the Federal Reserve. The top 30 percent of households saw at least some increase, but the big gains were heavily concentrated at the very top, in the hands of a small proportion of extraordinarily wealthy families.
This inequality of prosperity has become a defining issue in the nation’s politics. President Donald Trump ran on the promise that he would restructure the economy to revive employment in mining and manufacturing. Democrats vying to run against the president in 2020 are offering their own prescriptions for economic revival — and speaking of the plight of American workers in language usually reserved for recessions.
That rhetoric contrasts with the slow but steady improvement in economic conditions over the past decade. The unemployment rate is bumping along at the lowest levels since the 1960s; wages have started to rise more quickly, particularly for low-wage workers.
But the fact that it took so long to get here is a big problem for many American families. While unemployment is low, the slow pace of the recovery means that the average rate of unemployment in a given month during the past decade was a full percentage point higher than during the 1991-2001 expansion and almost 2 points higher than between 1961 and 1969.
There is also reason to worry that America has squandered the opportunity for a more prosperous future. During periods of economic growth, governments can take advantage of swelling tax revenues to improve infrastructure, invest in education and fund research. Companies can plow profits into new products and markets. But over the past decade, both public and private sectors have largely refrained from investing. The government has handed out tax cuts while companies have handed out dividends and repurchased shares. In effect, they’ve chosen to distribute profits among already wealthy Americans rather than develop the intellectual capital and equipment that could increase growth in the decades ahead, as investments in public universities, highways, fundamental scientific research and satellite networks did in the past.
Another result of the Trump administration’s tax cut is that federal deficits, which usually shrink during periods of economic growth, are on the rise. That leaves less room for the government to respond to a downturn by cutting taxes or by increasing spending. And the Fed cannot easily ride to the rescue: It has kept rates low to extend this fragile expansion, leaving little room to cut rates.
The end of an expansion, like the death of a star, is visible only after it happens. It is possible the economy will continue to grow for years, giving policymakers a chance to do better; long-lived expansions have become increasingly common across the developed world. It’s also possible that the analysts predicting a recession next year — there are always analysts predicting a recession next year — will turn out to be right.
So enjoy this lackluster expansion while it lasts. What comes next may well be worse.

Texto completo: Headnote Special forces killed thousands, U.N. says
GENEVA - Venezuelan special forces have carried out thousands of extrajudicial killings in the past 18 months and then manipulated crime scenes to make it look as if the victims had been resisting arrest, the United Nations said last week in a report detailing wide-ranging government abuses targeting political opponents.
Special Action Forces described by witnesses as "death squads" killed 5,287 people in 2018 and another 1,569 by mid-May of this year, in what are officially termed by the Venezuelan government "Operations for the Liberation of the People," U.N. investigators reported. ,
Laying out a detailed description of a lawless system of oppression, the report says the actual number of deaths could be much higher. It cites accounts by independent groups who report more than 9,000 killings for "resistance to authority" over the same period.
"There are reasonable grounds to believe that many of these killings constitute extrajudicial executions committed by the security forces," the investigators said.
The report, which U.N. human rights chief Michelle Bachelet was to present to the Human Rights Council in Geneva on Friday, delivers a scathing critique of President Nicolas Maduro's embattled government and its handling of Venezuela's deepening political and economic crisis.
Since 2016, the report says, the government has pursued a strategy "aimed at neutralizing, repressing and criminalizing political opponents and people critical of the government."
Venezuela's Foreign Ministry rejected the findings Thursday, saying the report offered a "distorted vision" that ignored most of the information presented by the government to U.N. researchers.
"The analysis is not objective, nor impartial," the Foreign Ministry said in a statement, listing what it said were 60 errors. "The negative points are privileged in the extreme and the advances or measures adapted in the area of human rights are ignored or minimized."
The Special Action Forces, known locally by their Spanish acronym FAES, are nominally tasked with combating drug trafficking and crime, but U.N. human rights officials said they were concerned the government was using these and other security forces "as an instrument to instill fear in the population and to maintain social control."
Families of 20 young men who were killed in the past year described a pattern of violence in which the FAES units arrived in pickup trucks without license plates, dressed in black and with their faces covered by balaclavas.
They broke into houses, seized belongings and molested women, forcing some to strip naked. Then "they would separate young men from other family members before shooting them," the investigators reported.
In every case described to the investigators, attackers manipulated the crime scene. "They would plant arms and drugs and fire their weapons against the walls or in the air to suggest a confrontation and to show the victim had 'resisted authority,'" the report says.
The investigators said they had also documented the execution of six young men carried out during one of the house raids, the killings done as a reprisal for their participation in anti-government demonstrations.
Five special forces members were convicted of attempted murder and other offenses in 2018, and 388 others were under investigation for abuses, according to the report. But few victims, it says, have access to justice or any redress.
The report also describes routine abuse by security and intelligence services of people detained for political reasons. In most of the cases, men and women were subjected to one or more forms of torture, including electric shock, suffocation with plastic bags, water boarding, beating and sexual violence. Women were dragged by their hair and threatened with rape, the report says.

Texto completo: RAWALPORA, Kashmir -- Mohammad Ishaq Lone got a call from the Indian Army one February night, ordering him to meet soldiers at an outpost near his house in Kashmir. It was only after he was hauled off to a brightly lit room, bound and beaten that he discovered why.
A soldier began by punching him in the face, drawing blood, Mr. Lone said. Another smacked him with a metal rod and began demanding that he disclose the whereabouts of his brother, who had left home months earlier to join militants waging a campaign to separate Kashmir from Indian rule.
Mr. Lone, a pharmacist with two young children, begged them to stop, saying he did not know where his brother had gone. He recalled screaming for help before losing consciousness.
"The world around me was collapsing," he said.
As tensions with the Indian authorities in Kashmir have sharply increased, Kashmiris are calling for an international investigation into accounts of abuse and torture by the security forces.
According to a lengthy new report from Kashmiri activists, thousands of civilians have been summarily arrested and then abused in Kashmir, the center of a long and bitter territorial dispute between India and Pakistan.
Released in May by rights groups in Srinagar, the capital of the Indian-administered part of Kashmir, the report profiles 432 victims of torture in detention since 1990.
It includes accounts alleging that Indian security forces had hung Kashmiris by their wrists, shocked them, forced them to stare at high-voltage lamps and dunked them in water mixed with chili powder. Most were civilians accused of having information about militants, the report said, and 49 of them died during or after being tortured.
In interviews with The New York Times, more than two dozen Kashmiris, including 15 whose cases are included in the report, shared similar accounts. The Times reviewed hospital documents and spoke with victims' relatives to help verify their stories.
Though some forms of torture are explicitly illegal in India, the report found that security personnel got away with their actions in every case because of laws that give them broad impunity.
India has emphatically denied accusations of abuses in Kashmir. In an interview, Dilbag Singh, the director general of the police in the region, said the report was "generalizing things based on data that is fake or fuzzed."
In a written response, Lt. Col. Mohit Vaishnava, a spokesman for the Indian Army, said last month that allegations of abuse were "false and fabricated propaganda."
According to data he sent, the Indian Army was aware of 1,052 alleged human rights abuses between 1994 and May 31, 2019, in Jammu and Kashmir. Every case was investigated, the data showed, with 997 of them found by the army to be "false" or "baseless," and punishment meted out to 70 personnel in other cases.
Last year, the United Nations also raised grave human rights concerns in Kashmir, logging cases of torture, among other issues, while detainees were in the custody of Indian security forces from June 2016 to April 2018.
India's Ministry of External Affairs wrote in a statement that the United Nations' findings played down wrongdoing by Pakistan in spreading terror and were "fallacious, tendentious and motivated."
Accusations of abuses have intensified as the Indian government has hardened its crackdown against militants and protesters in recent years.
To disperse crowds of protesters, security forces have injured thousands of people with pellet-firing shotguns. Civilian deaths rose over 200 percent from 2013 through 2018, when at least 160 people were killed, including from interrogations, activists say. And this year is on track to become one of the deadliest, overall, in the last decade.
Parvez Imroz, the president of the Jammu and Kashmir Coalition of Civil Society, a group that co-authored the 550-page report on torture, said the scope of abuse was even larger than the United Nations had reported.
The accusations have come amid a wave of detentions in Kashmir. A briefing released on June 12 from Amnesty International found that in the last few years, Indian armed forces had detained many hundreds of civilians -- including journalists, activists and children -- without charge or trial. The arrests were made under the Jammu and Kashmir Public Safety Act, which activists say violates international human rights law.
"Fear is used as a weapon," Mr. Imroz said.
In an interview with The Times, Nazir Ahmad Sheikh, 61, a farmer who was featured in the report on torture, said soldiers accused him of being a militant and detained him in 1994. He said they crushed his legs with a heavy roller and then poured scalding hot water on them. The men then forced him to open the lid of a coal heater with his bare hands at an army camp in northern Kashmir, he said.
"The moment I touched it, some of my tortured and numb fingers fell to the ground," said Mr. Sheikh, who also lost both legs below the kneecap and was forced to beg for money to survive after the ordeal. "A torture chamber is like a dark well where you cry out loud and no one hears your voice."
Hundreds of Kashmiris have joined homegrown insurgency groups since 2016. And tensions reached a breaking point in February, when a suicide vehicle bombing struck a convoy of Indian paramilitary forces, killing at least 40 of them. It set off a tense military standoff between India and Pakistan, where a banned terrorist group, Jaish-e-Muhammad, claimed responsibility.
Over the last year, activists say, the hunt for separatists has intensified, pulling ordinary Kashmiris into the fold.
Feroz Ahmad Hajam said he was on the way to meet a friend in September when the police abducted him, locked him in an interrogation cell in southern Kashmir and burned his feet and shoulders with cigarettes.
When Mr. Hajam, 25, a laborer, said he had no affiliation with militants, an officer walked up behind him and cut his throat.
The police have denied his claim and accused him of attempting to kill himself.
"I feel the knife in my dreams, slitting my throat again and again," he said in an interview, writing his answers on a piece of paper because his vocal cords were so damaged that he can no longer speak.
"I want to talk just once," he wrote, tears rolling down his cheeks.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India, whose Bharatiya Janata Party won a resounding victory during national elections in May, has vowed to ease tensions in Kashmir.
But many worry that the government will further alienate locals by removing special protections that grant the population, which is majority Muslim, a certain degree of autonomy. Hostility toward the Indian security forces has only increased. Almost every day, life is disrupted by gun battles, bombings or street protests.
Mr. Lone, 39, who said he was tortured for more than two hours while being questioned by Indian soldiers in February, said peace was unlikely.
When Mr. Lone regained consciousness at the army camp in the village of Rawalpora, he said three soldiers standing on him stomped on his thighs, struck him with bamboo sticks and screamed at him to get up and walk. He could not manage even one step.
"It was as if someone was taking me to a butcher's shop to have me chopped into small pieces," he said.
Bloodied and exhausted, Mr. Lone passed out again. He woke up in a hospital bed surrounded by relatives, who had dragged him from the camp when the soldiers finished with him.
Several months later, Mr. Lone can barely stand for five minutes. He has trouble kneeling to pray. His brother, the militant, is still missing. He worries about his children, ages 8 and 12.
He said the cycle of violence showed no signs of letting up.
"Every morning is filled with fear," he said. "How do you expect justice from one wing of the state when the other is inflicting pain on you? It is hell."

Surfliner’s up! David Allen rides Amtrak to San Diego

Texto completo: Usually I go car-free on vacation. This time, I went car-free to vacation.
My wish was to go to San Diego for a long weekend to see my team, the St. Louis Cardinals, play the Padres. And rather than drive to San Diego, I decided to take the train.
The last time I went to San Diego, in 2015, I drove to Encinitas, parked long-term and took the Coaster train to San Diego for the experience, but also to save on hotel parking. Coaster is Metrolink under a different name.
That was a pleasant 50-minute ride. But it made me want to do something more ambitious.
This time I decided to take Amtrak from L.A. Union Station. And to get to Union Station, I took Metrolink.
In other words, I took the train to the train.
This involved a small amount of planning, as I had to find good Amtrak times with a Metrolink train in proximity. Then I booked a modestly priced Gaslamp Quarter hotel — one that wasn’t quite so modest after nearly 20% in taxes — near a trolley stop.
That Friday morning, I drove a few blocks to the Metrolink station in Claremont. But that was the extent of my driving.
As longtime readers know, I’m a fan of public transit and of Metrolink. I enjoy the mild challenge of working out the connections while doing my bit for the environment. Taking transit makes me feel more urban. Plus, riding provides time to read, always a plus.
I got to Union Station more than an hour before my Amtrak train would leave, but that seemed right as I didn’t know about check-in procedures.
With the Pacific Surfliner, it turns out, all you do is board, the same as Metrolink. So I relaxed in a leather chair in the Union Station waiting room until about 20 minutes before departure.
The train was filling up when I did board, and I had lost the chance for a window seat on the second deck. Rookie mistake. Still, the rows are only two seats, so I had a good view regardless.
And the comfort! Compared to airlines, the coach seats are about five inches wider and have about eight inches more legroom.
Which brings up another point: You board without going through a luggage scanner, emptying your pockets, removing your belt and shoes, or submitting to a patdown or nude photo via the body scanner.
You can leave your tray table down the whole trip and use the restroom whenever you like. Now this is a civilized way to travel.
At the first stop, in Fullerton, the passenger at the window seat next to me disembarked. What a break. I scooted over and had a westside window seat the rest of the trip.
After the industrial and business zones came a few patches of agriculture, with pickers working the fields, and the rustic charm of San Juan Capistrano’s Los Rios Street.
South of there, at Capistrano Beach, the surf was perhaps 100 feet away. People could be seen on that shallow stretch of sand walking or sunbathing with books.
After the San Clemente Pier, the train was farther inland, paralleling the 5 Freeway, until the ocean became visible and near again at Solano Beach down a small bluff.
Three hours after leaving Union Station, the Surfliner arrived at the last stop, San Diego’s Santa Fe Depot.
Built in 1915 in the Spanish Colonial Revival style, the depot has twin domes, lots of arches and a waiting room with wooden benches and a soaring ceiling. It’s not too different from Santa Fe’s 1918 depot in San Bernardino.
From the depot, a $5 daily transit pass got me around, as did hoofing it. I saw the Cardinals-Padres game that first night with a San Diego pal. The Cards lost 3-1.
I’m thankful I skipped the next night, when they lost 12-2. A simple loss can be borne stoically, but a humiliation is too much.
Saturday, my friend picked me up to go bowling. He dropped me off, at my request, at Liberty Public Market, a food hall at Point Loma. I cobbled together lunch from multiple vendors and then wondered how I might find my way back to San Diego proper.
But Google Maps did the trick: A short walk took me to a bus stop, and I made that and two further connections seamlessly, arriving in the Hillcrest neighborhood in 40 minutes.
From there it was one block to my destination, Bluestocking Books, a very good used bookstore. I picked up a collection of Red Smith sports columns, unable to resist the blurb on the back from the New York Times: “Red Smith was to sports what Homer was to war.”
Two blocks away was Record City, an equally good record store, from which I bought a Firesign Theatre boxed set.
Three blocks back and I was soon on a bus that dropped me near my hotel.
Incidentally, I had considered my $71 Amtrak round-trip something of a splurge, especially when Metrolink tickets brought the total to $89. But in San Diego, hotels like mine were charging $45 a night for parking. I was there two nights.
Did I come out a buck ahead?
The next morning, I returned to the Santa Fe Depot and took a seat on one of the worn benches. As I did when I boarded in Los Angeles, I kind of wished I’d dressed in a suit, tie and fedora, and maybe had my shoes polished at a shoeshine stand, all for the vintage effect.
An Amish family was among the waiting passengers. The two men wore beards, hats and slacks, the older man in a vest, and the women were in dresses and bonnets. Now that’s a vintage effect.
Learning from my rookie mistake, I stood in line on the shaded platform to get a window seat. That worked out pretty well.
Except a college-age kid soon took the seat in front of me, and reclined it as far as it would go. By this point, all the other window seats were taken.
Even with his lean, I had plenty of room. I read from “Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance” while enjoying free wi-fi, free electricity for my phone and the same scenes as before, only in reverse.
At Union Station, with an hour and 15 minutes before my Metrolink train home, I rolled my baggage down Alameda Street for lunch at Philippe, founded in 1908. It was an old-time way to end an old-time trip.

Why 'raising a Black son' is a de Blasio campaign theme

Texto completo: The first frame in the now-famous 33-second ad is taken up almost entirely by Dante de Blasio's giant Afro.
He was only 15 then, an unlikely star of his father's equally unlikely victory in the 2013 mayor's race in New York City.
Through Dante, his father, Bill de Blasio, was able to highlight his biracial family, offer a personal perspective on his policies on affordable housing and early childhood education and signal his intention to end the police practice, known as stop and frisk, that Dante said in the ad "unfairly targets" minorities.
Now, deep into his second and final term as mayor and in the midst of another long-shot candidacy, this time for president, de Blasio is once again leaning on his son for a boost.
Over the last week, de Blasio suggested on Twitter that his son, a champion debater, helped him prepare - jokingly, it appeared - to compete in the first Democratic debate.
During the debate in Miami, de Blasio again inserted his son into the conversation, taking time from a question about Supreme Court nominees to talk about the concerns he had about how Dante would handle potential interactions with the police.
"Something sets me apart from my colleagues, and that is for the last 21 years, I have been raising a Black son in America," the mayor said at the debate.
On Monday, Dante de Blasio, now a 21-year-old graduate of Yale University, published an op-ed in USA Today referencing his father's remarks.
"They kept stressing these possible consequences, worried that a 13-year-old wouldn't understand," he wrote. "I remember them awkwardly looking at each other, searching for the best way to convey the gravity of the situation, until I spoke up and said, You don't need to keep telling me. I know what can happen.'"
The piece was actually written a few years earlier, de Blasio said during a visit to Chicago on Monday, accompanied by his wife, Chirlane McCray, who is African American.
"Chirlane and I, as we talked about the discussion around the debate, we asked him if it was something he wanted to address as well," de Blasio said. "And he wanted to publish that piece because it's something he felt needed to be heard."
Dante de Blasio is still deciding what to do next, said a de Blasio campaign spokeswoman, but it's unclear how much he will be involved in the campaign going forward. No matter his role, it would be hard to imagine that he could reprise his 2013 part as a difference-maker in 2020.
"I remember seeing the ad in the press room of the campaign for the first time, and I knew the minute I saw it that it was going to be a big deal," said Mike Morey, then the communications director for Christine Quinn's mayoral campaign. "The Dante ad was unequivocally a major turning point in the mayor's race."
De Blasio will need all the help he can get. Although most political experts agreed that he did well during the debate, the mayor may have squandered the momentum after he was forced to apologize for quoting Che Guevara, the Cuban revolutionary, in Miami, offending the local anti-Fidel Castro Cuban community.
George Arzt, the press secretary for Mayor Ed Koch, said that de Blasio's son could help in "places like South Carolina and in places where there are large African-American populations."
But Arzt doesn't expect Dante de Blasio's involvement to be as much of a factor as it was during the first mayor's race because of the presence of Sens. Kamala Harris of California and Cory Booker of New Jersey, who are Black.
"Kamala and Cory Booker take all the steam out of this strategy," Arzt said. "Against Chris Quinn it worked well, Against this field, it won't work well."
De Blasio has always included his family in his electoral campaigns. When he was running for mayor, de Blasio, his wife and their daughter, Chiara de Blasio, had a dance they performed together called the "smack-down." And Chiara has publicly discussed how her struggles with depression led to marijuana and alcohol addiction.
McCray has been involved in de Blasio's 2020 efforts since its launch. She has traveled with him to Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina to campaign. On Monday, de Blasio and his wife were in Chicago to speak at the women's luncheon for the Rev. Jesse Jackson's Rainbow/PUSH coalition's international convention.
"Bill de Blasio has always campaigned as the de Blasio family because that's who he is," said Rebecca Katz, a former special adviser to de Blasio who is not involved in his presidential campaign. "He would not let a story be told about him without it being about his family."
In his op-ed, Dante de Blasio describes how he walked through the Tenderloin neighborhood in San Francisco as an 18-year-old, on the way to a more affluent area where he was staying.
He recalled how he couldn't get into the apartment, either misremembering or mistyping the pass-code.
As a police cruiser stopped in front of him, Dante de Blasio said he frantically and finally typed the code in correctly, this time hitting the pound key, fearful that the police officers would confront him.
"That fear I felt is not unique. That lecture I got from my father and cousins has been given to countless young Black people," Dante wrote. "We're taught to fear the people meant to protect us, because the absolute worst-case scenario has happened too many times. This reality cannot continue. We shouldn't need to feel that fear."

Texto completo: NORMAL, III. - By definition, the time of the world's richest man is pretty valuable. But early last fall, Jeff Bezos sought out a 36-year-old entrepreneur named R.J. Scaringe and spent the better part of a day in Plymouth, Michigan, at the company he founded, Rivian.
Bezos got a preview of Rivian's electric pickup truck and sport utility vehicle and liked what he saw. Not long after his visit, Amazon led a $700 million investment in Rivian. Two months later, in April, Ford Motor invested $500 million. All told, Rivian has raised $1.7 billion without selling a single truck or SUV.
If you have not heard of Rivian before, that was intentional. Until recently, it was in stealth mode, operating out of unmarked buildings and making few public announcements. But no longer. By the end of 2020, Rivian intends to begin producing premium electric vehicles, with a greater range than anything on the road today.
Rivian is promising to do for trucks what Tesla did for luxury cars.
That's where the similarities between the two electric automobile makers end. Even as Tesla and its brash chief executive, Elon Musk, made headlines by setting and falling short of some audacious goals, Scaringe and Rivian have spent a decade fine-tuning their designs.
Walking around a former Mitsubishi plant in Normal, Illinois, Scaringe points to where stamping presses will churn out car parts like fenders and doors. But he is hoping to do more than sell cars. Scaringe wants to dispel myths he thinks still surround electric vehicles.
"We have a number of untruths - a truck can't be electric, an electric car can't go off road, it can't get dirty, it can't tow and truck buyers don't want something that's environmentally friendly," he said. "These things are fundamentally wrong. Electrification and technology can create a truck that's incredibly capable and fun to drive."
In addition to developing advanced battery systems, Rivian has also designed a skateboard-like chassis that it plans to sell to other carmakers. For Ford, investing in Rivian is a way to leapfrog the competition and get new ideas from a startup as it and other automakers race to prepare for an electrified future.
Amazon has been mum about its interest in the company, but Rivian's vehicles could help the retail giant reduce its carbon footprint as it builds its own distribution network.
Scaringe is likely to need billions more to get as far as Tesla, which itself struggled to expand production in 2017 and 2018. But the demand for electric vehicles is there - Tesla built more than 250,000 cars in 2018.
Scaringe founded Mainstream Motors, the business that would later become Rivian, in 2009 after completing a doctorate in mechanical engineering at MIT.
Family and friends provided the initial funding, and Scaringe and his father both took out second mortgages to raise money. Rivian takes its name from Florida's Indian River, close to where Scaringe grew up in Melbourne, Florida.
Early backing from Saudi and Japanese investors provided the runway for Rivian to develop its electric vehicle designs.
Scaringe, an outdoorsy type who enjoys mountain biking, wants his cars to be able to go off road. Rivian trucks and SUVs can operate in 3 feet of standing water. A ballistic liner protects the battery pack so drivers can take the vehicle into rugged terrain without worrying that rocks and other objects could penetrate the undercarriage.
Rivian's R1S SUV bears a resemblance to a Range Rover, while the flatbed in its R1T pickup is shorter than the bestselling Ford F-150. "Rivian's products are not really meant to be work trucks," said Stephanie Brinley, principal automotive analyst with IHS. "They aim to be lifestyle products, capable but meant for recreational use."
The R1S will directly challenge Tesla's SUV, the Model X, and although Musk has said he will introduce a pickup, Tesla has yet to unveil one.
The R1S and the R1T will start at around $70,000 and cost more than $90,000 for fully loaded models that can travel up to 400 miles on a full charge. Rivian has received tens of thousands of reservations from buyers who have made deposits of $1,000 each.
"Targeting the premium pickup and SUV market in the U.S. was smart," said Sam Abuelsamid, principal auto analyst at Navigant Research. "Those are the kind of vehicles Americans want to buy, as opposed to a compact car or midsized sedan." Profit margins are higher, too, especially for luxury models.
Asked about Rivian's rivalry with Tesla, Scaringe would not disparage the competition. He credits Tesla for changing the perception of electric cars as "boring and slow, or glorified golf carts."
While Tesla has failed to reach its own lofty production targets in recent years, Scaringe is only promising about 20,000 to 40,000 vehicles in 2021, the first full year of production.

Megan McArdle: Dear Democrats: I'll vote for any of you. But please nominate someone who can actually win.

Texto completo: Dear Democrats:
Well, this is certainly an exciting time for America, isn't it? There was so much to celebrate on the Fourth of July. "Stranger Things" is streaming all-new episodes, the U.S. women's soccer team played in the World Cup final, and Häagen-Dazs recently launched a new line of booze-flavored ice cream.
However, a few things could be better. Starting with the belligerent, impulsive and vulgar bully who's sitting in the Oval Office. And the Democratic plans to evict him come November 2020.
On the Democratic debate stage last week, a number of candidates, including many of the front-runners, came out of the gate promising to abolish private health insurance, pursue immigration policies that sounded, as New York Times columnist David Brooks put it, like "operationally open borders" and... maybe bring back busing for school desegregation?
I admire their zeal, but to me this sounds less like a winning campaign platform than an electoral suicide pact.
There are certainly reasonable policy arguments for a government-run health care system and reasonable moral arguments for open borders. Both, however, are unpopular with voters. What I heard from that stage can't be easily resculpted into some moderate-friendly sound bite, and it is unlikely to be forgotten by anxious moderates. Yes, candidates customarily run toward the base in the primary, then tack back to the center for the general election. But the leading candidates have wandered so far out into left field that they'll need a high-speed, solar-powered monorail to make it back in time for 2020.
I'm not the first person to make these points; Brooks and his conservative Times colleague Bret Stephens have already made them more pungently, and at greater length. Both of them are begging Democrats to put up a candidate they can vote for, and it's safe to say that they speak for most of what remains of the #NeverTrump conservatives.
Their message was not well-received by many Democrats, who engaged in what appeared to be an extended exercise in what the libertarian writer Julian Sanchez has dubbed "epistemic closure": the systematic banishment of any source of information outside your ideological bubble.
This reaction is understandable, to an extent. In our partisan era, it's hard to believe that anyone from the other team could have your best interests at heart. And how can the #Resistance take seriously anyone who has lived through the early years of the Trump administration without already being committed to support whomever the Democrats put up? If you #NeverTrump folks want us to listen, they seemed to be saying, then first you'll need to show us that you're serious by promising to stay on our side.
To which I reply, "We have a deal." Oh, I can imagine circumstances under which I could not support the Democratic candidate — say, if Bernie Sanders started promising a robust program of nationalizing private industry. Short of that, as long as the alternative is Donald Trump, I will be rooting for any Democrat to win, including Sanders.
In return, I implore Democrats to listen to Brooks and Stephens. They may not be "the average American," but on health care and immigration, they are where the bulk of the voters are, and the current crop of Democratic candidates is not.
It may seem to you, dearest Democrats, that Trump is so awful, his poll numbers so abysmal, that all it will take to beat him is a candidate who can breathe and read from a teleprompter. If you'll recall, it also seemed that way in 2016.
So while I can understand why many believe this is the perfect moment to forget about moderate voters and really go for the progressive gusto, please reconsider. I'm not saying you have to do this to get my support, because you've already got it. You had me at "Not Donald Trump."
Now let's talk about the tens of millions of other voters we're going to need to win.
For all the talk about Trump's extremism, he picked up voters in swing states by bringing the party back toward the center on economic policy. Believe it or not, that's still where American national elections are won. Trump has, of course, failed to deliver on much in the way of centrist policy, giving us another Republican tax cut, instead. Good news! That leaves open the most fertile ground in American politics.
If you think that Trump is a grave danger to our country — and I do — then it's imperative that we figure out how to recapture that territory, and the voters who live there, rather than posing for each other on the moral high ground.
Yours in solidarity,
Megan

Texto completo: Our guide to cultural events in New York City for children and teenagers happening this weekend and in the week ahead.
COMMUNITY DAY at the Noguchi Museum (July 7, 11 a.m.-6 p.m.). Young artists often reinterpret or reinvent the styles of their creative ancestors. This Queens museum will invite children to do the same -- after they first discover how the Japanese-American sculptor Isamu Noguchi (1904-88) followed that path himself. During this Community Day, part of a free series taking place the first Sunday of every month through September, families can go on a self-guided scavenger hunt through the galleries and investigate the show "Changing and Unchanging Things: Noguchi and Hasegawa in Postwar Japan," which illustrates how the abstract art of Noguchi and his colleague Saburo Hasegawa (1906-57) reflects the traditions of Japanese calligraphy. Visitors ages 2 to 11 can use their observations in Open Studio: Brush and Ink With Taisan Tanaka, a drop-in program from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. Tanaka, a Japanese artist, will introduce the techniques of this ancient art, which young people can explore and transform in their own paintings.
718-204-7088, noguchi.org
CIRCUS AFLOAT!: 'PREPOSTEROUS!' at the Waterfront Museum and Showboat Barge (July 6, 2 and 7 p.m.). Pies in the face, balls in the air, whoopie cushions sounding off -- you can expect the usual comic effects in what Happenstance Theater describes on its website as a "pocket-size theatrical clown circus." But the five members of this company also do a few things you don't always see, like function as a human calliope, portray animals in the ring and create what its website calls "ridiculous entrees." Its show "Preposterous!" is part of the aptly named Circus Afloat! series, on board this historic Hudson Valley barge that has gained new life as a Brooklyn museum.
877-238-5596, waterfrontmuseum.org
'ELGIN PARK' at Wildrence (July 6, 1 and 7 p.m.; July 7, 2 and 5 p.m.; through July 14). Enter a blue door at 59 Canal Street, descend a flight of stairs, and you'll find yourself in a murky place that is probably unlike any you've ever visited. It is "Elgin Park," which most closely resembles the internet-famous town of the same name that Michael Paul Smith, a model maker, assembled from toy-size buildings and tiny cars. But this "Elgin Park" is much more: A meditation on magic and memory, it immerses young people in a 1950s mystery that stars a reimagined version of Smith himself. Created by Drew Petersen, Jae Lee and Yvonne Chang, the show leads an intimate group of 20 (reservations are required) through a warren of rooms and around a miniature set as the fictional Smith investigates the disappearance of his brother, Paul, a renowned magician who may have pulled off the ultimate vanishing act. The 70-minute production, which is geared toward theatergoers 10 and older, employs sleight of hand, audience participation and shifting chronology as it weaves a mesmerizing spell all its own.

SUMMER ART MONDAYS: WHIMSICAL STRINGED INSTRUMENT at the Jewish Museum (July 8, 1-4 p.m.). Auditory art has a long history of inspiring visual art, and vice versa. This drop-in program, part of a family series taking place every Monday in July, lets children engage in that symbiosis. (Online registration is recommended.) They will be encouraged to explore the museum's current shows, especially "Leonard Cohen: A Crack in Everything," which features Cohen's music and a variety of videos, photographs and other works that reflect his songs. Young visitors will then use materials including cardboard, long tubes, colored wire, rubber bands and rice to design and build their own stringed instruments and shakers.
866-205-1322, thejewishmuseum.org
[Read about the events that our other critics have chosen for the week ahead.]
'TEEN TITANS: RAVEN' at Barnes & Noble, Union Square (July 9, 7-9 p.m.). For writers, delving into the pasts of superheroes can be as enticing as envisioning their futures. Consider "Teen Titans: Raven," a new graphic novel from DC Ink, a young-adult publishing imprint of DC Comics. Written by Kami Garcia and illustrated by Gabriel Picolo, the book reimagines the origins of Raven, a.k.a. Rachel Roth. Here, she is a 17-year-old whose memory has been severely damaged as a result of injuries suffered in an accident that killed her foster mother. Garcia and Picolo will attend this free celebration -- admission is first come first served -- where they will sign books, answer questions and talk about Raven's journey toward self-discovery. The authors Meg Cabot ("The Princess Diaries") and Danielle Paige (the Dorothy Must Die series) will join them.
212-253-0810, stores.barnesandnoble.com/store/2675
'35 YEARS OF TMNT' at the Paley Center for Media (through July 14). Cowabunga, dudes! Many turtle species are long-lived, and the heroes of this animated television franchise help prove it. Nickelodeon, the network home of the current incarnation, "Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles," is celebrating the 35th anniversary of the cartoon characters with this exhibition, which traces the foursome's evolution from their comic-book origins through multiple TV series and feature films. In addition to the show's posters, products and visual timeline, young fans of Leonardo, Raphael, Michelangelo and Donatello can enjoy related craft activities and screenings each weekend. This Saturday and Sunday the center will present "Out of the Sewers," episodes in which the turtles pursue adventures that take them beyond New York City's underground pipeline.
212-621-6600, paleycenter.org
'TOMBOY' in Tompkins Square Park (July 5, 8:30 p.m.). This movie's plot may strike you as somewhat Shakespearean: The heroine pretends to be a boy for her own convenience, only to find herself attracting the affections of a popular girl. In this 2011 feature by Céline Sciamma, however, the principal characters aren't young women, but 10-year-olds. Led by Zoé Héran, who portrays the titular rebel, Laure -- she calls herself Mikael after her family makes a summer move to the suburbs -- the young actors give the story "messiness, joy and life," Manohla Dargis wrote in her review in The New York Times. Screening in French with English subtitles as part of Films on the Green, the Cultural Services of the French Embassy's free outdoor screening series (the rain date is Saturday), "Tomboy" explores both gender identity and the complicated consequences of deception.

Texto completo: This week's "Sounds of Summer goes outside the box and into the pod. We get Kate Mishkin to share some podcast selections for your summer listening.
nnn
Once burgeoning and kind of obscure, podcasts have sprouted into ubiquity. It's about time.
I could write at length about why podcasts are so great, and which episodes you should listen to, and why you should listen to me. Instead, I've chosen four different podcasts worth trying out this summer.
I'm not saying my list includes the newest and most cutting-edge, or that I know something you don't. But these are the ones I look out for every week because they're just so perfect.
A quick note: The Charleston Gazette-Mail has a podcast, which I produce. It's called "Mountain State Morning, and we've been at it for about a year. You should listen to that, too.
Modern Love'
A product of WBUR, Boston's NPR station, Modern Love is a masterpiece that too few people are talking about.
Here's the premise: They match essays published in the New York Times' Modern Love column with an actor who reads the essay.
At the end, the actor, and the essay's author, talk about their feelings about the piece. The stories are sometimes somber, sometimes hilarious, but always artfully written and read. Episodes are short (20 minutes) and perfect for a summer evening on the porch.
Episode suggestion: "Part I: You May Want to Marry My Husband
The Daily'
This is not a hot take, and it's already pretty popular.
If you're not yet a regular listener, The Daily delivers the news in a way that sticks and forces you to think critically about it for the rest of the day, until the next great episode comes out tomorrow.
Bonus points if you listen until the credits to hear the dozens of people who make that show every single day.
Episode suggestion: "The Abortion Wars, Par 1: The Last Clinic in Missouri
10 Things That Scare Me'
This podcast from WNYC, the New York City NPR affiliate, takes everything you think a podcast is and throws it out. The show barely has a host, and the guests are rarely introduced.
Episodes are about 10 minutes, at most. The premise is self-explanatory: People recite their list, some with more explanation than others, but it's raw and very human, and will force you to confront what you think you're afraid of, and what it means to be scared.
This isn't something light to listen to on the beach. Sorry.
Episode suggestion: "Chris Miller
This American Life'
There are summer days when it's possibly hotter inside my apartment than it is outside, and all I can do is wander up and down Kanawha Boulevard with my headphones, trying to escape the summer heat and mid-July ennui.
Without fail, This American Life takes me somewhere else. This is the power of good storytelling, and of hearing someone else's voice. The show has been around since the mid-1990s, and pretty much paved the way for podcasts. I think it'll outlast most of them, too.

Texto completo: TOMS RIVER – Ocean County will join hundreds of cities, towns and county governments across the United States in a federal lawsuit against some of the biggest pharmaceutical companies in the world over America's epidemic of opioid abuse.
Without comment, the Board of Freeholders last month approved a resolution authorizing that a complaint be filed on its behalf in the National Prescription Opiate Litigation multidistrict litigation, MDL 2804. The vote was 4-to-0.
The lawsuit alleges that the manufacturers of prescription opioids grossly misrepresented the risks of long-term use for patients with chronic pain, and that distributors failed to properly monitor suspicious orders of those prescription drugs — all of which contributed to the current crisis.
In 2017, Toms River, Brick and Berkeley moved forward with similar litigation — although it was not immediately clear whether those municipalities were part of the same lawsuit.
Earlier this year, The New York Times reported that "the litigation has ballooned to 1,548 federal court cases, brought on behalf of cities and counties, 77 tribes, hospitals, union benefit funds, infants with neonatal abstinence syndrome and others — in total, millions of people. With a potential payday amounting to tens of billions of dollars, it has become one of the most complicated and gargantuan legal battles in American history."
After the meeting, Freeholder Director Virginia E. Haines explained that the litigation would not cost county taxpayers a dollar — the law firm representing the county would take about 20 percent of whatever fraction Ocean County was entitled to from whatever judgment or settlement may be reached in the case.
In the event of such a judgment or settlement, Haines said she would advocate that Ocean County use its share of the money to fund long-term drug rehabilitation care in the county for residents who cannot afford the cost and whose health insurance does not cover long-term treatment.
"I feel like we need to put a lot more money into rehab facilities," Haines said. "Right now, it's 14 days unless you have insurance. But you really need nine months to a year to really get full treatment — that's what I feel is important."
ABC News reported Friday that the number of public entities which joined the lawsuit had reached about 1,800 last week — they included Bergen County, New York's Albany County, as well as Baton Rouge, Louisiana and major cities such as Atlanta and Phoenix.
"The federal bundle of cases accuses opioid manufacturers, like Purdue Pharma and Johnson & Johnson, of aggressively marketing the drugs while misleading doctors and the public about how addictive they are," ABC News reported on its website. "They also accuse distributors, like McKesson, of moving huge quantities of the painkillers without alerting authorities, and accuse pharmacies like CVS Health and Walgreens of selling large amounts of the pills to patients."
The network reported that a potential settlement in the case could reach about $100 billion in total.
Ocean County has consistently been one of the counties in New Jersey hardest hit by the scourge of opioid addiction and overdose deaths.
In 2016, Ocean County had the second-highest total and rate of overdose deaths of any county in the state. Only Essex County, the most populous in the state, had more deaths and only Atlantic County had a higher rate of fatal overdoses per capita.
In Ocean County, between 2013 and 2016, 576 people died of suspected overdoses, according to state records.

Texto completo: Looks like former Boston Globe Spotlight reporter Michael Rezendes has really hit the big time: His name appeared as a clue in Tuesday's New York Times crossword puzzle.
The clue for 17 across read “Actor with the same initials as Michael Rezendes, his role in 'Spotlight.' " The answer: Mark Ruffalo .
“As a one-time English major, I have to admit it doesn't get any better," Rezendes said on Twitter.
Ruffalo was nominated for best supporting actor for his portrayal of Rezendes in the 2015 film “Spotlight." The movie won Academy Awards for best original screenplay and best picture.
A graduate of Boston University, Rezendes reported on the Globe's Spotlight Team for more than a decade. His investigative reporting on the Catholic church's cover-up of clergy sex abuse helped earn the Boston Globe the 2003 Pulitzer Prize for Public Service.
Rezendes's reporting revealed that top Catholic officials had buried the abuses of John Geoghan , a Boston priest who molested more than 100 children. After news of the Boston scandal broke, Rezendes continued to report on similar cover-ups by the church across the country. Although he has since retired from Spotlight, Rezendes continues to report as an Associated Press global investigation correspondent.
On his feature in Tuesday's crossword, Rezendes said: “It was very gratifying to see this high confirmation that the movie 'Spotlight,' Mark Ruffalo and the work of the Spotlight Team have succeeded in getting the issue of sexual abuse in the Catholic Church into the popular culture. Of course, I was also pretty happy to find a clue I could answer so easily."

TRUMP ABANDONS CITIZENSHIP QUESTION

Texto completo: The 2020 census forms are off to the presses without a controversial citizenship question that California and Bay Area officials feared could trigger a massive undercount of residents, costing the region and state hundred of millions in federal funding and congressional clout.
The Trump administration abandoned its long effort to include the citizenship question on Tuesday without explanation, acting a day after the U.S. Department of Commerce's self-imposed July 1 deadline to start printing the census form.
"This is a victory for Californians and for our democracy and a defeat for the Trump administration's relentless attack on our immigrant communities," Gov. Gavin Newsom said in a statement.
The decision also comes five days after the Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that the Commerce Department's justification for needing the question to better enforce the Voting Rights Act was insufficient. President Donald Trump lambasted that ruling and said on Twitter that he had asked lawyers if the census could be delayed until the issue was resolved.
In a statement, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross acknowledged dropping the question but said he strongly disagreed with the Supreme Court's decision.
"The Census Bureau has started the process of printing the decennial questionnaires without the question," Ross said. "My focus and that of the Bureau and the entire Department is to conduct a complete and accurate census."
Researchers warned that the inclusion of the question could result in California losing at least one, and possibly more, seats in Congress, reasoning that undocumented immigrants would avoid filling out the form for fear of identifying themselves to authorities. The loss of clout is less likely now, although an undercount in the state is still a distinct possibility.
Bay Area officials welcomed the decision, which was first reported by The New York Times and confirmed to this news organization by a U.S. Department of Justice official.
"We're grateful to the attorneys and advocates who tirelessly fought this Administration's attempt to stoke fear in our immigrant community, and depress participation in the 2020 Census," San Jose Mayor Sam Liccardo said in a statement.
Alameda County Supervisor Wilma Chan said she was thrilled.
"An undercount would've sent a message that immigrants and minorities don't deserve to be counted," she said, adding that a 2% undercount would have cost Alameda County $1 billion over 10 years.
In a statement, East Bay Rep. Barbara Lee echoed those sentiments.
"This misguided question should never have been proposed in the first place and the fear and anxiety it caused the immigrant community was completely unnecessary," Lee said.
Even without thequestion, an undercount in California and the Bay Area is still likely. The state is home to more immigrants than any other, as well as many renters, low-income residents and those not fluent in English, all of which researchers and state officials point to as some of the hardest-to-count communities.
Those populations are particularly large in West Oakland, Antioch, East San Jose and San Francisco's Mission and Chinatown neighborhoods, according to California Complete Count, the office tasked with the state's outreach and census coordination efforts.
Nick Kuwada, manager of Santa Clara County's Office of the Census, said that "a lot of the damage has been done." Many immigrant communities are already afraid of the census and how their answers could be used, he said.
"We need to start working today to make sure that they are counted in 2020," Kuwada said. "As much as I'd like to be ecstatic about the moment, there's still a lot of work to be done."
That work isvitally important for the state and local finances. California's population could be undercounted by 596,200 people, according to an analysis from The Urban Institute, a nonprofit research group in Washington, D.C. That includes 462,300 Hispanic and 96,700 black residents.
Every person not counted costs California roughly $2,000 in early education funding, food assistance and housing vouchers, according to George Washington University. That means the Urban Institutes anticipated undercount could cost California $1.16 billion in federal funding.
California is hoping to minimize those losses with a robust outreach and marketing effort to the tune of $100.4 million to count a projected 40.56 million residents, more per person than any other state. Alameda County is allocating $1.5 million to the effort, Chan said.
California's investment is in part to counteract an 11% decrease in how much the Census Bureau is spending on the census compared to 2010. Some of the savings came from making many respondents fill out the census questionnaire online. Chan urged the Trump administration to up the agency's funding.
"We'd like them to restore some of the money they took out from the Census Bureau last year," she said.

Texto completo: Corporations are made-up things. They do not occur in nature. A corporation is, to a substantial degree, a legal fiction that allows a private company to get some of the benefits of human individuals, and some of the benefits of a non-human business. Over history, the benefits of being a “corporation” have grown and grown, while the disadvantages have all but gone away.
One of the disadvantages used to be that corporations couldn’t participate directly in politics. But that “disadvantage” has gone substantially away in the age of Political Action Committees (PACs), which enable the leaders and executives of a corporation to band together, put huge sums together, and contribute it to aid political parties and campaigns. You’d have to squint pretty hard to see that as something other than a loophole by which corporations can participate in politics.
Corporations like to claim to have “values” other than maximizing profits. Many big American companies have values statements endorsing various kinds of diversity, including support for LGBTQ rights.
All this is leading up to passing along a nice analysis by Dave Leonhardt of the New York Times of money flowing through corporate PACs of companies that claim to support LGBTQ rights as a matter of corporate philosophy — to candidates who oppose LGBTQ rights in every meaningful way as a matter of government policy.
There’s an old saying that money talks while something else walks. The something else is a rude term for the excrement of bulls.
It would be reasonable to ask whoever is in charge running those corporate PACs, and deciding which candidates should get the very significant benefit of corporate PAC donations, whether the corporation is putting its efforts behind its claimed values or its profits. Leonhardt tried asking that question and got something that loops back to the bull excrement.
Here’s Leonhardt’s piece. (You’ll see it’s not an actual column but a few paragraphs he writes introducing links to various offerings from that day’s Times columnists.
In case you don’t click through, here are the first few paragraphs:
Virginia Foxx, a member of Congress from North Carolina, has a long record of opposing gay rights. She has gone so far as to claim that Matthew Shepard — a college student murdered in a hate crime — was not killed because he was gay. At one point, she used the word “hoax.”
Nonetheless, the executives of Comcast, the media company, have decided that Foxx deserves the company’s support: It recently donated money to Foxx’s political action committee.
Doug Collins, a House member from Georgia, is also an opponent of gay rights. He has argued, bizarrely, that a ban on workplace discrimination would somehow hurt “women, lesbians, and families.” Still, Home Depot has decided to support Collins financially.
Senator Marsha Blackburn, from Tennessee, opposes marriage equality and supports President Trump’s efforts to keep transgender Americans out of the military. AT&T recently gave her thousands of dollars.
This list could go on. FedEx, General Electric, Pfizer, UBS, UPS and Verizon have all given significant financial backing to members of Congress who oppose L.G.B.T. rights.
Yet every one of these companies also claims to support L.G.B.T. equality.

John Bolton disputes NYT report about 'freezing' North Korea's nuclear program

Texto completo: U. S. National Security Adviser John Bolton on Monday shot down a New York Times report suggesting the Trump administration is working on a plan that "tacitly accepts" North Korea as a nuclear power while effectively "freezing" its nuclear ambitions.
"I read this NYT story with curiosity. Neither the NSC staff nor I have discussed or heard of any desire to 'settle for a nuclear freeze by NK. '" Bolton tweeted.
"This was a reprehensible attempt by someone to box in the President. There should be consequences," he added. Bolton's comments came after President Donald Trump held a weekend meeting on the Korean Peninsula with North Korea leader Kim Jong Un.
Experts said the meeting, their third, was rich in symbolism, but lacked substance.
The Times said the idea behind the plan was aimed at stopping North Korea's nuclear arsenal from expanding, but would not dismantle North Korea's existing arsenal of weapons, estimated at "20 to 60," according to the paper.
U. S. administration officials have repeatedly insisted that North Korea should not be allowed to join the "club" of nuclear-armed nations that include, addition to the United States, China, France, India, Pakistan and the United Kingdom.
Two previous Trump-Kim summits, first in Singapore last summer and then in Hanoi, Vietnam, this year, have not yet yielded any concrete steps by North Korea to relinquish its weapons. Pyongyang has been holding out for relief from economic sanctions.

Texto completo: Each week, Paul Wood chats with a high-tech innovator. SIDDHARTH KRISHNAN, a Ph.D. candidate in the University of Illinois Materials Science and Engineering Department, has been named the Illinois Innovation Prize winner for 2019. He has developed a noninvasive, wearable shunt failure monitor for patients with hydrocephalus[, the buildup of fluid in the cavities deep within the brain.]
What's next for you?
I just defended my Ph.D. in May, and will formally receive my degree in August. I'm moving to MIT to pursue a postdoc in Professor Robert Langer's group in July.
Why is this research important?
The condition and is the most common reason for brain surgeries in children. The estimated medical costs for hydrocephalus are over $2 billion per year. The shunt failure monitor has the potential to bring down the costs associated with expensive, inaccurate and painful diagnostic testing.
How did you get started?
In the beginning (around 2015), as an engineer, I didn't really know much about hydrocephalus. We were developing a class of wearable devices to measure heat flow through near-surface layers of the skin as a means to quantify thermal transport properties, as they related to blood flow and skin hydration. These research efforts were done in the context of open-ended academic inquiry, without a particular application in mind. At the time, we were fortunate enough to connect with some world-class neurosurgeons at Northwestern University, who pointed out that wearable flow sensors could have a huge impact in the context of shunt diagnostics for patients with hydrocephalus.
How has that progressed?
Since then, we've interacted with several patients and I have witnessed how problematic shunts can be. Shunts are a life-saving technology -- the problem is that when they fail, it's extremely difficult to distinguish the symptoms of shunt failure from those of simple headaches or colds. Because they have high failure rates, it means that every headache could potentially be a shunt-related problem, and this usually means a trip to the emergency room, followed by lots of imaging, which can come with radiation risks. For the pediatric population, in particular, this can make living a normal life very challenging. Interacting with these patients and learning more about the condition has been a strong motivator for me to work on this problem.
Have you patented this device, and do you have a startup in the works?
Yes, the core technology underlying the device is patented and there is a startup company, Rhaeos Inc., to license the technology and commercialize it.
TECH TIDBITS:
SIDDHARTH KRISHNAN
Social media interests? Nothing too out there. I follow the New York Times, Wired, MIT Tech review and several academic journals on twitter.
Book or Kindle? Book over Kindle, though I do own a Kindle. Currently I'm reading "The Gene" by Siddhartha Mukherjee. It's fascinating, but quite a dense read. I'm moving through it slowly.
Any wearable electronics? Just one item: a My Skin Track UV device (measuring things like pollution and pollen), launched by L'Oreal, whose core technology comes from the John Rogers group.
Do you have an entrepreneur hero? No one in particular. I have a lot of respect for anyone who has been able to bring a successful medical device to market and have it deployed clinically. There are several barriers to entry, and it's not easy.
(Web-only text follows:)
Are you working with the John Rogers group? He was a legend when he was at the Urbana campus.
Yes, I'm one of Professor Rogers' Ph.D. students. I'm very fortunate to have an adviser like him. He combines an incredibly broad, deep scientific background with a strong motivation to build technologies with real impact. He has been a fantastic mentor.
Who else is on your team?
The core folks who have helped develop the technology so far, in addition to myself, are Professor Rogers and Dr. Amit Ayer and Dr. Matthew Potts, both in the department of neurosurgery at Northwestern.

Texto completo: SALT LAKE CITY — On the eve of the start of free agency, the Utah Jazz got some bad news.
The NBA announced the official salary cap for the 2019-20 season. The number: $109,140,000.
Utah would have benefitted if it had been just a bit higher. The Jazz, as currently constructed, won’t be able to complete the trade for Mike Conley without either waiving or including another player in the deal.
The Jazz are bringing Conley into their cap space and the new cap won’t be high enough to accommodate Conley’s $32,511,623 salary. Utah needed the cap set at about $109.28 million to make the current deal work.
The player that seems most likely to be included or waived to make the deal work is point guard Raul Neto.
The trade — which has Jae Crowder, Kyle Korver and Grayson Allen heading to Memphis — can’t be officially completed until July 6. So what Utah does in free agency could decide how it chooses to complete the deal.
Instead of just adding a player in the deal, the Jazz can also make other moves that put them under the cap — for example, choosing not to guarantee the final year of Derrick Favors’ deal and signing a player for less than the $16.9 million he’d be due.
And it appears such an option is indeed on the table.
The New York Times’ Marc Stein reported that “Utah had major interest in signing Nikola Mirotic to a three-year deal in the $45 million range” before Mirotic opted to go overseas and play for Barcelona.
Jazz general manager Justin Zanik said Utah plans on being “aggressive” on the free agent market even after acquiring Conley. With Favors’ and Neto’s (and even George Niang’s) deals being non-guaranteed for next season, the Jazz do have some flexibility. They won’t be able to clear max cap space (though they could get close, theoretically, by pulling off a sign and trade), but they could clear about $20 million.
Teams can begin negotiating with free agents at 4 p.m. MDT Sunday. The moratorium period ends on July 6 at 10 a.m. MDT.

Texto completo: There was one name that was noticeably absent in two nights of 2020 debates: E. Jean Carroll, the advice columnist who has accused President Trump of sexually assaulting her in a Bergdorf Goodman dressing room in the 1990s.
It was unclear whether that means Democrats have determined that the story is not credible enough, or they are just resigned to the idea that attacking Trump's record with women will get them nowhere, because whoever doesn't care about it at this point never will.
But it was still notable. There were 20 Democratic candidates, debating over the course of four hours, on a liberal network. It just seems as if somebody would have raised the matter, especially one of the lower-tier candidates who would have been guaranteed more attention by bringing it up.
Even on the morning before the second debate, the New York Times posted a podcast featuring interviews with two friends of Carroll who said she told them about the incident right after it happened. So there was news to tie any sort of reference to it.
The decision of Democrats to avoid making an issue of the accusation makes it more likely that the story will go away, and just get folded into the stories of other women who have accused Trump of sexual misconduct.

Guest opinion: Turns out religion and science aren't so different, after all

Texto completo: Editor's note: This commentary by Daryl Austin is part of an ongoing Deseret News opinion series exploring ideas and issues at the intersection of faith and thought .
I’ve always thought of science and religion as generally opposed belief systems with one relying more on logic or reason and the other relying more on faith. Having recently discovered the newest edition of the celebrated scientific text "A Short History of Nearly Everything," however, I no longer think about either belief system in quite the same way.
I still recognize, of course, that many of my religious beliefs defy a ready explanation (see angels, gold plates and parted Red Seas), but I now also appreciate how scientists are similarly unable to explain many of their own findings.
This uncertainty, this mystery, doesn’t shake my faith in either. Rather, I admire both science and religion more for the shared yearnings to discover greater light and truth.
My purpose here is not to denigrate the noble endeavors of science or to critique modern research advances. Instead, I want to underscore the perhaps counterintuitive commonalities between the seemingly distinct domains of pews and petri dishes.
"A Short History of Nearly Everything" is an international bestseller and one of the most highly reviewed works of popular science literature. The New York Times lauds it as "A modern classic of science writing," and the Times Literary Supplement writes that "all schools would be better places if it were the core science reader on the curriculum."
The author, Bill Bryson, dedicated three years of his life to completing the work. He met with or studied the findings of more than a hundred scientists and experts. His purpose in writing the book was “to see if it isn’t possible to understand and appreciate … the wonder and accomplishments of science at a level that isn’t too technical or demanding, but isn’t entirely superficial either.” To say he accomplished his goal is an understatement. In writing the book, however, he (perhaps inadvertently) also laid bare the many challenges and mysteries that confront the scientific enterprise.
Scientists and people of faith, it appears, both struggle to see through a glass, darkly. This may seem self-evident to many, but I was particularly struck by just how much scientists disagree — even among those who have similar educational backgrounds, in the same fields of study, who are observing the same data points.
Bryson, for example, notes that geologists throughout time have often disagreed about the age of the earth. He writes: “By the close of the nineteenth century, depending on which text you consulted, you could learn that the number of years that stood between us and the dawn of complex life … was 3 million, 18 million, 600 million, 794 million, or 2.4 billion — or some other number within that range.”
It's worth noting that every scientist across that spectrum absolutely believed his position to be the most accurate at the time. Chemists have been similarly affected. When the two-time Nobel Prize winner, Madame Marie Curie, discovered radium at the close of 1898, her fellow scientists initially embraced the perceived benefits of radioactivity. Bryson writes: “For a long time it was assumed that anything so miraculously energetic as radioactivity must be beneficial. For years, manufacturers of toothpaste and laxatives put radioactive thorium in their products.” Incredibly, Bryson notes that radioactivity “wasn’t banned in consumer products until 1938.”
Geophysicists, meanwhile, aren’t exempt. “The distribution of continents in former times is much less neatly resolved than most people outside geophysics think,” Bryson writes.
“Species of plants and animals from the ancient world have a habit of appearing inconveniently where they shouldn’t and failing to be where they ought.” Bryson provides many specific examples of inexplicable discrepancies while noting that today they’re “mostly ignored.”
And then there’s the 1918 Great Swine Flu epidemic. To demonstrate the magnitude of its destruction, Bryson observes that “The First World War killed 21 million people in four years; swine flu did the same in its first four months.”
What’s amazing is that to this day, scientists still don’t know “how or where” that particular virus mutated into its lethal form, nor why it “was most devastating to people in the prime of life” when the flu “normally is hardest on infants and the elderly.” Nor do we know “how it erupted suddenly, all over, in places separated by oceans, mountain ranges and other earthly impediments.”
(Bryson says that’s odd because “a virus can survive for no more than a few hours outside a host body, so how could it appear in Madrid, Bombay and Philadelphia all in the same week?”)
And what about our inability to account for how a sailor died of AIDS back in 1959, “yet, for whatever reasons, the disease remained generally quiescent for another twenty years.”
Scientists still know little (or nothing at all) about almost all of the species that have come before us. “It has been estimated that less than one species in ten thousand has made it into the fossil record,” Bryson continues. “That in itself is a stunningly infinitesimal proportion. However, if you accept the common estimate that the Earth has produced thirty billion species of creature in its time … that reduces the proportion to just one in 120,000.”
Along those same lines, I’ve heard speculation that there's relatively little archeological or scientific evidence of the ancient peoples described in, say, The Bible or The Book of Mormon. Even assume that this premise is true (and there’s reason to suggest it’s not) it’s nonetheless worth noting how incredibly rare Bryson says it is for such evidence to ever be discovered at all.
"Only about one bone in a billion, it is thought, ever becomes fossilized." Bryson then makes this stunning observation: "If that is so, it means that the complete fossil legacy of all the Americans alive today — that’s 270 million people with 206 bones each — will only be about fifty bones, one-quarter of a complete skeleton. That’s not to say, of course, that any of these bones will ever actually be found … it would be something of a miracle if they were."
The one exception to this is when bones from the same skeleton are found together. The most noteworthy of such finds is the hominid remains of a 3.18-million-year-old skeleton known as Lucy.
She’s so vital to certain theories of evolution that one expert states proudly: “She is our earliest ancestor, the missing link between ape and human.” And yet, as important as this discovery clearly is for the advancement of knowledge, Bryson outlines the reality that we simply know much less about Lucy than is “generally supposed.”
For instance, the American Museum of Natural History describes her remains as “two-thirds complete” but a BBC television series tells viewers she is “a complete skeleton.” Bryson discovers that Lucy is actually “only 20% of a full (skeleton),” and that “it isn’t even actually known that she was a female. Her sex is merely presumed from her diminutive size." And, well, it’s only "very recently" that “many authorities” revealed that they simply “aren’t so sure” about whether modern humans actually descended from Lucy or her kind after all.
All of this, of course, says nothing of the many scientific unknowns in outer space or related to the Big Bang. Still today cosmologists argue about whether creation took place 10 billion years ago “or twice that or something in between.”
Then there is the number of planets in the universe. Carl Sagan puts it at “ten billion trillion.”
Give or take a few, that is.
To be sure, skepticism or even acknowledging the messiness about science has too often been leveraged for ill-conceived ends.
So-called science deniers can sometimes champion anti-social causes. So, let me state another clear finding of Bryson’s work: Research works, and so does the scientific method. Scientific inquiry and literature do in fact build; discoveries and breakthroughs continue to improve our understanding and even save lives. However, to deny the mysteries and the contested conversations in the scientific process is to overlook the beauty and utility of the enterprise.
In this way, religion and science may not be quite so far apart as some contend. There is much still waiting to be discovered and revealed; there are so many unknowns in both science and religion alike.
Simply stated, the two are not mutually exclusive.
Bryson seems to have said as much himself in an interview with The Guardian: "The one thing I did appreciate when I was writing 'A Short History' was that conventional science and a belief in God are absolutely not incompatible."
Sure, science is often pitted against religion; but, I’ve come to learn that both require a bit of faith.

Texto completo: Three women who accused a prominent Newburyport psychiatrist of drawing them into demeaning sexual relationships while he was treating them for depression have settled medical malpractice lawsuits that alleged he preyed on vulnerable patients.
Lawyers for Dr. Keith R. Ablow, a nationally known author and former Fox News contributor, and the three accusers recently reached out-of-court settlements, according to court filings.
The terms and settlement sums were not disclosed.
In their lawsuits, the women alleged they traveled from out of state to be treated by Ablow, 57, in Newburyport, where their relationships eventually turned sexual. While under Ablow's care, all three said they received infusions of the anesthetic Ketamine to treat depression.
Two of the women alleged Ablow charged them for therapy during meetings where they engaged in sex acts.
During some sexual encounters, the women said Ablow beat them with a belt with a skull-shaped buckle and told one words to the effect of “I own you," and “You are my slave."
The same woman wrote in an affidavit that she had Ablow's Facebook name tattooed on her inner forearm.
Reached Tuesday, attorney Clyde D. Bergstresser, who represents the three women, declined to comment.
Bergstresser and lawyers for Ablow were scheduled to be in Essex Superior Court in Salem on Wednesday for a hearing on the women's request to prevent Ablow from selling or transferring assets valued at more than $25,000 while the cases were pending.
The hearing was canceled.
In February, Ablow published a tweet saying he “categorically, completely" denied the allegations in the lawsuits.
Attorney Paul Cirel, who represents Ablow, said his client is now focused on getting his medical license reinstated in Massachusetts where regulators barred him from practicing medicine last month after concluding he poses “an immediate and serious threat to public health."
“We are pleased that the civil matters have been amicably resolved so that Dr. Ablow can now focus his attention and resources on overturning the Board of Medicine's order of temporary suspension, so that he can restore his medical license and resume helping patients into the future, as he has countless times in the past," Cirel said Tuesday in an e-mail.
Hearings on Ablow's medical license are scheduled to begin in October before the state Division of Administrative Law Appeals. New York authorities have also suspended Ablow's medical license.
The women used their real names in the lawsuits, but the Globe is withholding their identities because the newspaper does not identify victims of alleged sexual abuse without their consent.
In May, a different medical malpractice case filed against Ablow in 2016 settled shortly before trial. Details of the agreement weren't filed in court.
In that case, a 55-year-old antiques dealer from Cape Cod accused Ablow of crossing clinical boundaries by e-mailing and texting her outside of therapy sessions, helping her open a store in Newburyport, prescribing medications for her family members, and suggesting she have an affair with help from the online dating service Ashley Madison.
The company's famous slogan is: “Life is short. Have an affair."
The lawsuit didn't accuse Ablow of sexual misconduct.
In court papers, Ablow's lawyers said his treatment was within the standard of care and “is to be viewed in the context of the development of communicative technology" and that the patient's ability to “reach, check in, and otherwise contact her psychiatrist was valuable."
The treatment, Ablow's lawyers said, was a “great success, and had resulted in substantial improvements in various spheres of plaintiff's life activity."
Ablow, who lives in Newbury, is a prolific author and worked for the Fox News network until 2017.
He has testified as a defense witness in the high-profile trials of Dr. Richard Sharpe, who was convicted of killing his wife in Wenham, and Christian Karl Gerhartsreiter, the German national serving time for murder in California who pretended to be a member of the Rockefeller dynasty.
Ablow has also pursued various business interests, including a wellness spa in Newburyport, a Ketamine clinic at his psychiatric office, and a now-defunct life-coaching business.
The suspension of his medical license has affected other parts of Ablow's life, including his license to carry a firearm, records show.
Newbury Police Chief Michael A. Reilly suspended Ablow's license on May 20, concluding that allegations levied by state medical regulators “give rise to concerns about your suitability to possess firearms."
Reilly ordered Ablow to turn in his firearms, according to a letter filed in Newburyport District Court.
Ablow is appealing the suspension of his license to carry. A hearing on the appeal is scheduled for September.

Texto completo: On July 20, 1969, the United States landed all-Americans Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin on the rocky surface of the moon. I was among 600 million people watching - a 5-year-old kid of the Space Age living in Clifton, New Jersey. As my Hot Wheels collected dust, I went gaga for outer space and astronauts.
Three weeks before, on June 28, a bus and a subway ride away from our family's split Colonial, a band of gays, lesbians and trans people also launched into the great unknown. They sparked an unprecedented protest against a police raid at the Stonewall Inn. On that night, this group, which many may still consider the antithesis of anything all-American, began the modern LGBTQ movement. You wouldn't know it by the headlines: Three days of New York Times coverage amounted articles buried between Pages 19 and 33.
On July 20, across the Hudson and years away from awareness of such events, my mom, dad, two older brothers and I watched a blurry black-and-white transmission on a 21-inch TV screen with walkie-talkie audio. Earlier, Armstrong had said, "The Eagle has landed."
"What Eagle?" I thought. Armstrong was on our TV, setting foot on the moon with a fishbowl on his head. I ran to the patio. I wanted to see it with my own eyes, in color.
"But I can't see the moon!" I said. The astronauts were as invisible to me and my family as the Stonewall protesters. "You can't really see them," said my brother Bob. I took it on faith, along with the Santa myth. Because as a 5-year-old gay-to-be with a penchant for pomp, a hero like Armstrong made sense. After extensive NASA screening, he rode on a one-of-a-kind spaceship to an exclusive destination, wore a custom outfit and ate freeze-dried ice cream. My grandmother helped me write a letter to NASA for his autographed photo.
As an out-of-the closet 30-something, I found that Saran-wrapped 8-by-10. But now a claustrophobic and an afraid-of-heights Cub Scout dropout, I reminded myself why I wasn't at NASA.
I learned about my Stonewall forbears during the 25th anniversary celebrations. Like the astronauts, they headed into uncharted territory: Armstrong and team entered history on a fantastic rocket ship. Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia Rivera, two of the Stonewall uprising's leaders, likely arrived in heels, fueled only by years of oppression and rage. They and their comrades approached the unknown, arguably more bravely, from a far precinct of American society.
Armstrong and his crew risked their lives to advance humankind's understanding of the universe. Similarly, Johnson and Rivera and their co-patriots gave voice to their rage and advanced human rights. They furthered America's heritage of protest and uprising, right back to that most famous of tea parties in the harbor.
In the summer of 2019, precocious gay 5-year-olds and their families can come to know and respect all-American role models in and out of the LGBTQ community. Our heroes are no longer invisible.

Texto completo: Ahead of World UFO Day, a Salt Lake City-based company has declared Maine one of the best states to see a UFO.
Dead last? The Lone Star State.
"If you're scrambling to avoid an alien abduction, the safest place for you to live is Texas," the company's report said.
SatelliteInternet.com used statistics from the National UFO Reporting Center and the U.S. census to determine that Maine has 70.23 sightings per 100,000 people.
The top five is heavy on states in the northern part of the country: Washington, Montana, Vermont, Alaska and Maine. And the bottom five is heavy on the South: Texas, Louisiana, Georgia, Mississippi and Alabama.
"I was coming up dry on theories," media relations specialist Cosette Jarrett said Wednesday. "I guess that there are two things here: You're more likely to spot a UFO in the North than the South or people have a stronger belief in the North than they do in the South and they're more likely to report something funny that they see up in the sky."
Jarrett said her company felt like it would be a fun time to crunch the numbers with UFO interest after the New York Times' story of Navy pilots coming forward to report strange objects in the sky.
Attitudes toward UFOs have been changing in the U.S.
In Chapman University's 2018 Survey of American Fears, 41 percent of people believe aliens had visited Earth in the recent past and 35 percent believe they've come in modern times, compared to 35 percent and 26.2 percent, respectively, the year before.
For anyone keeping a paranormal scorecard, more people believed in ghosts (57.7 percent) and fewer in Bigfoot (20.7 percent).
The National UFO Reporting Center has accounts of 957 UFO reports in Maine, 17 more than when SatelliteInternet.com ran its numbers, that date back to July 1, 1946, in South Portland: "motionless, dark oblong, noon sky over ocean, felt Energy-Pull of Observing craft; when spotted, accelerated straight upwards fast."
Some are anonymous, at least one in Auburn was a potential hoax and some have been deemed likely satellites or things that should be up there, like Venus.
World UFO Day, should you want to look up, is July 2.

New York Does In King Kong and Cher

Texto completo: "King Kong," the big-budget musical driven by its massive namesake puppet, will close Aug. 18 after less than a year on Broadway, the show's producers announced on Tuesday.
"The Cher Show," the jukebox musical that won Stephanie J. Block a Tony Award in the title role, will wrap up on the same day.
Each show arrived on Broadway with a presold -- and yes, larger than life -- name in its title. And the closings come as major disappointments, given the time, talent and expense it took to bring them to the New York stage.
Boasting three title performers and a bounty of tunes from the singer's lengthy career, "The Cher Show" featured a book by Rick Elice ("Jersey Boys") and direction by Jason Moore ("Avenue Q"). Jeffrey Seller, who brought "Hamilton" to Broadway, was a co-producer. Bob Mackie did the lavish costumes.
But the critic Jesse Green, writing in The New York Times, called the production a "maddening mishmash." For the week ending June 23, the show grossed $ 858,578, only 58 percent of its potential. Capitalized for up to $ 19 million, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, it has not recouped those costs.
"King Kong" was the first traditional stage production from Global Creatures, the Australian company whose realistic animatronics brought life to arena shows like "Walking With Dinosaurs" and "How to Train Your Dragon."
It arrived in New York later than expected. After a run in Melbourne, "King Kong" initially considered a 2014 opening, before eventually announcing its 2018 arrival in the spring of 2017. Various creative teams were attached along the way.
"King Kong" was capitalized for $ 30 million, according to the production. That sum -- enormous by Broadway standards -- has not been recouped.
The show eventually opened to stinging reviews, with most of the praise going to the towering title character himself, a colossal marionette clocking in at 20 feet tall and 2,000 pounds. For the week ending June 23, it grossed just shy of $ 783,000 at the box office, only 53 percent of its potential take.
Fourteen performers operate the lifelike ape, whose innovative expressions and movements exceed what most audiences have typically seen from puppetry on Broadway, and were recognized with a special Tony Award this month.
The creative team for "King Kong" included the writer Jack Thorne, who also was behind the script for "Harry Potter and the Cursed Child," and the director and choreographer Drew McOnie. The score was written by Marius de Vries, with songs by Eddie Perfect.
At the time of its closing, the show will have played 324 performances and 29 previews at the Broadway Theater. "The Cher Show" will have played 296 performances and 34 previews at the Neil Simon Theater.
"King Kong" will live to rampage through another city, however: The show is slated to open in Shanghai in 2021, and a news release on Tuesday promised a North American tour and productions in Japan and Spain.
And "The Cher Show" still has a sequin or three up its sleeve, announcing a national tour that will open in Rochester in October 2020.
In the meantime, the next Global Creatures show to arrive in New York -- "Moulin Rouge! The Musical" -- begins preview performances Friday at the Al Hirschfeld Theater.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

NOOSH ON REGENT REINVENTS ITSELF AS A SOBER BAR; ; FOOD &amp; DRINK

Texto completo: Laila Borokhim's near west side restaurant Noosh is having a soft relaunch this Thursday evening as a sober bar.
"Noosh will be constantly reinventing itself," Borokhim said. "It's a weird space. It's the best way for me to give this a try."
Noosh opened first in a former Taco Bell on South Park Street in 2016, then had a brief life as a food cart. It opened in a quonset hut at 1431 Regent St. in fall 2017, serving pierogis and malawach. Borokhim liked to call her menu "Jewified world cuisine."
In this latest stage of its evolution, the focus will be on making it a place for nearby students and others to gather when they want to hang out late, after the coffee shops have closed, but not have a drink.
"In my industry, after work, the option is mostly you go to a bar," she said. "I don't want to go sit at home alone, and I don't want to be in the atmosphere of the bar either. If you're not drinking, it's not the most pleasant experience."
From 4 p.m. until midnight Thursday, Friday and Saturday, Noosh will sell nonalcoholic cocktails for $6-$9 and nonalcoholic beer, like Old Milwaukee ("that's kind of a joke") and Sharp's. The cocktails will be based on distilled nonalcoholic "spirits" from companies like Seedlip.
Low- and no-ABV cocktails have become a major trend. There are sober bars in New York City and Los Angeles, spots with names like Getaway and Listen Bar. In Crystal Lake, Illinois (between Rockford and Chicago) is The Other Place, a sober bar open since 2013.
The availability of NA spirits has allowed these bars to give nondrinkers something beyond nonalcoholic beers or Sprite from a soda gun. A description of Seedlip's Garden 108, for example, sounds like gin: "A floral blend of handpicked peas and homegrown hay from founder Ben Branson's Farm, with traditional garden herb distillates in celebration of the English countryside. Simply serve with tonic and a sugar snap pea to garnish." More spots are serving low- and no-ABV options alongside their classics and house originals. Robert Simonson, the New York Times cocktail writer, noted that "people are using it to pace themselves. They get a cocktail and then they get a non-alcoholic cocktail, and that way they last twice as long through the night. It's just strategy."
Much like the east side arts venue Communication bills itself as a sober space for people to see music and poetry, Borokhim hopes Noosh can be a spot for people who want to live "in a cleaner way."
Noosh will keep its beer and wine license for now, and Borokhim has flexibility with the food. She'll have snacks, host pierogi nights and continue to make "shakshuka in the shack" on Saturday mornings. Noosh could also host pop-ups from food carts, like Robin Room does on East Johnson Street.
Borokhim also owns Joon, a Persian/ Iranian restaurant at 1835 Monroe St. She ran her first restaurant, Layla's Persian Food, on South Butler Street, from 20142018.
Borokhim isn't sure whether Noosh's new concept will work on Regent, especially with most of the student population out for the summer. But she already know she'll learn from trying.
"There are places like this out in Los Angeles, where it's a normal thing to do," she said. "Like, 'Hey, do you want to meet after work and have cocktails?' and they just don't happen to have alcohol. That's what I'm hoping to bring to Wisconsin." CREDIT: By Lindsay Christians

Texto completo: I never thought I would write this, but the publisher of The New York Times, A.G. Sulzberger, is right. Sulzberger wrote an op-ed for The Wall Street Journal in response to President Donald Trump's claim that the NYT committed "treason" by publishing a story about U.S. efforts to compromise Russia's power grid should Moscow again try to meddle in U.S. elections. The Times says it consulted National Security officials who raised no objections to its publication.
It is one thing for the president to criticize sloppy, inaccurate and biased reporting by the media. It is quite another to use such an incendiary word as "treason," whose definition does not fit what the president sees: "The offense of acting to overthrow one's government or to harm or kill its sovereign; a violation of allegiance to one's sovereign or to one's state; the betrayal of a trust or confidence; breach of faith; treachery."
Before becoming a columnist, I was a reporter for local TV stations and one network. In the early '70s, during a pro-Vietnam War demonstration in Washington, I was called a communist by one of the demonstrators, simply because I had an NBC News logo on my microphone.
Hostility toward the press for failing to report, or ignoring, what many conservatives believe to be true (but isn't always) has been around for some time. It has grown worse during the Trump administration.
It might help lower the temperature if what is collectively known as "the media" engaged in serious introspection. Why is public distrust of journalists so high?
Columbia Journalism Review reports on results of a new Knight Foundation and Gallup poll: "A majority of those who were surveyed said they had lost trust in the media in recent years, and more than 30% of those who identified themselves as being on the conservative end of the spectrum said they had not only lost faith in the media, but they 'expect that change to be permanent.' According to a separate Gallup poll from earlier this year that tracked trust in major institutions, newspapers and television news were among the lowest, exceeded only by Congress."
This is dangerous. Not only for journalism, which is seeing the decline of newspapers and an increase in staff layoffs, but also because a vibrant press is crucial to a strong nation.
The response to this and similar surveys over decades has been a collective shrug. There is no self-examination by the media. Campaigns for "diversity" are about hiring more women and minorities, not ideological balance. Consumers of media - especially religious and conservative people - view the press as hostile.
Journalism is a business. Think of it this way: If you owned a gas station and were losing customers because gas prices were too high, the lighting was so poor that people felt unsafe at night and the restrooms were dirty, would you allow these conditions to persist? Not if you wanted to stay in business. What if a competitor opened a station across the street with lower prices, cleaner restrooms and better lighting?
Too many in the media are like the guy who owns the substandard gas station. The predictable results are fewer readers of newspapers and lower ratings for television news programs.
What should frighten all of us in this latest survey is the number of people who say they expect their loss of faith in the media to be permanent.
Does any other business so disrespect its current customers and not try to win back the disaffected? While A.G. Sulzberger is right to criticize the president for his incendiary remark, he should also consider putting his own house in order - not only for the good of the profession, but for the greater good of the country.

Texto completo: Crisis of rising seas
An article on Page 1 of the June 23 Daily Press stated that protecting our seven cities from the global warming sea-level rise will cost at least $4.6 billion.
The longer we do nothing, the greater the rise will be and the costs will escalate.
On Page 2, we learn that Republicans sponsored an amendment in Congress that would prohibit funding a 195-nation effort to address climate change - with a goal of limiting the planet's temperature rise to 2 degrees above pre-industrial levels. Sadly, U.S. Rep. Rob Wittman, R-Va., voted with his party.
The Republican vote was near unanimous on this; their obsession to accept President Donald Trump's absurd theory that global warming is a "Chinese hoax" will create a disaster for our children and grandchildren.
I listened to Vice President Mike Pence in a television interview Sunday morning announce that our nation's carbon emissions are down thanks to President Trump. In fact, the New York Times reported a preliminary estimate that they rose 3.4% in 2018 despite a near-record number of coal plants closing in the U.S. last year.

Hundreds of Children Are Moved Out of an Overcrowded Border Station

Texto completo: Hundreds of migrant children have been transferred out of a filthy Border Patrol station in Texas where they had been detained for weeks without access to soap, clean clothes or adequate food, the authorities confirmed on Monday, suggesting that worsening conditions and overcrowding inside federal border facilities may have reached a breaking point.
The move came days after a group of lawyers was given access to the station in Clint, Tex., about 20 miles southeast of El Paso, and said they saw children as young as 8 caring for infants, toddlers with no diapers, and children who said they were waking up at night because they were hungry.
Though the station had held a relatively small population of migrants, compared to the tens of thousands who have been crossing the border each month, the lawyers' accounts offered a rare view into a system that has largely been hidden from public view.
Other examples of facilities with poor conditions have trickled out in recent months through reports published by the Department of Homeland Security's inspector general, as well as from other lawyers who have occasionally been allowed in. Access to the facilities has been largely restricted, however, even as federal authorities have declared that the number of migrants on the border has escalated beyond their ability to safely handle.
"We continue to experience a humanitarian and security crisis at the southern border of the United States, and the situation becomes more dire each day," said Evelyn Stauffer, a spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Human Services's Office of Refugee Resettlement, which houses children after they have been transferred out of temporary border facilities.
Ms. Stauffer added that the agency, along with the Homeland Security Department, Defense Department and Justice Department, had requested $ 4.5 billion to help care for the growing number of migrant children who are in shelters.
"We cannot stress enough the urgency," she said.
The visit by lawyers to the Clint facility on June 17 was allowed as a result of a judge's order in a long-running court case concerning the conditions under which migrant children are held in government facilities. After they arrived and observed what was happening, the lawyers, including representatives of some of the nation's most prominent law schools, immediately began lobbying for the children to be released.
[Read more about the children held in unsanitary and overcrowded conditions.]
Some 249 of the children were transferred into a shelter system maintained by the Office of Refugee Resettlement, according to Ms. Stauffer; an unknown number of others were sent to a temporary tent facility in El Paso, according to Elizabeth Lopez-Sandoval, a spokeswoman for Congresswoman Veronica Escobar, Democrat of Texas, who began looking into the overcrowded facility in Clint last week after reports about the conditions there.
The lawyers' accounts drew a powerful backlash from elected officials, including Ms. Escobar, as well as members of the public who immediately began donating money to immigrant advocacy groups in the region and launching efforts to send supplies to the facility. Observers said the children who were living there needed diapers, clean clothes and toothbrushes.
"We're still going, because we don't think that just because they've moved them to a different facility that makes it any better," said Julie Lythcott-Haims, an author from Palo Alto, Calif., who was driving in her white Jeep Wrangler with a group of newfound friends toward Texas for a protest in Clint that they had planned for Tuesday evening.
She added that at least a dozen people were planning to travel from California and New York. "We want to be there with our bodies and our hearts and our brains and show support for the migrant families and children," Ms. Lythcott-Haims, 51, said.
The Border Patrol was routing children to Clint because the agency had been facing an unusually large influx of border crossers. The infants there had either been separated from adult family members with whom they had crossed the border or were the children of teenage mothers who had also been detained there. Some of the minors had been held there for nearly a month.
The lawyers who visited the facility, first interviewed by The Associated Press and later by The New York Times, said that children lacked access to private bathrooms, soap, toothbrushes or toothpaste. Many were wearing the same dirty clothes that they had crossed the border in weeks earlier.
Some sick children had been quarantined in Clint, and the lawyers who traveled there were allowed to speak to those children by phone, but not in person.
Ms. Lopez-Sandoval said that only 30 children remain in Clint. The Border Patrol station there was meant to be temporary; children are supposed to be transferred out after 72 hours. But many had been languishing there because the Department of Health and Human Services's shelters were full.
The strain on that system began to let up last week as a result of two changes: First, the Mexican government launched tougher efforts to limit the number of border crossers from Central America, under pressure from President Trump. Second, the Department of Health and Human Services scaled back a policy requiring fingerprints from family members who applied to sponsor children in its care, speeding up the children's release from government facilities. Many of those who apply to sponsor such children are undocumented themselves and unwilling to submit identifiers that could put them or their family members in danger of arrest and deportation.
A Department of Homeland Security official said that conditions in the tent facility in El Paso were much better than in Clint because the facility had been built especially for families, though it was not known whether the children had been given access to soap or showers since they arrived.
The official, who asked not to be identified because they were not authorized to discuss the situation, said that the children would have been screened medically when they arrived in El Paso, though it was not yet clear if any had required hospitalization.

Trump is going to have to decide what he wants from Iran

Texto completo: What comes after President Trump’s almost-attack on Iran to retaliate for the downing of a U.S. surveillance drone?
Maybe diplomacy. Leaders on both sides appear to be casting around for an acceptable formula to start talking.
It’s a good thing that Trump thought twice about hitting Iran late last week. Even though the United States and Iran probably would have contained the conflict, hotheads on both sides and lots of weapons in a confined area make for a bad combination. Things could easily spin out of control.
Trump made himself the humanitarian hero of this drama by declaring that a projected 150 Iranian deaths would be disproportionate. Fair enough. But there are enough questions about how we got within minutes of a military strike on Iran to make heads spin, both here and in Tehran.
Why didn’t the possible death toll come up earlier? Did the president finally have to choose between his own excessive rhetoric and the views of his hawkish advisers on one side, and his distaste for another war? The U.S. did conduct a cyberattack on Iranian targets, and Trump says more sanctions are coming. It would be foolish to think that the danger of armed conflict has passed.
But there also has been another theme coming from the White House – Trump’s support for making “Iran great again,” his expression of appreciation that Iran did not target a manned aircraft, his repeated declarations that he wants to talk to the Iranians.
In Tehran, there’s a good chance Trump comes out of this looking wobbly. Iranian officials of course have paid attention to Trump’s North Korea policy, too. This all suggests that Iran will try to keep the pressure up (while trying to keep it from going too high), to see if Trump really wants to talk and what kind of deal they could get.
Much is unclear on the Iranian side, as well. Perhaps, as the New York Times reported, the Iranians did send a message saying a tactical commander overreacted in shooting down the drone. There is still some doubt about who was responsible for attacks on a couple of ships in the Persian Gulf – the U.S. rush to accuse Iran notwithstanding — but it is not unreasonable to think Iran was behind them.
After initially hunkering down as Trump dramatically increased pressure, Iran appears to have concluded that it needs to try to force the issue. Sanctions are hitting hard, and although it’s unlikely the Islamic Republic will collapse, Iran expert Suzanne Maloney at the Brookings Institution says Iranian leaders have concluded they can’t sit back and wait Trump out.
If that’s true, then the point of putting Persian Gulf shipping at risk is to cause economic jitters and force up the global price of oil – at least causing more uncertainty at a point when Trump has just launched his re-election campaign. That strategy has worked in the past, but is seeming less successful now because of changes in energy markets, including increased U.S. production and a shift to renewables.
Iran has been quite public about its plans to ditch part of the nuclear agreement – which of course Trump did last year.
Trump will face sharp domestic criticism whatever policy he follows on Iran. In fact, BBC diplomatic correspondent Jonathan Marcus raises the possibility that Iran might be pursuing a “regime change” policy of its own – causing Trump enough grief that it damages his re-election chances.
Ayatollah Khamenei publicly has ruled out new talks with the United States, but several experts don’t buy it.
Maloney points out that Iran has been talking to possible intermediaries, there have been public calls in Iran for talks without conditions, and that officials have floated the possibility of exploring prisoner exchanges as a start.
Writing in Politico this weekend, Ray Takeyh of the Council on Foreign Relations argues that the whole point of Iran’s recent actions is to restart talks. To do so, it needs to come in not as a supplicant, and shooting down a drone without incurring a military response provides cover.
A summit, à la Trump’s meetings with North Korea’s Kim Jong Un, would be a surprise. But lower-level talks or negotiations carried out through an intermediary such as Oman are possible.
Takeyh says Iran is confident that if its diplomats get in the same room, they expect outside pressure for a deal to pile up on the Americans. Maloney believes that starting small on direct bilateral issues might pay off. Susan Rice, President Obama’s national security adviser, sets out her own blueprint to restart negotiations here.
Trump is going to have to decide what he wants. Regime change in Tehran – with the risk of war? A substantially reworked nuclear deal? Or headlines and a tweaked deal that has his name on it rather than President Obama’s?
The mere fact that talks are going on tends to make armed conflict less likely. That’s probably enough; anything else could be beyond reach. Trump has surrounded himself with people who aren’t much interested in negotiating, unless it ends in something that would look to Tehran like surrender. And the president, as he has shown once again, isn’t the type to actually craft a careful long-range policy and then implement it.

Ducey again kisses up to Trump on the census

Texto completo: Meanwhile, here in the real world, analyses by social scientists and researchers paid to study such things shows the citizenship question will keep many Latinos from participating in the census. Given that political districts and federal funding are based on the census count, that's a problem for us.
What's more important to Arizona's chief executive: the state getting a 10th seat in Congress and hundreds of millions of dollars in new federal funding?
Or kissing up to President Donald Trump?
If you answered B, then congratulations. You, too, could be governor of Arizona.
Ducey supports the Trump administration's quest to ask about citizenship during next year's census.
"There's a number of different questions the federal government chooses to ask," Ducey told Capitol Media Services Howard Fischer in April. "And I think to get a handle of who's here, who's a citizen and who's not is a fair question."
Another fair question: has the governor changed his mind now that it's clear the state is about to get screwed?
Any day now, the U.S. Supreme Court is expected to rule on whether Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross can add a question about citizenship to the 2020 census.
It sounds innocuous enough. The Justice Department says it needs to ask about citizenship in order to better enforce the 1965 Voting Rights Act.
Never mind, that the question hasn't been asked on the decennial census since 1950, a full 15 years before the VRA was even created.
More likely, the question is designed to shore up Republicans and weaken Democrats when political districts are redrawn based on the 2020 census count.
Actually it's more than more likely. It's a dead certainty that funny business is afoot.
In May, documents surfaced showing that the late Thomas B. Hofeller, the GOP's expert on gerrymandering, conducted a study in 2015 and concluded that adding the citizenship question would stymie Democrats when political boundaries are redrawn after the census.
The New York Times reports that Hofeller not only convinced the Trump administration to add the question to the census, he also came up with the rationale — the Justice Department's position that adding it would help with enforcement of the Voting Rights Act.
Nice to know that Trump is worried about vigorously protecting the rights of minority voters, don't you think?
Meanwhile, here in the real world, analyses by social scientists and researchers paid to study such things shows the citizenship question will keep many Latinos from participating in the census. Given that political districts and federal funding are based on the census count, that's a problem for us.
If the census is conducted as it has been for the last 60 years, Arizona is in line to get a 10th congressional seat. But probably not, if you intimidate immigrants into hiding.
A study by Harvard's Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy predicts an undercount of six million Latinos — about 12 percent of the Latino population — if the citizenship question is added.
In Arizona, the resulting undercount would be just under 5 percent of the state's population, the highest in the nation, according to an analysis the Washington Post, which worked with Shorenstein to predict how states would be affected.
Translation: wave goodbye to that 10th seat in Congress.
If Trump is allowed to play politics with the census, not only will we lose out on congressional clout we've earned as one of the nation's fastest growing states. we'll also lose out on hundreds of millions of dollars in federal funding for transportation, education and the other programs.
And our governor is apparently OK with that.
"The govenor's comments stand," spokesman Patrick Ptak told me on Monday. "Everyone that should legally be counted in the census, should be counted."
Except, of course, that Ducey knows they won't be counted.
Just as he knew that Trump's threats to close the border would be a disaster for Arizona's economy yet supported it anyway. Just as he knew that Trump's threat to impose tariffs on Mexico would be a disaster for Arizona's economy yet supported it anyway.
Now we stand to lose a congressional seat we've earned and potentially $322 million in federal funding, assuming the Shorenstein analysis holds.
It's a strange position for an Arizona governor to take.
But an entirely understandable one for an ambitious second-termer looking to move up.

Texto completo: AMSTERDAM -- In the summer of 1888, Vincent van Gogh invited his friend and fellow painter Paul Gauguin to visit him in Arles, France, and to stay with him at the house where he hoped to establish an artists' retreat. When Gauguin arrived in the fall, he found his room decorated with Van Gogh's artworks, including a painting of sunflowers arranged in a ceramic vase against a yellow background.
The two-month visit ended disastrously. The two artists had a blowout fight, and van Gogh sliced off his ear, suffered a mental breakdown and ended up in the hospital. Gauguin fled back to Paris.
A couple of weeks later, however, he wrote to van Gogh requesting that painting, "Sunflowers," praising it as "a perfect page of an essential 'Vincent' style."
Understandably, van Gogh was reluctant to hand over what he felt might be his most accomplished work, and so he decided to paint another version of the yellow "Sunflowers" to exchange with a work by Gauguin. He completed that one in January 1889, but never sent it.
These two paintings, both called "Sunflowers," are generally accepted as the finest of several depictions of the thick-stemmed, nodding blooms that van Gogh made in 1888 and 1889 during his time in Arles. The first is now in the collection of the National Gallery in London, and the second is in the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam.
Van Gogh referred to this work as a "repetition" of the London painting. But art historians and curators have long been curious to know how different this "repetition" is from the first. Should it be considered a copy, an independent artwork or something in between?
An extensive research project conducted over the past three years by conservation experts at both the National Gallery and the Van Gogh Museum has concluded that the second painting was "not intended as an exact copy of the original example," said Ella Hendriks, a professor of conservation and restoration at the University of Amsterdam, who was the lead researcher on the project.
"Though the basic palette is the same, there were different colors that were used, differences in paint texturing, and his brushwork is different," she said.
Although both the London version and the Amsterdam version are too fragile to travel, it was possible to conduct a kind of virtual side-by-side comparison of the works using new mobile scanning technologies.
Rather than removing the paintings from the galleries for physical analysis, or taking invasive paint samples -- once common practice -- researchers brought mobile digital scanning devices into the museum that could map paint layers, brushwork and pigments without touching the artwork. They could then compare the data from each work.
The Van Gogh Museum shared this information in an interview with The New York Times before the opening of the museum's summer exhibition, "Van Gogh and the Sunflowers," which runs from Friday through Sept. 1. Along with the museum's "Sunflowers," some 20 other works from the museum's permanent collection, mostly depicting flowers, are on display, along with two loans.
Nienke Bakker, the exhibition's curator, said the research helped to understand something more about the nature of van Gogh's relationship with Gauguin.
When Gauguin wrote to van Gogh praising the painting and asking for it, van Gogh was flattered but didn't want "to give it away," she said. "If Gauguin hadn't asked, who knows if the other versions would have been made."
All told, van Gogh painted 11 works in which sunflowers are the primary subject, and more in which they play a role, Ms. Bakker said. He made four of these in Paris, and seven in Arles. Of those seven, two have disappeared from public view: one was destroyed in a fire in Japan during an Allied bombing of Osaka during World War II; another is in a private collection that has not made the work available for loan to any museums, Ms. Bakker said.
There are five paintings in public museums that are generally thought of today as part of van Gogh's "Sunflowers" series, all of essentially the same bouquet in the same ceramic pot, set against either a yellow or a pale blue background. Apart from the London and Amsterdam versions, the other three are in Munich, Tokyo and Philadelphia.
Most of them are now too fragile to travel. The National Gallery has only lent its painting three times: to the Van Gogh Museum in 2002 and 2013, and to the Van Gogh and Britain exhibition at Tate Britain across town, currently running through Aug. 11.
The Van Gogh Museum decided to stop lending its version last year, because conservators found that the chrome yellow pigments van Gogh used are unstable and could start to turn green and brown. To avoid changes already observed at a microscopic level from becoming visible, Ms. Bakker said, "you have to avoid vibrations and changes in climate, temperature and humidity."
The last time the National Gallery "Sunflowers" and the Van Gogh Museum "Sunflowers" were brought together was in 2013 and 2014, for jointly organized exhibitions at both institutions.
In this Van Gogh Museum exhibition, videos of all five "Sunflowers" paintings are presented on adjacent screens, showing the works in their museum settings, and zooming in on details that are both similar and different, so viewers can see how van Gogh's "repetitions" vary.
"It's impossible to reunite all of these paintings again," Ms. Bakker said. "It's rather sad, but on the other hand, we have to keep them and preserve them for future generations."

The 10% bonus that Trump needs

Texto completo: True, polls have very limited value at this stage of a presidential campaign. Yes, Democrats are far from choosing their nominee to oppose President Donald Trump. Of course, a great deal can change between now and Election Day.
Or maybe not.
Since Trump’s victory, the political balance has remained remarkably stable, and that’s both good and bad news for a president who formally launched his re-election campaign this week with a raucous rally in Florida.
On the plus side for Trump, his base shows no signs of cracking. When the president mused on Twitter recently that his supporters "would demand" he stay in office after eight years — a totally unconstitutional idea — he was accurately reflecting their unswerving devotion. "To too many people, he’s not a human being. He’s a demigod," said conservative radio host Michael Savage to The New York Times.
But the downside of this frozen landscape is equally obvious. Trump’s core base of support hovers between 35% and 37% of the electorate, and despite their fervid loyalty, that base is simply not large enough to guarantee him a second term. Trump won 46.4% of the vote in 2016, and he needs at least a 10% margin above and beyond his base — call it the 10% bonus — to have a realistic chance at a second term.
Recent polls clearly reveal the president’s peril. Two surveys in Michigan, one of three states that gave Trump his margin of victory in 2016, show Trump trailing former Vice President Joe Biden by double digits. In Pennsylvania, a Quinnipiac poll had Biden beating Trump by 11 points. A national survey conducted by Fox News put Biden ahead by a similar margin.
An average of all national polls puts Trump’s favorable rating at 43.3%. As Peter Baker points out in The Times, "He is the only president in the history of polling who has never once, not for a single day, earned the support of a majority of Americans surveyed by Gallup."
Trump’s real base is actually even smaller. In 2016, only 38% of voters told exit polls he was qualified to be president, 35% said he had the proper temperament, and 33% described him as honest and trustworthy.
The president enters the race with many strengths. The unemployment rate of 3.6% in May was the lowest in 50 years, and in the latest CNN poll, 56% approved of his economic policies, a new high. Trump, who never really stopped campaigning, enjoys a huge lead over the Democrats in building a national organization and raising money. Above all, the Democrats are far from producing a candidate who can generate the sort of energy and excitement that powered the campaigns of Barack Obama and Bill Clinton, the only successful Democrats in more than 40 years.
For all the turmoil generated by the Trump presidency, not much has changed politically since his election. His base remains just about the same. He won in 2016 because about 1 in 10 voters who were not part of that base, and who had serious doubts about his character and qualifications, disliked Hillary Clinton enough to vote for him anyway. Can Trump win over that 10% again? The election could well hinge on the answer.

A president who sleeps on the job? We would all rest easier.

Texto completo: George W. Bush made plenty of bad decisions during his presidency, but he began it with a very good one: He left the inaugural ball an hour ahead of schedule to get to bed. This was in keeping with his practice of getting plenty of sleep -- often nine hours a night.
His regular schedule fed the accusation that he was lazy. But given his record, it's hard to conclude that he would have been a better president had he been sleep-deprived.
The Democratic presidential candidates are busy staking out positions, preparing policy statements and trying to outdo each other in wonkiness. Elizabeth Warren's unlikely rallying cry is: "I have a plan for that." I will get around to digging through the details, but in the meantime I have a simpler and far more important basis on which to judge the contenders.
Recently, The New York Times asked them: "How many hours of sleep do you get a night?" This allows me to winnow out Eric Swalwell ("probably around four"), Seth Moulton (usually five or six) and Julian Castro (rarely more than five). It counts against Kamala Harris, Bernie Sanders and Beto O'Rourke, who all gave the same alarming answer: "Not enough."
I am not impressed with Pete Buttigieg ("It depends on the night") or Cory Booker ("It wildly varies"); neither answer indicates a firm dedication to adequate rest. Jay Inslee and Marianne Williamson were annoyingly vague. Tulsi Gabbard, Bill de Blasio and Amy Klobuchar did not inspire confidence, at six hours a night.
Tim Ryan and John Hickenlooper rose on my list, with both claiming a minimum of seven hours on the mattress. But they were beat out by Warren, who replied, "Sometimes as much as eight."
The slumber champ? Kirsten Gillibrand, who said with a blithe smile, "Eight or nine."
It's no secret that inadequate sleep has bad effects on mood, physical fitness and cognitive function, which are kind of a big deal for someone with all the power and responsibility that go with the presidency. I would not want to make a decision on whether to tell off Kim Jong Un, sign a huge tax bill or send in the 101st Airborne while bleary-eyed.
Donald Trump says he gets only four or five hours per night, which leaves him a lot of time to compose tweets betraying the sort of irritability that comes from chronic insomnia. Even Republicans would much prefer him to be snoring peacefully at 5 a.m. than unleashing an all-caps blast on his smartphone.
The dangers of sleep deprivation are bipartisan. Bill Clinton was famous for staying up late and expecting others to be available.
His energy secretary Bill Richardson said that whenever his home phone rang at 1 a.m., it was the president. Clinton admitted his folly: "In my long political career, most of the mistakes I made, I made when I was too tired."
Barack Obama, who had more regular habits, still got only five to seven hours per night. Aides often got emails after midnight. It may have eventually dawned on him that this was not sensible. Late in his second term, he revealed his post-White House plan: "I am going to take three, four months where I just sleep."
Maybe Obama would have avoided some pitfalls if he hadn't been operating on an accumulated sleep deficit. I've never heard of anyone attributing a mistake to being too well-rested.
Ronald Reagan, who was among our more successful recent presidents, was famous for getting plenty of z's. Before taking office, when informed that his White House national security adviser would arrive to brief him at 7:30 each morning, Reagan chortled, "Well, he's going to have a hell of a long wait."
Candidates who make a habit of getting enough rest exhibit discipline and prudence that is especially crucial in the crucible of the White House. A president who fails to account for the importance of sleep is likely to be chronically overwhelmed and distracted.
Warren and Gillibrand know that going to bed late and getting up early are taken as markers of toughness and dedication, and they don't care. They know what they need to perform, and they make a point of getting it. Their indifference to being accused of sloth indicates a secure sense of self-esteem, which is a valuable trait.
I for one will never complain about a politician who puts in long hours under the sheets. Presidents are like young children. They're all angels when they're sleeping.

Family secrets: Which to keep and others to share

Texto completo: Family secrets, every family has them. But should your estate plan be one of those secrets?
In my law practice, I am often asked by parents if they should provide a copy of their estate planning documents to their adult child(ren), or at least discuss the plan with them. And the typical lawyer answer I give is “it depends.” And it does.
It depends on the ages of those folks; whether you’re likely to make significant changes in the future; if there is anything unusual in your plan; whether anyone is being disinherited or inheriting less than what they might expect; and your relationship with the heirs and beneficiaries in general.
There are, however, some general rules.
What not to keep secret
Someone besides you (and your spouse, if applicable) should know where your documents are stored.
By the time your will, trust, health care directive, or power of attorney is needed, you are either deceased or incapacitated, so you won’t be available to hand over keys or combinations or directions to your secret storage spot.
Generally, it’s not a good idea to keep your documents in a bank safe deposit box either — access to these is notoriously difficult and they can’t be reached as quickly as may be needed in an emergency.
Your heirs and beneficiaries should know which attorney drafted your documents and how to reach them.
It’s a good idea to inform your heirs who you’ve put in charge when you’re gone. The trustee of your trust will have immediate duties and responsibilities. It’s good for them to be aware of their role ahead of time so they are prepared and willing to act.
The job of trustee is a big one — it’s not necessarily an “honor.” Thus, let them all know whom you’ve selected and why. You might find out the person you chose doesn’t want to serve, or the others object to that choice for very valid reasons.
I once had a client choose one child as trustee because the other four children “liked” that child. But during the family meeting to review the plan with all the children, it became clear that while they may have liked that child, they did not respect him. We could all see he wasn’t likely to act fairly either. Luckily, it was also apparent there was one child they all did respect. We made the change immediately.
If you are disinheriting a child or leaving one child less than the others, it’s generally a good idea to make that known ahead of time as well as your reasons for doing so. If you aren’t comfortable telling that child directly, let your attorney and your other children, and perhaps a trusted friend or adviser, know your reasons for the disinheritance. You may be able to avoid a costly fight later.
Secrets you might keep
You may want to keep the dispositive provisions of your estate plan (i.e. who gets what and when) confidential. Your children don’t need to know if you’ve left a charitable gift in addition to what you’ve left them, or how much you have, or that you’ve left the grandchildren something as well. Those things often change over time.
If you’re concerned about the spending habits of the spouse of one of your children, or the possibility of a child divorcing, you can arrange for that child’s share to be held in trust to maintain its separate property status (in California). That might be awkward to bring up at a family dinner, so you don’t have to go into details. You can simply let your child know you’ve provided for them in a trust that will give them creditor protection. (“Creditor” includes future ex-spouses, but doesn’t “creditor protection” sound so much nicer?).
Your list of assets and liabilities isn’t something anyone needs to know currently. But there should be a list (often it’s attached to your trust) and contact information readily available so that the trustee or agent acting under a power of attorney can spring into action when needed.
Many times I’ve seen family members struggle to find out where the bank accounts are, whether there was a mortgage on the house, and if there was any insurance, for weeks and months, which causes a delay in the entire administration process and unnecessary stress during an already stressful time.
Don’t take it to the grave
Finally, you’d be doing your family members a great favor if you talked about your wishes for end-of-life care and memorial services. It’s a difficult topic, but an important one. Talk about whether you want to be an organ donor, your desires for pain medication, life support and CPR.
If you prefer cremation or burial, let your loved ones know. The more plans you make on your own, including pre-paid burial arrangements, and share with your loved ones, the less their burden will be when they are grieving your loss. They’ll be able to focus on celebrating you and your life, your final gift to them.

Texto completo: President Trump on Thursday called off retaliatory strikes at the last minute that targeted three Iranian sites following the downing of a US Navy drone over the strategic Strait of Hormuz earlier in the day.
How did he come to that decision?
There were no official statements issued Friday morning to clarify the internal deliberations that led to the last-minute stand-down. But Trump himself offered explanations — and reporters in Washington were on the hunt to fill out the picture.
Here's what we know:
■ Trump posted four tweets Friday criticizing the Iran nuclear deal, justifying why he terminated it, and saying that, after imposition of “strong sanctions," Iran was now “Bust!"
He went on to say that “10 minutes before the strike," he had learned 150 people would die.
“I stopped it, not proportionate to shooting down an unmanned drone," he said, adding that he was in “no hurry."
Here are his tweets:
■ Trump elaborated in an NBC News interview Friday with Chuck Todd, saying that after he was told at the last minute about the projected casualties, “I thought about it for a second and I said, you know what, they shot down an unmanned drone, plane, whatever you want to call it, and here we are sitting with 150 dead people that would have taken place probably within a half an hour after I said go ahead, and I didn't like it, I didn't think, I didn't think it was proportionate."
■ During deliberations about the proposed strikes in the White House Situation Room on Thursday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo argued that sanctions were having a powerful effect by slashing Iran's oil revenues, a senior administration official familiar with the discussion told the New York Times.
Pompeo, who is a hawk on Iran, favored some kind of pinpointed military response to the drone strike, the official said. But the secretary of state also emphasized to Trump that the sanctions were having the long-term effect that the administration had hoped. The newspaper said Trump's tweets Friday suggested he may have listened to Pompeo.
■ National security advisor John Bolton, another hawk on Iran, pushed Trump to order the strike. Trump changed his mind based on “some additional information," an official told Bloomberg News. The news service didn't say what the information was. Bolton and Trump have been engaged in an ongoing debate about how to handle Iran, a senior White House official told CNN earlier Thursday. The Wall Street Journal reported that Boston pushed “military options," while Pompeo was “more understanding of reservations expressed by Defense Department officials."
■ The Times reported that one person familiar with Trump's thinking said he was pleased with Thursday night's events because he liked the “command" of approving the strike, but also the decisiveness of calling it off.
■ The Associated Press reported Pompeo, Bolton, and a number of top national security advisers and congressional leaders attended the briefing in the Situation Room. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy told "Fox and Friends" on Friday that Trump “was very clear that there will be action." But House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said no specific plans were discussed. US Representative Adam Schiff, the Democratic chairman of the House intelligence committee, said "the president certainly was listening" when congressional leaders at the meeting urged him to be cautious and not escalate the already tense situation.

N.R.A., Citing Attempt To Oust Chief, Suspends Its 2nd-Highest Official

Texto completo: The palace intrigue at the National Rifle Association deepened on Thursday as the gun group suspended its second-in-command and top lobbyist, accusing him of complicity in the recent failed coup against its chief executive, Wayne LaPierre.
The accusation came in a lawsuit filed Wednesday night in New York State Supreme Court against Oliver North, the N.R.A.'s former president, who led the attempt to oust Mr. LaPierre shortly before the group's annual convention in April. The complaint provides new details about the effort against Mr. LaPierre, but it is the involvement of the organization's No. 2 official, Christopher, W. Cox, that will reverberate.
In the suit, the N.R.A. said that text messages and emails demonstrated that "another errant N.R.A. fiduciary, Chris Cox -- once thought by some to be a likely successor for Mr. LaPierre -- participated" in what was described as a conspiracy.
The court filing includes text exchanges in which Mr. Cox and a board member appear to be discussing an effort to oust Mr. LaPierre, though the full context is unclear. The N.R.A. is conducting an internal review of the matter, and a spokesman, Andrew Arulanandam, said on Thursday that both Mr. Cox and a top aide, Scott Christman, had been placed on administrative leave.
Mr. Cox, in a statement, said: "The allegations against me are offensive and patently false. For over 24 years I have been a loyal and effective leader in this organization. My efforts have always been focused on serving the members of the National Rifle Association, and I will continue to focus all of my energy on carrying out our core mission of defending the Second Amendment."
The suit -- the latest in a series of legal actions stemming from the gun group's internal turmoil -- is likely to send new shock waves through the N.R.A. While Mr. North served as president for just one year, Mr. Cox has worked for the N.R.A. since 1995 and led its lobbying arm since 2002. He has been a leading presence at the organization's gatherings, reliably serving up red meat for the N.R.A.'s base.
Among other things, he has been a fervent defender of the AR-15, the semiautomatic rifle used in many mass shootings, telling attendees at the group's convention last year that "we have an AR culture that's on display all over the exhibit halls this weekend."
Together, Mr. Cox, 49, and Mr. LaPierre, 69, have been the public faces of the N.R.A., the twin architects of its strategy. But they have had an uneasy relationship, and their staffs are somewhat siloed from each other. Mr. Cox runs the N.R.A.'s lobbying arm, the Institute for Legislative Action, which has a separate media relations team from the N.R.A.'s, and his choice of consultants has also sometimes diverged from Mr. LaPierre's.
As Mr. North's coup attempt played out at the convention this spring, some people inside the N.R.A. said Mr. Cox largely kept quiet and appeared to be hedging his bets.
Jennifer Baker, a spokeswoman for the N.R.A.'s lobbying arm, said Mr. Cox and Mr. LaPierre had "worked closely together for a quarter of a century, and any notion that Chris participated in a coup is absurd. Chris Cox is known as a calming force who always acts in the best interests of our members by effectively defending the Second Amendment, so it's not surprising that board members would reach out to him for advice during tumultuous times."
But Carolyn D. Meadows, who succeeded Mr. North as N.R.A. president, said in a statement: "I fully support the actions undertaken today. The N.R.A. is moving forward on all fronts, especially with regard to serving our members and focusing on the crucial upcoming elections."
The genesis of the dispute between the N.R.A. and Mr. North is a related legal battle between the N.R.A. and its most prominent contractor, the Oklahoma-based advertising firm Ackerman McQueen, which employed Mr. North. The N.R.A. has sued Ackerman, claiming it withheld documents and records from the gun group, and some officials have suggested the company may also have been overbilling. Ackerman, which has said it did nothing improper, filed a countersuit claiming that it was smeared by the N.R.A.
In yet another lawsuit, the N.R.A. has accused Ackerman of breaching confidentiality clauses in its contract and smearing Mr. LaPierre.
The new lawsuit seeks to block Mr. North's attempt to have the N.R.A. pay his legal fees, which he has sought as he fields requests to cooperate with other litigation as well as a Senate inquiry.
"The N.R.A. believes that Col. North seeks payments from the Association to which he is not entitled," the N.R.A.'s outside counsel, William A. Brewer III, said in a statement. (Mr. North is a retired Marine lieutenant colonel who first came to prominence during the Iran-Contra hearings.) "The N.R.A. alleges that Col. North breached his fiduciary obligations -- in a coordinated attack against the N.R.A. and Wayne LaPierre that involved others motivated by their own economic self-interest," Mr. Brewer added.
In addition to implicating Mr. Cox, the new lawsuit claims that another N.R.A. board member, the former Oklahoma congressman Dan Boren, participated in the effort to oust Mr. LaPierre, and it presents a piece of evidence intended to shed light on the overbilling question.
Mr. Boren is close to Ackerman and works for another Ackerman client, the Oklahoma-based Chickasaw Nation. In an exhibit filed in the latest complaint, Mr. Boren expressed concern to a Chickasaw official that Ackerman was billing the N.R.A. for "full salary to these employees that may have been working on our accounts," adding, "I bet Ackerman is in trouble on this one."
Another key issue in the N.R.A.'s battle with Ackerman is the role of Mr. North, who was employed by Ackerman while serving as the N.R.A.'s president; the N.R.A. has claimed that the arrangement was improper and that Ackerman wouldn't show the N.R.A. a copy of Mr. North's contract for months. Mr. North has said Mr. LaPierre helped negotiate the contract.
Mr. North is said to have sparked the coup by delivering a threatening message to a key aide to Mr. LaPierre shortly before the N.R.A. convention in April, warning that damaging revelations about the N.R.A.'s spending on Mr. LaPierre's clothing and travel would be released if he did not step aside. He also said Mr. LaPierre would be well rewarded financially if he stepped down. Mr. LaPierre refused to step aside, and the embarrassing material was indeed released, though it is not clear by whom.
The latest suit calls this "a conspiracy by North to extort the N.R.A."
Any move against Mr. Cox could lead to further litigation. He is one of three senior executives who are contractually entitled to receive their base pay for one to four years if they are dismissed without cause, or in some other instances, according to Massachusetts State records reviewed by The New York Times.
The N.R.A., however, seems to be losing patience with paying those it considers to have betrayed Mr. LaPierre.
"Simply put, the N.R.A. exists to fight for the Second Amendment," the group said in its latest suit, "not pay other people's bills."

Texto completo: Called Iran attack 'very big mistake'
Destruction of U.S. drone heightens fear of conflict President Trump ordered an attack on Iran on Thursday in retaliation for the downing of a surveillance drone in the Strait of Hormuz, but called the operation off just hours before it was due to occur, officials said.
Administration officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive national security decisions, said the president approved the counterstrikes after Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) earlier in the day shot down a Navy RQ-4 operating off Iran's southern coast, a move Trump described as a "very big mistake."
But he later changed his mind, the officials said. It was not immediately clear why Trump decided to pull back the operation or what it would have included. The decision was first reported by the New York Times.
The aborted operation capped a day in which news of the drone's targeting heaped fuel on already heightened fears that the United States and Iran are on a course toward a military conflict as each side blamed the other for the incident.
Tehran and Washington gave conflicting accounts of what occurred when the massive drone crashed into the sea. While Iran said it had entered its airspace, U.S. Central Command denied that assertion, characterizing the incident as an "unprovoked attack" over one of the world's most important commercial waterways.
In remarks alongside visiting Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau at the White House, Trump condemned the shoot-down but also appeared to tamp down speculation that a counterstrike might be in the works, saying the drone may have been shot down without the knowledge of Iranian leaders.
"I'm not just talking about the country made a mistake. I'm talking about somebody under the command of that country made a mistake," Trump said at the White House. "I find it hard to believe it was intentional" on the part of Iran's top officials, the president said.
Trump was noncommittal about a U.S. counterattack. "Let's see what happens," he said. "This is a new fly in the ointment - what happened, shooting down the drone - and this country will not stand for it."
The White House invited a bipartisan group of top congressional leaders to a meeting Thursday afternoon to discuss the situation.
Among those invited were Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) and the chairmen and ranking minority party members of the House and Senate Intelligence and Armed Services committees.
"We had a good briefing," McConnell said, adding that he could confirm that an unmanned aerial vehicle "was fired on from Iranian soil and it was in international waters. And beyond that I think the administration is engaged in what I would call measured responses."
Schumer said he cautioned that "these conflicts have a way of escalating."
"The president may not intend to go to war here, but we're worried that he and the administration may bumble into a war," he said. "One of the best ways to avoid bumbling into war, a war that nobody wants, is to have a robust open debate and for Congress to have a real say. We learned that lesson in the run-up to Iraq" in 2003.
After the White House meeting, Pelosi held a closed-door session with Democratic lawmakers to brief them on the developments. "We know that the high-tension wires are up there, and we must do everything we can not to escalate the situation, but also to make sure that our personnel in the region are safe," she said.
Thursday's strike capped a number of recent incidents, including attacks on oil tankers, that American officials have depicted as part of an Iranian effort to hurt the United States and its allies in the region. The attack on the drone comes as the United States continues its "maximum pressure" campaign against a country the Trump administration has identified as its main adversary in the Middle East.
Tehran has responded with defiance to the initiative, which was launched after Trump withdrew the United States from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal and has included designating the IRGC as a terrorist group and taking steps to cut off Iranian oil sales.
On Thursday, the European Union said officials from Germany, Britain, France, Russia, China and Iran would meet next week to discuss strategies to salvage the nuclear pact despite renewed U.S. sanctions and Tehran's threat to exceed limits on its uranium stockpiles.
The Revolutionary Guard's top commander, Maj. Gen. Hossein Salami, called the downing of the drone "a clear message to America."
"Our borders are Iran's red line, and we will react strongly against any aggression," Salami said in remarks carried by Iranian state television. "Iran is not seeking war with any country, but we are fully prepared to defend Iran."
Nearly a quarter of the world's oil passes through the Strait of Hormuz, which connects Middle East energy producers to markets around the globe.
Lt. Gen. Joseph Guastella, head of U.S. air forces in the Middle East, told reporters at the Pentagon that the Global Hawk was flying at high altitude in the vicinity of recent tanker attacks and was not at any time any closer than 21 miles to the nearest point on Iran's coast.
Guastella said the aircraft did not leave international airspace and was brought down by an IRGC surface-to-air missile fired from an area close to Goruk, Iran.
"This dangerous and escalatory attack was irresponsible and occurred in the vicinity of established air corridors between Dubai, UAE, and Muscat, Oman, possibly endangering innocent civilians," he said. Guastella did not take questions, and the Pentagon did not make anyone else available to discuss the tensions.
The Global Hawk incident occurs the week after two tankers, one Japanese and one Norwegian, were attacked in the area of the Gulf of Oman. The Trump administration has blamed Iran for both incidents, at least one of which is said to have been carried out by use of limpet mine similar to devices previously displayed at Iranian military parades. Iran has denied involvement, calling the accusation "a lie."
The tanker incidents were similar to an attack on a tanker off the United Arab Emirates in May. The U.S. military also accused Iran of firing a modified SA-7 surface-to-air missile at an MQ-9 Reaper drone over the Gulf of Oman as it surveilled the attack on the Japanese ship.
Also this month, Centcom said Houthi rebels shot down an MQ-9 over Yemen using an SA-6 surface-to-air missile in an attack that "was enabled by Iranian assistance."
The latest incident occurs just days before acting defense secretary Patrick Shanahan steps down. Shanahan, who this week withdrew from his confirmation process after news media including The Washington Post published reports about past family strife, is handing responsibility for the military to Mark Esper, who now serves as Army secretary.
It is unclear how the turnover at the top of the Pentagon will affect an internal debate about how to respond to what officials say is an attempt to strike American interests. Some defense officials have voiced concerns that officials led by national security adviser John Bolton, who has publicly advocated regime change in Iran in the past, may be creating conditions in which war is inevitable.
Trump appeared to tamp down the likelihood of an immediate military response as he highlighted the fact that the Global Hawk was unmanned. "We had nobody in the drone," he said. "It would have made a big difference, let me tell you."
Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) tweeted, "When it comes to the Middle East, there are seldom good choices."
"But in some instances, failing to act can prove to be the most dangerous choice of all," he said.
A U.S. official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said U.S. naval assets were trying to recover pieces of the drone.

Texto completo: Far too many law enforcement officers - from rookies to the highest ranking - view African Americans as "dogs," and some punch in believing that, "it's a good day for a chokehold."
Others believe women in hijabs are tantamount to "trash bags."
Those of just some of the alarming public posts on Facebook written by police officers in departments across the country - they were identified by the Philadelphia-based Plain View Project, a database that chronicles police use of social media.
Already, authorities in Philadelphia and St. Louis said they've opened an Internal Affairs investigation into the posts, which number exceeds 3,000, according to the Plain View Project.
The departments thus far implicated are Dallas, Tex; Denison, Tex.; Lake County, Fla.; Philadelphia, Penn; Phoenix; St. Louis, Mo; Twin Falls, Idaho; and York, Penn.
The Plain View Project, headed by Philadelphiabased attorney, Emily BakerWhite, said its analysis determined that at least 328 active-duty police officers posted content that championed violence against Muslims, immigrants and African Americans.
"We found a very high and concerning number of posts that appear to endorse, celebrate or glorify violence and vigilantism," BakerWhite said in a televised interview with ABC News.
"We included posts that we thought could affect public trust and policing," she said.
"We also included posts that seemed to emit some sort of bias against a group of people - whether if that's a minority faith, a minority race, ethnicity, immigration status, whatever it is. We saw a number of posts that appeared to denigrate those groups of people," BakerWhite said.
Philadelphia Police Commissioner Richard
Ross confirmed that an investigation is underway in that city.
"We have reviewed the social media transcriptions you provided and find many of them to be not only incongruent with our standards and policies, but also troubling on a human level," Ross said in a statement.
While some of the Facebook posts, which also included images of the Confederate flag, have been deleted, the Plain View Project provided screenshots of the posts in their public online database.
Since its establishment in 2017, the group has compiled more than 5,000 posts from current and former officers, both in big cities such as Dallas and in smaller jurisdictions like Lake County, Florida.
The St. Louis Police Officers' Association said it has contacted the Council on American Islamic Relations to set up a meeting but declined further comment.
"We strongly condemn violence and racism in any form. The overwhelming majority of our seven-thousand officers regularly act with integrity and professionalism," Philadelphia Fraternal Order of Police Lodge #5 President John McNesby said in a statement.
Baker-White told the New York Times that the Facebook posts are far from isolated incidents and are very disconcerting.
"One of the reasons that I don't think it's an individual problem is that these folks are talking to each other. There are a lot of posts that have eight comments underneath them, and three of those comments are by other police officers, and in those long comment threads you often see a kind of piling on," Baker-White said.
"If one guy makes a comment that's sort of violent, another guy will say, 'Oh, that's not enough, I would have hit him harder. ' 'I would have shot him. 'I would have killed him. '
"It creates a space where officers feel like this is what they should do or think, and I fear that leads more officers to do and think this stuff," she said.
Baker-White acknowledges the tough job of law enforcement in general.
"Yes, police officers have an incredibly hard job," she said. "There's probably an incredible amount of PTSD; there's an incredible amount of stress. But, it's not OK then to say, 'Let's go get these animals tonight.'"

Descendants of slave, white supremacist join forces on Harvard's campus to demand school hand over 'family photos'

Texto completo: CAMBRIDGE — Under cover from a torrential downpour, two families came together on Harvard University's campus Thursday to demand that the institution turn over historical photographs of two slaves and reckon with its history of white supremacy.
Tamara Lanier, a Connecticut woman who sued Harvard in March, has said she's a descendant of Renty and his daughter Delia, two slaves who were forced in 1850 to pose naked for daguerreotypes, or early photographs. She said the images, discovered in 1976 and stored in Harvard's Peabody Museum, rightfully belong to her, and her lawsuit alleges that Harvard is “shamelessly capitalizing" on them.
She was joined at a press conference Thursday by descendants of controversial Harvard scientist Louis Agassiz, who commissioned the daguerreotypes in an attempt to support his theory of white biological superiority.
“I feel like I've been lifted into this extraordinary story that this woman is leading," Marian Moore, the great-great-great-granddaughter of Agassiz, said while standing with Lanier out of the rain under a concrete overhang. They were just hundreds of feet from where campus buildings bearing the Agassiz name stood. “It's like the chance of a lifetime, really."
Moore said she learned about Lanier's quest to obtain the daguerreotypes through a New York Times story, and reached out to Lanier via social media.
“I immediately contacted [Moore], and we have bonded," said Lanier, who is Renty's great-great-great-granddaughter. “When you think about . . . the fact that you have the linear descendants of Renty and the linear descendants of Louis Agassiz standing in solidarity, it's just amazing."
Harvard has used Renty's image several times, including on the cover of a 2017 anthropology book.
“Harvard has and will continue to come to terms with and address its historic connection to slavery," Harvard spokeswoman Rachael Dane said, stressing that the museum's high standards for preservation help maintain the fragile photos. “Harvard also strives to be an ethical steward of the millions of historical objects from around the globe within its museum and library collections."
In April, Harvard's president, Lawrence Bacow, told the student newspaper The Crimson that he thinks Harvard has “the law on our side" when it comes to possession of the daguerreotypes. The school charges a small fee for reproductions, but doesn't profit from the photos, officials have said.
“Again, I would hope, though, that we could resolve this not purely by resort to legal process," Bacow told The Crimson.
But Moore said she thinks turning over the images could help Harvard begin “crucial work of deep reckoning and repair." Her sister Susanna said she thinks the “family photos" belong to Lanier.
“Louis Agassiz, backed by Harvard University, offered a biological basis to white supremacy," Susanna Moore said. “The myth is maintained to this day by . . . institutions like Harvard, who are still saying, 'No.' It's time for reparations."
The reparations Lanier is seeking “will be significant, because the harm is significant and the benefit [Harvard] received was significant" according to Josh Koskoff, one of Lanier's attorneys. Her legal team also includes civil rights lawyer Ben Crump, who represented the family of Trayvon Martin, an African-American teenager who in 2012 was shot and killed by a community watch member in Florida.
After Thursday's clandestine press conference, announced at the last minute to avoid the possibility of Harvard officials kicking the families off campus, the group unfurled umbrellas and embarked on a soggy slog through campus to Bacow's office in Massachusetts Hall.
“Tammy sent many, many e-mails, and many, many letters, and has only been rebuffed," Susanna Moore said. “And so we're hoping that with a more public demand that they pay attention."
The plan was to hand-deliver Bacow a letter signed by 43 Agassiz descendants, demanding that Harvard turn over the photos. The families hoped the show of unity would pressure the school to relent.
“For Harvard to give the daguerreotypes to Ms. Lanier and her family would begin to make amends for its use of the photos as exhibits for the white supremacist theory Agassiz espoused," the letter said. “It is time for Harvard to recognize Renty and Delia as people."
But the group was met at the door to Massachusetts Hall by a startled security guard who barred access to the building.
The families didn't get to see Bacow, but they did get to drop off their letter.
“We have received it, and have no further comment," Dane told the Globe on Thursday afternoon.
“They said that president Bacow is not available. . . . Whether he's here or not, I don't know," Moore said. “It's completely predictable that he would not be willing to see us, because then he would have to face his lack of humanity."

Face off? Americans fear privacy loss to recognition software

Resumen: Police departments and tech companies are using facial recognition software, and that has profound implications for privacy and anonymity.

Texto completo: As facial recognition becomes more widespread, now appearing at check-ins for international flights, New York City apartment buildings, and even 24-hour convenience stores, more Americans are worried that public anonymity could become a thing of the past.
A poll released Wednesday by the market research company Morning Consult and the news outlet Politico, found support for facial recognition technology slipping among registered voters.
According to the survey, 42% approve of the technology, compared to 49% in August 2018. On Tuesday, a poll released by the American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts found that more than 9 in 10 voters in that state supported a state bill regulating how the government uses facial recognition, with nearly 8 in 10 supporting an outright moratorium.
Concerns about the technology – which uses sophisticated machine-learning algorithms to analyze facial features from a photo and match them with other photos that contain the same features –  span the political spectrum. According to the Massachusetts survey, 84% of Democrats, 82% of independents, and half of Republicans favor a moratorium.
“There are interesting alliances and strange bedfellows in the privacy world,” says Kade Crockford, director of the Technology for Liberty program at the ACLU of Massachusetts. “There does remain in the United States thankfully a relatively deep mistrust of government power, which I think is a very healthy thing.”
Already a feature used in unlocking high-end phones, facial recognition technology offers the promise of a world of seamless check-ins, payments, and other convenient identity checks.
And then there’s the promise of catching criminals, including suspects who may have been photographed stealing a package from a doorstep or breaking into a car, says Daniel Castro, vice president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a tech-policy think tank in Washington, D.C. “If police are going to have to say in the future, ‘Sorry, we can’t do anything, we can’t run facial recognition to find the person because of a law,’ I don’t think most people are going to be happy with that,” he says.
The technology is already being used to combat far more grevious crimes. On Wednesday, Wired reported that a nonprofit combatting human trafficking had developed a tool to match faces in online ads with police evidence to identify child victims of sex abuse.
Still, legislators in some cities are not buying the promise of increased security.
In May, San Francisco became the first U.S. city to ban the technology by law enforcement. Other cities considering bans are nearby Oakland and Berkeley, as well as Somerville, Massachusetts, a densely populated city in the Boston metro area. The Massachusetts legislature is also mulling a moratorium, backed by the ACLU of Massachusetts, on face recognition and other technology that can identify people at a distance by their voice, gait, or other immutable “biometric” features.
Also in May, members of the U.S. House Oversight and Reform Committee showed rare bipartisan unity in voicing deep concerns about the technology, which is built by companies like Amazon, IBM, Microsoft, and Google.
And last August, workers at these companies walked out or otherwise staged protests against their employers’ contracts with law enforcement, immigration enforcement, and the Pentagon. Facial recognition technology played a prominent role in the protests at Amazon and Microsoft.
A surveillance society Currently there are no federal laws governing how law enforcement may use facial recognition, nor is it clear how many of the country’s roughly 18,000 police departments are currently using it. But the technology is inexpensive and user-friendly: In April, The New York Times surveilled a park in midtown Manhattan for less than $100 and were able to successfully identify passersby.
“The practice of setting up citywide networks of ‘smart’ surveillance cameras ... that is, to me, a total surveillance society,” says Mx. Crockford (who prefers a gender-neutral attribution). It could “enable government or anyone else to create a permanent and invasive record, not just of one person’s habits, associations, and movements, but of every person, and not on one day but on all days.”
Face recognition, says Mx. Crockford, could undermine an implicit social contract that makes cities what they are. “Cities are spaces of anonymity. ... The growth of the modern metropolis has provided people with a degree of freedom through anonymity that is kind of unprecedented. ... That’s why gay people move to cities, because we could be free in those places. I mean relatively free.”
Cities offer an ability to reinvent oneself, to break with the past to a certain extent, and the ability to do this might be crucial to some peoples’ mental well-being. In a paper published last year in the Journal of Medical Ethics, Stanford University psychiatrist Elias Aboujaoude argued that establishing a “modern privacy bill of rights” should be a public health priority.
“Privacy mediates some very important psychological processes,” he says. “When you look at mechanisms such as recovery after a setback for rejuvenation or catharsis … all have been shown to require privacy.”
Dr. Aboujaoude cited the positive public health implications of a European Union law that created in 2014 a “right to be forgotten” online. The EU’s General Data Protection Regulation, passed last year, further restricts how companies can use people’s identifiable information, including images of their faces.
Scoring citizens in a ‘smart city’ China’s privacy norms, meanwhile, have been trending in the opposite direction. The country’s Social Credit System, a national social and economic reputation system that assigns a score to every citizen, is expected to go online nationwide next year. Already, the system has been used to restrict individuals’ travel.
A Chinese advertisement for a new 5G network by the state-owned China Mobile illustrates how the Chinese government is promoting facial recognition as an asset to public safety. In the ad, an undercover police officer deploys several aspects of a “smart city,” including face surveillance, to arrest a wanted man.
We can’t assume that such a system won’t come to the United States, says Mx. Crockford, pointing out that, for nonwhite citizens in poor neighborhoods, aggressive surveillance by law enforcement is already a feature of daily life.
“It’s all very nice and well for a wealthy white person to say, ‘I’m not worried about that. We’re not China,’” Mx. Crockford says. “Well, why don’t you talk to a young black man from the Bronx about his experience with the government?”
Avoiding a race to the bottom Some corporations may welcome greater public oversight of the technology. In a December blog post Brad Smith, the president of Microsoft, argued that 2019 should be the year that governments step in to regulate facial recognition.
“We don’t believe that the world will be best served by a commercial race to the bottom, with tech companies forced to choose between social responsibility and market success,” he wrote. “We believe that the only way to protect against this race to the bottom is to build a floor of responsibility that supports healthy market competition.”
Mr. Castro of ITIF, which receives funding from tech and telecom companies, argues that outright bans on government use could actually worsen the very problems that they aim to solve.
“It’s important for government to be an early adopter of some of these technologies,” says Mr. Castro. “They can say it is important for us that these technologies are generally neutral in terms of race, that they are not having significant errors and incentivize industry to prioritize that.”

Texto completo: The red Russian hardwood trunks with silver bracketing and removable wheels may not look like much, but inside they're packed with adventure and could revolutionize the way students learn. These red trunks are a product of the Red Trunk Project, a program focused on teaching kids about different cultures around the world. While the trunks are literally red, the "red" also stands for "respect every difference."
"The goal is to give kids a deep immersion into one culture and once they do that, they'll have the tools to uncode any other cultures they interact with throughout their life," said the project's founder, Rockland resident Kevin Thomsen.
"Learn to reach out a hand instead of a fist; to build bridges, not walls."
A producer of video games, toys, shows, ebooks and audiobooks who holds a gold record and a couple of Grammys, Thomsen is also a father of two.
"I have two adopted children, one from the Republic of Georgia, Penelope, and Sefan, from Ethiopia," Thomsen said. "For the past 17 years, the idea of keeping kids close to the culture of their birth has stuck with me. How do you introduce kids to a culture without going there? What's the best way to do this?"
The answer: trunks filled with artifacts, video, virtual reality goggles and a booklet.
Teaching through trunks isn't a new concept, but Thomsen wanted to expand on the idea and hyper-focus on a whole country and its culture, as opposed to a moment in history.
"There are people who do trunk-based kinds of things," Thomsen said, "but it's typically one trunk filled with something like Vietnam memorabilia."
Road to Red Trunks The idea came to Thomsen during an audiobook recording session for "A Path Appears," a book written by New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof and his wife, Sheryl WuDunn. The book profiles charities around the world and found a new way to measure their success.
After a conversation with actress Olivia Wilde, who was recording the book, a light bulb went off in Thomsen's head.
"I was like 'I want to record the stories of children from different countries around the world,'" Thomsen said. "The differences in each other is what makes life interesting."
The idea sat with him for a couple of years and morphed into the Red Trunk Project after his wife suggested reaching out to a friend to discuss the particulars.
"The idea of kids trading stories," Thomsen said, "became cultural artifacts, or maybe some video, that kids can touch and feel."
Once the project launched, two years later, Thomsen reached out to Kristof to tell him.
"Sheryl and I are thrilled to see what Kevin has done with the Red Trunk Project and to watch how it has grown," Kristof said. "It's just the kind of project that opens and nourishes young minds."
"He's been a great supporter, he even mentioned us in his newsletter," "Thomsen said of Kristof's support.
The first Red Trunk centers on Oaxaca, Mexico.
Thomsen approached Dr. Jill Vexler, a cultural anthropologist who has curated more than 40 exhibitions, through a mutual friend. Vexler, who spend years living in Mexico, reached out to another cultural anthropologist who was living in Mexico. With minimal conversation, they came up with identical lists for what artifacts must be in the trunks. Thomsen made three trips to Oaxaca to collect the artifacts, photos and video from the lists.
"It's a particularly cultural area," Vexler said of Oaxaca. " I wanted to show American kids how daily life solutions are solving the same problems just in different places.The artifacts and material culture of these solutions is very different and the tech to make the material culture is very different."
Michele Purpura, a third grade teacher at Brookside Elementary School in the Yorktown Central School District, had a Red Trunk visit her classroom this school year.
"For me, this was an unbelievable opportunity. The Red Trunk touched upon one of my favorite themes — acceptance," Purpura said. "I cannot explain how excited by students were during this project. They truly appreciated the artifacts, especially after viewing the videos."
The Red Trunk has visited school districts on Long Island, in Eastchester and Newburgh, in Orange County, and Thomsen said he is focusing on getting into more schools in Westchester, Rockland, Putnam, Orange and Dutchess.
"We're aiming for one trunk per classroom for a two-week period," Thomsen said. "We're putting as many artifacts we can fit in the trunks with video and the 'Kids of Oaxaca' booklet. There are about 60 artifacts per trunk and we want to make hundreds of trunks to share with the world."
The next Red Trunks may focus on Kenya or China. Thomsen is in talks with the Heard Museum in Phoenix, Arizona, about a Native American trunk. He is also in talks with Rockland Pride about creating a rainbow trunk which would take a look at the history of the gay civil rights movement.
"It's about activism," Thomsen said. "We want kids to get active to help the environment whether on a micro or macro level. Recycling in their homes is a micro thing that can make a big difference."
'Mad Men' actor is helping the cause
On Thursday, the Red Trunk Project is holding a fundraiser called "Red Trunk Liftoff." There will be food, wine, a mystery raffle and an auction run by comedian Richard Kind.
What would be auctioned off to help a project such as this? How about enjoying 30 minutes of cocktail banter via Skype with "Mad Men" star Jon Hamm, who is also on the Red Trunk Project's board of directors, or the opportunity to take a two-hour boat ride via Nyack Boat Charters, complete with a picnic provided by Mimi's Plate?
"What Kevin and his team have done with Red Trunk is provide a unique cross-cultural experiential toolset to inspire a new generation of minds to understand different cultures first hand," Hamm said in a release. "To lead with acceptance and understanding and not fear is a valuable concept in today's increasingly polarized and fractured conversation. I am proud to support Red Trunk and hope to make its reach even wider and more significant."
The money raised at the Red Trunk Liftoff will be matched 3 to 1 to raise even more funds for the Red Trunk Project.
Go: Red Trunk Liftoff, OUTSIDE IN Gallery, 249 Ferdon Ave., Piermont. June 13, 6-9 p.m. $75 per person. To register for the event head to eventbrite.com/e/red-trunk-liftoff-tickets.

Texto completo: Each summer we promote and encourage summer reading, but did you know that the library is also a place to enjoy summer movies? Shreve Memorial Library branches host movie screenings throughout the summer featuring blockbuster hits, family-friendly films, and cinematic classics. Movie screenings are always free and open to the public, and often include free popcorn. You can even catch a different movie screening almost every day of the week.
On Mondays, enjoy "Family Friendly Movie Matinee" at the Hamilton/South Caddo Branch and "Classic Movie Monday" at the North Caddo Branch. Tuesdays are perfect for Star Trek fans at the Broadmoor Branch as they present "Star Trek Double Feature Tuesday." The Hollywood/Union Avenue Branch also hosts "Senior Movie Day" on Tuesdays and "Preschool Story Time Movies" for the little ones on Wednesdays. Action fans won't want to miss "Marvel-ous Thursdays" at the Main Branch where screenings will feature a different Marvel movie. On Fridays, enjoy "Friday Movie Mania" at the West Shreveport Branch and take your pick of movie matinees on Saturdays at the Cedar Grove/Line Avenue, David Raines, and North Caddo branches.
While it is true that most movie screenings are during working hours, all of the movies shown by the library are available to check out. So if you miss a movie, never fear. You can always check out a copy on DVD from the library to watch at your leisure. DVD check outs are good for up to three days.
If you are unable to make it to the library, your Shreve Memorial Library card gives you access to Hoopla, an online service that allows you to borrow movies, TV shows, music, audiobooks, e-books and comics. The library of movies available via Hoopla may differ from what's available in the library, but you still should be able to find something that fits your viewing pleasure.
Be sure to visit the Shreve Memorial Library website (www.shreve-lib.org) for a complete list of movie screenings, dates, times and titles. If you prefer to read a great story rather than watch it on the big screen, be sure to check out what's new this week at the library.
What's New at the Library
Spine of the Dragon by Kevin Anderson (fiction)
New York Times bestselling author Kevin J. Anderson triumphantly returns to epic fantasy with the Wake of the Dragon series. Spine of the Dragon is a politically charged adventure of swords, sorcery, vengeance, and the rise of sleeping giants. Two continents at war, the Three Kingdoms and Ishara, are divided by past bloodshed. When an outside threat arises – the reawakening of a powerful ancient race that wants to remake the world – the two warring nations must somehow set aside generational hatreds and form an alliance to fight their true enemy.
The Electric Hotel by Dominic Smith (fiction)
A sweeping work of historical fiction from the New York Times bestselling author Dominic Smith, The Electric Hotel is a spellbinding story of art and love. For more than 30 years, Claude Ballard has been living at the Hollywood Knickerbocker Hotel. A French pioneer of silent films who started out as a concession agent for the Lumiere brothers, the inventors of cinema, Claude now spends his days foraging for mushrooms in the hills of Los Angeles and taking photographs of runaways and the striplings along Sunset Boulevard. But when a film history student comes to interview Claude about The Electric Hotel – the lost masterpiece that bankrupted him and ended the career of his muse, Sabine Montrose — the past comes surging back. In his run-down hotel suite, the ravages of the past are waiting to be excavated: celluloid fragments in desperate need of restoration, as well as Claude's memories of the woman who inspired and beguiled him. The Electric Hotel is a portrait of a man entranced by the magic of moviemaking, a luminous romance, and a whirlwind trip through early cinema. Sit back, relax, and enjoy the show.
The American Agent by
Jacqueline Winspear
When Catherine Saxon, an American correspondent reporting on the war in Europe, is found murdered in her London digs, news of her death is concealed by British authorities. Serving as a linchpin between Scotland Yard and the Secret Service, Robert MacFarlane pays a visit to Maisie Dobbs, seeking her help. He is accompanied by an agent from the US Department of Justice – Mark Scott, the American who helped Maisie escape Hitler's Munich in 1938. MacFarlane asks Maisie to work with Scott to uncover the truth about Saxon's death. As the Germans unleash the full terror of their blitzkrieg upon the British Isles, raining death and destruction from the skies, Maisie must balance the demands of solving this dangerous case with her need to protect Anna, the young evacuee she has grown to love and wants to adopt. Entangled in an investigation linked to the power of wartime propaganda and American political intrigue being played out in Britain, Maisie will face losing her dearest friend – and the possibility that she might be falling in love again.

Sen. Mike Braun: Despite gridlock, Congress has a real solution to address the border crisis

Texto completo: When I arrived in Washington, the government was shut down due to the humanitarian and security crisis on our southern border. Six months later, as Democrats refuse to address this emergency, the crisis has deteriorated to the point that even the New York Times is urging Congress to take action before we run out of money to address this humanitarian disaster at the border.
This week, the Senate will work on legislation that allocates $4.5 billion for our southern border, which includes $3.3 billion to address the dire humanitarian crisis. The Department of Health and Human Services, which is responsible for providing care and shelter to unaccompanied migrant children, is out of money and without an emergency funding supplemental will be unable to provide shelter, food, and medicine for the 13,000 unaccompanied migrant children at the border.
In a letter to Congress this week, the heads of HHS and the Department of Homeland Security shared that Border Patrol agents are spending over half of their time caring for families and children instead of carrying out their law enforcement responsibilities, with agents making an average of 70 trips to hospitals each day to provide urgent care to these immigrants. By replenishing HHS, specifically the Office of Refugee Resettlement, we can expand shelter facilities and increase dedicated care for unaccompanied children.
Top Trump administration officials have told me these additional funds are desperately needed, as nearly 170,000 children have surrendered at our southern border in the last seven months — more than half of whom are under the age of 12. Their journey is incredibly dangerous: for example, DHS mandates that all girls arriving at the border over the age of 10 be given a pregnancy test due to the high risk of sexual assault on the trek. These funds would directly improve living conditions for these children.
If Congress truly wants to address the humanitarian crisis on our southern border, there is no better solution than ensuring the Office of Refugee Resettlement is adequately funded to handle this crisis. This should not be a partisan issue, but for those Democrats who claim to be concerned with the living conditions of children on our southern border, they will have no one to blame but themselves if they block this legislation that is even supported by the New York Times' editorial board.
In addition to the humanitarian crisis, we have a security crisis. In the past year, the U.S. Customs and Border Patrol apprehended over 460,000 immigrants who were caught illegally crossing the U.S.-Mexico border, the highest number since 2009. Just in the month of May, Border Patrol encountered the highest monthly number of illegal immigrants in 13 years, and as the Washington Post reported, drug traffickers and human smugglers are taking advantage of our strained resources at the border. That’s why this legislation sets aside over $1 billion that will begin to address these concerns, because fixing the security crisis on our southern border means keeping drugs and dangerous criminals out of our country.
As a former entrepreneur, I’ve spent my entire life working on solutions, compromises, putting together deals, and delivering real results, which is exactly what this legislation does in terms of addressing the humanitarian and security crisis on our southern border. It’s my hope that Congress can come together this week and pass this desperately needed legislation to relieve some of the strain on our southern border.

Biden invokes segregationists in recalling Senate civility

Texto completo: NEW YORK — Joe Biden, defending himself Tuesday night against suggestions that he is too “old fashioned" for today's Democratic Party, invoked two Southern segregationist senators by name as he fondly recalled the “civility" of the Senate in the 1970s and 1980s.
Speaking at a fund-raiser at the Carlyle Hotel in New York City, Biden, 76, stressed the need to “be able to reach consensus under our system," and cast his decades in the Senate as a time of relative comity. His remarks come as some in his party say that Biden is too focused on overtures to the right as he seeks the Democratic presidential nomination.
At the event, Biden noted that he served with the late Senators James O. Eastland of Mississippi and Herman Talmadge of Georgia, both Democrats who were staunch opponents of desegregation. Eastland was the powerful chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee when Biden entered the chamber in 1973.
“I was in a caucus with James O. Eastland," Biden said, slipping briefly into a Southern accent, according to a pool report from the fund-raiser. “He never called me 'boy,' he always called me 'son.' "
He called Talmadge “one of the meanest guys I ever knew, you go down the list of all these guys."
“Well guess what?" Biden continued. “At least there was some civility. We got things done. We didn't agree on much of anything. We got things done. We got it finished. But today you look at the other side and you're the enemy. Not the opposition, the enemy. We don't talk to each other anymore."
On Wednesday, Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey, one of two black candidates running for president, said Biden was “wrong" to use segregationists as examples for bringing the country together.
“You don't joke about calling black men 'boys,' " Booker said in a statement. “I'm disappointed that he hasn't issued an immediate apology for the pain his words are dredging up for many Americans. He should."
Another presidential candidate, Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York, posted a photo of his multiracial family on Twitter and cited a racial epithet that Eastland used.
“It's 2019 & @JoeBiden is longing for the good old days of 'civility' typified by James Eastland," de Blasio wrote. “It's past time for apologies or evolution from @JoeBiden. He repeatedly demonstrates that he is out of step with the values of the modern Democratic Party."
Eastland, a plantation owner, was known as a vociferous opponent of integration efforts and a staunch critic of the civil rights movement, which he sometimes dismissed as the work of “communists." Throughout his career he referred to African-Americans as members of an “inferior race" and used the racist term “mongrelization."
Talmadge was also a critic of the civil rights movement and opposed the 1954 Supreme Court decision, Brown v. Board of Education, that declared racially segregated public schools unconstitutional.
Biden has long discussed his personal commitment to civil rights, and he has many strong relationships in the black community. He has also previously pointed to his dealings with segregationists like Eastland as an example of a time when Senate colleagues could disagree but still find ways to reach common ground.
But Biden is also now seeking the nomination of a party that is increasingly young and diverse — and skeptical of his emphasis on compromise, especially on issues that touch on matters of racial justice. His campaign declined to provide additional comment for this story.
New York Times
Cash rolls in after Trump reelection launch
President Trump raised $24.8 million in less than 24 hours as he officially launched his reelection, GOP officials said Wednesday, underscoring the huge fund-raising lead the president has over a divided and crowded Democratic primary field.
The Wednesday announcement by Republican National Committee chairwoman Ronna McDaniel, confirmed by campaign officials, indicates that the Trump campaign is on track to report its best fund-raising quarter since he became president.
The one-day haul as Trump held a kickoff rally in Orlando included $14 million for Trump's reelection committee and $10 million that went to Trump Victory, a joint fund-raising committee between his campaign and the RNC that can accept large donations.
The president is scheduled to headline a high-dollar fund-raising luncheon at the Trump National Doral hotel in Florida Wednesday that is set to bring in $5 million, officials said.
The president's fund-raising bonanza this week far eclipsed the $6.3 million that former vice president Joe Biden's campaign said it pulled in on the day of his late April campaign announcement — the largest 24-hour amount raised by any of the Democratic campaigns this year.
Washington Post
Plans readied for Fourth of July celebration in D.C.
President Trump's participation in the nation's annual Fourth of July celebration will include a Trump speech honoring America's armed forces, along with music, military demonstrations, and flyovers, the administration announced Wednesday, about two weeks before the patriotic holiday.
Federal lawmakers, local officials, and others have voiced concerns that Trump could alter the tone of what traditionally is a nonpartisan celebration of America's founding by delivering an overtly political speech after he added himself to an event that typically has not included the president.
After losing out on his wish for a military parade in Washington, Trump tweeted in February for people to "HOLD THE DATE!" for the "Salute to America" event, which he said would be held at the Lincoln Memorial and feature a major fireworks display, entertainment, "and an address by your favorite President, me!"
Interior Secretary David Bernhardt said Wednesday that Trump will use the speech, which the president promised in a February tweet, to honor the military.
Some groups are organizing anti-Trump protests.

Trump says he'll meet with Xi at G-20 session

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — President Trump said Tuesday that he and President Xi Jinping of China had spoken by phone and would have an “extended" meeting at the Group of 20 meeting next week in Osaka, Japan.
His comments were the first confirmation that the two leaders would actually meet after trade talks between the United States and China stalled in May and suggested that the two countries were once again trying to find compromise.
“Had a very good telephone conversation with President Xi of China," Trump said on Twitter. “We will be having an extended meeting next week at the G-20 in Japan. Our respective teams will begin talks prior to our meeting."
Stocks jumped after the president's tweet, as skittish investors took comfort in the potential for renewed discussions between the world's two largest economies.
Progress toward a trade agreement between the world's two largest economies had come to a halt after Trump accused China of breaking a deal with the United States and China accused the United States of failing to negotiate in good faith.
Trump officials said the Chinese government altered portions of the agreement that would require it to codify the trade deal's provisions in Chinese law, which the United States saw as evidence that China would not keep its side of the bargain.
That prompted Trump to escalate his fight with China, raising tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods as punishment and threatening to tax an additional $300 billion worth of goods if Beijing does not agree to America's trade terms.
On Capitol Hill on Tuesday, Robert Lighthizer, the administration's top trade negotiator, told lawmakers that no decision had been made about the next round of tariffs against China. Lighthizer defended the president's tough tactics before Republican and Democratic senators, who raised concerns about the trade war's effects on American farmers, manufacturers, and consumers.
“We had an untenable situation with China, one that should have been addressed frankly a couple of decades ago," Lighthizer, the US trade representative, told the Senate Finance Committee. “We view ourselves as having the most serious problem you can face in the trade space."
New York Times
White House reportedly explored demoting Fed chair
The White House explored the legality of demoting Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell in February, soon after President Trump talked about firing him, according to people familiar with the matter.
The White House counsel's office weighed the legal implications of stripping Powell of his chairmanship and leaving him as a Fed governor, the people said, in what would be an unprecedented move. A replacement would have to be nominated by Trump and confirmed by the Senate.
Trump's team conducted the legal analysis and came to a conclusion that has remained closely held within the White House, the people said, requesting anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. It isn't clear whether Trump directed the legal review, and the people didn't describe the outcome.
A White House official who declined to be identified said he wouldn't comment on what he called alleged discussions from months ago. Trump's top economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, said demoting Powell isn't currently under consideration.
“It's not happening today so therefore I have nothing to say on it," Kudlow told reporters.
Fed spokeswoman Michelle Smith said in an e-mail: “Under the law, a Federal Reserve Board chair can only be removed for cause."
Bloomberg News
Orlando paper says it would not endorse Trump
The hometown paper of the Florida city where Donald Trump made his reelection announcement says it won't endorse the president.
The Orlando Sentinel said in an editorial Tuesday that some readers may wonder how the publication can eliminate a candidate before anyone knows who his opponent will be.
The Sentinel answers that it's "because there's no point pretending we would ever recommend that readers vote for Trump."
The paper says it has had enough of "the chaos, the division, the schoolyard insults, the self-aggrandizement, the corruption, and especially the lies."
Associated Press
Biden suggests he has raised $20 million for campaign
Joe Biden told supporters at a Manhattan fund-raiser Monday that his presidential campaign has raised money from 360,000 donors, with an average contribution of $55 — figures that suggest he has amassed nearly $20 million.
If so, the former vice president's haul would eclipse that of any of the other Democratic White House hopefuls in the first quarter of the year, including Senator Bernie Sanders, who reported taking in $18.2 million from about 500,000 donors. Sanders also reported another $2.5 million in transfers from previous campaigns.

Texto completo: Former vice president Joe Biden does fewer interviews, makes fewer campaign trips and has fewer events per day than his Democratic rivals. The New York Times reports:
"Over the past eight days, Mr. Biden celebrated a granddaughter's graduation with the family of Barack Obama while 19 of his opponents fought for breakout moments at a party gathering in Iowa, and he spent his own visit to Iowa locked in a ferocious exchange of attacks with President [Donald] Trump, waving off questions about his Democratic competitors.
“He has invested less time in the early-voting primary states than many of his rivals, while also appearing in general-election battlegrounds like Pennsylvania and Ohio. . . . In ways big and small, Mr. Biden's choices underscore his determination to play by his own rules in the Democratic primary, gambling that his widespread name recognition and status as early poll-leader free him to set a pace and tone sharply distinct from his competitors.”
By doing fewer events and giving less time to interviews than his rivals for many reasons, the opportunities for gaffes diminish, the 76-year-old candidate can pace himself, and he gives the impression he is already the nominee. His national poll numbers are high for now, the distance between him and his closest rival, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., is vast (17 points in the RealClearPolitics average), and he leads in all states' primary polls, even where there is a candidate from the state (e.g., Texas, Massachusetts, California). For now, you don't mess with success.
However, what works in June and July of 2019 may not work much beyond that. He needs to convey an image of a vigorous pugilist, not someone in semi-retirement. And he should not give the famously demanding voters of New Hampshire and Iowa the sense he takes their votes for granted.
His supporters should hope he is using his downtime for some debate prep. The first debate ironically may be more important for him than for lesser candidates for whom expectations are low. Biden has not debated fellow Democrats since his 2008 presidential run; he hasn't had any debates since he bludgeoned Paul Ryan, R-Wis., in the 2012 vice presidential debate. He can afford some gaffes and some Bidenisms (“Honest to God”), but what he cannot afford is a Rick Perry moment (Oops!), when memory and/​or words fail him, nor can he afford to be seen languishing in the Obama years. Instead of going back to the good old days of 2010 (or so), he would be wise to stress that he is picking up where he and President Barack Obama left off.
In short, anything that makes him sound or look a step slower or caught up in the past will feed into his opponent's message that the party needs someone younger, fresher, more in touch with younger voters. In that regard, he's in the same position President Ronald Reagan was during the 1984 presidential debates when age became an issue. Reagan disarmed his opponent, Sen. Walter Mondale, D-Minn., and the audience with a typical quip. “I will not make age an issue of this campaign,” he said. “I am not going to exploit, for political purposes, my opponent's youth and inexperience.” All Mondale could do was laugh along.
Biden surely should not copy that quip, but he should use humor when appropriate to undercut the attacks his opponents have launched (e.g., too old, too nice to Republicans, too moderate). If Sanders decides to go negative and attack (the candidate most likely to do so), Biden would be well to remind voters he's an old pro at this, not easily rattled and certainly not provoked to lash out.
Every candidate has his or her challenges. Biden would do well to remain sunny and optimistic, good humored, forward-looking (he actually knows quite a lot about green energy) and above all, sharp and energetic. Then he might think about a stamina-testing bus trip (an ode to his friend John McCain's “Straight Talk Express”). It's not an uncommon view in Democratic circles that only Biden can beat Biden. In 10 days he'll have his first real test - and his first opportunity to put age and related issues to rest.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — Former Vice President Joe Biden reflected Tuesday on the "civility" that existed between himself and segregationist senators early in his career in an effort to present himself as a bipartisan consensus-maker.
The 2020 Democratic presidential candidate, who has found himself a front-runner in recent polls, drew criticism for the remarks.
Speaking at a fundraiser at the ritzy Carlyle Hotel in New York, Biden talked about his ability to "(get) things done" with former Senators James Eastland of Mississippi and Herman Talmadge of Georgia, according to a campaign pool report. The two segregationist Democrats fought against the civil rights movement and opposed the racial integration of schools. Biden's first term in the Senate, which started in 1973, overlapped with the tenures of the two men.
Biden also lamented a political climate that would not allow for similar "consensus" today.
"I know the new New Left tells me that I’m — this is old-fashioned," he said. "Well guess what? If we can’t reach a consensus in our system, what happens? It encourages and demands the abuse of power by a president. That’s what it does. You have to be able to reach consensus under our system — our Constitutional system of separation of powers. ”

Biden then went on to cite his relationships with Eastland and Talmadge as examples of people who "didn't agree on much of anything" but "got things done. "
“I was in a caucus with James O. Eastland,” said Biden, reportedly imitating Eastland's southern drawl. “He never called me 'boy,' he always called me 'son. '” Talmadge, he said, was "one of the meanest guys I ever knew. "
But according to Biden, despite these differences, "At least there was some civility. We got things done. We didn’t agree on much of anything. We got things done. We got it finished. But today, you look at the other side and you’re the enemy. Not the opposition, the enemy. We don't talk to each other anymore. ”
Eastland and Talmadge were ardent segregationists. After Brown v. Board of Education was decided by the Supreme Court in 1954, according to a 2007 Atlantic article, Eastland said that "the Southern institution of racial segregation or racial separation was the correct, self-evident truth which arose from the chaos and confusion of the Reconstruction period. Separation promotes racial harmony. It permits each race to follow its own pursuits, and its own civilization. Segregation is not discrimination"
Journalist Paul Mayhew, describing Talmadge in a 1956 New Republic article, said, "No Senator from the South is so well equipped or so zealous to become the head and front of a sustained fight for segregation. "
Biden's comments, once reported on by the Washington Post, drew outrage online. Connie Schultz, a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist who is married to Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, slammed Biden for his comments.
"There is no punchline here, no emoji or funny meme to soften the harm of your words. That segregationist never called you 'boy' because you are white. If you want to boast about your relationship with a racist, you are not who we need to succeed the racist in the White House," Schultz wrote.
Jamelle Bouie, a New York Times opinion columnist, noted that "it may have been necessary to work with segregationists but there’s nothing laudable about it.
Almost the entire Democratic presidential candidate field is going to South Carolina this weekend to court voters at the South Carolina Democratic Convention and Rep. Jim Clyburn's fish fry. South Carolina's Democratic electorate is about 60% African American.
Clyburn, a former chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, defended Biden on Wednesday afternoon. According to Politico's Jake Sherman, Clyburn said that his own work with Sen. Strom Thurmond, who filibustered the Civil Rights Act of 1957 was “similar to Biden working with Talmadge. "
Vice's Daniel Newhauser reported that Clyburn told reporters, "So what? Do you know how many times I’ve been called the N word and worse?”"
Some Democratic contenders criticized Biden for his remarks.
New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, a Democratic presidential candidate, weighed in, calling Biden "out of step" with the modern Democratic Party.
"It’s 2019 & @JoeBiden is longing for the good old days of 'civility' typified by James Eastland,'" wrote de Blasio.
And in a press release, Sen. Cory Booker D-N. J. , called on Biden to apologize.
"Vice President Biden’s relationships with proud segregationists are not the model for how we make America a safer and more inclusive place for black people, and for everyone. I have to tell Vice President Biden, as someone I respect, that he is wrong for using his relationships with Eastland and Talmadge as examples of how to bring our country together," said Booker.

Texto completo: Varios inmigrantes indocumentados que fueron despedidos de los clubes de golf del presidente Donald Trump en Nueva Jersey y Nueva York le tienen una sorpresa nada agradable al mandatari durante su mitin en Florida, donde lanzará su campaña de reelección presidencia.
El abogado Aníbal Romero , quien representa a los inmigrantes, dijo que los inmigrantes harán una conferencia de prensa para defender la reforma migratoria el mismo día y en la misma ciudad en que el presidente Trump estará lanzando su campaña de reelección.
“Estos empleados que trabajan para Donald Trump representan a cientos de personas que han trabajado para él como inmigrantes indocumentados, y muestra cómo la Administración puede fácilmente vilipendiar y demonizar a los inmigrantes y, sin embargo, no tiene problemas para contratarlos”, expresó Romero.
Margarita Cruz y Adela García , examas de llaves en el Trump National Golf Club Westchester, así como Wiston Blandon, un ex lavaplatos en ese mismo club asistirán a la conferencia de prensa en Orlando.
Tamibén estarán presentes Sandra Díaz y Victorina Morales, examas de llaves en el club de Trump en Bedminster, Nueva Jersey.
El caso de estos inmigrantes conmocionó al país, al revelarse que el Organización Trump contrataba a extranjeros sin permisos de trabajo, mientras las políticas del presidente iban en sentido contrario.
La historia fue contada en diciembre de 2018 por Díaz y Morales a The New York Times , donde detallaron su experiencia en el club de Nueva Jersey.

Sotheby's bought by telecom entrepreneur for $3.7b
The auction house Sotheby's will be bought by the telecommunications entrepreneur Patrick Drahi in a deal worth $3.7 billion, the company said Monday. The acquisition of Sotheby's by BidFair USA, which is owned by Drahi, returns the only publicly traded major auction house to private ownership after 31 years on the New York Stock Exchange. Sotheby's reported a loss of $7.1 million for the first quarter of this year after reporting a $6.5 million loss for the same period a year earlier. Drahi, a French-Israeli billionaire, said he was honored that the Sotheby's board had recommended his offer. Drahi, who founded the telecom company Altice in the Netherlands in 2001, has been on a spending spree in recent years. Altice acquired Cablevision in the United States in 2016 as part of an effort to become a leading cable and broadband provider there. — NEW YORK TIMES
MEDIA
Digital platform company buys right to publish Sports Illustrated online and in print
Digital platform company TheMaven has bought the right to publish Sports Illustrated — digitally and in print — for at least the next 10 years, ending former owner Meredith's relationship with Sports Illustrated a few weeks after the landmark magazine's intellectual property was sold to the Authentic Brands Group, TheMaven and Meredith announced Monday. TheMaven, based in Seattle, also announced the creation of Sports Illustrated Media, to be run by veteran media industry executive Ross Levinsohn, a former publisher of the Los Angeles Times. While the price was undisclosed, a Securities and Exchange Commission filing said that TheMaven had already paid $45 million to Authentic Brands. The two companies will also share revenue. Authentic Brands, a licensing company, is run by entrepreneur Jamie Salter. A significant portion of its business comes from its deals to represent the estates of dead-but-still-lucrative celebrities like Elvis Presley, Marilyn Monroe, and Muhammad Ali. — NEW YORK TIMES
GASOLINE
Price at the pump drops four cents in Massachusetts
The cost of a gasoline in Massachusetts is bucking historical trends and dropping as the summer driving season gets underway. AAA Northeast said Monday that self-serve, regular is selling for an average of $2.67 per gallon, 4 cents lower than a week ago. The current price is a penny lower than the national average and 20 cents lower than the Massachusetts average from a year ago. A AAA spokesman says a decline in prices at this time of year is unusual, because higher demand in the summer usually drives prices higher. This year, growing gasoline inventories are contributing to lower prices. AAA found a wide range in prices, from a low of $2.49 per gallon, to a high of $3.05. — ASSOCIATED PRESS
HARASSMENT
Public allegations of corporate misbehavior at a low
Public accusations of corporate misbehavior and harassment have fallen to their lowest level since October 2017, when allegations against movie producer Harvey Weinstein sparked the #MeToo movement. Twelve complaints generated media coverage in May compared with a peak of 143 last October, according to data compiled by crisis consultant Temin and Co. The firm has tracked 1,227 high-profile incidents over the last 3-and-a-half-years. In order to be included, a person's alleged behavior must generate multiple press reports. All but 36 of the accused are men and about half have lost their jobs, the data showed. — BLOOMBERG NEWS
INDUSTRY
GE's jet leasing unit to provide aircraft for new US carrier
General Electric Co.'s jet-leasing unit agreed to provide the first nine aircraft for a new US carrier planned by airline entrepreneur David Neeleman. GE Capital Aviation Services and Neeleman signed a letter of intent for the purchase and leaseback of nine Airbus SE A220-300 planes that will be delivered in 2021 and 2022. Neeleman previously signed an order for 60 of the planes to supply the new carrier, which has the code name Moxy. The agreement, announced Monday at the Paris Air Show, moves Neeleman a step closer to inaugurating the airline that he's said will give customers new ways to customize their flight experience, from legroom to food to price. The carrier, he said, will be low-cost "but not austere." It will compete in a market populated by the four largest US carriers as well as heavy discounters like Spirit Airlines Inc. — BLOOMBERG NEWS
ENVIRONMENT
More than 700 companies being called out for inadequate disclosures
Amazon.com Inc., Exxon Mobil Corp., and Volvo are among more than 700 companies being targeted in a campaign backed by a large group of investors advocating for greater transparency when it comes to environmental impact. HSBC Global Asset Management, Investec Asset Management, and close to 85 other investors representing a combined $10 trillion in assets are asking companies to comply with the reporting process managed by the Carbon Disclosure Project, a British nonprofit research group that solicits and scores corporate environmental disclosures. The effort targets companies the group says have failed to disclose such information for years at a time. — BLOOMBERG NEWS
FAST FOOD
Domino's to test unmanned pizza deliveries in Houston
There goes another high schooler's job: Domino's Pizza Inc. plans to test unmanned pizza delivery in Houston later this year. The chain, known as a technology leader in the restaurant industry, is teaming up with Nuro, a Bay Area robotics startup run by a pair of former Google employees. To start, Domino's will send food to customers from a single store in the Texas city using one of Nuro's fully autonomous vehicles. — BLOOMBERG NEWS
CREDIT CARDS
Mastercard will allow transgender customers to chose the names on their cards
Mastercard Inc. will allow transgender customers to use their chosen names on credit and debit cards. The company is working with its banking partners to introduce True Name cards that will let customers use the name they want on their cards without requiring a legal name change, a process that should help transgender and non-binary cardholders in particular, the company said Monday in a statement. The network has already started talking to banks to help them implement the cards, said Raj Seshadri, president of US issuers at Mastercard. — BLOOMBERG NEWS
ACCOUNTING
KPMG to pay $50m to settle SEC allegations involving altered audit work
KPMG LLP, one of the big four accounting firms, will pay $50 million to settle Securities and Exchange Commission allegations that it altered past audit work after receiving stolen information from an industry watchdog. The fine stems from an embarrassing chapter for KPMG that led to five former employees being accused of interfering with inspections of the firm by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, an agency overseen by the SEC that is the US's main regulator of auditors. KMPG admitted wrongdoing as part of the settlement with the SEC, and agreed to hire an independent consultant to review its internal controls, according to a Monday statement. — BLOOMBERG NEWS

Texto completo: Plants and animals have some crazy lifestyles, particularly when it comes to pollination.
Pollination, as you may recall, is the transfer of pollen from one plant to another. This makes it possible for flowers to produce seeds, which, in turn, will produce more plants.
Insects need food, often in the form of plant sugars from nectar and protein from pollen. Put humans in the equation, and it’s a win-win-win situation. The plant gets to make more plants, the animal gets nutrition, and we get stuff we need — like soybeans, cotton, apples, tomatoes, and Tequila.
Pollination ranges from the straightforward to the intricate and complex. In the latter category is buzz pollination (or, to be fancy, "sonication"). Bumblebees seek nectar and pollen for food for their growing colonies in the summer.
Flowers in the tomato family have tons of nutritious pollen, but they don’t give it out for free. The flower won’t release its pollen unless it "hears" a certain vibration.
Bumblebees, it turns out, give off good vibes. In fact, just the right vibes.
Grasping onto the flower by the anthers, the bumblebee buzzes with a specific frequency. At this frequency, the flower explodes with pollen, giving the bumblebee its protein and coating it with pollen.
Thus doused, the bumblebee heads right to another flower, taking the pollen from Flower One to Flower Two, and on to many others.
Scientists have determined that the frequency of buzz pollination is equivalent to a C note on a tuning fork. (Or, the "Hey" in "Hey Jude," for those Paul McCartney fans out there.) And speaking of music, recent research has revealed an amazing new page in the pollination songbook.
Some flowers produce sweeter nectar when they hear pollinators approaching.
Yep, they "hear" or detect the vibrations of pollinators.
Michelle Z. Donahue reported in the January 2019 issue of National Geographic some exciting studies undertaken by Lilach Hadany of Tel Aviv University.
"Hadany’s team looked at evening primroses," wrote Donahue, "and found that within minutes of sensing vibrations from pollinators’ wings, the plants temporarily increased the concentration of sugar in their flowers’ nectar. In effect, the flowers themselves served as ears, picking up the specific frequencies of bees’ wings while tuning out irrelevant sounds like wind."
Sweet!
The Tel Aviv researchers also looked at flower shape and the ability to sense approaching pollinators. Plants with bowl-shaped flowers may be able to detect sound better than others.
"This makes them perfect for receiving and amplifying sound waves," explained Donahue, "much like a satellite dish."
This exciting research has launched a new field of study called phytoacoustics. It all goes to show that sometimes you do need to sing for your supper.
Another amazing plant-pollinator relationship has been recently discovered. Tilo Henning of the Botanic Garden and Botanical Museum in Berlin, and Maximilian Weigend of the University of Bonn in Germany have hypothesized that a group of plants native to the Peruvian Andes can move their pollen-bearing structures according to past visits from pollinators.
Henning and Weigend studied the plant Nasa poissoniana and determined that it can remember the schedule of pollinator visits, and repeat their movements accordingly.
"These plants can gymnastically wave around their stamens — the organs they use for fertilization — to maximize the distribution of their pollen," according to Cara Giaimo in The New York Times.
"More surprisingly, (Henning and Weigend) suggest that individual plants can adjust the timing of these movements based on their previous experiences with pollinators. In other words, they remember the past and try to repeat it."
Crazy? You bet. You can read details of the research methods and conclusions in the April 2019 issue of Plant Signaling and Behavior.
A close-to-home example of unusual pollination is the skunk cabbage-carrion insect relationship.
Skunk cabbage, as the name implies, is a smelly plant that grows in wet woods. It’s one of the first plants to flower each year — often in February when the snow is still on the ground.
The flower is definitely not bouquet-worthy. It’s dark maroon, lacks petals, and is hidden by an overarching structure.
The color, as well as the stench of the flower, mimic dead, rotting things — hence attracting carrion beetles and flies.
The flower also produces its own heat, and can maintain a comfortable 60 to 70 degrees inside the floral covering. Perfect for those carcass-loving insects.
Other examples of strange pollination abound. With each new discovery, we find that the business of life is fascinating in its complexities.
What happens when one of the partners in the intricate dance of pollination disappears?
We are losing pollinators at an alarming rate, and plant extinction continues apace. Habitat loss and pesticide use are the big culprits.
Not to end on a buzz-kill, let me present some good news to counter the bad. Everyone can chip in to restore, preserve, and protect habitat for the myriad creatures around us.

Melania is no Jackie O, but who would want to be?

Texto completo: There are precious few individuals that modern Americans universally love, and one of those individuals is Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis. "Jackie O" is off limits for criticism. Jackie O's jersey number has been retired. Jackie O embodied that whole "Camelot" narrative, and Americans, who threw off the British monarchy and then spent 200 years enviously ogling tiaras and coronations across the pond, lapped it up.
Those who weren't bewitched by her early public persona - all pastels and whispery softness - could be enamored of her later years, when she took an intellectual-type job as a book editor and reportedly did her own Xeroxing.
Everyone loves Jackie Kennedy Onassis, everyone knows she is beyond compare, which is the trap President Trump fell into on Friday when he tried to make a comparison.
"We have our own Jackie O today, it's called Melania. Melania. We'll call it Melania T, okay?" he said in a phone interview on "Fox & Friends."
Firstly, yes. Yes, the president did use the pronoun "it," twice, to refer to his wife.
Secondly, as with many mangled statements he makes, you could squint your eyes and sort of see where he was going with it.
The quote was in the context of updating Air Force One, which currently sports a color scheme Jackie chose while her husband was president. Melania Trump is now the first lady, and she has some aesthetic credentials: She studied architecture in college (though she didn't graduate) and later worked as a model. Jackie didn't have any particular design training when she launched a massive White House renovation and preservation project - she had studied French literature and then worked for a newspaper - but the end result became her celebrated legacy. At any rate, Trump probably figured his wife was just as capable of choosing colors for an airplane.
But it wasn't about color selection, as angry Jackie loyalists immediately made clear. It was about vaguer questions of taste and class - both in the "upper class/lower class" sense of the term and in the "good/bad" sense.
"Jackie O had class," tweeted former Vermont governor and Democratic National Committee chair Howard Dean. "No one named Trump has ever had class and never will. Sorry DJT."
One can imagine the president, an unsubtle man, reading that tweet with befuddlement: Of course he has class, because he has money, because, at his penthouse in New York, even the filigrees have filigrees. And anyway, his current residence is the White House, so suck it.
One can also imagine the president neglecting to consider the darker implications of a Jackie/Melania comparison: Here are two women, both married to men trailed by allegations of philandering. Here are two women who spent their time in the White House keeping up impeccable appearances. Both receive compliments for their "poise" and "grace." But remember, the qualities of poise and grace are often forced by awkward situations. Jackie O is poised while Marilyn Monroe suggestively purrs "Happy Birthday" to her husband; Melania is poised while the country discusses whether hers paid off a porn star.
To be compared to Jackie O means entering into a land of wounded femininity, a land where the public's respect is balanced equally by how sorry the public feels for you. It's admiration, but a kind of display-case admiration; a sentiment driven less by loving you than by an obsession with keeping you in mint condition.
For Jackie, becoming a legend carried an unthinkable price: the murder of her husband while she sat next to him, followed by single parenthood, followed by a lifetime of being scrutinized by paparazzi. When she dared remarry, to shipping magnate Aristotle Onassis, some onlookers were furious: "The reaction here is anger, shock and dismay," reported the New York Times; a German newspaper claimed America had "lost a saint."
And yet, 50 years later, here we are, still enthralled with the idea of Jackie. Wander into any yoga studio or juice bar, and you might see someone carrying a popular tote bag: "Dress like Coco, live like Jackie, act like Audrey, laugh like Lucy." Spotting them makes me crazy because at least three of these women led deeply troubling or tragic lives . (Dress like Coco Chanel, secret Nazi agent?)
To make a Jackie O comparison means, at some level, revealing what you think about how women should behave, and what you think they should be: Always uncomplaining. Always graceful. Always chic, put together, beautiful, soft-spoken and gentle, even when their own lives are falling apart.
On Friday, the critics of Trump's Jackie O statement focused on the idea that Melania didn't deserve to be compared to Jackie O. We're talking about something silly; we're talking about airplane decor, I get that. But I also can't help but think that the adoration of Jackie O was based on terrible things happening to her while she soldiered on and the public took pictures of her outfits. And she probably didn't deserve to be compared to Jackie O, either.

Media must avoid the 'electability' delusion

Texto completo: As Iowa journalist Robert Leonard talks to voters around his state, he finds himself baffled at the national portrayal of Joe Biden's dominance in the presidential campaign.
The local Democrats he encounters respect the former vice president, he told me, but many of them also feel his time has passed.
They're far more excited about other candidates, five in particular: Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.); Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind.; Sen. Kamala D. Harris (Calif.); former Texas congressman Beto O'Rourke and Sen. Cory Booker (N.J.).
So he shakes his head at the extensive coverage and commentary that depicts Biden as almost a shoo-in for a nomination that's more than a year away.
One example: CNN's morning briefing newsletter recently called Biden "the most formidable threat" to President Trump's reelection chances.
CNN is far from alone. It's common across the national media to see Biden pegged as the safest candidate for Democrats to put up to unseat Trump. He's got that secret sauce: electability.
"Sure, Democrats think he's electable, but they believe a half-dozen other candidates are, too," Leonard, the news director of two Iowa radio stations, told me. "No one I have spoken with sees Biden as more formidable than other top candidates."
But this thinking - much of it driven by early polling - creates a self-perpetuating effect: Biden is the front-runner, so he gets more media coverage.
"Joe Biden has done something no other Democrat has been able to do in this race: Command attention from all cable networks, and have them stream his entire event live," Washington Post political reporter Matt Viser tweeted last week during Biden's Iowa visit.
That coverage decision captures the electability delusion in action - and it cuts both ways.
Was Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez seen as electable?
Certainly not. Not until the Democrat rolled to victory last year in her New York City primary against entrenched incumbent Joseph Crowley and soon afterward became the youngest woman ever elected to Congress. Some news outlets didn't even have her photograph available on election night; and the New York Times, her hometown newspaper, hadn't written a full profile of her during the campaign.
Was Hillary Clinton seen as electable?
More than electable, she was inevitable - the crowned queen of 2016, from about 2013 on. Until, of course, she wasn't.
"So-called electability is no more a science than astrology. Indeed, it is often little more than calcified prejudice," Boston-based political activist Jonathan Cohn wrote recently.
On one level, seeing Biden this way is understandable. The former vice president is out front in poll after poll.
On another level, it's downright unfair to other candidates at this early stage - and it may be dangerous to the Democrats' quest to unseat Trump.
Salon's Amanda Marcotte finds it troubling to see Trump going after Biden with nicknames and other attacks, but not because she feels sorry for the former vice president.
No, her theory is that Trump - with his unerring instinct for steering the media caravan - is focusing on Biden because he knows the former veep may be relatively easier to beat.
"Biden's centrism, his big mouth, his age and out-of-touchness, and his handsiness sets him up to be beset with a 'both sides are the same, so don't vote' campaign targeting the same voters who sat out 2016," she tweeted.
When I followed up with her, Marcotte wrote me: "I don't have a problem with calling him the front-runner at all, since that's just a fact, but I do think it's unfair to take his political argument for himself ('electability') as a fact instead of an opinion/argument." (The Washington Post has decided, for now, not to use the term "front-runner" for Biden in its news coverage, according to an all-newsroom memo in May from National Editor Steven Ginsberg, "given the continued volatility among the candidates at this early stage." Some other news organizations are showing similar restraint.)
Wasn't former Florida governor Jeb Bush looking pretty electable early in the 2016 Republican primary campaign? Conversely, before the 2008 election, weren't pundits busy doubting whether the United States was ready to elect a black president?
Wrong, and wrong again.
For months now, I've heard network news chiefs, and political editors and reporters of all stripes, insist - often as they sat on soul-searching journalism panels - that it would be different this time: less horse race, more listening to the American people's concerns.
To their credit, there does seem to be more effort to talk to voters in the field, all across the country, not just in the Acela corridor of New York City to Washington.
Certainly, campaign staffs are bigger than ever at many news organizations. But that often leads to more horse-race coverage, rather than a deeper understanding of communities.
The excitement about the latest polls puts all that reporting effort in the background - even though it's too early for polls to be very meaningful, at least when forecasting the general election.
Combine that with the unquenchable thirst for a narrative, a simple story for savvy journalists to tell news consumers, and before you know it, you've got the pseudoscience of electability. Cable news pundits, though not alone, are especially culpable.
The lust for narrative often comes with a hefty side order of unexamined sexism, as in: "Biden's more electable than Warren or Harris because Democrats already tried running a woman and failed."
We don't know that, and it may be dead wrong.
The truth is that journalists and pundits are bad at predictions. They should have learned that when Trump - a candidate so manifestly unsuited to be president that he couldn't possibly win - blew their minds by doing just that.

Texto completo: Nineteen-year-old Maddi Bertrand of Glen Ellyn is a leading voice in a somber new video by The New York Times, which notes that 11,000 Americans will die this year while waiting for organ transplants. Chicago’s Lurie Children’s Hospital will give Maddi a Hope and Courage award Wednesday for her wide range of contributions, including her advocacy efforts that helped lead to a change in the legal age to buy tobacco products from 18 to 21 in Illinois as of July 1.
She’s been raising money for the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation since she staged Maddi’s Marvelous Mayfair fundraiser at the age of 7. She’s successfully lobbied for smoke-free bike paths and parks. She never turns down a chance as a speaker to raise funds and awareness on behalf of people with cystic fibrosis.
"And I will for the rest of my life until a cure is found," Maddi says. Then she coughs a dozen times into a paper towel, grimaces, removes the oxygen tubes from her nose to blow into a tissue, and pauses for nearly a minute to give her body time to catch up. CF is a life-shortening, progressive, genetic disease that affects the pancreas and causes a thick mucus to form in the lungs.
"I’m definitely sicker than I was a month ago," she says. The attention and awards are nice, but what she really wants is a new set of lungs.
Born in Pennsylvania, one of the few states at the time that tested newborns for cystic fibrosis, Maddi got diagnosed and started treatment earlier than many CF patients, says her mother, Linda Bertrand.
"When I was in elementary school and middle school, I could do sports," Maddi says, noting that she even played the rough game of lacrosse. "Whenever I’d join a team, I’d get sick, end up in the hospital, and then the season would wind down."
She plays the flute and piano, did martial arts with her brother, and was healthy enough to be a section leader in the marching band and take on roles in a couple of plays during high school.
"I’ve gone from this tiny backpack to a tank because I’ve been needing more oxygen," says Maddi, whose senior photos featured one with the oxygen tubes and one without. She takes a couple dozen pills each day, and undergoes three or four daily lung treatments. In spite of missing weeks of school, she made it to prom and graduated from Glenbard West High School in 2018 with the rest of her class. On Feb. 2, 2018, she went on the lung transplant waiting list.
"She’s a very smart, determined and wonderful young woman," says Lisa Mulvaney, coordinator of the creative arts program at Lurie Children’s, and the person who recruited Maddi for the Lurie Children’s Kids Advisory Board in 2013. "From Day One, she was really invested in this group of kids and about making the hospital even better. She never wants to miss a meeting."
Maddi dragged her oxygen tank onto a Metra train and ordered a ride service once she got into Chicago to make one board meeting. Because CF patients can get sick when near other CF patients, Maddi is the only representative of that disease on the board, which has members aged 12 to 19.
"She really displays such hope and such courage," Mulvaney says. "She wants to give as much as she can."
As a freshman in high school, Maddie became the first CF patient to complete the Xtreme Hike: a one-day, 21-mile hike with her mom through the hills of the Manistee National Forest in Michigan. Maddi has helped host three proms for the inpatients at Lurie Children’s. She attended the first International Children’s Advisory Network summit in Washington, D.C. Her mother recalls how Maddi didn’t get a chance to meet with then-U.S. Sen. Mark Kirk of Illinois. "But I recognized his wheelchair at the airport," says Maddi, who walked up, introduced herself, and had a nice chat about the importance of funding research for CF and other diseases that affect children.
The New York Times video featuring Maddi was produced by Kendall Ciesemier, an original member of the Lurie Children’s Kids Advisory Board from Wheaton, and a member of the 2010-11 Daily Herald Leadership Team. At age 11, Ciesemier founded Kids Caring 4 Kids, which helps children in Africa impacted by AIDS. Her work was recognized by then-President Bill Clinton and Oprah Winfrey. Born with a rare liver disorder, Ciesemier was the recipient of two liver transplants.
"I want people to know that donating organs is so important and that I wouldn’t be alive without the generosity of a stranger," Ciesemier says via email. "I take the gift that someone gave me very seriously and I focus a lot on paying it forward. … I like to believe that I can give people hope."
Maddi says she maintains her hope.
"Of course, I want new lungs, but I’ll wait as long as it takes. I’m happy," says Maddi, who notes the transplant wait is tricky. "I have to be really sick to be at the top of the list, but I have to be healthy enough for the surgery. This is so crazy."
She gets support from her brother Zach, 16, and sisters Grace, 13, and Gabbi, 11, but Maddi says her strength comes from her Christian faith. "God’s in control," she says. "Whenever I’m down and don’t know if I can do this, I lean on God. I know He will get me the right pair of lungs."
She’s learning to play a new religious song on the piano, with the lyric, "I will fight for you." Transplanted lungs would be free of CF, but recovery from the surgery can be grueling, and requires lifelong medications and care. Imagining her life with new lungs and the ability to breathe, Maddi sees herself going to college and becoming a trainer who works with dolphins at Clearwater Marine Aquarium, the Florida not-for-profit whose care of sick and injured marine animals was made into two "Dolphin Tale" movies. Anchored close to home while she waits for her transplant, Maddi also dreams of traveling to Florida, New York, Hawaii and California, and doing some of those things that CF denied her.
"When I get these new lungs," Maddi says, breaking into a sly grin, "I want to live a little first."

A milestone, not a starting point

Texto completo: When police raided gay bars back in the day, they expected the patrons to scatter. But one hot Friday night 50 years ago, at the Stonewall Inn, no one was going anywhere. Gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender, old, young -- they booed and jeered as the cops walked their prey out of the bar. Kids across the street started throwing pennies, then bricks. Finally, the riot squad was called in, and even they couldn't clear the streets.
Martin Boyce remembers sitting on his stoop the next day, exhausted from the melee. "My God, we're going to pay so desperately for this," he thought. But that's not what happened.
"The next day we were there again," he says. "We had had enough. Every queen in that riot changed."

On June 28, 1969, what happened at Greenwich Village's Stonewall Inn became "Stonewall," the legendary uprising against homophobic abuse.
The telling and retelling of the Stonewall story makes it seem like Martin Luther King Jr.'s famous arc of the moral universe isn't long -- as he claimed -- but explosively short. Much of the 50th anniversary coverage of the uprising has marveled at how quickly gays won their civil rights, at how everything changed in one night when, in Boyce's words, "We had had enough."
But nothing about Stonewall was sudden. The homophobia was an age-old story, and the riot was the product of activism that had been building for decades. King's quote is correct: History's arc traces a very long line. It only bends toward justice because so many activists over so many years hammer relentlessly upon it.
The movement that erupted into a riot at Stonewall in 1969 dates back to the early 1900s, when LGBTQ people began to migrate to cities. Abuse and harassment followed them.
The repeal of Prohibition in 1933 empowered states to license liquor, and with licensing came the requirement that bars must be "orderly," which gave authorities cover for harassing gays even in their own establishments. In the 1940s, the Red Scare became a "Lavender Scare," as investigators applied the "subversive" label to gay men and lesbian women working for the government. The longest surviving gay resistance organization, the Mattachine Society, was founded, alongside the lesbian Daughters of Bilitis, in the early 1950s; it all but unraveled under the pressure of government scrutiny.
But in 1957, the government made a terrible mistake when it fired physicist Franklin "Frank" Kameny for being gay. Instead of going quietly, he sued. Kameny lost (the Supreme Court would not consider discrimination based on sexual orientation unconstitutional until 1996), but his fight revived the Mattachine Society. Kameny organized early gay rights protests at the White House, the Pentagon, the United Nations.
By 1969, gays who had honed their activism protesting the Vietnam War had had enough maltreatment from their straight lefty brothers. They came out and applied their politics to a new front. One of them, Carl Wittman, once a leader in Students for a Democratic Society, wrote a manifesto calling for gays to openly embrace their identity: "Stop mimicking straights, stop censoring ourselves. We have to learn that our loving each other is a good thing, not an unfortunate thing." With exquisite timing, two other SDS alumni, Bill Katzenberg and John O'Brien, scheduled a "homosexual discussion group" at Alternate U., a free counterculture school in Greenwich Village for July 1969. It would go from five pre-Stonewall registrants to 40, post-Stonewall.
When the first stone flew at the Stonewall Inn, an architecture for the movement was already in place. Before Stonewall smaller uprisings in San Francisco and Los Angeles galvanized individuals. After Stonewall, there were meetings.
Within days, radical members of the New York Mattachine Society forced its conservative president, Dick Leitsch, to convene the group, where lesbian activist Martha Shelley stood up and invited everyone to a demonstration protesting police abuse. She soon dubbed the protest planning committee the Gay Liberation Front. Meanwhile, the Alternate U. group set an agenda and a meeting schedule and adopted the same rubric. The game was on, or more appropriately, it was continuing.
We can see a corollary to the Stonewall milestone in another explosive cultural moment. In the course of 10 days in early October 2017, seemingly out of nowhere, the New York Times and the New Yorker both exposed Harvey Weinstein's epic sexual abuse and harassment history. Then actress Alyssa Milano shared a message: "If you've been sexually harassed or assaulted, write 'me too' as a reply to this tweet." Overnight, #MeToo (originated by black activist Tarana Burke in 2011) echoed 55,000 times.
Presto, change-o, right? Not really.
Way back in 1974, Paulette Barnes, a brave clerk at the Environmental Protection Agency, sued a boss who had given her a choice: sex with him or lose her job. Happily, a brilliant law student, Catharine MacKinnon, was laying the theoretical groundwork to establish sexual harassment as sex discrimination -- a civil rights offense. Barnes won on appeal, and MacKinnon's theory became law. That wasn't enough to protect Anita Hill or to make Monica Lewinsky a purely sympathetic figure. It would take another 2 1/2 decades, when a cadre of young feminists empowered by the internet -- Andi Zeisler, Jessica Valenti, Rebecca Traister -- began to insist on another "we've had enough" moment. Out of their ranks came the change in mindset, and some of the mainstream journalists who would break the Weinstein story.
"Stonewall" conveniently marks a movement that was a century in the making and that would go on to be honed by assassination (Harvey Milk), a deadly epidemic (AIDS) and a brilliantly strategic same-sex marriage campaign. The Weinstein revelations likewise mark a milestone for women, but to say it launched a movement isn't exactly accurate. Gay rights and women's rights don't turn in an instant, no matter how galvanizing. The revolution is incremental. It takes agonizing courage, a dedicated fight, herculean perseverance. It takes time.

Texto completo: El gobierno mexicano presentó este viernes al Senado del país la carta que recoge el acuerdo migratorio que firmó con Estados Unidos el viernes de la semana pasada. Previamente, a principios de esta semana, Donald Trump habría mostrado un supuesto “plan secreto”. Sin embargo, el presidente estadounidense solo recibió burlas por presentar lo que parecía un papel en blanco.
Ambos países “comenzarán de inmediato las conversaciones para establecer los términos definitivos de un acuerdo bilateral vinculante para abordar el reparto de la carga y la asignación de responsabilidades para el procesamiento de las peticiones de refugio de los migrantes ” -rezaba la carta, que adelantó el periódico Reforma.
El acuerdo bilateral, firmado el 7 de junio, compromete a las dos partes firmantes a “ aceptar la devolución y procesar las solicitudes del estatus de refugiado [que presenten] nacionales de países terceros” . Es decir, tanto México como Estados Unidos deben hacerse cargo de las personas que atraviesen su territorio antes de pedir asilo en alguno de los puertos de entrada que comparten ambas naciones.
Well, Mexico just released the full page that @realDonaldTrump carried when he said there was a secret agreement pic.twitter.com/A5ocd4WV6p
— Carlos Manuel Rodríguez (@carlos_rgz) June 14, 2019
El último párrafo de la carta obliga a México a rediseñar su estrategia migratoria si “Estados Unidos considera a su discreción” que las medidas adoptadas por su vecino del sur en los primeros 45 días “no lograron resultados suficientes para abordar el flujo de migrantes”. En tal caso, el gobierno de Andrés Manuel López Obrador tendrá otros 45 días para “cumplir el acuerdo”.
Respecto a este párrafo, el canciller mexicano Marcelo Ebrard, explicó en la presentación del documento al Senado del país que las dos partes volverán a evaluar la situación migratoria dentro de 45 días y, de nuevo, al cabo de tres meses . Según publicó también el diario Reforma, Ebrard negó la existencia de otro acuerdo que recogiera las negociaciones con Estados Unidos.
Cuando Trump mostró a los medios el documento que supuestamente recogía el acuerdo con México, el presidente no compartió ningún detalle. “Esta es una página de un acuerdo muy largo y muy bueno para México y para Estados Unidos”, añadió el presidente con un folio en la mano. Días antes, el diario New York Times había publicado que las medidas publicadas ya se habían acordado meses atrás.

Do music charts still matter?

Texto completo: "Random" might be the best word to describe a handful of music news within the past week.

Justin Bieber challenged actor Tom Cruise to a UFC fight on Twitter. The New York Times reported master recordings of Nirvana, Steely Dan, The Roots, R.E.M., and up to 500,000 others were included in the damage from the 2008 Universal Studios fire. An unnamed hacker stole unreleased Radiohead recordings from its 1997 album OK Computer and threatened to release the music unless the band paid $150,000. Instead, Radiohead released the music online for $23 with all proceeds donated directly to a climate change organization.

Oh yeah, you might have also seen Big Bird and the rest of the Sesame Street cast on NPR's Tiny Desk Concert.

Yet, one of the eye-catchers this week was when Page Six reported DJ Khaled was looking to sue Billboard for allegedly cheating him out of the No. 1 spot for his newest album Father of Asahd on the Top 200 for ranking second, behind Tyler, The Creator's IGOR.

The music producer claimed Billboard didn't include the 100,000-energy-drink-bundle downloads in the final tally, when an agreement had been made that those units would be included toward his debut numbers, and was the reason he ranked No. 2.

Artists use a bundle strategy where apparel or miscellaneous items are sold along with an album - in DJ Khaled's case, energy drinks. Artists use bundles to increase their chart position and revenue. In fact, Prince was the first to use a bundle package in 2004 when he gave away copies of his album Musicology with concert tickets.

Yet, despite the drama between the upset music producer and Billboard, do chart rankings even matter in 2019 to the consumer?

The Hot 100 measures total song consumption of streaming activity, traditional sales, and airplay and, at least for new artists, has the power to provide more opportunity and success such as the artist's music to be featured on movies soundtracks or television shows and commercials along with press. However, unless you're part of the artists and repertoire division of a record label, it's difficult to believe the majority of music consumers pay attention to the charts.

Today we have online radio, various streaming platforms, and podcasts to find music making it difficult to keep a keen eye on, which Rolling Stone has certainly pointed out in a few articles in 2018. There's also another conversation between a band such as The Beatles in album sales compared to artists such as Drake or Post Malone who have more than 1 billion streams in today's realm of hitting a button on a platform, but we'll save that for another day. Do the number of streams even matter now that anyone can literally upload their music with the press of a button?

The word "random" comes back to mind when stumbling across new artists, whether that be on a SoundCloud account or a random YouTube video, but it seems like the music charts are becoming something of the past.

New York Times writer Ben Sisario had it right over the weekend when he wrote "the phrase 'No. 1 with a bullet' has referred to a song or album that zooms to the top of the Billboard charts. Given current music industry practices, "No. 1 with a T-shirt" may be more accurate."

Texto completo: ProPublica Illinois is an independent, nonprofit newsroom that produces investigative journalism with moral force. Sign up for our newsletter to get weekly updates written by our journalists.
Hello, again! How are you, Illinois? Let’s talk about tickets.
This week, a task force examining Chicago’s ticketing and debt collection practices released its recommendations for reform. The task force, officially called the Chicago Fines, Fees & Access Collaborative, is made up of aldermen, city department heads and community advocates. It was launched by City Clerk Anna Valencia in December 2018, sparked by our reporting with WBEZ Chicago that showed how the city’s ticketing and debt collection practices disproportionately affect low-income and black neighborhoods — an issue you should be fairly familiar with if you’ve been keeping up with these newsletters ??.
Overall, the task force “falls short of calling for immediate reforms or specific changes to some of the most controversial practices, including license suspensions over unpaid tickets, late penalties and ticketing disparities,” my colleagues, ProPublica Illinois reporter Melissa Sanchez and WBEZ data reporter Elliott Ramos, wrote in a story this week. Right now, it’s more like a road map for the City Council — should it choose to introduce legislation.

“Things of this magnitude took eons to get to this hot mess, so we can’t be unrealistic and change things tomorrow …”
— Rosazlia Grillier, a parent leader from the nonprofit Community Organizing and Family Issues who was on the task force.

Still, here are some of the recommendations we’ll be keeping an eye on:
1.
Rolling back the $200 fine for not having a required city sticker on your vehicle.
In July of last year, we reported that the city’s 2011 decision to raise the cost of sticker tickets from $120 to $200 produced only modest revenue increases but led to hundreds of millions of dollars in debt for residents.
2.
Ending the automatic doubling of tickets when late and, instead, tying the cost of the ticket to a driver’s income.
The $200 city sticker tickets can quickly rise to $488 with late penalties and fees. Our reporting shows how, for Chicago’s working poor, and particularly for African Americans, a single unpaid parking or automated traffic camera ticket can quickly spiral out of control and threaten their livelihoods.
3.
Allowing motorists who receive those tickets to pay a reduced rate of, say, $10 if they come into compliance by purchasing a vehicle sticker.
Alderman Gilbert Villegas, of the Northwest Side’s 36th Ward, reintroduced legislation this week to reduce late penalties, give motorists more time to pay tickets and allow community service in place of some fines and penalties.
4.
Reforming the city’s payment plans by reducing down payments or basing them on motorists’ ability to pay.
Reducing down payments for low-income motorists is also part of Villegas’ legislation. Right now, motorists with significant ticket debt must make a down payment of up to $1,000 to get on a payment plan, keep their vehicles from getting impounded or lift license suspensions.
5.
Examining Chicago’s massive vehicle impoundment program.
A WBEZ Chicago investigation this year showed how Chicago sold tens of thousands of impounded vehicles to a private towing company for less than $200 each.
6.
Establishing a “Chicago Financial Justice Director Position: a position to coordinate efforts across City Departments and agencies, as well as serve as point person on issues pertaining to fines and fees reform.”
In conversations we’ve had with people affected by this issue, many have expressed frustration with contesting tickets and navigating the various departments involved.
7.
Reviewing whether police should issue citations for non-moving violations.
We analyzed more than 54 million parking, standing and vehicle compliance tickets issued since 1996. We found that police — rather than city parking enforcement aides or private contractors — issued most of these kinds of tickets in majority black wards. Search for ticket information about your ward in our app, The Ticket Trap.
Also of note: Task force members said they couldn’t come to an agreement on what to do about license suspensions, one of the most controversial topics on this issue. As always, we’ll keep you posted on what we learn. And if you’re into this, please join our Facebook group, Driven Into Debt: Chicago Drivers Navigating Vehicle Ticket Troubles.
Until next week …

P.S. Did you know that Illinois is the opposite of Alabama? At least, that’s what one New York Times writer suggested in a piece this week examining America’s growing divisions, as most states are now under the control of a single political party. But maybe our states have more in common than it seems? Plenty of people agree that both Illinois and Alabama are among the most corrupt in the country … ha.

Texto completo: NUEVA YORK – Un bebé de 4 meses llamado Constantin Mutu es el niño migrante de menor edad identificado hasta el momento entre las miles de víctimas de la separación de familias en la frontera Estados Unidos-México por la política de “tolerancia cero” del gobierno de Donald Trump, reveló este viernes The New York Times.
Exclusive: We found the youngest known child separated from his parents at the border under President Trump. He was only 4 months old https://t.co/IHSAe6ebrs
— The New York Times (@nytimes) June 14, 2019
Un episodio en “The Weekly”, la nueva serie de televisión producida por el NYT, aborda las vicisitudes que atravesó el pequeño rumano, enviado a los cuatro meses a un hogar de acogida lejos de sus padres, que habían viajado a México desde Rumania con dos de sus cinco hijos -él y un niño de 4 años- para pedir asilo en Estados Unidos en 2018.
Los agentes fronterizos estadounidenses detuvieron en Texas al padre, Vasile, y al bebé Constantin, y después la madre, Florentina, y el otro hijo y los padres y el hijo mayor tuvieron que volver a Rumania.
De acuerdo a la historia que adelanta el diario, el padre de Constantin tiene antecedentes criminales y aseguró haber recibido “presiones para retirar la petición de asilo”.
Vasile Mutu fue enviado a un centro de detención y finalmente lo deportaron a Rumanía, mientras que las autoridades colocaron a Constantin, que tenía solo 4 meses de edad, en una familia de acogida en el estado de Michigan, al noreste de Estados Unidos.
“Cuando el presidente Trump se rindió a la presión y firmó una orden ejecutiva que paralizaba las separaciones, un juez dio paso a una demanda que pretendía reunir a las familias y preparó el camino de vuelta a Rumanía para Constantin”, señala el rotativo, que visitó al pequeño en el hogar de acogida y a sus padres en Rumania.
El Times reveló el año pasado que las autoridades estaban separando a los menores de sus familias en la frontera, acusó a las autoridades de no cuantificar el problema, y después calculó que en octubre había más de 700 niños migrantes separados de adultos que los reclamaban como sus hijos.

America squanders its power as others move in

Texto completo: NEW YORK – This week we watched an unusual spectacle. The foreign minister of Germany, one of the United States' closest allies, went to Tehran and announced that a European payment system, designed as an alternative to the dollar-based one, would soon be ready. This visit was made in coordination with Britain and France, both of which helped create the new payment mechanism, called INSTEX.
INSTEX will probably fail or prove to be wholly inadequate in the short term. The dollar's dominance in global transactions – which has been a huge benefit for America – will be hard to displace, but INSTEX is a warning sign, the canary in the coal mine. America's closest allies are working hard to chip away at a crucial underpinning of U.S. global power.
Why? It's simple: the Trump administration's abuse of this power. The United States sits atop the world for now, but there are forces eroding that lofty status. Some of these are deep structural shifts, like the rise of China. But as The Economist points out, others are reactions to a pattern of hegemonic abuse.
Consider the trigger for this search for an alternative to the dollar. Britain, France and Germany are all signatories to the 2015 Iran nuclear deal. When the Trump administration unilaterally reneged on the pact last year – even though Iran had abided by it – the U.S. reimposed sanctions, using its dollar power to prevent other countries from doing business with Iran (since most international transactions use the dollar for convenience). Furious at this misuse of authority, the Europeans have set about trying to create a new payment system.
They are not the only ones. The Chinese, Russian and Indians have also been trying to create mechanisms that would allow them to escape the hegemony of the dollar. So far, these efforts have been largely ineffective. But if so many major trading nations, including key European ones, set out to subvert the dollar, they will eventually have some impact. Once upon a time, the British pound was the dominant international currency, but it was supplanted by the dollar. There is no iron law that says the dollar will be king forever.
Or look at the way the Trump administration has been wielding the threat of tariffs. In many cases, the administration has invoked "national security" concerns. The law that allows the president to levy such tariffs was passed during the Cold War to enable the country to preserve critical industries that might be needed to sustain the geopolitical contest with the Soviet Union. Canadian aluminum and Japanese-made SUVs don't fit the bill, even if Trump thinks otherwise. As Jennifer Hillman, the former general counsel to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, wrote recently in The New York Times: "If the United States can justify tariffs on cars as a threat to national security, then every country in the world can most likely justify restrictions on almost any product under a similar claim."
The United States has legitimate complaints about China's trade practices. Beijing will often follow the letter of the law but find clever ways to undermine its spirit through loopholes and exceptions. But that is precisely what the Trump administration is itself doing. By misusing the national security exemption, it is weakening the very trade rules and international laws that it is asking China to follow. If I were a Chinese negotiator, I would simply explain that I would follow trade rules just as much as Donald Trump does.
Or consider Trump's efforts to crush Chinese tech behemoth Huawei. So far, very few countries have followed America's ban, but almost all are surely noting that if they remain reliant on crucial American technologies, Washington could suddenly cripple them on a whim. The result will be a greater desire for technological self-reliance and a shift away from American companies.
America still occupies a unique position in the world. But it is clear that we are moving into an era in which more players will have more power. Twenty years ago, China accounted for 3% of global GDP; today its share is 15% and rising. In such a period, it is all the more important that Washington act with restraint, use international institutions and try to establish consensus.

Jury Convicts Libyan on 2 Terrorism-Related Counts in Benghazi Trial

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- A Libyan man was found guilty on Thursday on two terrorism-related charges arising from the attack on a United States diplomatic compound in Benghazi in 2012 that killed two Americans, including the ambassador to Libya, and became a political flash point.
But the jury in Washington remained deadlocked on 15 other charges against the man, Mustafa al-Imam, and the Federal District Court judge overseeing the trial ordered jurors to keep deliberating on the remaining counts. Those included aiding and abetting several murders and aiding the follow-up attack, hours later, on a nearby C.I.A. "annex" facility, during which two more Americans were killed.
Regardless of what the jurors decide on those counts, the guilty verdict on at least two charges -- conspiracy to provide material support to terrorists and aiding in the malicious destruction of American property -- means Mr. al-Imam is virtually guaranteed a lengthy prison sentence.
He became the second suspect to be tried successfully in federal court in Washington for his role in the deadly assault, which took on broader significance as Republicans and conservative news outlets seized on them to try to damage the presidential ambitions of Hillary Clinton, then the secretary of state.
Ahmed Abu Khattala, a former militia leader in Benghazi and a friend of Mr. al-Imam's, was convicted in 2017 on similar charges and sentenced to 22 years in prison. But both cases experienced turbulence: The jury in Mr. Khattala's case acquitted him of 14 charges, including several counts of murder, the same charges that the jury in Mr. al-Imam's case has struggled to reach agreement over.
That rocky experience underscores the difficulty in bringing foreign terrorism suspects captured under battlefield conditions to the United States for prosecution under civilian-court standards, raising the question of whether the government will seek to apprehend and bring back any more of the dozen or more suspects it has identified from the attacks. Mr. al-Imam was captured by American commandos about a month before the verdict in Mr. Khattala's case.
On the night of the Benghazi attacks, on Sept. 11, 2012, armed men overran the diplomatic compound and set it ablaze. Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and another State Department employee, Sean Smith, were killed. Hours later, militants attacked the nearby C.I.A. base with mortars and small-arms fire. Two C.I.A. security contractors, Tyrone S. Woods and Glen A. Doherty, were killed, and others were wounded.
In 2017, American commandos and members of the F.B.I.'s elite Hostage Rescue Team apprehended Mr. al-Imam in Libya and brought him aboard an American warship, where he was questioned. Mr. Khattala was captured in Libya in 2013 by a similar American force, demonstrating the eagerness of the United States to hunt down those involved.
Mr. al-Imam and Mr. Khattala, who were close friends, traveled to the diplomatic compound on the evening of the attack. The defense argued that Mr. al-Imam was just in the wrong place at the wrong time, but prosecutors said he intended to commit deadly violence.
"When they're going armed and ready and with the military-style vehicle with Abu Khattala to the U.S. Embassy," the defendant "knows exactly what he's doing," Karen Patricia Seifert, a prosecutor, told the jury during closing arguments this month. "That's when he's joining the conspiracy, right at that moment. He knows where they're going. He knows they're going armed."
Mr. al-Imam was one of the men filmed entering and leaving the diplomatic compound the night of the attack, and he stole materials from it, including a map that prosecutors said he suspected had intelligence value. Phone records indicated that during the attack, Mr. al-Imam spoke several times with Mr. Khattala; prosecutors argued that this was a sign they were coordinating and said Mr. al-Imam wanted to attack the compound because he believed it was a spy base.
Prosecutors pointed to what they described as incriminating comments he made while being questioned by the F.B.I. aboard the warship. He told agents: "I know why I'm here. It's because of Khattala."
During closing arguments, Ms. Seifert said Mr. al-Imam "had consciousness of guilt even then."
"He knew what he had done," she said, "he knew who he had associated with, and he knew his associates had perpetrated these attacks together with his assistance."
Mr. al-Imam's defense lawyer, Matthew J. Peed, said his client was just a convenience store worker and devoted family man who happened to go to the compound on the night of the attack. His client played no role in it, Mr. Peed maintained, and like others simply went to the compound to see what was happening.
His lawyers also sought to play down the evidence against him, dismissing his apparently frequent phone communications with Mr. Khattala during that period.
"A friendship is not a conspiracy," Mr. Peed told the jury.
Defense lawyers had tried previously to suppress the comments Mr. al-Imam made to F.B.I. agents while aboard the Navy warship. His lawyer contended he been suffering from seasickness mental trauma. But Judge Christopher R. Cooper of the Federal District Court in Washington rejected the argument and permitted prosecutors to use that evidence.
Lawyers in the case also called as a witness David D. Kirkpatrick, a correspondent for The New York Times who interviewed many people in Benghazi about the attack in its aftermath.
In an article published at the end of 2013, Mr. Kirkpatrick reported that a friend of Mr. Khattala's had sought to exonerate him by offering an account of a phone call with him during the attack. The article also noted that several witnesses to the attack had contradicted the friend's account.
The same friend, Bilal Al-Ubaydi, now using a pseudonym for his safety, testified in the case as a witness for the prosecution. A lawyer for the defendant called Mr. Kirkpatrick to the stand in an effort to discredit the friend's current testimony by contrasting it with his earlier account of the phone call.
Mr. Kirkpatrick provided his testimony via a video link from the American Embassy in London and was limited to confirming the accuracy of the report in the 2013 article about the attack.
For the F.B.I., capture and prosecution of Mr. al-Imam was considered a victory. Jeff Sessions, then the attorney general, did not believe that suspected terrorists should be prosecuted in civilian courts yet allowed the Libyan to be brought to the United States for trial.
During the same period when Mr. al-Imam was captured and brought to domestic soil for prosecution, Mr. Sessions had refused to bring back a suspected Qaeda operative, a Sudanese citizen known as Abu Khaybar, to face charges in New York. He has been held in Yemen for more than two years by United Arab Emirates authorities.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump sought on Wednesday to cast recent polls as "fake numbers" amid reports that his campaign's internal polling data and public polls show him lagging behind Democrat Joe Biden in key battleground states.
Trump took to Twitter to accuse the media of weaponizing polls, a day after a new Quinnipiac Poll showed him trailing against six Democratic presidential hopefuls in a potential 2020 matchup.
The president also pushed back against a New York Times report that indicated his campaign's internal polling shows him falling behind Biden in more than a dozen states critical to a 2020 victory. The Times, Politico and other national news outlets, citing campaign sources, have also reported on the Trump campaign's private polling data, which show Biden leading in states Trump won in 2016, including Florida, North Carolina, Wisconsin, Ohio and Michigan.
"The Fake (Corrupt) News Media said they had a leak into polling done by my campaign which, by the way and despite the phony and never ending Witch Hunt, are the best numbers WE have ever had," Trump tweeted without offering his campaign's data. "They reported Fake numbers that they made up & don't even exist. WE WILL WIN AGAIN!"
Trump, who often lagged in polling leading up to his 2016 victory, has often berated polls that showcase unfavorable numbers, while embracing polling figures that show solid support among his base.
Speaking to reporters at the White House on Wednesday, Trump said he was "not a huge believer in polling."
"We have some internal polling, very little, and it's unbelievably strong," Trump said. "The strongest I've ever been is exactly today."
The latest Quinnipiac Poll, conducted by the nonpartisan and independent Quinnipiac Polling Institute, shows Biden leading Trump by 13 points among the 1,214 voters surveyed from June 6 -10. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) has a nine-point advantage over Trump, Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) has an eight-point edge and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) has a seven-point lead over Trump, according to the poll. Sen. Corey Booker (D-N.J.) and South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg each top Trump by five points, according to the results of the poll, which� had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.

Texto completo: Willett, a lawyer turned stay-at-home mother, was happily raising two daughters and building a writing career, when she hears a life-altering voicemail from another woman on her husband's phone. The discovery of betrayal marks the first of many collapses: each one like an avalanche headed straight for her family's four-story Brooklyn home.
"Disassembly Required" gives readers access to every intimate moment of Willett's divorce, starting with long days in court fighting to keep the house she'd come to know and love.
Initially, her soon-to-be ex-husband agreed to continue paying for the house, but like other promises, this one was quickly forgotten in his haste to begin a new life. In court, Willett's decision to become a stay-at-home mom backfired, and she found herself at the mercy of judges expecting her to acquiesce, move on, and leave behind the home she'd built.
Instead, she fought back, armed with her prior legal experience and determined to make the justice system keep its promises. Willett's personal struggles are placed against the backdrop of systemic injustice suffered during divorce, mostly by women, and the mortgage crisis of 2008. All around her, people were losing their homes while she tried desperately to keep her own American dream afloat.
After six years, Willett wins the house in addition to a mortgage, a bill for attorney's fees, and decreased alimony. For four years, she struggles to maintain some sense of normalcy for her daughters as she continues to battle the daily collapse of the house, the family, and herself. She faces each landslide as it comes: an infestation of bird mites and a leaky ceiling; panic attacks and a bad back; and the slow ache of splitting her daughters' time between two homes.
When her youngest daughter prepares to go to college, she endures the final collapse: an empty nest. The time has come to sell the house. Willett's effort to catalogue and dismantle their belongings soon turns into inventory on the life she shared with her ex-husband.
Each possession sparks a memory or a revelation. What should be thrown away? Who is responsible for four-stories of family photo albums, bank statements, and souvenirs purchased during family vacations? And most importantly, after the explosion of her family life, what, if anything, can be salvaged?
Willett's writing shows the type of matter-of-fact vulnerability that can only come from surviving what was meant to destroy you. Even the most gut-wrenching of scenes have a level of self-awareness that expertly avoids pity. Moments of dark humor and wisdom shine throughout the narrative, which reads almost like a second coming-of-age story. Slowly, order returns to Willett's life, and she's able to rebuild, the satisfaction of surviving acting as the perfect foundation for a new life.
Thankfully, she built that new foundation here in Savannah. Originally from Maryland, Willett studied political science at Penn State and law at Catholic University's Columbus School of Law in Washington, D.C. Her work has been published in The New York Times, Salon, The Washington Post, Newsweek, The Guardian and many more. She also serves on the boards of the Savannah Homeless Authority and the Flannery O'Connor Childhood Home.
Ariel Felton received her B.F.A. in English from Valdosta State University and her M.F.A. in writing from SCAD. Her writing has been published in The Progressive, The Bitter Southerner, Scalawag, McSweeney's Internet Tendency, Under the Gum Tree, Savannah Magazine and more.

Martin Feldstein, influential Harvard economist, key Reagan official

Texto completo: While Ronald Reagan was campaigning for president in 1980, Martin S. Feldstein was teaching at Harvard University, a top rising star in economics though he hadn't yet held an influential position in government. Would he head to the White House if Reagan were elected, a reporter asked. “I haven't really thought about that," he told the Globe that June. “I'd have to consider it."
Summoned to Washington, D.C., after the election, Dr. Feldstein said yes, and became a chief economic adviser in the Reagan administration — building a reputation as someone who was unafraid to publicly disagree with other White House officials.
Dr. Feldstein, who lived in Belmont, died Tuesday at the age of 79. His death was announced in an e-mail sent to colleagues by Jeremy C. Stein, the chairman of Harvard's economics department. It did not say where he died. He had been treated for cancer for some time, Stein said.
During his long career at Harvard, Dr. Feldstein nurtured many of today's top policy makers. He later counseled the administrations of George W. Bush and Barack Obama, and for three decades — from 1977 to 2008 — he was president of the National Bureau of Economic Research, a once-sleepy think tank based in Cambridge that under his leadership became a gathering point for economists, particularly those focused on policy-oriented work.
Dr. Feldstein rose to prominence early in his career as he sought to take serious economic research out of the classroom and apply it to public policy.
“He was a dominating scholar and teacher of public sector economics of the last half century," Lawrence Summers, a former Treasury secretary and former Harvard president, told The New York Times Tuesday.
Summers once worked as a research assistant for Dr. Feldstein, who was his dissertation adviser. He credited Dr. Feldstein with “bringing serious empirical analysis, particularly with respect to incentives, to the whole field of public sector economics."
Dr. Feldstein entered the national spotlight in 1982, when he was appointed chairman of Reagan's Council of Economic Advisers, just as the country was heading into a deep recession. Dr. Feldstein replaced Murray L. Weidenbaum.
Dr. Feldstein helped lay the intellectual groundwork for the “supply-side" economic theory that underpinned much of Reagan's economic policy, and which was known as Reaganomics. It held that the nation could be restored to economic health through the stimulus of tax cuts — the heart of supply-side theory — and by restricting the money supply to contain inflation. Critics called that combination contradictory.
But Dr. Feldstein was “not a polemicist," Summers said, and viewed himself as a scholar, not a political actor.
He was also a prolific writer, the author or editor of several books, on topics such as taxes and capital formation, the Social Security system, and the economics of art museums, as well as hundreds of academic papers. He frequently contributed opinion pieces to The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, The Washington Post, the Globe, and other publications.
He assembled a staff that included Summers and Paul Krugman, who won the Nobel Prize in economics and is now a columnist for the Times.
At first, Dr. Feldstein's support of tax cuts and deficit reduction matched the White House's goals, but campaign rhetoric soon collided with everyday reality. When the Reagan administration called for the dual aims of cutting taxes and increasing military spending, Dr. Feldstein looked at the numbers and they simply didn't add up.
"It will not be possible for us to grow our way out of these deficits" without raising taxes, Dr. Feldstein said in 1983.
His economic analysis may have been right, but his politics were wrong.
Reagan largely ignored the advice and turned instead to Treasury Secretary Donald Regan and Secretary of State George Shultz, an economist by training. Administration insiders privately called the Harvard economist "Dr. Gloom."
White House spokesman Larry Speakes shot down Dr. Feldstein's call for a tax hike, saying, "Feldstein's wrong; the president's right."
Speakes all but called for Dr. Feldstein to step down immediately, deliberately mispronouncing his name, in his Mississippi drawl, as "Feld-steen." (The proper pronunciation is "Feld-stine.")
When Dr. Feldstein submitted a report to Congress in February 1984, Regan undercut him, telling a Senate panel, "As far as I'm concerned, you can throw it away."
Dr. Feldstein refused to step down and even made light of Regan's comment, saying, "I suppose that was just a throwaway line."
He returned to Harvard later in the year, earning the admiration of members of Congress from both parties.
"It may very well be that you leave Washington with an economy in ruins," said Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York, "but you leave with a reputation intact."
Upon his return to Harvard, a Globe editorial said his tenure as chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers was “notable for candor."
“Reagan would do well to look for a replacement as straightforward as Feldstein," the editorial said, adding that he was “leaving with his honor very much intact. Whatever one thinks about his conservative views, he has earned access to the ears of the rest of the world, access he seemed not to have had in the White House."
Martin Stuart Feldstein was born on Nov. 25, 1939, in the Bronx to Meyer and Esther (Gevarter) Feldstein. His father, who was known as Mac, was a lawyer. Martin Feldstein won a scholarship to Harvard, from where he graduated in 1961.
He had considered becoming a physician before becoming fascinated by economics while attending graduate school in England in the 1960s. His analysis of the efficiency of the British health-care system helped influence national policy and helped define his future.
"I figured if a 25-year-old graduate student could do something," he later told the Globe, "then economics was a pretty good activity to be in."
He went on to earn a doctorate from Oxford University. While in England he met his future wife, Kathleen Foley, who is also an economist and with whom he would cowrite columns — including dozens for the Globe's business section in the late 1990s and early 2000s.
Dr. Feldstein returned to the United States before the end of the decade to be an assistant professor of economics at Harvard, where he studied the legacies of programs such as Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal, Harry S. Truman's Fair Deal, and Lyndon B. Johnson's Great Society. He said he found that such programs, while created by Democrats with good intentions, had ended up worsening economic conditions.
In addition to his wife, Feldstein leaves their daughters, Margaret Feldstein Borden and Janet Feldstein McKillop; a sister, Helen Feldstein; and four grandchildren. Funeral services will be held 2 p.m. Thursday at Levine Chapels in Brookline. Burial will be private.
Dr. Feldstein was an “extraordinary research economist" from an early age, winning the prestigious John Bates Clark Medal for economists under the age of 40, said James Poterba, a professor of economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Poterba, who was an undergraduate when he met Dr. Feldstein, succeeded him as the president of the National Bureau of Economic Research in 2008. “He was a terrific and inspirational teacher," he added, “clear, exciting — got you feeling like economics could really make a difference in the world."
Many of Dr. Feldstein's students, of various political persuasions, went on to prominence in their own right, among them Raj Chetty, the Harvard economist known for his work on inequality and social mobility, and Jeffrey Sachs, the Columbia University economist known for his work on global poverty.
“If you look at the economists who have played important roles in economic policy in this country over the past four decades, an incredible number of them were students of Marty's or students of students of Marty's," Douglas Elmendorf, dean of the Harvard Kennedy School and a former director of the Congressional Budget Office, told the Times.
“Marty taught people how to think about economic policy in a rigorous way with a real commitment to making policy better, in order to make the world better," Elmendorf said.
Indeed, Dr. Feldstein conceded that he had little time to devote to anything other than economics. Nearly all his friends were economists.
“It's one thing to have other interests, and another thing to have time for them," he told the Globe in 2005. “I keep accumulating books, and saying, 'Maybe next year.' "

Rand Paul: 'Insiders' say John Brennan lost 'need to know' clearance and access to classified info

Texto completo: Sen. Rand Paul said White House "insiders" assured him former CIA Director John Brennan's access to classified information has been cut after it was reported he still had his security clearance in spite of a presidential order.
In a tweet Wednesday, the Kentucky Republican said Brennan's “need to know” clearance was indeed revoked by President Trump.
Tweet
Trump announced in August that Brennan's security clearance was being stripped due to "erratic behavior" that disqualified him from having access to sensitive information. But a source told the New York Times last month that the White House never followed through with the complicated bureaucratic process of revocation.
A CIA spokesperson declined to comment at the time, telling the Washington Examiner the agency does not discuss individual security clearances. The White House did not return a request for comment.
Although it was widely believed he had lost his clearance, Brennan has on occasion visited Capitol Hill to brief Democrats on national security matters. He has been an outspoken critic of Trump and his tendency to question the motives of members of the U.S. intelligence community.
Brennan recently said he hopes Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats and CIA Director Gina Haspel will "stand up" to Trump's "unprecedented act" of granting Attorney General William Barr "full and complete authority to declassify information" related to the origins of the federal investigation into possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russia.
A close ally of the president, Paul told CNN last week he hoped Trump would conduct a search to find out who may have defied his order last year. He said the "deep state," in which federal or military officials defy a democratically elected government, was likely to blame.

NYT cuts all daily political cartoons

Texto completo: The New York Times is again making news for how it handles editorial cartoons - or in the latest turn, will not handle editorial cartoons.
Beginning next month, the Times will cease running daily political cartoons in its international edition, editorial page editor James Bennet said Monday in a statement - a move that brings the overseas newspaper "into line with the domestic paper," which in recent years had ceased running weekly roundups of syndicated cartoons and experimented instead with longer-form editorial comics.
The decision came to light Monday when longtime contributor Patrick Chappatte wrote on his blog that he was told the news last week by Times editors. In his post, Chappatte pointed to the Times controversy from April, when a cartoon depicting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as a guide dog - wearing a Star of David collar tag and leading a blind, yarmulke-wearing President Trump - was widely condemned as anti-Semitic and evocative of Nazi propaganda.
The cartoon, by Portuguese artist Antonio Moreira Antunes, was distributed by the syndicate CartoonArts International, selected by a Times editor in Hong Kong and published in the global edition of the Times, which ultimately apologized for the cartoon. Last month, publisher A.G. Sulzberger said in a staff memo that the Times would cease publishing cartoons by nonstaff members.
Bennet's statement, however, is worded as if to dispel any direct connection between the Antunes cartoon fallout and the employment of contract contributors such as Chappatte.
"We're very grateful for and proud of the work Patrick Chappatte and [Singapore-based cartoonist] Heng Kim Song have done for the international edition of The New York Times," Bennet said in the statement before adding: "For well over a year we have been considering bringing that edition into line with the domestic paper by ending daily political cartoons and will do so beginning on July 1st."
Through a Times representative Tuesday, Bennet declined The Washington Post's request for comment.
Many editorial cartoonists have been angered by the Times's frequent reluctance to publish political cartoons in its domestic paper - and have been vocal about the imperiled nature of their industry. Over the past three decades, the ranks of staff political cartoonists in North American papers have dwindled from hundreds to dozens. Such Pulitzer Prize winners as Steve Benson and Nick Anderson have recently been laid off, and last year, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette fired veteran cartoonist Rob Rogers, a Pulitzer finalist this year, for his anti-Trump commentary. All three artists generally work in traditional political cartoon formats of one or two panels.
In recent years, the Pulitzer Prizes have recognized as finalists a handful of political cartoonists who instead often work in a multi-panel, narrative form of commentary, including Matt Bors, Jen Sorensen, Dan Perkins (a.k.a. Tom Tomorrow) and Ken Fisher (a.k.a. Ruben Bolling). Yet it was graphic journalism by the Times that sparked industry controversy: The Pulitzer Board last year awarded a Times entry that was a visual narrative but, in a historic first for the editorial cartoon category, was not a direct commentary in nature. The winning work, "Welcome to the New World" by Jake Halpern and Michael Sloan, was a nonfiction "graphic novel" series about a family of Syrian refugees.
On Monday, Bennet wrote that the Times plans to do "more such work and [hopes] to collaborate with Patrick and Heng and others on such projects in the future."
"I'm glad they're leaving that door open," the Geneva-based Chappatte told The Post on Tuesday, noting that he was a proponent of this kind of comics journalism for the Times in 2016, with his graphical series "Inside Death Row."
Bennet wrote that such long-form visual journalism expresses "nuance, complexity and strong voice from a diversity of viewpoints across all of our platforms."
But the Times is nixing "tip of the spear" single-panel cartoons - a form of pointed critique that in American newspapers dates back to the 19th-century work of the legendary Thomas Nast, as well as to pamphlet images published by Benjamin Franklin.
Chappatte said Monday that he still believes in the power of such images, writing: "In the insane world we live in, the art of visual commentary is needed more than ever. And so is humor."
Chappatte began a quest to get political cartoons into the Times nearly 25 years ago, eventually persuading the Paris-based International Herald Tribune, then a joint venture between The Post and the Times, to hire an "in-house editorial cartoonist." Just three months ago, Chappatte won the Overseas Press Club's cartoon award.
But Chappatte speculated Monday that his decades of work have been "undone" by the Trump-Netanyahu cartoon. "I'm afraid this is not just about cartoons, but about journalism and opinion in general," wrote Chappatte, who is in his early 50s. "We are in a world where moralistic mobs gather on social media and rise like a storm, falling upon newsrooms in an overwhelming blow."
Some political artists view the Times's decision to end daily political cartoons as a repudiation of the art form.
"It is their clarity and pointedness, the sharpness of their satire, that make them such powerful vehicles for expressing opinion," Association of American Editorial Cartoonists President Kevin Siers, a Pulitzer-winning cartoonist for the Charlotte Observer, said in a statement Tuesday.
"There is no 'on the other hand' in an editorial cartoon," the AAEC continued. "This power, understandably, makes editors nervous, but to completely discontinue their use is letting anxiety slide into cowardice."
Speaking to the larger landscape, Matt Wuerker, the Pulitzer-winning cartoonist for Politico, said: "The collapsing space for political cartoons and satirical commentary because editors don't have the spine to stand up to social-media outrage campaigns is bad for free speech, and bad because political debate benefits from a little humor now and again."
Taking a similar view on the bigger issue is Daryl Cagle, head of the syndicate Cagle Cartoons, which distributes Chappatte's work to about 800 subscribing clients.
"By choosing not to print editorial cartoons in the future, the Times can be sure that their editors will never again make a poor cartoon choice," Cagle said. "Editors at the Times have also made poor choices of words in the past. I would suggest that the Times should also choose not to print words in the future - just to be on the safe side."

Texto completo: KHARTOUM, Sudan - The young doctor had been on the run for days, hiding in a quiet corner of the fear-filled Sudanese capital, Khartoum, his wounded head swaddled in bandages.
The doctor, Diaa Ali, witnessed the crackdown last Monday when paramilitaries rampaged through central Khartoum, shooting pro-democracy protesters, burning tents and sexually assaulting women. Doctors counted 118 deaths over several days, with 40 bodies dragged from the Nile. The government admitted to 61 deaths.
Ali, 24, helped treat the wounded, then was attacked himself. Now he was lying low at a friend's apartment. His smartphone, once a key tool of protests, lay inert on a table: the government had cut internet access. He dared not venture outside, where paramilitaries roamed the streets.
For the protesters who have dared challenge the military rulers in the vast African nation of Sudan, it seemed a gloomy moment - yet another Arab uprising thwarted by autocracy, violence and repression. But Ali remains defiant, even hopeful.
"This is not the end of the revolution," he said. "It's just the beginning."
Sudan drew the world's attention a few months ago when thousands of protesters besieged the capital, fed up with economic hardships and the 30-year reign of President Omar al-Bashir.
The military generals surrounding the president forced him to step down, started running the country themselves and promised change. But the heady optimism created by al-Bashir's downfall gave way to new tensions, as the generals resisted protester demands for a swift transition to civilian rule. Then came the crackdown a week ago.
On Sunday, Sudan's revolutionaries made a new bid to wrest control from the junta with a general strike that paralyzed Khartoum and other cities. Streets were largely deserted and shops shuttered. Protesters mounted makeshift barricades on suburban streets. The security forces killed at least three protesters, doctors said.
Lt. Gen. Jamaleddine Omar of the ruling military council said Sunday night that "closing the roads and building barricades ... is a full-fledged crime as it deprives people from being able to go about their normal life."
On Monday, shops and businesses reopened Monday and some traffic returned to the streets of Khartoum despite calls by pro-democracy protesters to continue the strike.
The Sudanese Professionals Association, which helped lead the protests that toppled al-Bashir, has ordered supporters to avoid confrontation with the security forces during the strike. But they are faced with the might of al-Bashir's notoriously harsh security apparatus.
"The deep state still exists and is still running the country; you can feel it everywhere," said Rudwan Dawod, an opposition leader.

High court to rule on Comcast race-bias case

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - The Supreme Court on Monday agreed to decide whether Comcast, the nation's largest cable company, may be sued for race discrimination over its decision not to carry programming from an entertainment company owned by African-American entrepreneur Byron Allen.
A federal appeals court in California ruled that the case could move forward under a Reconstruction-era federal law that gives "all persons" the same right to "make and enforce contracts" as "is enjoyed by white citizens."
A unanimous three-judge panel of the court, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit, said that Allen's company, Entertainment Studios Networks, had made accusations that were serious enough to avoid dismissal at an early stage of the litigation.
Entertainment Studios said Comcast had expressed interest in its programming but never closed a deal, reversed its position on what Entertainment Studios needed to do to secure carriage, carried every network that its main competitors did except Entertainment Studios and offered space to "lesser-known, white-owned" networks even as it said it lacked capacity to carry Entertainment Studios.
Comcast, in urging the Supreme Court to hear its appeal, said its decision not to make a deal with Allen's company was prompted by ordinary business calculations, "including bandwidth constraints, a preference for sports and news programming," and insufficient demand for Entertainment Studios' offerings.
Comcast's stated reasons were pretexts, Entertainment Studios said in its own brief. "For example," the brief said, "Comcast claimed that it did not have sufficient bandwidth to carry Entertainment Studios' channels, but Comcast launched more than 80 white-owned channels at the same time."
The race-discrimination suit, Comcast's brief said, was based on claims of "an outlandish racist conspiracy."
"Plaintiffs contend that Comcast did not base its decision on legitimate business considerations, but on an outlandish racist plot against '100% African-American-owned media companies' - a contrived racial category gerrymandered to include plaintiffs and virtually no one else - that involved, among others, the U.S. government, the country's oldest and most respected civil-rights organizations (including the NAACP and the National Urban League), prominent African-Americans (including Earvin 'Magic' Johnson, Sean 'Diddy' Combs and Al Sharpton), and 'white-owned media,'" Comcast's brief said.
Entertainment Studios said it was not pursuing those claims. "Like it did in the 9th Circuit below, Comcast is still attacking a conspiracy claim that respondents dropped over three years ago," Entertainment Studios' brief said. "Respondents are pursuing a direct claim against Comcast. Comcast cannot avoid this lawsuit by ignoring the allegations against it."
The legal question for the justices in the case, Comcast Corp. v. National Association of African American-Owned Media, No. 18-1171, is whether Entertainment Studios must assert and prove that race was the key reason for Comcast's decision or one factor among many.
The appeals court said the second kind of evidence would suffice.
"Plaintiffs needed only to plausibly allege that discriminatory intent was a factor in Comcast's refusal to contract," a unanimous three-judge panel wrote, "and not necessarily the but-for cause of that decision."

Have app, will travel like a local ... hopefully

Texto completo: While on their honeymoon in Hoi An in central Vietnam last month, Sharadhi Gadagkar and Kunal Patel didn't bother a hotel concierge with questions about things to do.
Instead, the couple signed up for their first Airbnb experience, a tour organized by SecretEATS, during which they hit five locations serving original cocktails, including a spiked iced coffee in the wood-planked loft of a designer boutique. It was a perfectly tipsy three hours with two other guests and two guides.
"We love booking these types of experiences," said Gadagkar. "They give you a unique perspective on the local culture that's much harder to get on our own."
The push to get travelers to book tours and activities through mobile apps and websites has never been more vigorous.
The majority of these day trips, unlike hotels and flights, are still booked offline, representing the next major growth opportunity for online travel companies. Players large and small are racing to aggregate existing group tours, activities and attractions - from river cruises in Chicago to "Sound of Music" tours in the Alps.
These tech companies, a mix of established businesses and startups, also are developing more personalized, local "experiences," like a butchery class at a London gastro pub or a tour of Buddhist temples in Ho Chi Minh City.
The so-called experience economy and shift to buying memories rather than things has been tracked since the late 1990s. In truth, all travel is an experience, but the branding and marketing of "experiential travel" has been one of the top tourism trends in recent years.
Typically, these excursions would be found through a hotel front desk or a local tourism office. But tourists, especially screen-dependent millennials, are increasingly turning to their phones for instant booking. Not having to struggle with a language barrier is also an incentive.
Operators of tours booked online can be the same ones used by local tour offices. But when they're not, deciphering which guide to choose, or even which site, can be tricky. Online platforms say their quality control includes monitoring reviews to weed out underperformers, and some have instant messaging for customers to send up red flags on-site and secret shoppers to test tours.
Even so, tourists like Zeena Bacchus and Felix Eke, who were traveling in Southeast Asia last month, prefer an in-person transaction. Bacchus, 29, a nurse practitioner from Pennsylvania, used online booking platforms TripAdvisor and Klook to get an idea of things to do when in Hoi An. But they arranged sightseeing through a local tourism office, figuring they could negotiate a better price and establish trust in person.
"I've just found that when traveling in other countries, I can tell a local tour company exactly what I want and see if they can work out my activities for the amount of days I have," Bacchus said.
But Gadagkar and Patel, San Francisco-based tech workers, are sold on online experiences. Besides their Airbnb cocktail adventure, they booked wine, rafting and cycling tours in New Zealand last year through TripAdvisor and its Viator business.
Major online travel companies like TripAdvisor, Expedia and startups like Klook, KKday and Musement have amassed inventory from the million-plus tours, attractions and activities available. Many are also recruiting entrepreneurs to upload less-commercial offerings with personal connections to local culture and residents.
Booking.com jumped into experiences in 2016 in Europe and the Middle East. In May, the company opened its attractions offerings to all travelers, regardless of whether they had also bought accommodations. It started with attractions in 10 cities, from an Edinburgh castle tour to a Flamenco show in Barcelona.
Some startups are focused mainly on building their own supply with local guides, who design encounters where travelers have a deeper engagement with a place.
Context Travel was one of the first in 2003, with experts leading private art, architecture and food tours, followed in 2005 by Global Greeter Network, where volunteers show visitors highlights and hidden spots in cities for free.
Traveling Spoon, with locals hosting cooking classes and making homemade meals, came on the scene in 2013. Airbnb quickly became a dominant player in the space after it introduced its experiences in 2016, now with more than 30,000 offerings in 1,000 cities.
Dozens more have crowded the scene recently, with apps coming last year from Lyfx, which pairs travelers with outdoor adventurers, and this year from VeloGuide, matching travelers with local cyclists for personal tours.
There are also niche players like Tiqets, which offer tickets to attractions and museums like a priority pass to the Sistine Chapel, and Tinggly, whose website sells gift vouchers for multiple-experience packages including dining in the dark in Estonia.
The escalation in experiences has been a boon to entrepreneurs like Alexander Bradley, a Paris-based photographer who listed a photography tour in 2013 on Vayable, which has been offering urban experiences hosted by locals since 2011.
Bradley now has 33 photographers leading tours in 17 cities, mostly in Europe and Asia, and lists them on seven booking platforms, including Viator and Expedia.
He's not bothered by the 20-25% commissions, he said, because the platforms gave him global marketing and the incentive and confidence to charge more for his tours.
"If it wasn't for Vayable, I wouldn't have started," Bradley said. "It gave me the ability to have a risk-free start."

Texto completo: Texas Rep. Dan Crenshaw fired back at a New York Times contributing opinion writer for questioning his patriotism and claiming he was not signed on to support the 9/11 Victims Compensation Fund.
"Anytime a Republican says they are 'patriots' ask them if they voted to fund the 9/11 Victims Compensation Fund. You know who's for it? Ilhan Omar. You know who hasn't sponsored it? Dan Crenshaw," Wajahat Ali said Tuesday in a since-deleted tweet.
Screen Shot 2019-06-11 at 6.05.23 PM.png
"Hey 'journalist,' maybe you should check your facts. I am a co-sponsor. Nice try though," the Navy SEAL veteran said, adding an X-ray of his skull to prove his patriotism. Crenshaw lost his eye due to an improvised explosive device while on his deployment in Afghanistan in 2012.
Crenshaw was stationed twice overseas after losing his eye. He was medically retired from the Navy in 2016 as a lieutenant commander.
Tweet
Ali sent a follow-up tweet after Crenshaw corrected him.
Tweet
Crenshaw became a co-sponsor of the fund in May after some tension with some 9/11 first responders. One said Crenshaw blew him off, while the Texas Republican accused Democrats of using the first responders as pawns. After a meeting with veterans about the fund and to clear the air, Crenshaw signed on.
Unless the money for 9/11 vicitms is permanently funded by Congress, it will run out in 2020.

Are health care and jobs 'rights'? Not yet.

Texto completo: I'd like every American to be guaranteed health care, higher education and meaningful employment — things some Democratic candidates for president frequently refer to as "rights." Trouble is, these are not rights, and to frame them as such is counterproductive to good causes.
Sen. Kamala Harris of California said, "I am running to declare education is a fundamental right, and we will guarantee that right with universal pre-K and debt-free college." That's an admirable goal, but it's not a right.
Most of us know our legal rights, beginning with those enumerated in the Bill of Rights, including freedom of speech, press and religion. They extend to protections such as due process and freedom from unreasonable search and seizure.
What about such things as safe streets, functional utilities and preserved parks? As citizens we deserve them, but they are not among our legal rights.
Conflating moral objectives, sometimes referred to as "natural rights," with legal rights is trending. When Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts tweets, "Health care is a human right," she hurts the argument that she and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., are making on behalf of "Medicare for All." Health care is vital, but it's not a right, at least not in the United States. The obvious proof is the fact that many Democrats are striving to make it one.
Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey has introduced legislation to establish a federal jobs guarantee program. He believes that every American has the right to a job, "and that right has only become more important," he maintains, in an age of income inequality and discrimination.
Government guarantees are often called economic rights or positive rights: benefits, such as Social Security, to which citizens can claim a legal right. In 1944, President Franklin Roosevelt proposed a "Second Bill of Rights," including jobs, education and medical care, the very things candidates are advocating today. He called them "new goals of human happiness and well-being."
It was not clear whether FDR, who died the following year, was speaking of actual, enforceable rights or merely guideposts for a better society. He proposed "the right of every family to a decent home," but he stopped short of guaranteeing such a right by having government pay for the homes.
In today's politics, semantics matter, and inaccurately describing ambitious policies is a red flag. The undecided voter might reasonably say, "Persuade me, but don't claim something is a right when it's not." Some conservatives fear costly "entitlements" and reject the notion that discretionary government spending can be lumped with our inalienable rights.
At the start of this decade, the United Nations General Assembly passed a resolution declaring that access to water is a human right. That seems eminently more reasonable than suggesting we are somehow entitled to universal pre-K.
To be clear, several legitimate rights have been challenged recently, despite laws and court decisions that support them. A woman's right to abortion is being threatened and should be defended in state legislatures and in the courts. Voter suppression poses a risk to our electoral freedom, and we must take whatever steps needed to protect the right to vote. Women's rights to equal pay and opportunity, LBGTQ rights to marry and serve in the military — they, too, are established rights.
An interesting example of the power of words was seen recently in The New York Times, where an opinion writer stated flatly that child care is a "fundamental right." Editors crafting the print-edition headline wisely inserted the word "should." That made it "Child Care Should Be a Right" and gave readers a proper headline over an improperly worded op-ed. It's a distinction that makes a difference.
Candidates would be more convincing if they argued that things such as pre-K and employment "ought to be a right," or "deserve to be a right." Alternatively, they could choose to remain silent, which is after all their Miranda rights.

Texto completo: RIDGEWOOD – Champagne popped and cheers rang out as friends of Broadway star Ali Stroker celebrated the Ridgewood native becoming the first actor in a wheelchair to win a Tony.
"She isn't going to win this award because she's in a wheelchair," said Gail McCarthy, the co-event coordinator. "She's going to win this award because she's the most talented, hardest working and biggest inspiration to our community."
Stroker, 31, who was paralyzed from the chest down at the age of 2 in a car accident, plays Ado Annie in the gutsy revival of the Broadway classic, "Rodgers & Hammerstein's Oklahoma!"
The New York Times described her vivacious portrayal as a "country siren-voiced Ado Annie, who rides a wheelchair as if it were a prize bronco."
With 50 of her family and friends looking on from the Park West Loft in Ridgewood, Stroker made musical theater history after taking home the Tony for Best Performance by an Actress in a Featured Role.
"This award is for every kid who is watching tonight who has a disability, a limitation or a challenge who has been waiting for themselves to be represented in this arena," said Stroker in her acceptance speech.
Throughout her time at Ridgewood High School, Stroker frequently landed leading roles in her theater program, RHS New Players.
"When you see her on stage, her wheelchair disappears,"said Meg Schaefer, artistic director of the Ridgewood High School theater program. "I feel like everybody in Ridgewood is watching tonight because we all watched her grow up."
Her talent shone through even in childhood: At age 9, she starred as Dorothy in "The Wiz" in a production at Somerville Elementary School.
More recently, she appeared on television, in Oxygen's network's "The Glee Project" and an episode of Comedy Central's "Drunk History" that focused on the Americans with Disabilities Act.
Earlier this month, she claimed the Drama Desk Award for Best Featured Actress in a Musical. "Oklahoma," which also won the Tony for Best Revival of a Musical, was directed by Daniel Fish, who grew up in Tenafly.
"This means everything," said Noreen Clarke, the first director to work with Stroker, as she fought back emotions on Sunday. "Ali is magical — her winning this award just opens the door for everybody else."

Greta Van Susteren talks Appleton, UW-Madison on podcast

Texto completo: This week marks 25 years since the murder of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ron Goldman — the horrific crime that led to the arrest of football legend O.J. Simpson and the ensuing "trial of the century."
Lawyer Greta Van Susteren, an Appleton native and graduate of Xavier High School and University of Wisconsin-Madison, ascended to become a nationally known television personality during that time as a legal expert for CNN.
Van Susteren was a guest on the Wisconsin Alumni Association's new podcast, "Thank You, 72," chatting with host Tod Pritchard about her upbringing in Wisconsin, her experience during the Simpson trial and what's transpired in the years since.
After the frenzy around the Simpson story subsided, Van Susteren continued on as a cable news fixture for nearly two decades. She worked at Fox News Channel for more than 15 years and then briefly at MSNBC.
In March it was announced she was joining Gray Television, which owns stations in more than 90 markets across the country to be the chief national political analyst for the stations — which include WBAY (Channel 2) in Green Bay and WXAW (Channel 7) in Wausau. She'll debut a new show, "Full Court Press," in September.
Van Susteren's "Thank You, 72" interview runs about 35 minutes. Here are all the times she mentioned her hometown or subjects tied to it:
Looking back at her upbringing in Appleton:
"What's interesting mostly is how it relates to the economy. When I grew up, one of my friend's fathers owned the grocery store, another one owned the office supply, another one owned the bank, another was captain of the police force, my father was a judge. It was sort of interesting. It was at a time when we didn't have Staples or Giant or Safeway or these big chains. I liked it because the community really cared about the community because that's what the whole economy was.
"I suspect it's changed, or I know it's changed because now you've got a bunch of chains in there, so it's lost a lot of its small-town nature, but I think that's true all across America."
On her father, who worked for Joe McCarthy:
"My father was his campaign manager in 1946 when I think he beat Robert La Follette in the primary, McCarthy. Then, once elected to the Senate, my father elected not to go to Washington with McCarthy but decided to stay in Appleton, which was a pretty smart decision."
On the influence of McCarthy:
"Not much because I was only three (when McCarthy died), so I didn't ... Not much. Interesting, though, when I came out to Washington, D.C., the first summer I spent with Joe McCarthy's widow, living at her house. I was only going to spend one night, and I ended up spending the whole summer. She was significantly younger than McCarthy. I think she was about 26 when she married him, and probably not so much older when he died, so she was in her early 50s, and I got to know her. She died in 1979, right after I graduated law school.
"She was an artist and very exciting. She was an attractive woman. She knew everybody in Washington, which made her even more exciting to me. She knew Edward Bennett Williams, a very famous lawyer who had been Joe McCarthy's lawyer way back when. She knew senators and congressmen, and it was exciting to know Jeannie McCarthy Minetti."
On moving on to Madison after high school:
"I remember seeing my first New York Times newspaper in the Memorial Union. I'd never seen that in Appleton. My mother was a New Yorker, and she oftentimes talked about the New York Times, and I actually think she got it on Sundays, but it was not like it is now. Madison had people from all over the world.
"It was a microcosm of the whole world. You'd go there, you'd meet people from all different countries all over the world, studying all sorts of different topics. Plus, you'd meet people even from around Wisconsin that you didn't know. I met people whose parents were doctors and lawyers, but I also met people whose parents worked in Point Brewery or other, paper mills. It was just about the greatest place to be."
On making a career out of being a lawyer on television:
"... when I was growing up, the only lawyer on TV was Perry Mason, and that, of course, was fiction. Yes, it accidentally turned into a career for me. Not one I ever intended to have. I liked practicing law. My idea of a lawyer goes back to Appleton, Wisconsin, where you hang a shingle on a door, and you wait for the people to come in."
Other highlights On why she chose UW-Madison:
"It was the only place to go. When I grew up, you just, you went to two places. I went to a Catholic high school. You either went to Marquette or Wisconsin, those were your two choices. Nobody ever went out of state or thought of going out of state. Madison was probably just about one of the most exciting places on earth. Especially, this was on the tail end of the antiwar demonstrations. Madison was just, like I said, one of the most exciting places in the world. Most interesting place, where diverse discussions, debate people from all over."
On her best college memory:
"My first night there I went to the Memorial Union. When I started college, 18 was the drinking age, it had just recently switched. It was always 18, I think, for beer. I went out on the Memorial Union. It was a beautiful, beautiful August night. It was absolutely spectacular on the lake, and I got a bottle ... I sat down, had a bottle of beer. They put up a big screen and played some black and white Charlie Chaplin movies, and someone played a piano to it. They were silent movies. It was just about one of the most beautiful nights in my whole life.
On becoming a TV personality:
"TV is a million times easier than practicing law. Sitting there watching a trial and explaining what's going on is so much easier than the actual responsibility of being the trial lawyer, so to me, it was a lark. Plus, when you practice, you have to worry, things about like paying your staff, paying for the fax machine, the lights. TV is a million times easier, and think about this: You don't have people's lives in your hands. If you make a mistake, you embarrass yourself or you shame yourself. If you make a mistake while you're practicing law, you could hurt somebody's life. So to me, [TV] was a lark. It was so much easier."
On her experience in Washington, D.C., during the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks:
"We were on the runway at National Reagan Airport (in Washington, D.C.) on Sept. 11, about 9 in the morning or 8:30 in the morning. Naturally, our plane never took off. They held us, and for obvious reasons, because first the plane hit one of the World Trade Center buildings. Then they hit another. My husband and I then, the plane was brought back to the terminal.
"We got off, and we went to our car, on the roof of National Airport. We always park on the roof so we don't lose our cars, because otherwise, you forget where you park when you're in and out of the parking lot, and we're in and out of the airport so often. The space had been dead silent because they had stopped all the air traffic. All of a sudden, we heard a plane, and it was like ... I looked up in the air, which is where you look for a plane, and didn't see anything.
"Then I heard an engine roar, and then I heard a horrible explosion. All of a sudden, a black plume of smoke comes out of the Pentagon, which is only about five blocks away, and you can ... It was right over the top of two buildings, was the Pentagon. We knew it was the Pentagon, but we thought it'd been a bomb.
"This huge black cloud went straight up, and we didn't know if we were about to get bombed or not, but it was the weirdest thing. Because it was a bright, sunny day, but the bright cloud had this weird glitter in it, like this sparkling glitter. It was so bizarre. What I've come to learn later is that the tiny pieces of the airplane skin were in this black cloud, the sun was catching it, but it looked like a cloud of ... a black cloud with a bunch of sparkle and glitter in it."
On the state of cable news:
"I don't know if it's me getting older or if cable has somewhat gotten so partisan. I don't mind good, robust debates from either side, but it's got a tinge of nasty to it. At least, I think, not everybody, but there are some who have loud voices that could somehow poison it for the others. I just think that cable, and with the cost of cable, and everyone cutting the cord and going to online is that, I just think the future is, obviously, more online and with broadcast, which is free."

MORNING BRIEFING; Premature congratulations to Blues

Texto completo: St. Louis Blues majority owner Tom Stillman remembers exactly where he was when his team won its first Stanley Cup.
Which is quite impressive since the team hasn't actually done it, and may not now.
Somehow a letter from Stillman addressed to Blues fans -- which contains such lines as "All of us will remember where we were, what we did and how we felt when the Blues brought the Cup home" -- appeared in the Sunday e-edition of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. So did a couple of ads congratulating the Blues on winning the Stanley Cup.

It not only appeared hours before the Blues had a chance to clinch the title in Game 6 of the Stanley Cup Final at home, but then they were crushed 5-1 by the Boston Bruins to tie the series at three games apiece.
That means there's a Game 7 on Wednesday in Boston. Those who believe this title chance has been jinxed aren't pleased, especially after the Post-Dispatch offered a lukewarm "our bad" tweet.
The paper said it was just giving their readers a "sneak peek at what our advertisers are hoping to say to the Blues, the fans and St. Louis. We apologize ... and hope to share their messages with everyone very soon!"
Sacrebleu.
Which way to Norwich?
Add to the summer reading list for "books that don't appear to have any sort of sports hook but kinda do," we recommend Karen Crouse's "Norwich: One Tiny Vermont Town's Secret to Happiness and Excellence," with 3.41 stars out of five on GoodReads- .com.
The New York Times sportswriter raised in Southern California with a USC journalism degree moved to the city of about 3,000 residents to find out how it produced nearly a dozen Olympic athletes since 1956.
Yes, the townfolk are well off financially. But Crouse said she realized its "secret to happiness and excellence can be traced to the way the town collectively raises its children. It stresses participation over prowess, a generosity of spirit over a hoarding of resources and sportsmanship over one-upmanship ... largely rejecting the hypercompetitive joy-wringing culture of today's achievement-oriented parents. In Norwich, kids don't specialize in a single sport, and they even root for their rivals."
She adds that it doesn't hurt that the city has poor cell service -- less screen time to siphon away the kids' attention.
Resume upload
Just when you thought everyone in Hollywood needed an agent to find a high-profile job.
USC's potent athletic department appears to have resorted to rather pedestrian posts on Indeed.com in trying to attract attention to head coach openings for its baseball and beach volleyball programs.
So what if it works?
The baseball position, created when Dan Hubbs was fired in May, notes the candidate is "responsible for teaching all aspects of Baseball including analysis and skill development."
The beach volleyball spot, open after the retirement of two-time national coach of the year Anna Collier last week, seeks someone more specific to "recruiting student athletes, both nationally and internationally who meet university academic and athletic standards."
Just so we're all clear, right Aunt Becky?
Don't overthink it. The application process is only here through Saturday.

SAT metric targets 'privilege'

Texto completo: The earnest improvers at the College Board, which administers the SAT, should ponder Abraham Maslow's law of the instrument. In 1966, Maslow, a psychologist, said this: If the only tool you have is a hammer, every problem looks like a nail. The College Board wants to solve a complex social problem that it and its test are unsuited to solve.
The College Board has embraced a dubious idea that might have the beneficial effect of prompting college admissions officers to think of better ideas for broadening their pool of applicants. The idea is to add to the scores of some test-takers an "environmental context" bonus. Strangely, board president David Coleman told the Wall Street Journal's Daniel Henninger that this is not, as the media has named it, an "adversity index." But it is: It purports to measure 15 factors where these test-takers are situated. Coleman more convincingly says to The New York Times: "This is about finding young people who do a great deal with what they've been given."
Perhaps the board's evident discomfort with the label "adversity score" is because their more benign-sounding "environmental context" gives a social-science patina to the obverse of a category (and political accusation) currently in vogue, that of "privilege." By whatever name, however, the SAT's new metric is another step down the path of identity politics, assigning applicants to groups and categories, and another step away from evaluating individuals individually. But if the adversity metric becomes a substitute for schools emphasizing race, this will be an improvement on explicit racial categories that become implicit quotas.
The SAT was created partly to solve the problem of inequitable standards in college admissions. They too often rewarded nonacademic attributes. And they facilitated the intergenerational transmission of inherited privileges.
By making an objective test one component of schools' assessments of applicants, it advanced the American ideal of a meritocracy open to all talents. However, it has always been the schools' prerogative to decide the importance of the SAT component relative to others. And as "diversity" becomes an increasing preoccupation of schools, the SAT becomes decreasingly important.
Any adversity index derived from this or that social "context," however refined, will be an extremely crude instrument for measuring the academic prospects of individuals in those contexts. It might, however, be a good gauge of character.
But the SAT is a flimsy tool for shaping the world of social inertia. Articulate, confident parents from the professions will transmit cultural advantages to their children, advantages that, as the SAT will record them, are apt to dwarf "adversity" bonuses.
The Chicago Tribune warns, plausibly, that the "secret-sauce" of the SAT's adversity score will "breed more public mistrust" of colleges' admissions processes. But calling for more "transparency" implies that the more admissions' criteria are made public, the better. However, private deliberations and criteria about applicants protect the applicants' privacy interests. Furthermore, asserting a public interest in maximum transparency encourages government supervision of schools' discretion in shaping their student bodies.
Unquestionably, such discretion often is employed in unsavory ways to serve academia's fluctuating "diversity" obsessions. Soon a Boston court will render a decision, probably destined for Supreme Court review, in the case concerning Harvard's "holistic" metrics, beyond "objective" ones (secondary school transcripts, standardized tests), for - it is alleged - the purpose of restricting the admission of Asian Americans.
Caution, however, is in order. Further breaking higher education to the saddle of the state is an imprudent objective.

Texto completo: LONDON - Queen Elizabeth II marked her official birthday Saturday with the annual Trooping the Colours parade, a traditional display of British pageantry. About 1,400 soldiers in scarlet coats and bearskin hats marched past in a ceremony on Horse Guards Parade in Westminster.
Royals taking part included Prince Charles, Prince William and his wife, Kate, and Prince Harry and his wife, Meghan - who appeared in her first public outing since giving birth to their son, Archie, to watch the birthday flyby of military aircraft.
Baby Archie did not appear, but another young royal almost stole the queen's limelight when he made his debut on Buckingham Palace's balcony. Prince Louis, 1, the youngest child of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, waved frantically at the first sight of helicopters.
The queen marks her birthday twice a year - an official ceremony is always held in June, in hopes of holding the parade in good weather. Her actual birthday, April 21, is usually celebrated with close family only. She turned 93.
Thousands of spectators lined the parade ground and gathered in nearby St. James's park to watch the spectacle in sparkling sunshine. They then walked down the road leading to Buckingham Palace, gathering at the gates to honor the monarch ahead of the fly-past.
The queen waved and smiled as she emerged on the balcony and the crowd roared.
The ceremony originated from traditional preparations for battle. The colors - or flags - were "trooped," or carried down the lines of soldiers, so they could be seen and recognized in battle.
London police arrest 5 teens in alleged attack of women on bus
LONDON- Five teen boys were under arrest Saturday in connection with an alleged assault on two women who refused to kiss as they were surrounded on a London bus and taunted as lesbians, according to an account by one of the women.
The alleged attack was revealed in social media posts by one of the women, Melania Geymonat.
The Metropolitan Police announced that four teens had been arrested Friday and said another boy, 16, was arrested Saturday. Police were reviewing footage of the attack.
Geymonat, an Uruguayan flight attendant, said she and her U.S. girlfriend were traveling home on the top deck of a bus to Camden Town, a neighborhood busy with nightlife, on May 30 when they were attacked.
London Mayor Sadiq Khan called the incident "a disgusting, misogynistic attack."
US ambassador says Israel can retain parts of the West Bank
JERUSALEM - The U.S. ambassador in Jerusalem says Israel has the right to retain parts, but not all, of the West Bank.
David Friedman's remarks in an interview with The New York Times published Saturday come about two months after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to begin annexing parts of the West Bank.
It's unclear if the ambassador was revealing a component of the long-awaited Trump administration Mideast peace plan.
The Palestinians want statehood in the West Bank and Gaza, with a capital in east Jerusalem. Last year, Washington announced it recognized the city as Israel's capital.
Most of the world considers Israeli settlements in the West Bank and east Jerusalem illegal.
Albania president cites tense climate in canceling elections
TIRANA, Albania - Albanian President Ilir Meta on Saturday canceled upcoming municipal elections, citing the need to reduce political tensions in the country. Meta said he would clarify his decision Monday.
Thousands of Albanians who support the political opposition assembled for an anti-government protest Saturday. The Albanian opposition accuses the government of links to organized crime and vote rigging. The government denies the allegations and said protests that started in February have hurt the country's image as the European Union is set to decide this month whether to launch negotiations to include Albania as a member.
The U.S. and EU urged the opposition to disavow violence and sit with government representatives to resolve the crisis.
Hillary Clinton says youngest brother has died
NEW YORK - Hillary Clinton's youngest brother Tony Rodham died Friday night. The former U.S. senator, secretary of state, first lady and Democratic presidential candidate announced the death Saturday on Twitter.
Clinton remembered her brother as a generous person who could walk into a room and "light it up with laughter."
"It's hard to find words, my mind is flooded with memories of him today," she tweeted.
He was survived by his wife, Megan, and three children, Zach, Simon and Fiona. Tony Rodham was born in 1954 to Hugh and Dorothy Rodham. He was raised in the Chicago suburbs along with his older siblings, Hillary and Hugh.
The youngest Rodham held a variety of jobs, including stints as a prison guard, insurance salesman, repo man, private detective and business investor.
Pickup truck hits Amish carriage, killing 2 kids
ALGANSEE TOWNSHIP, Mich. - Authorities say a pickup rear-ended an Amish horse-drawn carriage in southern Michigan, killing two children and seriously injuring two others and a woman who were in the carriage.
State police say the two adults and five children who were in the carriage were ejected when the truck hit it Friday night in Algansee Township, a farming community not far from Michigan's borders with Indiana and Ohio.
The children who were killed were 6 and 2 years old. Authorities say two other children, ages 3 and 4, were hospitalized with life-threatening injuries and that a woman also suffered serious injuries.
Sgt. Todd Price told ABC News that the pickup's driver was intoxicated at the time of the crash and is being held in Branch County Jail.
Rebel soccer icon: A Syrian soccer goalkeeper who became an icon of the rebellion against President Bashar Assad has died of wounds suffered in a battle with government forces, the rebels said Saturday.
Abdelbaset Sarout, 27, rose to fame as a player for his home city of Homs and won international titles representing his country. When peaceful protests broke out against Assad in 2011, Sarout led rallies and became known as the "singer of the revolution" for his songs and ballads.
Following the arc of the Syrian uprising, Sarout later took up arms as the country slid into civil war. Many activists and rebels came to refer to him as the "guardian of freedom," a play on the Arabic word for goalkeeper.

Texto completo: Greg Kesich is right that our political system concentrates power in too few hands (June 2) - but those are the major parties' hands and they are aided and abetted by the media!
If every vote is to be counted equally, let's not funnel our votes through party primaries and party presidential elections. This reduces both voters' and candidate choices. Independents are now about 40 percent of registered voters. Nearly 50 percent of the millennial generation identify as independents.
Remember, the Maine and American taxpayer pays for our elections. The Democratic and Republican parties should not use We the People funds to conduct their party-controlled elections. They are private corporations.
Former Republican U.S. Rep. Mickey Edwards wrote a New York Times best-selling book called "The Parties vs. the People." One of his major points was to end party control over ballot access.
Any eligible voter should be able to register as a voter, not as a party member.
Maine and America need true, open primaries through a truly open presidential election. Otherwise, America will continue more as a partiocracy than a representative democracy (a republic).
Regarding the Electoral College, wasn't it the states representing We the People that created the federal government? Wasn't it an effort to create a balance between larger and smaller states?
Want to improve it? Eliminate the electors! Retain the electoral votes and allow each state to determine how they can be automatically allocated by congressional district or statewide by popular vote.
Yes, Maine's a small state with a small voice. That won't change much. But our We the People's voices should not be muffled by party control! Let every vote count in Maine. Let us end party control over our election systems.

A First-Aid Kit To Cover Everything

Texto completo: It's a question that the two 52 Places Travelers have fielded from readers and colleagues alike: How do you stay healthy when crisscrossing the world for nearly 365 days? And what do you pack in case you get sick? Each location has its own set of challenges, recommended vaccines and access to pharmacies.
There's a thin line between being over- and underprepared, said Rebecca Acosta, the co-founder and executive director of Traveler's Medical Service. The average globe-trotting traveler does not need I.V. bags and syringes, she said, though the items are suggested for those trekking in rural areas.
Jada Yuan began her year as the inaugural 52 Places Traveler in 2018 with a first aid kit that was built with the help of foreign correspondents. Ms. Yuan's kit was so extensive that a Moroccan customs officer accused her of being a drug dealer.
Twelve months and some 74,900 miles later, Ms. Yuan returned to New York City with "basically the same amount of medicine," she said.
This year's 52 Places Traveler, Sebastian Modak, is having a similar experience. Five months in, his first aid kit has been almost untouched. But it offers enough peace of mind that it's worth all the space it takes up, he says.
(His top recommendation for staying healthy? Drink clean, filtered water. Lots of it.)
Here's how to pack a first aid kit, whether you are going around the world for a year or a remote adventure for a week.
Start With a Vaccine Checklist
The Centers for Disease Control has a list of vaccines, health notices and packing lists for those traveling around the world. That means accounting for location: Ms. Yuan and Mr. Modak had to plan for places as diverse as Liuwa Plain National Park in Zambia and Japan's Setouchi Islands.
Make sure to look up vaccine requirements far in advance of your travels, as some vaccines may require treatments or doses. Additionally, some nations may require proof of vaccination upon entering customs. The World Health Organization keeps an updated list of nations requiring yellow fever vaccines here.
Don't forget travel insurance
If you are traveling with a group or on business, you may already have traveler's insurance that covers medical evacuation. If not, consider buying insurance that includes medevac services, which are recommended when traveling to more rural destinations.
In addition to health coverage, travel insurance covers things like lost baggage and flight cancellations. So even if you stay healthy, it can come in handy when you're on road.
A good travel insurance package will also include a support number to call if you need help identifying the severity of your illness, and where to turn for help.
If your health care provider in the United States offers virtual doctor visits, you may be able to turn to your regular doctor's office while abroad, too.
Management vs. prevention
If you have prescriptions, make sure they are filled for the entirety of your travels. That may take some coordinating between a primary care physician and insurance companies if medicines need to be resupplied on the road. Ms. Acosta recommends working with a doctor to compile a list of all prescribed medications, in generic form, in case prescriptions are misplaced.
When it comes to prevention, Ms. Acosta said, travelers should think of their medicine cabinet. "What are the type of things that you may grab from your medical kit at home? If it's one in the morning and you have an upset stomach or a headache, what do you go for?"
Pack those items first.
For Mr. Modak that included vitamins. "I don't know if you can overdose on vitamins but if so, I'm doing it," he said from Bulgaria. "I take a multivitamin every morning and chew an Airborne vitamin C tablet, too, on top of that."
Build your kit
"The worst time to go looking for a pharmacy is after you already need one -- and that's especially true when you're traveling in an unfamiliar place," said Ria Misra, the travel editor with Wirecutter, a New York Times Company that reviews and recommends products. That's why she recommends building your own kit or carefully choosing a prepackaged one.
Traveler's Medical Service offers recommendations for your kit, listed below; choose the brands that you've used in the past. (Traveling internationally is not a great time to test new medication.) Wirecutter recommends packaging a kit in the Osprey UltraLight Roll Organizer; the bag's roll-up design allows it to pack down significantly.
For travelers short on time, some pre-packed first-aid kits cover the basics. Wirecutter recommends to First Aid Only's Essentials Kit, which contains the basics needed to clean up minor cuts and relieve pain.
Keep those kits in a carry-on.
Make a checklist
Travelers should create a first aid kit for simple wounds and basic medications to treat stomach issues, colds and allergies. Some products that Traveler's Medical Service recommends include:
First aid items
■ Alcohol swabs and liquid disinfectant solution
■ Bandages: Adhesive bandages, gauze, tape, blister pads and bandage rolls
■ Topical creams: Antibiotic ointment, antifungal ointments, hydrocortisone cream
■ Oral rehydration solution for diarrhea or dehydration
■ Tweezers
■ Digital thermometer
■ Lubricating eye drops
■ Insect repellent
■ Aloe gel
Medications
■ Antacids
■ Antihistamines for allergic reactions and seasonal allergies
■ Bismuth subsalicylate for nausea, gas and bloating
■ Laxative/stool softener
■ Anti-motility medication for severe diarrhea
■ Cough and cold remedies and lozenges
■ Pain relievers/fever reducers
■ Motion sickness medication
Similarly, note any preventive medicines in generic form should you need to restock while traveling.

Texto completo: Look out, sheriff! An over-the-top video you made two years ago has returned to bite your fanny like a gator going for a chihuahua.
Chomp!
Lake County's top lawman Peyton Grinnell has long since regretted his video warning to heroin dealers that came across more 'ISIS thug' than 'community protector' and backfired on the department. Flanked by deputies wearing masks and bulletproof vests, a stern Grinnell warned: "We are coming for you. Run."
But there's no out-running the internet.
That 2017 video is the reason the Lake County Sheriff's Office ended up in national news this week as one of only eight police agencies across the United States in a study of officers posting comments on Facebook that encouraged violence, disparaged and mocked Mexicans, women, blacks and Muslims and celebrated the Confederate flag.
In general, the study concluded, the public postings by officers created real reasons for some folks not to trust the departments.
"It's embarrassing," a whipped-looking Grinnell said in an interview.
It is. But there is more to this story.
The Plain View project, started by Philadelphia lawyer Emily Baker-White, compiled a searchable database, which included posts from that city's police officers, along with others from Dallas, St. Louis, Phoenix, York, Pa., Twin Falls, Id. and Denison, Tx.- and Lake County.
The database collected more than 5,000 Facebook posts from 3,500 Facebook accounts of current and former officers in the eight departments. Lake County's share accounted for 89 of those posts - from 14 current and seven former employees, most of whom had been fired.
An analysis of the database was written by a non-profit online Chicago news organization called Injustice Watch, and the story also appeared in Buzzfeed after a deal with the New York Times to publish the material fell through for reasons neither Injustice Watch nor the Times would discuss.
Still, stories about the disgusting posts reverberated across news outlets nationwide as police administrations opened internal affairs investigations and started to study what their officers had to say.
Some of the posts and memes clearly crossed the line into hate speech, which ought to trouble any police department anywhere, regardless of whether the First Amendment protects such opinions. No place in America needs police officers who take hatred and bias onto the street with them when their shift begins. Grinnell, for example, said that he expects his deputies to be held to a higher standard than the public, and he is right.
In Lake, the most revolting posts, those calling the prophet Muhammad a child molester, warning women to shut up while men are talking, making fun of blacks and transgender people, disparaging liberals, urging gays to take pills called "Gay-away" and congratulating a student who kicked a chair from underneath another who declined to stand to pledge the flag, all came from a former corrections officer who retired more than six years ago.
That hater's posts alone accounted for 36 percent of all comments from Lake.
The sheriff's office opened internal investigations on Deputy Jason Williams, a school resource officer at East Ridge High School, and Cpl. Robert Bedgood, a supervisor in crime scene investigations, after being contacted by Injustice Watch.
Williams' three posts all came from three years ago. In one, he shared without comment a meme depicting a heavily-armed officer in a mask with text saying, "Some Men are Morally Opposed to Violence. They are Protected by Men Who Are Not."
He also shared a meme of a tractor-trailer with a bloodied front bumper and the remark, "Just Drove through Arizona. Didn't see any Protesters" along with his own comment, "Love this!!"
And the third was a meme looking down the business end of a gun with the text: "Wrong Bathroom. My daughter will be done in a min..."
Bedgood's comments were older. Eight years ago, he posted a map to a Winter Park store for eyeglasses, remarking that it was so "hood" that he wouldn't return.
And seven years ago, he posted a picture of a lime-green car with lettering across the back window saying, "1-800-Choke-a-Hoe" and joked that it was his "new motto."
Are these comments in good taste? Not hardly. Should deputies be posting that kind of "humor"? They should not - the sheriff's office has a broad policy forbidding deputies to "disparage" anyone. But are such comments a reason to lose a career in law enforcement?
That's for Grinnell to decide. Investigators will be looking over posts from 12 other current deputies to see whether they believe the sheriff's policies about social media were violated.
Consider that last week, a corrections officer with 19 years in the department resigned after acknowledging that he told an inmate to hang up a telephone and get his "black ass" back to his cell, and later remarked to another African-American that the government probably was taking care of his children while he was serving time, like all "those people." Detention Deputy Adam Dufresne said he was referring to criminals, not any particular race.
Some of the posts cited by the Plain View project were baffling.
Lt. Michael Marden posted this in 2010: "Trying to rally the guys and put some more people in jail tonight."
Grinnell said, "Sounds to me like he was doing his job."
Indeed. Around these parts, that comment deserves applause, not a place on a list of violence-hungry, out-of-control cops. But even a seemingly innocuous comment such as that can be interpreted in a sinister way by people who live in neighborhoods that have had bad police experiences, one expert said.
The story that accompanied the Plain View database stated that the cities were chosen to get a variety in geography and department size. The reporter who wrote the story, Emily Hoerner, said she did not know how they were picked beyond those criteria.
Baker-White said she prioritized communities "that had on-going conversations about police" and whether they could be trusted. She said she chose Lake after seeing the controversial video made by Grinnell and his staff in 2017.
This project could have gained more solid credibility if the agencies had been chosen randomly - here's betting the results would have been very much the same - or if readers had been told that they had been targeted. Posts that are close to a decade old and those that come from fired employees also raise questions about the methods used.
After all, this trust thing - it goes all ways.

Texto completo: Nazis raus! - or Nazis, out! - was the scrawled graffiti on a building I read driving into Vienna two summers ago. The message was a sharp contrast to the city's genteel atmosphere. The directive was clear: In the birthplace of Nazism, hate ideology was unwelcome.
That night, I turned on the TV to a vision of young men carrying torches, their faces contorted with rage while chanting anti-Semitic slogans. It was coverage of the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. It wasn't the first time Nazi sympathies flourished in America, of course. In 1939, six months before Adolf Hitler invaded Poland, pro-Nazi sympathizers gathered in Madison Square Garden in a so-called pro-American rally where police attacked protesters.
Europe is battling its own rise of anti-Semitism. The German government's commissioner on anti-Semitism has warned Jewish men against wearing yarmulkes in public after a rise in attacks against Jews. The United Kingdom's national human rights institution is investigating anti-Semitism within the Labour Party.
And, the depressing list goes on. This week, The New York Times reported that while NYC is getting safer, there's a 64 percent increase in the number hate crimes reported from a year ago - 60 percent of those being anti-Semitic attacks. Then again, the newspaper's international edition recently published an editorial cartoon with caricatures reminiscent of 1930s Nazi propaganda.
On Wednesday, Queen Elizabeth II met with President Donald Trump at an event commemorating the 75th anniversary of D-Day, when Allies invaded Normandy, effectively quelling Hitler's war machine. The longest-reigning British monarch in history said, "The wartime generation, my generation, is resilient."
New Yorkers embody a collective resiliency that we wear as a badge of pride. And that helps us stand up to what we know is wrong. Or at least, I hope it does.
As a lifelong New Yorker and a child of Holocaust survivors, I urge you to educate yourselves, your friends and your family to the dangers of unchecked anti-Semitism. I urge you to speak up and speak out, because it doesn't start with a concentration camp. It starts with the normalization of hate.
And to anyone who thinks anti-Semitism has a place in NYC, I say this: Nazis raus!

Texto completo: Extradition hearing for Huawei exec is Jan. 20
A Canadian court says an extradition hearing will begin in January for a top executive of the Chinese tech company Huawei wanted by the U.S on fraud charges.
British Columbia's Supreme Court on Thursday accepted a proposal by Meng Wanzhou's defense team to start her hearing Jan. 20, more than a year after she was taken into custody at Vancouver's airport. Defense lawyer David Martin says the schedule could allow the case to wrap up in two years.
The Huawei CFO wasn't in court Thursday.
The U.S. has charged Meng with lying to banks about Huawei's dealings with Iran in violation of trade sanctions. Meng and Huawei deny wrongdoing.
Uber planning to offer helicopter rides in NYC
Uber Technologies Inc. is testing a helicopter service in New York City, according to documents outlining the program obtained by Bloomberg.
Passengers will be able to use the Uber app to book a flight through the service, called Uber Copter, the documents show. Tests flights took off from a Manhattan heliport near Wall Street to John F. Kennedy International Airport.
After Bloomberg asked Uber for comment Wednesday, the New York Times published a story about the program. It says customers will be able to book flights starting July 9 in New York City and that the average ride will cost $200 to $225 a person. Eric Allison, the head of Uber's flight business, told the Times that the company plans to eventually offer helicopter rides in other cities. A spokesman for Uber declined to comment.
Stocks close listless day with only modest gains
Major U.S. stock indexes capped a day of listless trading with modest gains Thursday, snapping the market's two-day losing streak.
A late flurry of buying helped lift the indexes, which had spent much of the day moving sideways after an early rally lost momentum. Even so, the market remained on track for its fourth straight weekly loss and its first monthly decline of the year.
Stocks have been sliding in volatile trading all month as investors come to grips with the potential impact that the escalating trade war between the U.S. and China could have on corporate and economic growth. With one day left of trading in May, the S&P 500 is heading for a monthly loss of about 5.3 percent.
"This 5 percent or 6 percent sell-off is really just a resetting of expectations, especially with the sentiment that's been a gloomy overhang," said David Lyon, global investment specialist at J.P. Morgan Private Bank.
The S&P 500 index rose 5.84 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,788.86. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 43.47 points, or 0.2 percent, to 25,169.88.
The Nasdaq composite added 20.41 points, or 0.3 percent, to 7,567.72. The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 4.42 points, or 0.3 percent, to 1,485.53.
Major stock indexes in Europe rose broadly.

Texto completo: Headnote JAZZ NOTES
The Vision Festival is the most captivating annual jazz event in New York City from America's far reaching tentacles to the land of Oo-Bla-Dee. This year the multimedia journey will celebrate the lifetime achievement of drummer and composer Andrew Cyrille and sculptor Alain Kirili. The festival runs June 11 through June 16, at Roulette (509 Atlantic Ave.), in Brooklyn.
The multi-faceted festival will feature Vision Films, a one day event on June 9, at the Anthology Film Archives (32 2nd Ave.). The festival states, "One Long Painting is a retrospective of Jeff Schlangeťs paintings over the last 25 years. Schlanger, who coined his description as music witness, has been painting and documenting live avant-garde jazz performances since 1976. He has been a regular fixture at all 19 Vision Festivals. He is prominently situated next to the artists swinging in the momenti" Tm interested in hearing creative music I never heard before," said Schlanger.
The saxophonist, composer, arranger and artist Oliver Lake will perform solo reflecting Schlanger as music witness.
The mandatory documentary "Milford Graves Full Mantis" (2018) will screen at 9 p.m. It is a result of nearly 15 years of filming, directed by Jake Meginsky, a long-time student of Graves, and co-directed by Neil Young. The film reflects Graves' creative musical concepts in the evolution of avant-garde music, his ongoing research within the field of healing through music and glimpses of worldwide perfonnances.
Graves is one of the founding pioneers of avant-garde music, and remains one of the most influential living figures in the evolution of the form. Fie believes that music is more than an art form to be mastered. He says sound is a life force to be in tune with, through regard and respect.
On June 11 the festival presents Andrew Cyrille "A Lifetime of Achievement." He will play in a variety of exciting configurations that will include Lebroba Trio with trumpeter, composer and finalist for the 2013 Pulitzer Prize Wadada Leo Smith and guitarist Brandon Ross; the all-star cast of saxophonist Kidd Jordan and vocalist lisa Sokolov; and video artist and digital media Stefan Roloff. The poet and author Quincy Troupe will appear with the Haitian Fascination ensemble.
On June 12, the 10:30 p.m. set is a tribute to Alvin Fields. The noted drummer was a founding member of the Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians and was a founding faculty member of the Louis "Satchmo" Armstrong Summer Jazz Camp. He died Jan. 5,2019.
Featured artists are saxophonist Kidd Jordan, bassist William Parker, saxophonist Joel Apfelbaum and drummer Hamid Drake.
On June 13 the God Particle will include bassist Melvin Gibbs, coronet Graham Haynes, pianist Mac Cary and drummer Will Calhoun among others. On June 15, David Virelles Mboko steps into the light. The resilient young pianist/composer infuses roots from his homeland of Cuba with percussionist Roman Diaz, bassist Rashaan Carter and drummer Eric McPherson. Darius Jones Quintet also plays (an alto saxophonist never to be missed).
The June 16 conclusion includes Dianne McIntyre. The celebrated dancer inspired many young dancers who came under her tutelage at her Sounds in Motion dance studio, the form er dance mecca on 125 th Street and Lenox Avenue just a few doors from Roger Furman Theatre and the Lenox Lounge.
Later D.D. Jackson Bluiett Tribute Band with saxophonists James Carter, Darius Jones, pianist D. D. Jackson, drummer Ronnie Bumagę, percussionist and bassist Juma Sultan. For a complete schedule vis.t website artsforart.org. For tickets visit the website visionfestival. bownpapertickets.com.
Ishmael Reed's play "The Haunting of Un-Manuel Miranda" is a historical correction of Broadway's musical "Hamilton: An American Musical" about the life of founding father Alexander Hamilton, with music, lyrics and book by Un-Manuel Miranda Now running at the Nuyorican Poets Café (236 East 3rd St.) through June 16.
Reed's play represents David's trusty slingshot against the Goliath ("Hamilton") Broadway corporate investors. Those familiar with the playwright, poet, novelist, essayist and editor shouldn't at all be surprised by this penwielding gorilla warfare historical rebuttal because he is known for his satirical works challenging American political culture.
It seems tine character of Miranda (Jesse Bueno) has fallen asleep at his computer and while in a vivid, frightening dream he is visited by slaves, Native Americans and white indentured servants who were conveniently left out of the book but have a lot to say about the great Alexander Hamilton, who from their perspective was far from being a compassionate abolitionist. Hamilton (Zachary Clarence) and George Washington (Robert Turner) both appear in this nightmare without any pretensions of being honorable men. These visitations have Miranda's character quite disturbed. Fie reiterates, "I low can this be true; all of my research for the book and play was based on the Alexander Hamilton biography by Ron Chemow the famous historian, my God the guy won a Pulitzer, why would belie."
"Many of my critics asked early on if I had seen the play-writers from the NEWYORKER and New York Times," said Reed. "I had not seen the play; I read Chemow's book and quoted him in my play. I did recently see the play, which cost me a small mortgage. Which didn't change the fact both General Washington and Hamilton conspired against the Native Americans to steal their land and they owned slaves."
Reed noted the concept for the slave character Diana came from an Albany state parks brochure where the historical Schuyler Mansion is located. Philip Schuyler was a slave owner. When Blacks ran away fom the plantations, he put up reward posters. When a team of archaeologists dug up the remains of the slaves of the Schuyler plantations, they found that these slaves were subjected to harsh brutality and malnourished. Hamilton married Schuyler's daughter Elizabeth and moved into the mansion.
"The Puerto Rican students in Puerto Rico are now protesting against Miranda's play," stated Reed.
The play is directed by multi AUDELCO Award winner Rome Neal, who once again collaborates with his good friend and mentor Reed. It is amazing how Neal manages to consistently cast such fine actors, who for the most part are under the casting radar, and a few only act part time. Neal, like Reed, is a cultural revolutionist who believes tire truth should be acted out on stage for the community to see.
For tickets visit the website nuyorrican.org or call 212780-9386.
On June 9 Symphony Space's signature music marathon celebrates the life and legacy of jazz innovator John Coltrane, exploring the wide span of his career through music, dance, film and conversation (Wall to Wall Coltrane). This FREE event will have three segments: 3 p.m.-6 p.m.; 6 p.m.-8 p.m. and 8 p.m.-11 p.m.

Gig work is great - for the employers

Texto completo: Uber just filed its first quarterly report as a publicly traded company. Although the company lost $1 billion, investors may still do well because the losses appear to be declining.
Uber drivers, on the other hand, aren't doing well. According to a recent study, about half of New York's Uber drivers are supporting families with children, yet 40 percent qualify for Medicaid and another 18 percent qualify for food stamps.
It's similar elsewhere in the new American economy. Last week, the New York Times reported that fewer than half of Google workers are full-time employees. Most are temps and contractors receiving a fraction of the wages and benefits of full-time Googlers, with no job security.
Across America, the fastest-growing category of new jobs is gig work - contract, part-time, temp, self-employed and freelance. And a growing number of people work for staffing firms that find them gig jobs.
Estimates vary, but it's safe to say that almost a quarter of American workers are now gig workers. Which helps explain why the standard economic measures - unemployment rate and income - look better than Americans feel.
The jobs problem today isn't just stagnant wages. It's also uncertain incomes. A downturn in demand, a change in consumer preferences, or a personal injury or sickness can cause future paychecks to disappear. Yet nearly 80 percent of Americans live paycheck to paycheck.
According to polls, about a quarter of American workers worry they won't be earning enough in the future. That's up from 15 percent a decade ago. Such fears are fueling working-class grievances in America and, presumably, elsewhere around the world where steady jobs are vanishing.
Gig work is also erasing 85 years of hard-won labor protections.
At the rate gig work is growing, future generations won't have a minimum wage, unemployment insurance, worker's compensation for injuries, employer-provided social security, overtime, family and medical leave, disability insurance or the right to form unions and collectively bargain.
Why is this happening? Because it's so profitable for corporations to use gig workers instead of full-time employees.
Gig workers are about 30 percent cheaper because companies pay them only when they need them and don't have to spend on the aforementioned labor protections.
Increasingly, businesses need only a small pool of "talent" anchored in the enterprise - innovators and strategists responsible for the firm's competitive strength.
Other workers are becoming fungible, sought only for reliability and low cost. So, in effect, economic risks are shifting to them.
It's a great deal for companies such as Uber and Google. They set workers' rates, terms and working conditions, while at the same time treating them like arm's-length contractors.
But for many workers it amounts to wage theft.
If America still had a Department of Labor, it would be setting national standards to stop this. Yet Donald Trump's Anti-Labor Department is heading in the opposite direction. It recently proposed a rule making it easier for big corporations to outsource work to temp and staffing firms and to escape liability if those contracting firms violate the law, such as not paying workers for jobs completed.
On the other hand, California is countering Trump on this, as on other issues.
Last week, the California Assembly passed legislation codifying an important California Supreme Court decision: In order for companies to treat workers as independent contractors, the workers must be free from company control, doing work that's not central to the company's business and have an independent business in that trade. (The bill is not yet law. It still has to pass the California Senate and be signed by the governor. And businesses are seeking a long list of exemptions, including ride-share drivers and many high-tech contract workers.)
Whatever national rule eventually emerges for defining gig workers, they'll need a different system of social insurance than was the case when steady full-time employment was the norm.
Robert Reich's latest book is "The Common Good," and his newest documentary is "Saving Capitalism."

Texto completo: Changes to an online genealogy service used to help solve one of Lancaster County’s most infamous cold cases will severely limit law enforcement’s ability to make similar arrests.
GEDmatch, the online genealogy service used by DNA technology company Parabon NanoLabs to identify Raymond Rowe — who later admitted to the 1992 killing of Christy Mirack — updated its policy so that users now have to opt in for their DNA to be available for law enforcement searches.
With the change, the 1.2 million current profiles on the website were automatically opted out, according to GEDmatch co-founder Curtis Rogers.
The company takes pride in playing a role in solving dozens of cold cases the past year, he said. It wants users to opt in, he said, adding 40,000 have already done so.
The policy change won’t eliminate possible police work through GEDmatch. But it severely limits it.
The district attorney’s office is working with Parabon on one case but declined to specify the nature of the case or the type of work.
Lancaster County District Attorney Craig Stedman called the policy change a “huge blow.”
“Any limitation of the data base will reduce the chances of bringing killers like Ray Rowe to justice,” he said.
Reason for the change
For months GEDmatch’s operators have discussed requiring users to give permission for law enforcement to access their profiles, said Curtis Rogers, who co-founded GEDmatch in 2010.
Last May GEDmatch updated its privacy agreement to specify users’ information could be used by police investigating a homicide or sexual assault, according to a New York Times report.
But a recent BuzzFeed News investigation revealed that the company allowed law enforcement to use the database while looking into an aggravated assault case in Utah.
The Utah case “emphasized the need to change our terms of service,” Rogers said in an email.
“Since some people are concerned about (law enforcement) use of genetic genealogy we feel that this is the ethical thing to do,” Rogers said.
The Pennsylvania American Civil Liberties Union did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A national ACLU attorney told ABC News that while GEDmatch’s decision is a good step, lawmakers and courts need to step in.
Lancaster defense attorney Michael Winters said police searching geneaology DNA is part of the greater issue of privacy in a world of information gathering technology.
“Allowing the government unfettered access to our private information should be a concern for everyone,” Winters said.
‘Major ramifications’
Stedman said the policy change has “major ramifications for homicides that already happened and those that will happen in the future.”
"The Mirack family and the community deserved those answers in the Rowe case and we are proud of the forward-thinking work done there," he said.
After Rowe’s January guilty plea and sentence to life in prison without parole, Stedman opened a new Cold Case Homicide Unit with a $10,000 budget for DNA analysis this year. Parabon’s genealogy work costs between $3,000 and $5,000, according to the district attorney’s office.
The district attorney’s office will explore whether search warrants could be issued for GEDmatch profiles.
Company wants users to opt-in
Parabon did not respond to a request for comment Wednesday. But CeCe Moore, Parabon’s lead investigator in Rowe’s case, said in a Facebook post May 21 that she “wasn’t interested in debating GEDmatch’s decision.
“Whatever one thinks about this decision, it is inarguable that it is a setback for justice and victims and their families,” Moore said.
She also changed her profile photo on Facebook to a frame with the text “Resolve violent crime. Identify the lost. Opt-in on GEDmatch.”
Although the new terms of service limit the number of profiles available for police searches, those that are made available give police grounds to search for DNA in more crimes.
GEDmatch updated its definition of “violent crime” to match the FBI’s definition, Rogers said. That includes murder, nonnegligent manslaughter, aggravated rape, robbery or aggravated assault.
He clarified that GEDmatch isn’t the one doing the detective work.
But the company has been involved in “nearly every cold case solved so far,” Rogers said. Parabon, which primarily uses GEDmatch, identified nearly 50 criminal suspects in the past year.
“We urge everyone who has been tested for genetic genealogy to be a part of solving these horrendous crimes by putting their information on GEDmatch and opting-in for law enforcement use,” he said.

Steve Bannon believes Trump obstructed justice, Michael Wolff says

Texto completo: Former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon believes President Trump obstructed justice, according to author Michael Wolff.
Doing the media rounds to promote his new book Siege, a book on the White House which relies heavily on interviews with Bannon, Wolff was asked about special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.
“Do you think Steve Bannon believes that the president obstructed justice?” CNN's John Berman asked.
"Yes,” Wolff said. “Now I would say that Steve Bannon would go and characterize this as, that’s Donald Trump. So, I mean, the Steve Bannon view is partly, you know what this guy is, there’s never been any, any illusion otherwise. He’s Donald Trump. That’s the man you elected. A man who cannot, literally cannot, tell the truth."
The questions comes after Mueller, as part of his investigation, declined to make a determination about whether he believed the president attempted to obstruct justice. He did, however, outline 10 instances of possible obstruction, and while Attorney General William Barr said there was insufficient evidence to accuse Trump of an obstruction crime, Democrats argue Mueller left it to them to investigate and decide.
Wolff also commented on a part of his book that focused on Trump's business empire. Wolff wrote that Trump's businesses "increasingly seemed to resemble a semi-criminal enterprise." Bannon replied, "I think we can drop the 'semi' part."
Asked if he thinks this was meant as a joke, Wolff told CNN that he thinks Bannon is "perfectly straightforward about this" and suspects the former Breitbart News executive chairman has "direct knowledge of that."
Bannon, who also was chief executive officer of Trump's successful 2016 campaign, left the White House in August 2017.
Wolff’s last book, Fire and Fury, was riddled with unsubstantiated allegations, several of which were denounced as false. His new book, which hits bookshelves Tuesday, is already facing accusations of falsehoods, and in an interview with the New York Times the author admitted he does not check his stories with his subjects.

Siege: Mueller's 'pit bull' drafted obstruction indictment against Trump

Texto completo: One of special counsel Robert Mueller's top prosecutors led the initiative to draft a three-count obstruction of justice indictment against President Trump, according to author Michael Wolff.
Siege: Trump Under Fire, which hit bookshelves Tuesday, says Andrew Weissmann, who was widely regarded as Mueller's "pit bull," was in charge of the effort.
Last month The Guardian first reported the draft indictment, without mentioning who was behind it, and said staff had viewed the documents. Mueller's office quickly pushed back against the claim. “The documents that you’ve described do not exist,” Mueller spokesman Peter Carr said in a statement to the Washington Examiner.
Weissmann led the federal inquiry's case against former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, who was sentenced to roughly seven and a half years in prison for conspiracy and fraud. He came under fire by conservatives for actions that show the potential for bias, including attending Hillary Clinton's 2016 election night party and praising former acting attorney general Sally Yates in an email after she refused to defend his initial travel ban. Weissmann was also one of the Justice Department officials who was informed of British ex-spy Christopher Steele's anti-Trump dossier by former DOJ official Bruce Ohr before joining Mueller's team.
In the book, Weissmann is introduced as a fierce counterweight to Trump. He was chief of the criminal fraud division at the Justice Department when Mueller recruited him in May 2017, and Wolff plays up his reputation. "Many believed Weissmann was the most aggressive white-collar prosecutor in the nation," Wolff wrote.
The book says Trump "thought he knew all about Weissmann" and deemed him a "screw-up and a loser" over his prosecution of accounting firm Arthur Andersen as part of the Enron task force, which was overturned by the Supreme Court.
Wolff wrote that Trump, a businessman himself, saw the whole debacle as a "business tragedy" and that Weissmann should have been disbarred. As he has done for his political opponents, Trump came up with a mocking nickname: "Arthur Weissmann."
But Wolff asserted the Andersen setback only made Weissmann appear to be more of a threat to Trump.
"To the degree that the Andersen case might have tainted Weissmann, it also reinforced his reputation for waging total war. For Weissmann, overreach was something of a philosophical belief: in his view, white-collar criminals were trying to beat the system, so the system had to beat them. And Donald Trump's entire life and career were about beating the system," Wolff wrote.
In March 2018, Wolff wrote that the Weissmann-led team laid out the indictment, which charged Trump with obstructing an investigation, tampering with a witness, and retaliating against a witness. Wolff said his reporting was “based on internal documents given to me by sources close to the Office of the Special Counsel.”
Wolff’s last book, Fire and Fury, was riddled with unsubstantiated allegations, several of which were denounced as false. His new book is already facing accusations of falsehoods, and in an interview with the New York Times the author admitted he does not check his stories with his subjects.
In response to Mueller’s spokesman denying that a draft indictment was drawn up, Wolff insisted that a memorandum was put together that supposes Trump was indicted for obstruction of justice.
“The document is a 56-page document. It assumes that the president has been indicted. It assumes that he in turn has come back and made a motion to dismiss that indictment on grounds that you can't indict a sitting president,” Wolff said in an interview Monday evening on MSNBC. “Then this document is a response to that.”
Wolff said the document outlined what charges Trump would face and argued why a sitting president can and should be indicted. “So it’s in a way I think that missing piece of the Mueller puzzle,” Wolff said.
When asked by MSNBC host Lawrence O'Donnell to divulge whether his sources were in the Mueller team, Wolff would only say that these were "gold standard" sources.

Why we're writing about Black food culture on South Side

Texto completo: My father was born in Englewood in a house at 63rd and State Street in December 1950, seven months after the tragic Green Hornet streetcar crash at the same corner. My mother was born in November 1953 in Yazoo City, Mississippi, but moved to Chicago when she was 7 years old, along with millions of other Black folk who moved north during the Great Migration.
My dad moved to 66th and Carpenter Street when he was 3 or 4 -- as I was growing up, he'd always point out the street sign to me and my sister and joke about the Carpenters living on Carpenter -- and my mom spent her middle and high school years living about 2 miles away at 424 W. Tremont St.
Though I grew up in the south and southwest suburbs, I was born at Michael Reese Hospital in Bronzeville. I'm a proud Hyde Park resident now, and while I don't know if I'll ever feel I've earned the right to call myself a South Sider, my South Side roots run deep. As a kid, I looked forward to trips to the city in part because they involved a new assortment of dishes to try, from smoky barbecue sauce-smothered rib tips and fries from Lem's Bar-B-Q, to soul food from the legendary (and since closed) Park Manor institution Army and Lou's.
This June, we're focusing on Chicago's South Side, covering the food and drink culture, traditions and scene of the Black community. Our Food & Dining team had many conversations about how to approach this month's coverage -- should we include Chinatown? Pilsen? Bridgeport?
Our reporters work diligently to cover those neighborhoods and will continue to do so, but we agreed on the importance of celebrating the Black South Side specifically for this month. That said, we can't write about the South Side and not acknowledge it was formed by our city's history of segregation, how public housing projects confined Black Chicagoans there and how the route of the Dan Ryan expressway created quite a literal barrier between Black and white communities. It is part of the story.
Last year, when I wrote about Black-owned restaurants on the North Side, I included this caveat: "Communities on the South and West sides are continually under- or misrepresented in the media, and in food and beverage coverage in particular, many black-owned spots are left out of the narrative. For this story, I chose a very narrow focus based on reader feedback, but there are ample opportunities to support black-owned businesses throughout Chicago."
This month's focus is but one small step forward as we continue eating at and writing about restaurants on the South Side, as we continue to prioritize coverage that is inclusive and reflective of the diversity of our city. To give the Black South Side food culture the visibility and respect it deserves, we've also chosen to capitalize the "B" in Black during this month's coverage. It's part of the story.
The Chicago Tribune follows Associated Press style, which instructs us to write "black" as an adjective in lowercase letters. Many journalists have argued that the B should be capitalized, and I agree we should have the option to do so.
"Black should always be written with a capital B. We are indeed a people, a race, a tribe. It's only correct," journalism professor Lori L. Tharps wrote in her New York Times op-ed, "The Case for Black With a Capital B."
I am Black with a capital B. I don't mind when someone describes me as African American, but it's not how I identify myself.
I learned of my Nigerian heritage last year, at 32, after submitting my DNA to 23andMe. Before that, I could only speculate or take the word of Nigerians who recognized kin when they looked at me.
Writer and cultural critic Toure explained his choice to capitalize "Black" and lowercase "white" in his author's note to "Who's Afraid of Post-Blackness? What It Means to be Black Now."
"I believe 'Black' constitutes a group, an ethnicity equivalent to African-American, Negro, or, in terms of a sense of ethnic cohesion, Irish, Polish, or Chinese," Toure wrote. "I don't believe that whiteness merits the same treatment. Most American whites think of themselves as Italian-American or Jewish or otherwise relating to other past connections that Blacks cannot make because of the familial and national disruptions of slavery. So to me, because Black speaks to an unknown familial/national past it deserves capitalization."
Through this month's coverage, we have an opportunity to show respect to Chicago's Black community, a community that understandably distrusts mainstream media and hasn't always received fair, prominent coverage. It is our hope that this transparency will start a conversation. With you, our readers, and within the Chicago Tribune newsroom -- as well as others -- as we question why we follow certain guidelines and consider the people who did and did not have a seat at the table when these rules were created.
This month, we'll tell stories of the current state of soul food on the South Side, stories of Black craft beermakers in Englewood. We'll dive into jerk chicken and highlight Black food and beverage entrepreneurs. We've gathered input from community members and leaders, chefs and restaurateurs, to anticipate any blind spots in our coverage plans. I'm proud of this work and this team, and hope you'll join us for a tasty, community-driven month celebrating the Black South Side food scene.

Texto completo: On a recent afternoon, college student Michele Jacobs walked into an American Eagle Outfitters store in Manhattan to buy some pieces from its Aerie lingerie line. She left with two bralettes -- plus a jean skirt and a couple pairs of shorts.
"I feel like it's really hard to not spend money when I go in there," said Jacobs, 19, a rising sophomore at Franklin & Marshall College in Pennsylvania. "The majority of my clothing is from American Eagle. All my jeans are from here."
In many ways, the success of American Eagle Outfitters Inc. doesn't make sense. Most teen retailers have struggled to appeal to the newest crop of young shoppers while e-commerce sites have scattered the stores' once-loyal customers. The situation has led Charlotte Russe and Aeropostale into bankruptcy and Abercrombie & Fitch Co. to close some flagships and shrink the footprint of its stores. Fast-fashion retailer Forever 21 Inc. is said to be exploring a debt restructuring to shore up its liquidity.

Yet American Eagle, which has been around for 42 years, has found solid footing. It's consistently at or near the top of its peer group for revenue growth and digital sales. Teenage boys and girls continue to say it's one of their favorite brands, according to Piper Jaffray's semiannual survey. Investors will get a fresh look at how the company is doing Wednesday, when it reports quarterly earnings. The start of 2019 has not been kind to the U.S. apparel industry.
American Eagle's stock has declined about 3% this year, and although the shares are underperforming the benchmark Standard & Poor's 500 index, they are holding up better than most peers even amid renewed investor anxiety about the retail apparel industry in the United States. Abercrombie stock is down about 14%, Urban Outfitters Inc. shares have dived about 26%, and Guess Inc. shares have slid about 24%.
Jeans loyalty
American Eagle's popularity is partly fueled by Aerie, as well as its denim business, a space in which the company has preserved its stature while others have faltered, said Oliver Chen, a retail analyst at Cowen. Jeans are well-priced and once consumers find the right fit, they're pretty loyal to the brand, he said.
American Eagle jeans surpassed $1 billion in annual sales last year, said Chad Kessler, global brand president. And executives think there's more for the taking. Chief Financial Officer Robert Madore said in March that Gap Inc.'s announcement that it would close hundreds of stores provides a "huge opportunity."
"They're working from a position of strength while others are not, and that's helpful," Chen said. "It's not easy to adapt because teens want variety, so the new trend is no trend."
The first American Eagle store opened in 1977 in a mall in Michigan. It wasn't until 1990 that the company created its private-label products, which included men's boot-cut and worker jeans. Signature denim came a few years later.
In a fashion world still dominated by athleisure, competition among retailers to put shoppers back in jeans is heating up. Levi Strauss & Co. and Kontoor Brands Inc. went public this year, and J. Crew Group Inc. may do the same for its denim line Madewell this year.
Jeans companies have made headway by churning out denim pants that are as comfortable as leggings. American Eagle has stayed ahead of the curve by using stretch technology, distressed treatments and a wide range of sizes, including lengths, Chen said. In some stores, customers can personalize jeans by adding back patches or paint.
'Playing it safe'
The retailer wasn't always at the top of its game. Five years ago, American Eagle struggled to keep up with the pace of fast-fashion chains such as H&M and Forever 21. It announced plans in 2014 to close about 150 stores over three years, and its revenue and same-store sales declined for seven straight quarters.
"They were playing it safe to a degree," said Gabriella Santaniello, founder of retail consulting firm A Line Partners. "But what we're starting to see from them is that they're really evolving their product."
American Eagle is also trying in-store concepts to keep current fans as they mature. The Manhattan location where Jacobs shopped, which is close to New York University, has a study area and washing machines and dryers under pink neon signs where students can do laundry free of charge. The catch: They can't leave during the wash and dry cycles, which means some visitors stay in the store longer.
American Eagle is gaining cachet as a lingerie and swimsuit seller through Aerie, which it launched nationwide in 2006. Aerie has posted quarterly same-store sales growth in the double digits for a handful of years -- often 20% or higher -- consistently outpacing the American Eagle brand.
'Game changer'
Aerie also helps spread the company's diversity message. It has aimed to be more inclusive of women of different shapes, sizes and backgrounds, a departure from the images traditionally promoted by rivals including Victoria's Secret. Executives decided some years ago to not retouch photos of models in Aerie campaigns.
Emily Zabaleta, a 25-year-old digital designer, said she and her friends started buying Aerie because of plus-size model Iskra Lawrence, who is often featured in its advertising.
"Aerie is an absolute game changer," said Zabaleta, who recently placed an online rush order for clothes to take on a cruise. "A lot of the times when I'm looking at these brands it's, 'Oh, how am I able to make myself look like that?' as opposed to 'Oh, I look like that and that could look good on me.' "
Young voices
This spring, American Eagle began identifying young people -- of different races, gender identities and body sizes -- who are passionate about activism and have sizable social media followings. The company asked them to style themselves in American Eagle clothes and take their own photos, some of which now adorn walls of stores across the country.
The campaign resonated with customers, about half of whom belong to Gen Z, the generation of people roughly ages 7 to 22.
The connection with young shoppers has also influenced the company's leadership. Last year, when some survivors of the high school shooting in Parkland, Fla., appeared on the cover of Time magazine wearing American Eagle jeans, executives were so moved that they wanted to find a way to support the voices of more teenagers and young adults, Kessler, the brand president, said in an interview.
This spring, the retailer launched its AExME council with a group of young adults. They are paired with mentors and gather about once a month to discuss practices and products. At a meeting at the company's Pittsburgh headquarters this year, they made suggestions for the back-to-school collection, which the company plans to act on, Kessler said.
"It's important for kids in this generation to know not all big companies are the same," he said. "We are turning over a certain amount of control of the brand to this generation."

Texto completo: June is Pride Month, historically considered a time to celebrate lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer history.
A group in Boston has sparked outrage, however, by announcing plans to host a “Straight Pride" Parade this summer, although it's unclear if the city will allow the event.
Mark Sahady, vice president of Super Happy Fun America, a group organized by three men who claim to advocate “on behalf of the straight community,” announced that the parade is tentatively scheduled for Aug. 31. Sahady included a proposed parade route that mirrors the path of the LGBT Pride Parade that takes place on Saturday.
“We will have the streets closed and be allowed floats and vehicles,” Sahady wrote in a Facebook post. “This is our chance to have a patriotic parade in Boston as we celebrate straight pride. ”
Sahady claimed he filed a discrimination complaint with the city and that officials are now working with the group on the event. City officials confirmed the group has contacted them, but they haven't received the permits required to host a parade.
'Straight pride is every day': Why we have LGBTQ Pride and not 'Straight Pride'
Pride Month: Why is LGBT Pride Month in June?
Sahady has organized several controversial rallies in Boston, Boston Magazine reported, including a “Rally for the Republic” in 2017 that drew fewer than 100 right-wing demonstrators and a pro-gun protest in response to the March for Our Lives in 2018.
Boston is a historically LGBT-friendly city, and Massachusetts became the first state to legalize same-sex marriage in 2004.
The announcement drew ridicule on social media after New York Times assistant managing editor Carolyn Ryan tweeted about the event.
Boston Mayor Marty Walsh, a Democrat, issued a statement in support of the city’s LGBT community and its upcoming Pride Month events.
“Every year Boston hosts our annual Pride Week, where our city comes together to celebrate the diversity, strength and acceptance of our LGBTQ community,” Walsh said. “This is a special week that represents Boston’s values of love and inclusion, which are unwavering. I encourage everyone to join us in celebration this Saturday for the Pride Parade and in the fight for progress and equality for all. ”

Texto completo: A Pittsburgh researcher will not have to testify about her conclusions that allowing transgender people to serve in the military won't harm military readiness or cost overly much, a federal judge has ruled.
U.S. District Judge Mark Hornak on Monday granted a motion by Agnes Schaefer, a Rand Corp. researcher, to block the Justice Department from forcing her to testify about a report she authored for the Defense Department.
Judge Hornak's order quashes four DOJ subpoenas seeking her testimony. He said that while it's possible other cases might cause him to revisit the debate at some point, it won't be now.
"The court concludes that the government has failed to demonstrate that it has a need, substantial or otherwise, for Dr. Schaefer's compelled expert deposition testimony," he said in an opinion. "The court further concludes that Dr. Schaefer would be unduly burdened by having to comply with the subpoenas at this juncture because the professional and reputational burdens that she would incur would disproportionally outweigh the relevance of, and the government's asserted need for, her deposition testimony."
Ms. Schaefer and her lawyers have refused to comment, as has counsel for DOJ. The parties argued the case before the judge in April.
Ms. Schaefer, a senior researcher at Rand's office in Oakland, said her report stands on its own and that testifying about it would undermine Rand's reputation for independent research.
The Trump administration said it had a right to know how she reached her conclusions so it can defend the policy in four federal lawsuits brought by transgender people across the country.
The plaintiffs are using her report to bolster their contention that the administration's ban on transgender people serving in the military violates the Constitution.
One set of plaintiffs had also asked to depose Ms. Schaefer. They later withdrew the request but the government did not, arguing that it wanted to test her "factual underpinnings."
But Ms. Schaefer's lawyers said the report is publicly available, peer-reviewed and lists all of the studies on which it is based, so there's no need for her to be brought into court. They also said that if the government wants to challenge her report, it can hire its own experts to do it.
The judge agreed on most of her points but left the door open to look at the issue again if one of the parties files a motion to modify his order "for good cause shown based on subsequent or intervening events."

Texto completo: [What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox .]
There is no escaping the clamor of New York City. Just ask Mike Edison.
He has been jolted awake before dawn by jackhammers and screeching delivery trucks. He asked politely for those responsible to stop. He dialed the city's 311 hotline. He fired off letters to the police and other city agencies. Nothing.
So he single-handedly opened another front in the war against noise: He sued in small claims court.
And it worked.
Mr. Edison, who has no legal training, has sued a construction company, a real estate developer and the Rite Aid drugstore chain, claiming they were negligent in failing to keep their workers from being annoyingly loud. He has also threatened to sue a half-dozen other companies including Starbucks and Con Edison, the giant utility.
Though his unorthodox legal claims have never been tested in court, the mere possibility has been enough to wrangle settlements that stopped the noise and paid him thousands of dollars.
"This is effective -- it actually works -- all the other stuff won't," said Mr. Edison, 70, a retired advertising sales executive who teaches English to immigrants in Queens.
Still, while Mr. Edison might have succeeded in making his little corner of the Upper East Side of Manhattan quieter, the rest of the city is actually getting louder.
Noise complaints to 311 have soared by 29 percent to nearly 438,000 last year from about 338,000 in 2014, according to an analysis of city data by OpenTheBooks.com, a nonprofit watchdog group, and The New York Times.
The top complaints were about construction-related activities, music and parties, loud talking, banging and pounding sounds, barking dogs and idling engines and honking.
And the problem is getting worse. This year, the city has already logged 127,271 noise complaints through April, up from 119,331 for the same period a year ago.
The complaints have grown despite the city's efforts since 2007 to enforce a more stringent noise code that had been overhauled for the first time in three decades. The sweeping measures included setting new limits on music played at bars and restaurants and restricting noisy activities to regular working hours.
Noise is not just maddening -- it has also been linked to higher levels of stress, hypertension and heart disease.
Mr. Edison moved to the Upper East Side from New Jersey a decade ago after meeting his second wife, Carol, a retired school secretary who lived there. Back then, he recalled, it was a relatively tranquil oasis in the city. Not anymore.
Last year, a new apartment tower started going up nearby. Though the city restricts construction to weekdays between 7 a.m. and 6 p.m., work is sometimes allowed outside those hours and the project on Mr. Edison's street had gotten special permission.
These exceptions are also rising. Citywide, there were 67,604 after-hours permits in 2018, up from 48,262 in 2014.
Buildings officials say it is sometimes safer to carry out work when there are fewer people and less traffic around.
But Mr. Edison said he could not sleep with all the jackhammering and the rumbling from cement trucks. He complained to the contractor, CM & Associates Construction Management. The noise stopped for a while, only to return as loud as ever, he said.
He complained some more. In an emailed response, which Mr. Edison shared with The Times, a company employee acknowledged Mr. Edison's displeasure about "these early starts" and offered him a "hotel room at your expense."
That was the proverbial last straw.
"That was pretty rude," Mr. Edison said. "Why should I get a hotel room?"
George Mihalis, a senior project executive for the company, said a misunderstanding had occurred and the hotel room had been offered at the company's expense. Longer work hours were needed, he said, while pouring the concrete structure for the building because it had to be done all at once.
City buildings officials said the after-hours permits for the project were issued for limited periods, and that an inspection in December found work happening when there was no permit. They ordered all after-hours work to stop.
But Mr. Edison said he continued to be woken up by idling trucks and workers calling out while they waited for construction to start.
His next stop was Manhattan small claims court to sue CM & Associates and Todd Cohen of Icon Realty Management, which is developing the project. He did not need a lawyer and the paperwork was simple.
He prepared his arguments for court, but never got to use them. A lawyer called to settle.
Mr. Edison asked that the exact amount not be disclosed because he had signed a confidentiality agreement.
Mr. Edison said he gave half the money to a local soup kitchen and several nonprofit groups. "I don't think you should make money on the suffering of other people -- a lot of people around here were upset by the noise," he said.
Mr. Mihalis declined to comment and Mr. Cohen and lawyers who handled the settlement did not respond to requests for comment.
City Councilman Ben Kallos, who represents the Upper East Side and is also a lawyer, said Mr. Edison was pursuing an unusual legal route.
Small claims court is typically the last resort for settling disputes over specific monetary damages -- not a venue for fighting quality-of-life issues.
"I'm pleasantly surprised that he was able to win some small victory," he said.
Jack Grant, a longtime friend of Mr. Edison's, said Mr. Edison does not back down. "When he believes in something, Mike will stick to it until it gets done," he said.
Mr. Edison was just getting started. His next target was Rite Aid after he had been woken up numerous times by delivery trucks unloading at the pharmacy on the corner. He complained, and a lawyer for Rite Aid assured him that it would not happen again, Mr. Edison said. It did.
That time, he said, he tried to reason with the workers. He asked them to keep it down. "They laughed at me," he said. "I filed the suit the next day."
Rite Aid offered to settle before the case was heard. He told the lawyer to donate the settlement money to the soup kitchen. All he wanted was for the noise to stop -- and it did. A spokesman for Rite Aid declined to comment.
Since then, Mr. Edison has created a form letter he uses to threaten to sue companies over noise. Starbucks and Walgreens Boots Alliance, which operates the nearby Duane Reade, and the trucking services they use were sent letters over noisy deliveries. So was Con Edison after metal plates on the street came loose during repair work and clanked whenever cars drove over them.
The letters have been so effective, he said, that the noise usually stops right away. He has not had to go back to small claims court.
Walgreens said it had taken steps to prevent any more late-night noise, adjusting the store's delivery schedule to earlier hours. "We've apologized to Mr. Edison for the inconvenience," said Molly Sheehan, a company spokeswoman.
Mr. Edison's tenacity has impressed some of his neighbors. "I think it's great, you have to be proactive," said Robert Weinstein, an insurance consultant, who runs a fan year round in his apartment to drown out street noise.
Even Mr. Edison has been surprised.
"Every one of these guys I went after stopped," he said. "That's the amazing thing to me. "

Texto completo: Henry Fountain is a science writer on the Climate desk of The New York Times. He toured the Chernobyl plant and the exclusion zone around it in 2014.
The first thing to understand about the HBO mini-series "Chernobyl," which concludes its five-part run on Monday, is that a lot of it is made up. But here's the second, and more important, thing: It doesn't really matter.
The explosion and fire at Chernobyl's Unit 4 reactor on April 26, 1986, was an extraordinarily messy and grim event, a radioactive "dirty" bomb on a scale that no one -- certainly not anyone in the Soviet Union -- was prepared for. It remains the worst disaster in the history of nuclear power, killing more than 30 people initially (and more in the years that followed, though the numbers are much disputed) and spreading radioactive contamination across large swaths of Soviet and European territory.
In the immediate panicked aftermath, and in the months of crisis and confusion until the completion seven months later of the concrete-and-steel sarcophagus that entombed the reactor's lethal remains, the heroes and villains numbered in the hundreds, and the supporting cast in the hundreds of thousands.
The producers of the mini-series don't sanitize the disaster (sometimes the gore even goes a little too far: The radiation victims are often covered in blood for some reason). Instead, they simplify. They leave the grim alone, but the demands of Hollywood, and of production budgets, take a toll on the messy.
That's not to say there aren't many touches of verisimilitude. The rooftop scene in which conscripts have just seconds to toss radioactive debris to the ground is as otherworldly as it must have seemed to those who were there three decades ago. And the Unit 4 control room is faithfully re-created, from the control-rod dials on the walls to the white coats and caps worn by the operators. (When I visited the adjacent Unit 3 control room five years ago, I had to wear the same odd outfit, which seemed more appropriate for a bakery than a nuclear power plant.)
But if you didn't know much about Chernobyl you could be forgiven if, after watching, you thought the entire response and cleanup was run by two people, Valery Legasov and Boris Shcherbina, aided valiantly by a third, Ulana Khomyuk.
You could also be forgiven if you thought they were all real characters. Legasov and Shcherbina were real, though their roles were twisted and amplified to meet the script's need to keep things moving. Khomyuk, on the other hand, was made out of whole cloth, and her actions strain credulity, from traveling to Chernobyl, uninvited, to investigate the accident to being in the presence of Mikhail Gorbachev at the Kremlin not much later.
The producers mention some folderol at the end, that Khomyuk was a composite character created to represent all of the scientists who helped investigate the disaster. Fine, I guess. But much of the rest of "Chernobyl" gets the simplistic Hollywood treatment, too.
There are the brave, doomed firefighters, ignorant of the radiation hazards they encountered (though nobody climbed up over the reactor debris, as portrayed in the series; they were working the roof to prevent fires from spreading to the undamaged Unit 3). The plucky, can-do miners, brought in to excavate under the reactor to stop the meltdown, stripping naked to get the job done (the series doesn't say this, but their work ended up largely for naught). The no-nonsense helicopter pilots, risking radiation sickness to drop their loads of lead, boron and sand on the reactor (while one helicopter did crash, killing its crew, the accident happened months later, and radiation had nothing to do with it).
I could go on. Don't get me started about that blue light from the exposed reactor shining high into the night sky in the first episode. Yes, nuclear reactors can produce a blue hue, from something called Cherenkov radiation, but no, there's no way Unit 4 would have looked like the "Tribute in Light" in Lower Manhattan on the anniversary of Sept. 11.
In the end, though, none of this really matters. For the mini-series gets a basic truth right -- that the Chernobyl disaster was more about lies, deceit and a rotting political system than it was about bad engineering or abysmal management and training (or, for that matter, about whether nuclear power is inherently good or bad).
"Chernobyl" is grim only partly because of all the destruction and death. The need to constantly lie (or cope with the lies of higher-ups) weighs on its characters as heavily as all the lead that was dropped on the reactor.
Yes, this basic truth is simplified, too, especially in the final episode, which portrays the trial of three power plant officials.
I don't want to give away much about these scenes, though I will reveal that the geeky term "positive void coefficient" -- one of the reactor's design flaws -- was uttered. (As a science writer, I was overjoyed.)
The scenes have a lot of tension, and are among the best in the whole mini-series. But they seem drawn more from American movie courtrooms than from Soviet jurisprudence. The idea of someone speaking truth to power in this court seems about as far-fetched as anything else in the whole of "Chernobyl."
How the show gets to its truth, however, is less important than that it gets there. Viewers may come away from "Chernobyl" realizing that, together, people and machines can do awful things -- like create a nuclear catastrophe for the ages. If they also come away understanding that in this case, that outcome was more the fault of a government and its apparatchiks, so much the better.

Texto completo: When the federal Office of Civil Rights in 1977 charged New York City with running a top-to-bottom racially segregated public school system, a big part of its complaint was that blacks and Latinos made up about 60% of public high school students but just 45% of those at Stuyvesant, Bronx Science and Brooklyn Tech.
After accusing the city of using academic tracking as a K-to-12 instrument of segregation, the feds struck a deal the next year that, as the New York Times summarized it, recognized the need for "common-sense grouping of children...but with the understanding that the schools are responsible for helping youngsters to work their way up from the bottom so that starting on the slow track need not determine a child's speed forever."
The agreement let New York maintain the 1971 law mandating that a single test, the SHSAT, determine admissions to those three elite high schools, and - quoting the Times again - it "acknowledged that there is an irreconcilable conflict between academic selectivity and admission by quotas that are aimed at insuring a perfect sample of the overall demography."
Jump ahead four decades, and blacks and Latinos are up to about 70% of all public high school students and down to just 10% of those at the eight elite high schools that now use the test to determine admissions.
And Chancellor Richard Carranza and Mayor Bill de Blasio are furiously calling on Albany to change the law so that New York City's elite schools will better reflect its demography - and flatly denying what the Times long ago called that "irreconcilable conflict."
Rather, de Blasio has said, the current standard is a "monumental injustice," and creating a new admissions standard to diversify the SHSAT schools "would raise the bar at the specialized high schools in every way" and "also make our society stronger" as "the kind of high schools we have today, will determine the kind of New York City we will have tomorrow."
He's right. Talent is spread across our city, but easily recognized in only a few of its pockets. It's profoundly unhealthy to have such a segregated public system. And given how hard it is for a chancellor with three years, tops, overseeing a system it takes students 13 years to move through, to steer the ship toward a new course, there's some moral, political and rhetorical appeal in using the elite schools to force a conversation about integration and equity (that is, if you're not Asian-American) across the system.
But it's absurd to pin on one test that's supposed to have somehow become more discriminatory over time the failings of the much larger school system that produces most of the students taking it (or deciding not to).
More, I suspect the elite schools do more to burnish their own reputations than they do for students already primed for success; though they do help retain families who'd otherwise leave the system or the city. Finally, no matter how much more equitable you get, separating "the leaders and innovators of tomorrow" isn't helpful to everyone that leaves behind.
I'm sure that compared to the political capital and rhetorical energy spent pushing the SHSAT boulder up the hill 150 miles north, de Blasio and Carranza have spent precious little on the "slow track" here.
And I'm sure that there is nothing stopping them from changing the admission standard at the five other high schools using the test to prove that they have a better approach.
(They now claim it's not legally clear they could do this, but it is; this is a guy pretending he wants to fight screaming "hold me back!" at his own legal department.)
There's nothing at all stopping them from opening new elite schools so even more students would benefit.
But Carranza, who's said that "some people say the test is racist," is passing: "What you're going to do is you're going to create another tier of schools. I don't want to create more tiers."
Or maybe Carranza and de Blasio just don't want to put their money where their mouths have been.

Texto completo: Kristen Arnett launched her 2017 book at the 7-Eleven down the street from her house.
"It was great. About 40 people came," said Arnett, 38, of Maitland. "I read by the Slurpee machine. I signed books next to the hot dog roller." The book: "Felt in the Jaw," a short-story collection.
There should be more people and hoopla for the Tuesday, June 4, launch of "Mostly Dead Things," her ballyhooed first novel, at Park Avenue CDs in Orlando.
The New York Times has listed Arnett among "4 writers to watch this summer." In a Times review, Parul Sehgal called the book "an irresistible first novel set in the hard sunshine and 'juicy green' of Central Florida." From all the buzz, Arnett prizes a starred Booklist review from the American Library Association because she is a librarian.
She has worked at the Maitland and Rollins College libraries and is taking a leave from the Barry University School of Law Library for her nearly 20-stop book tour. She likes that the start Tuesday, the day the book comes out, should be informal.
"I grew up going to Park Avenue CDs, although granted, when it was on Park Avenue," she said. "This is a book that's very much about growing up in Central Florida. I grew up in that shop. I love being able to do the book launch there."
Her narrator, Jessa-Lynn Morton, deals with her father's suicide and the family's failing taxidermy business. She and her brother love the same woman. Their mother takes to arranging the taxidermied animals in sexual poses.
"My protagonist Jessa is very uptight," Arnett said. "She's a queer woman, but she takes taxidermy very seriously and considers it to be this very personal and deep kind of art that she has a reverence for."
Her mother's racy creations make Jessa uncomfortable and so does seeing her parent as a sexual being. Although Jessa is a control freak, the book takes a plainspoken approach to sexuality.
"I'm a lesbian author," Arnett said. "I wanted to write in ways that I've been looking for my whole life as a reader - just to see queerness embedded in the text. I didn't want it to be a coming-out story. I just wanted it to be what's the day-to-day domestic life of this family and the woman just happens to be gay. I wanted it to be present and not something that needed its own plot."
She writes expertly about taxidermy after extensive research ("it helps that I'm a librarian"). She writes humor and drama with equal skill. Her family confrontations after years of avoidance are especially memorable.
"I wanted this to be a book about grief, but I also wanted it to be a book about finally understanding the coping mechanisms that you've used your whole life," she said. "What happens when those finally stop working? A lot of the time that means actually having to deal with the fallout from things. That's ugly and messy."
Arnett also writes about parenting with tenderness and understanding. She has an 18-year-old son at Florida State University. She went to Winter Park High School, earned her undergraduate degree at Rollins College and her master's at Florida State. In "Mostly Dead Animals," she writes about "a kind of local amnesia" in Central Florida.
"I'm third generation Floridian. I was thinking a lot about here specifically in Orlando," she said. "We have these places that have been here for a long time. When they're gone, you ask people about them, and no one seems to remember them. As a writer and a person who loves Orlando, I'm trying to capture memory and a feeling of nostalgia of place. The fact that people don't keep that, that there's a collective amnesia about why we're here, is so fascinating to me."
She says she's a bit troubled by the trend yet optimistic. "More people are growing up and staying here and want to work to preserve memories," she said. "That gives me hope."
Her book has echoes of classic Southern writers. "I'm a huge Flannery O'Connor fan. I wrote my honors thesis on Flannery," Arnett said. "I'm into Southern women writers."
She also cites Florida writers Karen Russell, Lauren Groff and Laura van den Berg as inspirations. "Swamplandia!" author Russell's praise decorates the book jacket for "Mostly Dead Things": "one of the strangest and funniest and most surprising first novels I've ever read."
Arnett is a playful presence on Twitter, where she calls herself "lesbian willie nelson" because of her hairstyle and a "7-eleven scholar." In "Mostly Dead Things," she thanks "my 7-Eleven cashier." "I'm there all the time," she said.
Arnett is a columnist for Literary Hub and an essay writer. She scrapped a short story to write the novel, which took four years. She hopes it resonates especially with Floridians.
"I love Florida, and specifically Orlando," she said. "There are very preconceived ideas about what Orlando is. I love living here. I wanted that present in the book. Place is as important to me as character. It wouldn't be the same book if you took Florida out of it."

Manhattan chef's return cause for loud hosannahs Nina June chef/proprietor Sara Jenkins has deep ties to Italy and Maine - both are deliciously evident on the plate at her Rockport restaurant.

Texto completo: Bluefish is the way to my heart. Or mackerel, sardines, even whitebait - all the fish that a good friend describes lovingly as "smelling like the bottom of an aquarium."
In part, I love them for their brazen, unblushing fishiness. They are proud to be precisely what they are and don't make Tiliapian efforts to mask their identity. It is impossible to eat a piece of mackerel without knowing it.
But I also love these fish because they get so little affection elsewhere, especially in big cities. Fifteen years ago, at my favorite fish market in Manhattan, I saw fillets of bruise-colored bluefish piled on ice and ordered two or three for that night's dinner.
"I'll give you the whole stack for a dollar if you just take them away," the fishmonger said, exasperated. "Nobody buys them. Restaurants don't want 'em. They're garbage fish." I understood that afternoon, lugging a 7 1/2
-pound bag of fillets back to my apartment, that I would never be a New Yorker.
Last weekend while walking past Nina June in Rockport, I caught a glimpse of the evening's menu taped to the glass-paneled front door, and I had a flashback to that day. "I don't know what you're going to have tonight," I announced to my dinner guest. "But I'm getting the bluefish."
Owner Sara Jenkins, a celebrated New York chef (Porchetta, Porsena) and native Mainer who spent most of her childhood in Italy, knows how to handle oily fish, pan-frying it in juniper-berry-infused butter, then setting the crisp bluefish alight in a gin-catalyzed fireball. Once the flambÃ© sputters out, she nestles the fillets onto a "risotto" of fiddleheads and barley, then crowns the plate with a verdant snarl of pea shoots, dill and ribbons of cucumber ($26).
"Sometimes I complain about how many things I can sell in New York but not here," she said. "But oily fish is not one of those things. I get bluefish now, and then mackerel all summer. I think that's where all the flavor is. And people really just eat it up. It fits here."
Another easy sell is the braised, coriander-spiced Guini Ridge Farm lamb rib and chop that Jenkins glazes with a Floyd Cardozo-inspired plum, ginger and tamarind chutney ($28). It is a phenomenal dish that splices together fresh spring protein with culinary shout-outs to last autumn -- purÃ©ed golden turnips and sticky-sweet charred carrots that I watched the back-of-house staff grill over a mammoth, open-flame stove at the center of the room.
When I first sat down, my back to the windows overlooking the 26-seat patio, Rockport Harbor and Marine Park, I figured I had drawn the short stick by sacrificing gorgeous scenery for the ability to take a few notes as I ate. But at Nina June, the Colosseum-like kitchen and its full exposure of everyone from line cooks to Jenkins herself ensures that there is no such thing as a bad view.
"It's really kind of a stage, and you have to go into service like it's a little performance," Jenkins told me. "If I had my druthers, I'd be hidden away in a closet somewhere, but people love to sit at the bar and watch us work. They really seem to dig it, even if we're a little grumpy."
On my recent visit, a little grumpiness was going around, but it wasn't coming from the kitchen. Rather, each of the three tables around me expressed exasperations large and small about that evening's service. One couple sat for 10 minutes before their server delivered menus. Another sat discussing their dessert choices for so long, they eventually gave up and sniped, "I don't think we can really afford to wait for it," when their server eventually arrived.
My own server ignored my guest's empty cocktail (and later, wine) glass, forcing us to flag down a different front-of-house staffer for another of the tart and extra-high-octane French 75s that the bar fortifies with cognac and Cointreau ($14).
This happened again with water glasses, except this time, we were teased first. "Would you like more water?" our server inquired. Having sat with empty glasses for 30 minutes, we certainly did. A few minutes later, she returned to deposit a full carafe of water on an empty table just out of reach, then retreated to the kitchen, reappearing to spirit away the jug without pouring a drop.
I'll admit to a smidgen of grumpiness myself over the miserly portion of sautÃ©ed, locally foraged ramps and a single crostino so thin it was translucent ($14). Dip what the menu calls "shaved bread" into the excellent, peppery aioli that Jenkins buzzes together with the oil from last year's preserved cherry hots; snag a fork-tender ramp bulb, and -- poof! -- it's gone. Even one more of the vanishingly thin crostini would have made this dish feel more like an appetizer and less like a subliminal message.
Yet, if the worst thing I can say about what I ate at Nina June is that I wish I had more of it, Jenkins and her team are on the right track with their mostly Italian, entirely Mediterranean menu. And to be clear: I absolutely did not leave hungry. A shared slice of the dense, peppery olive oil cake ($10) served with a generous and jiggly spoonful of house-made lemon curd was ample for two, especially if one of you has ordered her superlative (and sizable) pasta al limone ($25).
Incorporating a chive-and-egg-yolk emulsion into the dough, Jenkins fashions supple, radiantly aromatic strands of rough-cut spaghetti that she dresses in sunny lemon butter and finishes with scoops of Maine crab meat. Pure pleasure from the first to last forkful, it is obvious why this has become Nina June's signature dish.
"That's a pasta that some Italian guy I was sitting next to at a wine dinner was telling me about. Except his was just lemon and bottarga (salt-cured fish roe)," Jenkins said. "I thought I should do it with lemon butter instead, and then I stuck crab meat into it. Now, I can change the menu left, right and center, but I can't ever take that off. People identify that dish with Nina June."
During one of her increasingly rare trips back to her lone remaining New York restaurant, Porsena, you might find Jenkins making pasta, but you won't find that exact dish on the menu. It belongs to Nina June, to Maine; it fits here.

Texto completo: Other Voices
For those unfamiliar with the business of Mount Everest, last week's photo showing hundreds of climbers in a dense line snaking up the mountain's southeast ridge on their way to the 29,029-foot summit was a shock. An American named Don Cash died in that traffic jam after being on his feet for more than 12 hours.
Another American who made it to the summit and came down safely later told the New York Times, "It was like a zoo." The Times blamed "fly-by-night adventure companies ... taking up untrained climbers," the Nepali government, "hungry for every climbing dollar it can get," and "a growing body of thrill-seekers the world over" for the situation.
To many observers, this wasn't just confirmation of the worst aspects of Everest's reputation; it was a sign that today's Everest climbers represent the height of human stupidity. But the situation on the summit this year is not reason enough to demonize those who were up there or who will go up there in the future.
I've been writing about the world's highest peak as long as I've been a journalist, and I was on the scene at Base Camp, living with the Everest ER doctors, when, in April 2015, a massive earthquake triggered an avalanche that killed more than a dozen climbers - and almost killed me. Yet if someone offered me the chance to go climb Everest in the next few years, I would probably say yes.
That wouldn't mean just paying $70,000 for a one-time adventure. Before climbing Everest, I'd have to take mountaineering courses here in the United States, an expedition to another 8,000-meter peak such as Cho Oyu and months off from full-time work. What's lost in today's conversation about Everest is how much time and effort the majority of climbers dedicate to preparing for their summit attempts.
Everest has had periodic PR crises since 12 people died during the spring of 1996 and Jon Krakauer condemned the commercial guiding industry's foibles in his book "Into Thin Air." Every few years, the cycle repeats itself: Faraway onlookers shake their heads, reporters write about how climbing conditions are worse than ever, and Nepal's government officials, who control access to the mountain's most popular route, make vague statements about imposing new rules.
I came away from my time at Base Camp feeling conflicted: So much obviously unnecessary death has occurred around this place, but, if I had the means, I would go back as soon as I could. For all the bad it brings out in people, Everest will always be an invigorating, awe-inspiring wonder. To see it with your own eyes is a gift; to meet the people of Nepal's Khumbu Valley is to be humbled and befriended in ways you never imagined.
I'm a distance runner, and I believe that, just like climbing Everest, pretty much anyone can run a marathon these days. That doesn't mean running a marathon is easy or perfectly safe. Several people die running in the United States each year, although there's no doubt that climbing Everest is riskier than running 26.2 miles. But both pursuits are fairly irrational, require sacrifices and are not easily understood by those who say, "I would never do such a thing."
Fortunately, if you can't finish a marathon, you're probably not going to hurt anyone else in the process. Ill-prepared Everest climbers compromise the safety of other people on the mountain. That's a real problem that "the beauty and awe of Everest" can't excuse. But it's possible to hold all these thoughts at the same time: Just because a massive feat of physical endurance is achievable doesn't mean it's easy. And just because some people will attempt this feat without proper training doesn't make everyone who does it an idiot. And it doesn't make the pursuit itself stupid.
The Nepali government and certain guiding companies absolutely can do more to keep inexperienced climbers off Everest. The problem is not that too many people want to climb. It's that a few guiding companies are willing to accept clients who aren't ready to do it - and catering to their needs on the mountain is often what leads to deadly traffic jams.
There's a lot to roll your eyes at about the modern Everest experience: the insanely luxurious accommodations some expeditions provide at Base Camp, the high sticker prices, the human waste. The endless superlatives climbers use to distinguish themselves and get funding for their trips: the youngest person, the oldest person, the first person with cystic fibrosis. (I could be the "first woman with Type 1 diabetes.") So much of that deserves healthy cynicism. But the desire to test your own limits by walking to the top of the world on your own two feet remains pretty darn pure.

Mamet's 'Bitter Wheat' Sows Debate

Texto completo: LONDON -- Word that the Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright David Mamet was working on a #MeToo-related play first emerged in February 2018. "I was talking with my Broadway producer and he said, 'Why don't you write a play about Harvey Weinstein?' And so I did," Mr. Mamet told the Chicago Tribune.
Since then, he's said next to nothing about the play, titled "Bitter Wheat." And those involved in the production, which begins performances June 7 here at the Garrick Theater, have remained extraordinarily tight-lipped, too.
Mr. Mamet's last few plays, including "The Anarchist," "China Doll" and "The Penitent," have not been well-received. And his political turn to the right has won him few fans in theater circles.
Still: David Mamet -- who has directed 10 movies himself -- taking on Harvey Weinstein? We want to know more. Here's everything we've learned so far.
What Mr. Mamet has said.
"Every society has to confront the ungovernable genie of sexuality and tries various ways to deal with it and none of them work very well," he continued in that Tribune interview. "There is great difficulty when you are switching modes, which we seem to be doing now. People go crazy. They start tearing each other to bits."
Mr. Mamet is directing the play. His lead character, a "depraved Hollywood mogul," according to the promotional materials, is Barney Fein. And John Malkovich is playing the part, his first time on the West End stage since 1992.
What Mr. Malkovich has said.
In January, Mr. Malkovich raised hackles after he described "Bitter Wheat" as a "black farce" on BBC Radio 4. "It might upset people who've experienced the kind of treatment that the play contains and shows and describes," Mr. Malkovich predicted.
"A lot of people may not like it," he said, noting that he personally considered it a terrific piece of writing.
"A lot of great plays elicit the question: Do I laugh or do I cry?" Mr. Malkovich said. "I think a lot of great comedy exists at the crossroads between pain and farce."
So, yes, it's already caused controversy.
The news that a powerful and wealthy male playwright was writing a "farce" about abuses carried out by a powerful and wealthy male movie mogul didn't go down too well. Matters weren't helped by the provocatively jaunty language used in publicity materials, which state that "Bitter Wheat" has been written and directed by Mr. Mamet "in a good mood," and describe the Weinstein-style character of Barney Fein as "our hero."
The marketing tag line: "Money, sex, power. You only need one of them to see 'Bitter Wheat."'
Journalists are waiting, warily.
In The Guardian, Yomi Adegoke suggested that "there is a churning sense of irony in the fact that a campaign created to amplify women's voices is instead amplifying the voices of men." The theater critic Lyn Gardner expressed concerns in The Stage that women should own #MeToo stories, not "middle-aged playwrights whose recent hits have been sparse, and who are fascinated by male 'monsters' and want to give them more stage time. They have had quite enough."
[Video: "Bitter Wheat" trailer Watch on YouTube.]
It plays with its own mythology.
Publicity materials for the show are littered with references to Greek myths -- albeit in a teasing, arch way: Posters inflate Mr. Malkovich into a hulking, ominous figure and Barney Fein "is a bloated monster -- a studio head, who like his predecessor, the minotaur, devours the young he has lured into his cave," according to the play's website.
This is a reference to the mythical half-man, half-bull minotaur who lived in the center of a labyrinth and ate humans. The promotional material, however, goes on to say his "fall from power to shame is a mythic journey which has been compared to 'The Odyssey' by people who claim to have read that book," which suggests it would be wise to take Mr. Mamet's trail of references with a pinch of salt.
It's got a robust female star
Mr. Malkovich told the BBC that one of Mr. Weinstein's accusers asked to read "Bitter Wheat," with a view to appearing in it -- before deciding against it, for reasons unknown. The production instead stars actress Ioanna Kimbook, making her West End debut, as well as Doon Mackichan, a British actress and comedian who plays a production assistant named Sondra.
Ms. Mackichan said in an interview that she talked to one of Mr. Weinstein's former employees as preparation for the role.
She called the play "a really important story that needs to be told, now. I hope it gets all the conversations going, and makes people at the top go: 'Christ, I can't get away with that."'
On the question of a #MeToo story being treated as "farce," she added that it was all a question of tone. "There's nothing farcical about rape," she said, speaking shortly before rehearsals began in May. "That's not anything I would be involved in, and if I feel uncomfortable with the way the story is being told I will make myself very clear."
Mr. Mamet already wrote a divisive he-said, she-said play.
Mr. Mamet's 1992 "Oleanna," stitched from conversations between a powerful, privileged college professor and a militantly politically correct young female student, has always been controversial for having the young female student falsely cry rape, depicting a woman willfully destroying a man. Encouraged to sympathize with the wrongfully accused professor, the play's final act of violence toward a young woman has even been cheered by audiences.
And he's comfortable attacking Hollywood.
It's unlikely that Mr. Mamet will pull any punches when it comes to criticizing the movie industry -- he certainly didn't in his Oscar-nominated screenplay for "Wag the Dog" in 1997. And his previous disquisitions on show business have been zingingly, stingingly cynical. His 2007 book "Bambi vs. Godzilla" was made up of caustic essays about everything that's wrong with the movie business, taking aim at corporate culture, greedy producers and the vacuous nature of modern cinema.
In his New York Times review, Ben Brantley described Mr. Mamet's 1988 play "Speed-the-Plow" as an "acid-etched portrait of greedy, foulmouthed Hollywood players." It depicted male movie producers using their power to seduce younger, female employees -- before revealing that the young women may, in fact, be knowingly manipulating them.
New York next? Don't be surprised.
The choice of producer suggests "Bitter Wheat" may have further life in New York.
While it's unusual for a Mamet play to open first in London, "Bitter Wheat" is produced by his regular Broadway producer Jeffrey Richards -- responsible for 2015's "China Doll," the 2012 revival of "Glengarry Glen Ross" and the 2008 revival of "Speed-the-Plow."
Among the stars of Richards's previous shows: Al Pacino, Alan Alda, Liev Schreiber and Elisabeth Moss. You'd be foolish to bet against it transferring.
