Texto completo: As Democrats begin an impeachment inquiry, President Trump spent Sunday vigorously defending himself on Twitter, including highlighting a quote from a longtime evangelical pastor warning of particularly dire consequences if the Democrats follow through.
"If the Democrats are successful in removing the President from office (which they will never be), it will cause a Civil War like fracture in this Nation from which our Country will never heal," Trump tweeted, adding his own parenthetical to a quote from Robert Jeffress, a Southern Baptist preacher speaking on "Fox & Friends Weekend" on Sunday.
Trump's tweet invoking civil war marks a notable escalation in his rhetoric about the impeachment inquiry, and also highlights his close relationship with Jeffress, a pastor known for viciously attacking other faiths who holds sway over the president and evangelical voters alike.
The tweet left critics, including one sitting Republican congressman, accusing Trump of stoking violence and diminishing the reality of true civil war.
"I have visited nations ravaged by civil war. @realDonaldTrump I have never imagined such a quote to be repeated by a President," tweeted Representative Adam Kinzinger, Republican of Illinois and a decorated Air Force veteran who served as a pilot in Iraq and Afghanistan. "This is beyond repugnant."
Two Senate Democrats, Chris Murphy of Connecticut and Brian Schatz of Hawaii, also condemned the president's tweet, which Murphy described as "so frightening."
"He is going to keep talking like this," Murphy tweeted, "and some people are going to listen and do what he asks."
It's not clear from Trump's tweet or Jeffress's interview on Fox whether he was referencing actual violence as the outcome of an impeachment, but many critics said that the president's use of the term was troubling. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment clarifying the president's intentions.
"Lincoln created the Republican Party and gave his life in order to save the Union. Trump ruined the Republican Party and now threatens to destroy the Union in order to save his job," tweeted Representative Jamie Raskin, Democrat of Maryland.
Schatz echoed that concern.
"This is just a reprehensible way to talk and people could get hurt," Schatz tweeted. "It's clear now [Trump] will allow the Republican Party to eat itself and will tear the country apart if he thinks it gives him an advantage of any kind."
Washington Post
Flake says Trump's actions warrant impeachment
Former senator Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona, said in an op-ed published Monday that President Trump's actions warrant impeachment and urged fellow Republicans not to support his reelection if he remains in office.
In the piece for The Washington Post, Flake cited Trump's July call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, in which Trump repeatedly urged Zelensky to investigate former vice president Joe Biden and his son at a time when the White House had suspended military aid to Ukraine.
Most Republicans in Congress are rallying around Trump, as House Democrats aggressively move forward with an impeachment inquiry.
Flake argued that impeachment is a difficult call.
"I fear that, given the profound division in the country, an impeachment proceeding at such a toxic moment might actually benefit a president who thrives on chaos. Disunion is the oxygen of this presidency," Flake wrote.
He said that, by contrast, a decision not to support Trump's reelection is easy — although he acknowledged that it could come with consequences.
Flake referenced his own decision to retire last year after becoming an outspoken critic of Trump and seeing his popularity in Arizona decline.
Last week, Flake claimed that at least 35 Republican senators would vote for Trump's impeachment if they could do so privately.

GOP group starts ads attacking 3 House Dems on impeachment
A political committee that supports House Republican candidates is using digital ads to accuse three House Democrats of backing "a radical scheme to impeach President Trump."
The ads are among the first to use House Democrats' impeachment inquiry into President Trump to target that party's congressional candidates.
The spots by the Congressional Leadership Fund target veteran Representative Matt Cartwright of Pennsylvania and freshmen Representatives Elaine Luria of Virginia and Elissa Slotkin of Michigan. They are among 31 House Democrats representing districts that Trump carried in 2016.
The Luria ad, largely verbatim to the other two, says the effort is "Dividing the country. Tearing us apart. Because she doesn't like the President."
The group plans to run the ads during Congress' current two-week recess.

Congressman resigns before plea in insider trading case
Representative Chris Collins, a fourth-term Republican from western New York who narrowly won reelection last year despite fighting federal securities fraud charges, resigned Monday in advance of an expected guilty plea.
Collins, 69, the first sitting member of Congress to endorse President Trump in 2016, had been accused of using private information about a drug company in which he was invested to help his son and others avoid financial losses.
Collins was to be tried in February along with his son, Cameron Collins, 26, and a third man, all of whom had pleaded not guilty. But a document filed in US District Court in Manhattan on Monday said there would be a “change of plea" hearing Tuesday for Collins, though the filing did not indicate what charges he would be pleading guilty to.
Cameron Collins and the third defendant, Stephen Zarsky, whose daughter is engaged to Cameron Collins, were set to appear for their own “change of plea" hearings Thursday.
The three men were facing charges of conspiracy, securities and wire fraud, and making false statements.
A spokeswoman for Collins did not immediately return a request for comment, nor did lawyers for him and his son.

AP-NORC poll: Most disapprove of Trump on race relations
Large majorities of black and Latino Americans think Donald Trump's actions as president have made things worse for people like them, and about two-thirds of Americans overall disapprove of how he's handling race relations, according to a new poll conducted by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.
About half of all Americans think Trump's actions have been bad for African Americans, Muslims and women, and slightly more than half say they've been bad for Hispanics.
Trump's 33 percent approval rating on handling race relations makes that one of his worst issues in recent AP-NORC polls. That stands in stark contrast to his handling of the economy: About half say they approve of his handling of that issue, while views of current economic conditions continue to be rosy amid robust employment numbers and a strong stock market.
Four in 10 Americans said they approve of Trump overall, according to the poll, conducted before the release of a rough transcript of a phone call showing Trump prodded the president of Ukraine to investigate Democratic political rival Joe Biden and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's announcement that she would launch a formal impeachment inquiry.
The poll provides a bleak assessment of how the nation views Trump on race issues as he runs for a second term and repeatedly boasts of his popularity among African Americans and Latinos. Trump has consistently said his economic policies have been good for African Americans and other people of color.
But the poll shows few black Americans think that's true. Just 4 percent say they think Trump's actions have been good for African Americans in general, while 81 percent think he's made things worse. Similar shares of black Americans think Trump has been bad for Hispanics, Muslims, and women.

Twitter rightly bans conservative child comedian 'Mini AOC'

Texto completo: Much to the ire of certain corners of the Right, Twitter has evidently suspended the account of "Mini AOC," an 8-year-old girl who lampoons liberal firebrand Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.
Any self-actualized conservative ought to admit that the tech giant was unequivocally right to do so.
We rightfully criticize the Left when they prop up Greta Thunberg as an authority on climate change. Thunberg being a 16-year-old Swedish girl with a number of mental health problems renders her uniquely susceptible to the pressures of the global political stage. We understand that hiding behind children to voice the political opinions of adults is grossly disingenuous, and even more important, we know that the public sphere, especially the political one, is a vile, nasty, and cruel space. There's nary a journalist, politician, or activist who hasn't been harassed online, and plenty of us receive death and rape threats on the regular.
To throw children into that arena is cruelty.
The case of Mini AOC (whose real name I'll not be using) is even more egregious than that of Thunberg. Whereas Thunberg's parents were complicit in allowing her to become a pawn of the Left, Mini AOC's mother actively instigated turning her daughter into a living political parody. Remember, this child is half Thunberg's age and less than a third of the real Ocasio-Cortez. As cute as the girl may be and as funny as her anti-socialist quips surely are, an 8-year-old with zero political agency should not be forced to express opinions she may not later agree with as an independent, adult individual.
Twitter often wrongly bans people out of its sheer political bias. While that's its prerogative, the public is right to call out its supposed dedication to free speech as hogwash.
Social media companies rightly ban users under a certain age to protect them from millions of child predators lurking the net in droves. Facebook requires that users be at least 13 years old when they make an account, as does Twitter, at least officially. A heartbreaking investigation from the New York Times found that tech companies reported over 45 million online instances of media depictions of child rape, and even innocuous videos of children being children have become fodder for pedophiles thanks to YouTube's automated recommendation system. A majority of teenagers report being harassed online, and those propped up as public figures surely experience much worse even more often.
Keeping children off the internet can literally be a matter of life and death, and if parents won't do their jobs, social media companies are right to step in.
Mini AOC may wind up espousing the exact same beliefs as her online persona when she grows up, but her political ideology and public identity should be her choice. To rob her of that agency isn't just cruel, it's dangerous. Twitter rightly has an age limit for that reason, and they're right to enforce it.

Ukraine cloud over Attorney General William Barr is thick. He should step aside.

Resumen: President Trump and Rudy Giuliani aren't the only players tied to this controversy.

Texto completo: One of the most shocking revelations in the transcript of President Donald Trump’s phone call with President Volodymyr Zelensky was that so much of what Trump had to say on the call focused just on getting Ukrainian officials to investigate Trump’s political opponents. Another surprise was the fact that President Trump said repeatedly — five times, in fact — that Attorney General William Barr would be running point, working with Trump’s private attorney Rudy Giuliani, on these matters.
Make no mistake, these facts now implicate the attorney general, the nation’s chief law enforcement officer, directly in the commission of acts that many of the country’s leading legal experts consider federal crimes — whether as election law violations, bribery or other offenses concerning public corruption.
This doesn't look good for the AG
The revelation of Barr’s possible involvement should alarm all of us concerned about the rule of law in this country. At a minimum, it’s no longer sustainable for this attorney general to oversee the Justice Department’s handling of the Ukraine scandal.
Consider a contrast: One of the most egregious acts revealed in the Mueller report was when the president asked then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions to ”take (a) look” at investigating Trump’s political rival, Hillary Clinton. Sessions, to his credit, refused. Not to his great credit, though, because the right answer is so obviously to refrain.
Ukraine whistleblower: It's time for all the cards to be laid out for Congress
Even Barr seems to understand the extreme impropriety of what the transcript suggests about his using the power of his office to go after the president’s political rivals. Hence Barr’s formal statement, issued within 30 minutes of the transcript’s release, suggesting that what Trump told Ukraine’s president about the attorney general’s role was essentially false.
But Barr long ago lost the benefit of the doubt. We cannot accept at face value what he says when it comes to the defense of the president or himself.
What’s even more egregious here is to think of the transcript in relation to what else Barr may have been doing in handling the Ukraine matter.
It’s deeply concerning to now know that Barr’s Justice Department told the director of national intelligence to withhold the whistleblower’s complaint from Congress, while Barr admits he knew at the time that he was named on the phone call at the heart of the whistleblower’s allegations. Perhaps that would be excusable if the Justice Department’s advice to the director was ordinary and well within the law. But the DOJ advice was not close to that line. Even Fox News’ Judge Andrew Napolitano has called the DOJ legal theory for withholding the whistleblower’s complaint “cockamamie. ”
Pushing aside reports
Layer onto all of these concerns another revelation in Wednesday’s news — according to The New York Times, the director of national intelligence and the inspector general of the intelligence community each referred the whistleblower’s complaint to the Justice Department for a possible criminal investigation into the president’s actions. Within a matter of days, it seems Barr’s Justice Department somehow reached the conclusion that the complaint could not even trigger an investigation because the allegations could not involve a crime. The legal reasoning that has been reported would put the administration “on very thin ice,” as Judge Napolitano might say.
McMullin: If Congress doesn't stand up to Trump on Ukraine, his abuse of power will only escalate
Apparently, Barr’s Justice Department came up with the idea that “the information discussed on the call didn’t amount to a ‘thing of value’ that could be quantified,” according to BuzzFeed News. That logic flies in the face of what the nation’s foremost legal experts, including Trump’s deputy solicitor general, concluded in the Mueller report. In the case of Ukraine, just chalking up all of Giuliani’s out-of-pocket expenses in the hunt for fake dirt on Biden would likely show the immense value that he and Trump placed on the information.
Finally, what makes matters worse for Barr is that the president has twice publicly discussed having the attorney general investigate allegations involving Ukraine, Clinton and Biden. And the attorney general famously tried to avoid answering Sen. Kamala Harris’ simple question whether the White House ever asked him to investigate anyone.
After the release of the Ukrainegate transcript, the cloud over Bill Barr is thick. There’s one way for him to remove it. Step aside.

Portland Early Music Chapel Series explores French Baroque style Timothy Burris builds his program around the Tombeau, a French form in which composers memorialized dignitaries and other musicians.

Texto completo: For anyone fascinated by early music, played on period-appropriate instruments, Portland's offerings are comparatively few, even if you include choral concerts built around antique masterpieces. Timothy Burris, a fine lutenist and guitarist, is involved with most of them. He directs the Portland Early Music Chapel Series at the Cathedral of St. Luke's, as well as what was once an annual Portland Early Music Festival (now it alternates years with the Back Cove Contemporary Music Festival) at the Portland Conservatory. And if you look at the instrumental ensembles accompanying choral performances of Baroque works, Burris is usually among the continuo players, plucking a long-necked theorbo.
Burris opened the Chapel Series on Saturday evening with "Tombeaux: Le Luth en France au 17e SiÃ¨cle," a program that explored aspects of the French Baroque style through its music for lute and theorbo. As the title suggests, Burris' program was built around the Tombeau - a uniquely French form in which composers memorialized dignitaries and, in many cases, other musicians. The Tombeau was at its peak in the Baroque era, but you can find more recent examples, too, most notably Ravel's "Tombeau de Couperin."
Not that composers adhered to a distinct formal plan when composing a Tombeau. They are more like fantasies, emerging from an opening chord progression. But the earliest known example, Ennemond Gaultier's "Tombeau de Mezangeau, du Vieux Gaultier," which Burris played in the second half of his program, provides a road map of sorts. It begins, as do many of its successors, with a slow, graceful chord progression, and unfolds in a series of hauntingly introspective passages that are often less mournful than elegiac - more a celebration of the subject than a lament.
That was certainly the case in the first Tombeau Burris played, Jacques Gallot's "Pavane, 'Tombeau de la Reyne." True, a sense of melancholy suffuses its opening moments, but the increasingly fine detail in the unfolding lute figuration, which Burris executed flawlessly, transforms the piece into a virtuosic meditation.
Jacques Bittner's "Tombeau" - the dedicatee is not named - is a quiet, attractive piece, if somewhat less characterful than the Gallot, or others on the program. Perhaps the most striking examples of the form, here, were a pair of works composed in memory of the Parisian lutenist Charles Fleury, who was known by the name Blancrocher, and who died after tumbling down a staircase at a party. A popular player, Blancrocher left no published compositions, so is known today only by reputation.
Of the four known Tombeaux composed in Blancrocher's honor, Burris played those by Louis Couperin (originally for harpsichord, in Burris' arrangement) and FranÃ§ois Dufat. The Couperin, though written for a keyboard instrument, is a gentle, plangent essay, packed with lute figuration that undoubtedly represents Couperin's impressions of Blancrocher's performing style. The Duffat, one of the more harmonically adventurous pieces here, may also offer a clue to Blancrocher's work, in which case it offers a valuable glimpse at a legacy that survives only in these few Tombeaux.
Burris surrounded his selected Tombeaux with other works from the era, including a pair of lively dances (an Allemande and a Gavotte) by Johann Gumprecht, an Allemande ("L'Impromptu") and Chaconne by Charles Mouton, and short pieces by Gaultier and Duffat.
In these, all played on the lute (as were all the works mentioned so far), Burris gave polished readings that thrived on the delicacy of the instrument's timbres. A distinction between the sounds of the lute and the guitar, after all, is that a guitar tone, once struck, remains consistent until it fades; a note struck on the lute has a shimmering, transparent and changeable quality. Burris plays both instruments, but he seems to prefer the lute, and you can see why.
The program also included a group of pieces by Robert de VisÃ©e - a Prelude, and pair of instrumental dances from operas by his contemporary Jean-Baptiste Lully. Burris played these on the theorbo, which gives him an extended range, with deeper and fuller basses. Here, as on the lute, his pacing, his attention to the details of ornamentation, and the clarity of his counterpoint were exemplary.
But the real joy here was the thoughtfulness he brought to his selection of works, and the degree to which his playing illuminated an assertion he made early in the program, when he quoted harpsichordist Ralph Kirkpatrick's observation that the contours of French music, more than any other national style, are governed by the shape of the spoken language. Entertaining as the performances were, on their own terms, they also offered a concise overview of a historical style that listeners today don't often think about.

Texto completo: Washington scandals are moving at a record pace. It was little more than a week ago that The New York Times launched its unfair hit piece on Brett Kavanaugh. This is the Trump-era news cycle. Scandals that used to go on for months now seem to end in hours. Nothing illustrates this better than the bizarre Ukraine story we're all living through. A week ago, no one had even heard of it. Then we were on the brink of impeachment because of it, and now it seems it may be over already.
The same angry news anchors who brought you Stormy Daniels and the Russia hoax now want you to know Big Orange's days in the White House are over. Why? Because Donald Trump, they say, threatened to withhold military aid to Ukraine unless Ukraine did something bad to Joe Biden and his family. Supposedly, Mr. Trump was finished.
Once again, the mob turned out to be wrong. The administration released a transcript of the president's phone call with the Ukrainian head of state, and it says none of the things the news anchors claimed it would. Read it for yourself. It's online. Try to find the extortion in there. There isn't any. Mr. Trump never even mentions military aid. There's certainly something unseemly about a president asking a foreign government to investigate an American citizen, but it's not illegal, and it's not all that different from three Democratic senators' writing a letter to Ukraine just last year demanding investigations into Mr. Trump.
Now that the call turns out to be nothing like what the media told us it would be, some on the left have started a conspiracy theory that the transcript can't be real; it must be doctored. These conspiracies aren't confined to weird corners of the internet. Democratic leaders Chuck Schumer and Adam Schiff have already questioned the trustworthiness of the transcript, despite the fact that there's no evidence of wrongdoing. Numerous career national security officials - many not fans of our president - have access to the original call and would have to be in on any conspiracy.
What's driving all this insanity? Rep. Al Green, D-Texas, has been more honest about it than most. Mr. Green admitted it straight up: "I'm concerned that if we don't impeach this president, he will get re-elected."
Lots of Democrats, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Rep. Jerry Nadler, stood up when Bill Clinton was impeached to give impassioned speeches about the perils of taking away the American people's choice.
Sadly, Ms. Pelosi and Mr. Nadler were right in 1998. Republicans should not have impeached Mr. Clinton, and they paid the price. Democrats today hate Mr. Trump. It's not about justice or truth. What they care about is winning the 2020 presidential election. Democratic leaders have decided that impeaching Mr. Trump is essential if they're going to win next year. So they're staking everything on this bizarre, flimsy scandal that the rest of us can barelyunderstand.
Personal attacks on Mr. Trump have proven ineffective. If calling him a racist or a traitor actually worked, Hillary Clinton would be running for her re-election right about now. That's not going to work. If you want to beat Mr. Trump, make a case on the issues. He won on the issues. So make a countercase. But the geniuses can't figure that out.
In the end, the loser in this impeachment nonsense is likely to be Mr. Biden, who, you will recall, is the apparent front-runner. He's supposed to be the safe choice, the guy who's going to re-energize the Obama coalition and win back the White House. Yet Democrats have now in effect demanded that we spend the next six months talking about Mr. Biden and his son's alleged corruption. That's what's at the core of this Ukraine story.
The issues aren't really complicated. Why in the world would a Ukrainian company pay Hunter Biden $50,000 a month? We still haven't heard an answer. If we're talking about Ukraine and impeachment, we're talking about Mr. Biden's alleged corruption. That can't help his campaign for president. In fact, it's likely to tank it. It looks like sabotage, really. They must have gamed this up. Or maybe Democrats have just become so obsessed with destroying Mr. Trump that they're accidentally destroying themselves.

Texto completo: Martha Long opened a Tupperware bin three years ago in the shed behind her family's cabin in the Maine woods. She was rummaging through family records and photos, preparing to celebrate her father's 80th birthday.
That's when she stumbled upon two neat piles of letters, carefully bound in twine. Handwritten by her grandparents during their courtship in 1927, the 100-plus letters were laced with their beliefs, passions and dreams. Never mind that John Leslie had just turned 22 and Marion Jean Savage was 19.
"How mature and ardent they were at such a young age," said Long, 51, a school psychologist who lives in Wayzata. "I sat down to start reading. For me, they were impossible to put down. Eventually, someone ... found me on the floor of the shed, lost in those letters."
Since then, she's found time to transcribe the letters and organize them into a 25-page booklet of theme-sorted excerpts and snapshots. Long is a mother of twin seniors in high school, whom she lovingly calls "screenagers." She marvels at the difference between today's texters and her grandparents' eloquence in that long-gone era of letter writing.
In one example, written just months after Charles Lindbergh's ballyhooed first transatlantic flight, Leslie discusses his "plans for breaking into the airplane game" when he completes his master's degree in aeronautical engineering at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He will eventually became a vice president at Pan Am Airlines and, from 1929 to 1970, play a major role from early commercial transoceanic commercial flights to introducing Boeing 747s.
"We are shooting at 'something big,' " he tells Savage in 1927, explaining how he hopes to differentiate himself from other emerging businessmen.
"I'm not ashamed at all to admit that I want money and power," he writes. "But I like to think that I can get what I want in a sporting way … without giving up all the other things I look forward to -- a happy home life, good health, leisure time, fishing trips."
He describes his budding business philosophy -- "that is, developing a steel-like sense of determination and self-confidence then covering it up with the soft velvet of courtesy, tact, and generosity."
Both children of Lake Minnetonka privilege, John Leslie and Jean, as everyone called Savage, met in the summer of '27 when he piloted his father's elegant power boat from Brown's Bay near their home in Orono to her family's dock on Robinson's Bay. Initially unimpressed, she warmed up on moonlit cruises that summer until he returned east to MIT after earning his undergraduate degree from Princeton.
That's when the letters began going back and forth, leading to their engagement in 1928 and wedding at the Princeton chapel in 1929. Those events prompted society-page stories in the Minneapolis Star, the Minneapolis Sunday Tribune and the New York Times.
After all, one of Jean's ancestors fought in the Revolutionary War, and her grandfather (and namesake) Marion Savage made a fortune selling livestock feed. He's most famous for owning fabled racehorse Dan Patch, which prompted the Minnesota River town near his farm to rename itself Savage.
Leslie also came from money -- paper money. His father founded a wholesale paper company in 1892.
Their love letters gradually picked up steam between Wayzata and Boston as autumn turned to winter in 1927.
"I am honored, my dear, at your willingness to share with me through your letters your hopes, wishes, and ideals," Jean wrote. "Your trust in me and mine in yourself will do much to bring us together. I hope that you will always find me a friend."
Responded John: "I love you so deeply, so … serenely and with so much respect. You're a gentlewoman, my dear -- and you've an intelligence and a character that is your own; I respect that. … I have hardly ever dared hope that I might one day find in any girl such a wonderful balance of emotion and reason as I have in you."
Jean replied: "Dearest, there are so many things I leave unsaid in these more or less formal letters to you. It is hard to write -- to make you feel my happiness and pride and joy in the love and friendship you have given me."
The 1,400 miles between them, at times, seemed too much.
"Patience certainly must be a virtue -- I need some tonight," John wrote. " It's so darned aggravating, sitting here writing you instead of really being with you -- I sometimes feel like throwing things. … I'm so darn anxious to see you again -- to do the things that we mutually enjoy -- to feel you near me."
Their 52-year marriage produced four kids and 16 grandchildren and saw Jean gracefully care for John after a polio attack in 1950 left him in a wheelchair. She died in 2000, at 92 -- 18 years after John. They're buried side by side at Lakewood Cemetery in Minneapolis.
"More striking to me, in these letters, is how clearly John and Jean know themselves and what they want in life," their granddaughter said.
Curt Brown's tales about Minnesota's history appear each Sunday. Readers can send him ideas and suggestions at mnhistory@startribune.com. His latest book looks at 1918 Minnesota, when flu, war and fires converged: http://strib.mn/MN1918.
HE SAID, SHE SAID
In more than 100 letters written in 1927, a young couple who met on Lake Minnetonka -- John Leslie and Marion Jean Savage -- share their love that will span 52 years of marriage. Here's a brief sampling:
"John, I am happy in the knowledge of your love and in my own for you. Whatever may happen in the future I shall have known the happiness of peace inspired by your gentleness and love of all that is beautiful."
John responds:
"I marvel rather humbly at it all, and wonder how I deserve it -- and then start trying to be worthy of you. It rather worries me to be told that I have so many fine qualities when I know how just frail and rotten I am in so many ways -- but on the other hand, it thrills me to have so much to live up too. You are so very close to my heart, so utterly dear to me that I simply can't help thinking of us as one."

401(k) investors: Here's how to create your strongest retirement portfolio now

Texto completo: U. S stocks have trounced overseas markets in 2019, extending a dominance that has lasted for years. But why should you care?
Because if you want the strongest possible retirement portfolio this late in a bull market, you should look deeper into these trends and consider blending stocks from around the world.
Most people claim foreign stocks lag U. S. shares because of Europe’s lousy economy and political drama, or because of tariffs. That's an alluring story, but wrong. U. S. leadership is all about tech.
Strip out tech and techlike communications stocks and U. S. stock returns closely match Europe. Through late September, U. S. stocks were up 21% year-to-date, versus Continental Europe’s 16%. Exclude tech and that gap narrows — 18% for the U. S. and 16% for Europe.
Will debt doom America? Will our obligations bring us down?
Cars have a problem: They last longer, and automakers are scrambling
Europe simply doesn’t have enough tech to lead when tech is winning globally. About 22% of the market value of the Standard & Poor's 500 index is Tech. Only 7. 5% of the MSCI Europe index, excluding the U. K. , is tech.
Europe doesn't have many techlike, non-tech stocks, either.
In America, many techlike stocks live in the S&P 500's new Communication Services sector. Formed last year, it blends telecom, media and entertainment. When created, it took Facebook and Google and plopped them in a category called “Interactive Media & Services. ”
Now, Communication Services is 10. 5% of U. S. market capitalization. Almost half of that is tech-like. European Communication Services is only 4. 5% of MSCI Europe, excluding the U. K. , and nearly all of that is telecom — not at all techlike.
That difference matters. Year-to-date, America’s Communication Services sector is up 24%. Europe’s? Just 2%.
So target American tech and techlike names. You’ll find a smattering in Consumer Discretionary (like Amazon) as well as Communication Services.
Add some American non-tech names for diversity, but get much of that outside America. How?
Emphasize stock types that usually shine late in a bull market’s life. Skip small, cheap companies with high dividend yields. Instead, you want “growth” stocks — firms with rising revenue and profits, brand names everyone knows, diverse product lines and huge global presence. Big, high-quality stocks.
Relative to sectors and industries, those that have led this year probably keep leading for the remainder of this bull. That’s how it usually works. Those that have lagged lately probably keep lagging irregularly. Here, too, look within sectors to find the best stocks.
Take health care. European health care stocks are overall beating the world over the past year. But not all health care was created equal. European health care equipment & supplies are actually down, not up. So are European health care providers. The real magic is happening in European pharmaceuticals. So go shopping there.
Take the same approach to consumer discretionary stocks. Avoid European automakers. They’re lagging badly due to last year’s emissions standards overhaul and a global auto sales slowdown. Instead, own textiles, apparel and luxury goods companies. The latter is almost half of the sector’s market value in Continental Europe and is up 20. 6% over the past two years. It benefits from big spending in China, India and other areas with an ascending middle class. Case in point: the luxury legend LVMH Moët Hennessy – Louis Vuitton, the creation of France’s richest man, Bernard Arnault. You would think it was a tech stock from its strength.
Energy should also do well down the stretch. The broad sector lags, but Europe’s oil and gas drillers are very strong, outperforming global stocks’ return. And they should keep humming as oil bounces around.
I’m less optimistic on industrials, consumer staples and utilities, but don’t avoid them. Always own small positions in sectors you disfavor — a saving grace if you’re wrong.

Corporate executives throw stockholders under the bus

Texto completo: The new diktat declares all "stakeholders" equal —
leaving corporate moguls, our
enlightened visionary betters, to decide how to serve many masters and balance everyone's interests via corporate actions.
Recently, our big national corporate leaders have provided a perfect example of how political and economic behavior masquerades as public-spirited when it's really completely self-serving. The Business Roundtable, an association of chief executive officers of America's largest companies, issued a new "Statement of the Purpose of a Corporation," signed by 181 CEOs.
"While each of our individual companies serves its own corporate purpose, we share a fundamental commitment to all of our stakeholders," they say. They name those stakeholders: customers, employees, diversity and inclusion interests, suppliers, the communities where they work, environmental and sustainability proponents. Oh, yes, also "effective engagement with" company stockholders.
Since 1997, their periodic "Principles of Corporate Governance" statements have endorsed shareholder primacy: the idea that corporations exist primarily to serve stockholders. In the New York Times Magazine in 1970, economist Milton Friedman, one of the intellectual giants of the 20th century, said business executives who pursue a goal other than making money for their equity investors are wrong ("The Social Responsibility of Business is to Increase Its Profits," Sept. 13, 1970). They are, he said, "unwitting puppets of the intellectual forces that have been undermining the basis of a free society these past decades." They become "unelected government officials" who essentially tax employees and customers. They violate their legal and ethical fiduciary duties.
But the new diktat declares all "stakeholders" equal — leaving corporate moguls, our enlightened visionary betters, to decide how to serve many masters and balance everyone's interests via corporate actions.
The concept of corporate stakeholders arose over 50 years ago. Originally, it was descriptive: It described groups affected by actions of corporations. But once the term was invented, it morphed into a normative concept suggesting the stakeholders have some kinds of claims on the decisions of companies and their leaders that legitimately compete with the fiduciary duties owed to those who put their capital at risk by investing in the firm.
Now the CEOs have thrown in the towel and joined these predatory special-interest claimants. Why?
It's something I've observed the last 40 years in regulation, politics and business. Essentially, executives are — surprise! — pursuing their own self-serving interests. They want to be lionized everywhere as great leaders, compassionate souls, visionary intellectuals. They want to be invited to dine with the governor, serve on the opera and major charity boards, do guest spots on TV. They want to use the resources their stockholders have entrusted to them to buy off everyone: unions, politicians, predatory special interests such as environmentalists and the press.
Maximizing long-term discounted stockholder value within ethical norms crimps those aspirations.
This rot is clearest with regulated utilities, where executives can cut implicit (sometimes explicit) deals with regulators: We'll do almost any foolish thing you want us to, as long as we can pass on the costs to ratepayers.
But other firms have also learned to curry favor with government, media and special interests that might otherwise criticize them. So, they get policy favors, as well as direct subsidies. Plus little criticism about the CEOs' excessive pay packages and other job perks. And no picketers in front of their homes.
The problem started a century ago when large corporations were no longer managed by their primary owners, but instead by hired professional managers with their own self-serving agendas. Ironically, consumers, employees and the real public interest in economic growth and fairness suffer with stockholders in this scheme. Friedman was more right than he knew.

Texto completo: When I invited a few friends to tag along for dinner at Maiz, a Colombian street food restaurant that opened this April after two years upstairs at Portland's Public Market, they pulled out their phones to look up the restaurant's website. Then, almost in unison, they asked: "What's an arepa?"
I stumbled a bit, first describing it like a fatter, stuffable corn tortilla, then settled on asking them to picture what might happen if a pancake, pita and cornbread got together to co-parent a griddled, gluten-free baby.
Once I started visiting the boldly hued, counter-service-only restaurant, I realized my friends were asking the wrong question: How you eat an arepa at Maiz is the real issue.
Just ask the girl at an adjacent table during my second visit. She picked up a compostable fork (all single-use materials at Maiz are compostable) and proceeded to deliver a tutorial on how to prepare an arepa for consumption.
"Mommy, now watch me," she commanded, plunging the tines and handle of her fork deep into the center of the filled arepa, then muscling it up and down, side to side, as if unclogging a drain. "Now you can eat. Just be careful. I made a hole," she said, pushing a distended corn flap back into place, only to dislodge pico de gallo from another, an inch away. "Oops," she giggled.
Her method might have been messy, but the kid was onto something. And clearly, I wasn't the only one left scratching my head over how Maiz assembles their arepas.
Through a slit at the top, co-owner and kitchen manager Niky Watler's staff spoon fillings inside, packing them like the stratified deposits in an archaeological dig. Start at the top of the chicken-filled Basico ($9.45), and you'll unearth freshly chopped pico de gallo that spills over the side, followed by a layer of juicy, curry-spiced chicken breast, then a soggy bottom layer comprising nothing but melted mozzarella and feta cheeses.
Until I saw my young neighbor MacGyver a solution, I figured it must be impossible to eat an arepa without chewing through each discrete layer in succession. I tried the fork-and-knife method, levering off the side of the arepa, then swirling all the fillings together before slicing it like a pizza. It worked, but the flimsy paper liner on my basket shredded as I cut. I must have eaten half the sheet.
When I emailed a Colombian friend - a lifelong BogotÃ  resident who spends each January in Cartagena, where Watler hails from - she described arepas where every bite yields a mouthful of all the fillings at once. It sounded like heaven.
And yet, even a frustrating arepa can still be pretty great.
Best of the bunch is the Upgrade ($10.60) - a version that starts with the same foundation as the chicken-filled Basico and adds an extra layer of sweet, slow-roasted pork shoulder. "That's for people who can't make up their minds if they feel like chicken or pork," general manager and co-owner Martha Leonard said with a laugh.
Of the seven house sauces Maiz offers as accompaniments, the yogurt-tempered fire of the Suerito and the ultra-garlicky, aioli-esque Ajo sauce work best with its meat-filled arepas.
On vegetarian arepas like the hearty corn, avocado and tender black-bean-filled Beans Please ($9.75), or the bland stewed cauliflower-and-chickpea Veg. Overload ($10.60) opt for something brighter, like spicy, scallion-based Verduritas that injects a necessary shot of vibrancy into the dish.
Those sauces (as well as the sweet-tart Roja Dulce) also offer an extra kick to deep-fried cornmeal empanadas ($5) filled with a rotating selection of stuffings. The pulled pork version I tasted was so good, I didn't even mind that it was the only variety available on each of my three recent visits.
Indeed, figuring out what's on offer at Maiz can be tricky. I would have liked to try the Beet The Heat, a coffee-rubbed beet salad, or the North Spore mushroom arepa - both listed on the permanent menu as specials - but neither was available. Platanos maduros (sweet plantains, $5) were similarly an on-again, off-again menu item. One server on my first visit even told me, "We don't sell those anymore." I didn't see her on my next visit, so I tried my luck and was rewarded with a golden, baked plantain split down the center to allow for a molten stream of melted mozzarella cheese. Sadly for me, I have yet to encounter another plantain at Maiz.
"We don't do those specials all the time," Martha Leonard said. "The platanos maduros have to be at the peak of ripeness - it's dependent on the food item, and we can't do anything to speed them up. That's what happens when you're small and you do everything by hand. And sometimes things just sell out on a specific day." They certainly deserve to.
Just like the choclo ($5), a softer, more pancake-like take on the arepa, made with milk and topped with more of Maiz's signature feta-and-mozzarella blend. Almost a dessert, this sweet-savory treat is one of Maiz's staff favorites as well. "Oh man, you haven't lived until you've eaten a choclo," one counter staffer replied when I asked for appetizer recommendations.
"But the real story is over here," he said, patting the top of the glass-and-chrome oven housing three lonely-looking rolls. They turned out to be the best thing I tasted at Maiz: pan de bono ($3.25), a springy quick bread bun made from cheese, yucca and corn flours. You may already be familiar with its lighter, more open-crumbed sibling, Brazil's pao de queijo - a bread that, thanks to its lack of gluten, made the rounds as a pass-around hors d'oeuvre at nearly every institutional gala in the mid-2010s.
But don't confuse the two. The Colombian version is dense, with a spongy texture like a savory cheese mochi, its self-generating exterior crust delicate and crumbly as it is torn. Dip pan de bono in one of Maiz's sauces - floral cilantro blitzed with oil or even the Rosada, essentially a blend of ketchup and mayonnaise - or just eat it plain. No premeal machinations required.

Texto completo: President Trump told two senior Russian officials in a 2017 Oval Office meeting that he was unconcerned about Moscow's interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election because the United States did the same in other countries, an assertion that prompted alarmed White House officials to limit access to the remarks to an unusually small number of people, according to three former officials with knowledge of the matter.
The comments, which have not been previously reported, were part of a now-infamous meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak, in which Trump revealed highly classified information that exposed a source of intelligence on the Islamic State. He also said during the meeting that firing FBI Director James B. Comey the previous day had relieved "great pressure" on him.
A memorandum summarizing the meeting was limited to all but a few officials with the highest security clearances in an attempt to keep the president's comments from being disclosed publicly, according to the former officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive matters.
The White House's classification of records about Trump's communications with foreign officials is now a central part of the impeachment inquiry launched this week by House Democrats. An intelligence community whistleblower has alleged that the White House placed a record of Trump's July 25 phone call with Ukraine's president, in which he offered U.S. assistance investigating his political opponents, into a code-word classified system reserved for the most sensitive intelligence information.
The White House did not provide a comment Friday.
It is not clear whether a memo documenting the May 10, 2017, meeting with Lavrov and Kislyak was placed into that system, but the three former officials said it was restricted to a very small number of people. The White House had recently begun limiting the records of Trump's calls after remarks he made to the leaders of Mexico and Australia appeared in news reports. The Lavrov memo was restricted to an even smaller group, the former officials said.
A fourth former official, who did not recall the president's remarks to the Russian officials, said memos were restricted only to people who needed to know their contents.
"It was more about learning how can we restrict this in a way that still informs the policy process and the principals who need to engage with these heads of state," the fourth former official said.
But the three former officials with knowledge of the remarks said some memos of the president's communications were kept from people who might ordinarily have access to them. The Lavrov memo fit that description, they said.
White House officials were particularly distressed by Trump's election remarks because it appeared the president was forgiving Russia for an attack that had been designed to help elect him, the three former officials said. Trump also seemed to invite Russia to interfere in other countries' elections, they said.
The previous day, Trump had fired Comey amid the FBI's investigation into whether the Trump campaign had coordinated with Russia. White House aides worried about the political ramifications if Trump's comments to the Russian officials became public.
Trump had publicly ridiculed the Russia investigation as politically motivated and said he doubted Moscow had intervened in the election. By the time he met with Lavrov and Kislyak, Trump had been briefed by the most senior U.S. intelligence officials about the Russian operation, which was directed by Russian President Vladimir Putin and included the theft and publication of Democratic emails and the seeding of propaganda in social media, according to the findings of the U.S. intelligence community.
Trump's firing of Comey touched off an investigation into whether the president had tried to obstruct the FBI's probe. His comments about Comey's dismissal being a relief, which were first reported the same month by the New York Times, reinforced suspicions that Trump dismissed Comey because the FBI was investigating him.
According to the fourth former official, Trump lamented to Lavrov that "all this Russia stuff" was detrimental to good relations. Trump also complained, "I could have a great relationship with you guys, but you know, our press," this former official said, characterizing the president's remarks.
H.R. McMaster, the president's then-national security adviser, repeatedly told Trump he could not trust the Russians, according to two former officials.
On some areas, Trump conveyed U.S. policy in a constructive way, such as telling the Russians that their aggression in Ukraine was not good, one of those former officials said.
"What was difficult to understand was how they got a free pass on a lot of things - election security and so forth," this former official said. "He was just very accommodating to them."
The former official observed that Trump has "that streak of moral equivalency," recalling how he once dismissed a question about the assassination of journalists and dissidents in Putin's Russia by telling Fox News's Bill O'Reilly: "There are a lot of killers. You think our country's so innocent?"
Another former official said Trump wasn't the only one to conflate Russia's interference in the U.S. elections with U.S. efforts to promote democracy and good governance abroad.
The president and his top aides seemed not to understand the difference between Voice of America, a U.S.-supported news organization that airs in foreign countries, with Russian efforts to persuade American voters by surreptitiously planting ads in social media, this person said.
One former senior official said Trump regularly defended Russia's actions, even in private, saying no country is pure. "He was always defensive of Russia," this person said, adding the president had never made such a specific remark about interference in their presence.
"He thought the whole interference thing was ridiculous. He never bought into it."

FBI reportedly investigating NJ tax breaks

Texto completo: FBI agents in Philadelphia are investigating New Jersey's tax-break policies, which are also the center of a task force created by Gov. Phil Murphy formed earlier this year, the Philadelphia Inquirer reported.
The Inquirer cited multiple anonymous sources but reported that interviews of witnesses started a month ago and focused on development in Camden.
The revelations of federal agents investigating the tax breaks, which were used heavily under former former Gov. Chris Christie, also follow a steady stream of news reports raising questions about how the programs were administered and how companies took advantage of them.
The New York Times reported earlier in the week that a dozen companies had threatened to leave New Jersey for the same building complex in New York if they did not receive tax breaks. But they never did, and many of them never seriously considered moving to the Blue Hill Plaza in Pearl River, New York, located just a half-mile from the New Jersey border in Bergen County.
New Jersey's two major tax credit programs were designed to encourage businesses to create jobs and to invest in the Garden State, and Christie, a Republican, and many Democrats who supported the incentives have defended them as essential tools to compete with neighboring states.
The programs expired in July, but were already at the center of scrutiny before Philadelphia authorities reportedly joined the fray. The Attorney General's office in New Jersey has also been looking into the incentives, and the state comptroller issued a damning audit of the incentives at the beginning of the year, saying that they lacked proper controls and there was no way for the state to check if jobs were created.
Murphy's task force, led by a small team of white-collar attorneys, found in an initial report that special interests were overly influential on the creation and implementation of the credits, and that the agency doling out the awards didn't have the proper procedures in place to confirm the validity of applications worth millions of dollars in forfeited taxes.
The task force's biggest targets so far have been companies connected to George E. Norcross III, the heavily influential Democrat from South Jersey who worked closely with longtime friend Stephen Sweeney, the Democratic Senate president, and Christie on a range of policies over the years. Of nearly $11 billion in awarded tax breaks, about $1.1 billion in incentives went to those companies, all located in Camden.
One of the organizations connected to Norcross, Cooper University Hospital, has hired the high-profile attorney Abbe Lowell, according to Politico New Jersey. The hiring of Lowell, who represented U.S. Sen. Bob Menendez in his corruption trial and White House adviser Jared Kushner in the special counsel's investigation of the Donald Trump presidential campaign, could be a sign that Cooper is facing a serious legal challenge.
For his part, Christie, a former federal prosecutor, said he is "not concerned" about the investigations and that they could be a reaction to media coverage and "the circus that's been created at the State House."
At the unveiling of his new political institute at Seton Hall University on Thursday night, he referred to a 2016 investigation of Norcross by the U.S. Attorney's Office in New Jersey that concluded "no further action is warranted."
Christie, whose institute is founded on civility in politics, blasted his Democratic successor, Murphy, for putting such heavy focus on the tax incentives.
"It's political theater by a guy who understands theater and who needs a show to distract from the fact that the major things that he ran on, he simply hasn't accomplished even though he has a Legislature of his own party," Christie said.
As much as $500 million in tax incentives were subject to being suspended by the state or have been voluntarily terminated already, the task force said in its 75-page report, issued in June. But that money has since been released, according to NJ Advance Media.

Deutsche Bank Says It Has 2 Trumps' Tax Returns

Texto completo: Deutsche Bank told a federal appeals court on Friday that it had the tax returns of two members of the Trump family, but did not disclose their identities.
The German bank -- long President Trump's primary lender -- is caught in a legal battle between Mr. Trump and congressional Democrats, who have issued subpoenas for financial documents connected to the president, his family and his businesses.
Last month, appeals court judges asked Deutsche Bank and Capital One Bank if they had copies of tax returns that would be covered by the subpoenas, which name Mr. Trump and his three oldest children -- Donald Jr., Ivanka and Eric -- as well as Mr. Trump's company.
Capital One told the court that it did not have copies of any tax returns covered by the subpoena. Deutsche Bank said it did, but the names associated with those returns were redacted from the public version of the letter.
News organizations, including The New York Times, then asked the court to unseal Deutsche Bank's letter, and in laying out its opposition to that request, the bank disclosed that the tax returns belonged to two individuals.
"The bank has in its possession tax returns (in either draft or as-filed form) responsive to the subpoenas for two individuals, not entities, named in the subpoenas," lawyers for Deutsche Bank told the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in a filing on Friday. Lawyers for Mr. Trump also opposed the request.
The bank told the court that it was contractually obligated to preserve the confidentiality of one of those people, but that a review of contracts for the second person did not reveal any confidentiality clauses.
Deutsche Bank asked the court to provide it time to inform its clients if the court decides to unseal the letter.
The documents held by Deutsche Bank most likely contains details of how Mr. Trump made his money, who his partners have been, the terms of his extensive borrowings and other transactions.
Mr. Trump's lawyers have fought to block the subpoenas, which were issued in April by the House Intelligence and Financial Services Committees, saying they have no legitimate legislative purpose.
The Financial Services Committee says it wants to know whether Mr. Trump helped Russians and other foreign buyers launder money through his properties, and the Intelligence Committee says it is trying to determine whether Mr. Trump's financial dealings made him subject to foreign influence.

Texto completo: Former U.S. diplomat Joseph Wilson, who with outed CIA officer Valerie Plame was part of a feted Washington couple after the launch of the Iraq war, died on Friday at the age of 69.
Wilson, who was U.S ambassador to Gabon from 1992 to 1995, famously questioned the intelligence used as the Bush administration's justification for U.S.-led invasion of Iraq, and Plame was later outed as a CIA agent — which she and Wilson claimed was in reprisal.
"It is with deep sadness that I learned of the passing of a true American hero — Ambassador Joe Wilson," Plame, who divorced Wilson in 2017, said in a statement. "He had the heart of a lion and the courage to match." The couple had twins Trevor and Samantha, now 20.
Plame, 56, and Wilson, were both committed liberals. They shot to fame in 2003 when Wilson wrote in the New York Times that he believed “some of the intelligence related to Iraq's nuclear weapons program was twisted to exaggerate the Iraqi threat.” Wilson, a Democratic contributor who left the diplomatic service in 1998, endorsed John Kerry, President George W. Bush's opponent, in the 2004 election.
Conservative Washington Post columnist Robert Novak revealed Plame’s identity in a 2003 column, attributing the information to “two senior administration officials.” Plame maintained that the leak was “payback” from the Bush administration for her Wilson's article.
Lewis “Scooter” Libby, former chief of staff to Vice President Dick Cheney, was convicted in 2007 of perjury and obstruction of justice over the leak of Plame’s identity. It emerged that former Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage — a Cheney antagonist — was the primary source for Novak’s story, but Armitage was never charged. President Trump pardoned Libby in 2018, saying he was treated unfairly.
Plame and Wilson were vocal critics of the Iraq war and used their notoriety to secure lucrative book and movie deals. The glamorous couple were the subject of the 2010 movie Fair Game, which featured Naomi Watts as Plame and Sean Penn as Wilson.
They owned a sprawling two-acre estate in Santa Fe, which they unsuccessfully put on the market for $2.1 million in spring 2017. The 4,609-square-foot Pueblo style home featured 11 fireplaces, a separate guesthouse, and stunning views of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains.
Plame and Wilson first met in 1997 at a reception at the Turkish ambassador’s residence. At the time, Wilson was still married to his second wife, but by the next year he had divorced her and married Plame.
In 2007, she wrote about the strain the "outing" had put on her marriage. "It was so distorted, so twisted, and Joe was furious with me because he felt he had defended me gallantly, and I was not coming to his defense — although he understood that as an employee of the [Central Intelligence] Agency I could not speak publicly.
"It was just tearing us apart. Maybe I shouldn’t say this, but I felt the only thing that will save my marriage, is that goddamn it, I’m not going to let them have that too. We will get through this."
In 2017, Plame was forced to apologize after sharing on Twitter an anti-Semitic article from the UNZ Review entitled "America's Jews Are Driving America's Wars." The article stated that Jews "own the media," that they should wear labels while on national television, and that their beliefs were as dangerous as "a bottle of rat poison."
Her initial response was: "First of all, calm down. Re-tweets don't imply endorsement. Yes, very provocative, but thoughtful. Many neocon hawks ARE Jewish." But she later added: "OK folks, look, I messed up. I skimmed this piece, zeroed in on the neocon criticism, and shared it without seeing and considering the rest."
She later apologized and resigned from the board of the Ploughshares Fund, which provides grants for projects aimed at preventing the spread of nuclear weapons. But in the space of three years, she had posted nine UNZ articles, including one titled "Why I Still Dislike Israel" and another about "Dancing Israelis" on 9/11.
Plame has been an outspoken critic of President Trump, launching a GoFundMe effort to buy a stake so she could ban Trump. It raised $89,719 toward its $1 billion goal. She has been active in Democratic politics since moving to Santa Fe in 2007. She hosted a fundraiser for Hillary Clinton’s super PAC in 2014 and another fundraiser for Clinton’s presidential campaign in 2015.

Wilson, the diplomat who disputed pre-war intelligence on Iraq and endured retribution, has died. He was 69. Valerie Plame confirmed in a text message that Wilson died Friday of organ failure in Santa Fe, N.M. She called him a patriot with the heart of a lion. Wilson's denial of pre-war intelligence under the administration of President George W. Bush touched off retribution against Plame and a criminal cover-up.

Texto completo: SANTA FE, N.M. — Joe Wilson, a diplomat whose public questioning of whether the George W. Bush administration was manipulating intelligence before the Iraq War set off a firestorm that engulfed his then CIA-operative wife, has died at age 69 in Santa Fe.
Valerie Plame, Wilson’s former spouse, posted Friday on Facebook: “It is with deep sadness that I share with you the passing of an American hero – Ambassador Joe Wilson. He had the heart of a lion. He was the father of four beautiful children and I wish him nothing but peace in his next journey.”
In a subsequent statement, she added: “As a patriot, Joe had the courage to write an Op Ed that told the truth about the justification for the Iraq war because he knew that with the privilege of citizenship comes great responsibility.”
“He is already deeply and painfully missed,” she added.
Wilson wrote a New York Times op-ed in 2003 that attacked Bush’s claim that Iraq’s former President Saddam Hussein had purchased the makings for a nuclear weapon. Wilson had traveled to Niger for the CIA to investigate whether Saddam had purchased uranium yellowcake.
In retribution, the Bush administration leaked to a journalist that Wilson’s spouse Plame was an undercover CIA operative, setting off a political scandal.
An aide to former Vice President Dick Cheney, I. Lewis “Scooter” Libby, was convicted of obstruction of justice and lying to investigators following the 2003 leak of Plame’s identity. Libby was pardoned last year by President Donald Trump.
Plame and Wilson moved to Santa Fe several years ago. Plame is now running for the U.S. House seat in New Mexico’s 3rd Congressional District.
U.S Rep. Ben Ray Luján, the 3rd District incumbent who is running for a Senate seat next year, issued a statement calling Wilson “a friend and fellow New Mexican for whom I had deep respect.”
“Ambassador Wilson was a devoted patriot who put country and duty before politics and who had the courage to speak the truth in the face of extreme criticism.” Luján said. “With his passing, our country lost a faithful public servant.
“Today, my thoughts and prayers are with Joe’s family and friends. He will be missed by all those who loved and respected him.”
U.S. Sen. Martin Heinrich, D-NM, said, “Joe Wilson was a dear friend and a true statesman dedicated to serving our country at home and abroad. My thoughts are with his family as they mourn Joe’s passing and we honor his incredible legacy of public service.”
U.S. Sen. Tom Udall, D-N.M, said Wilson “was a true public servant and statesman who stood up for his country with courage and dignity.”
“His service to our country will live on and inspire others to serve with the same honor and purpose that he carried forward throughout his life,” Udall added
Many tributes to Wilson were posted on line.
New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof tweeted: “Joe Wilson, who challenged Pres. Bush’s narrative about Iraq seeking uranium, is dead at 69. Joe first told me the story of his trip to Niger and let me write about it without using his name. When officials denied it, he went public. RIP, brave man.”
U.S. Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., tweeted: “Karma, man. The day after the most famous executive branch whistleblower complaint since Joe Wilson comes to light, Joe Wilson passes. I got to know him a bit — he was indeed a hero of his times.”

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — The Democratic National Committee plans to hold the October presidential debate over just one night, setting up a stage packed with 12 candidates for the first time this year.
“Pending a final decision after the certification deadline, it is the intention of the DNC and our media partners to hold the October debate over one night on Tuesday, Oct. 15,” party officials wrote in an email Friday.
CNN and The New York Times will be hosting the debate, which will air live at 8 p. m. ET from the campus of Otterbein University in Westerville, Ohio.
The following candidates will appear on stage together:
Former Vice President Joe Biden
Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey
South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg
Former HUD Secretary Julián Castro
Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii
Sen. Kamala Harris of California
Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota
Former Rep. Beto O'Rourke of Texas
Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont
Tom Steyer, billionaire and activist
Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts
Andrew Yang, entrepreneur
Other candidates have until Oct. 1 to qualify, but it appears unlikely any others will meet the qualifications of receiving 2 percent support in four DNC-approved polls and donations from 130,000 unique donors.
Gabbard and Steyer are additions to this stage from the September debate, where only 10 candidates faced off.
Despite Gabbard qualifying, she criticized the DNC over it’s debate criteria Friday, saying that “there’s been a lack of transparency in that whole process about which polls are selected, which aren’t, which they’re seeing as qualifying, which ones are actually polling. ”
The DNC recently released more difficult requirements candidates must meet to qualify for the November debates, setting up the possibility that several additional candidates may miss the stage compared to the upcoming October matchup, and potentially ending some campaigns.

Texto completo: The whistleblower whose bombshell report set off an impeachment inquiry into President Trump is reportedly a CIA officer who at one point worked at the White House.
The whistleblower has returned to the CIA since the report emerged, The New York Times on Thursday quoted "people familiar with his identity as saying.
No other details about the whistleblower were known, though the Times noted that attributes of his report suggested he was trained as an analyst and had deep knowledge of U.S. policy on Europe.
The new details emerged as members of the House Intelligence Committee were grilling acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire (inset).
The whistleblower's lawyer, Mark Zaid, said publication of the new details "will place this individual in a much more dangerous situation.
"Publishing details about the whistleblower will only lead to identification of someone, whether our client or the wrong person, as the whistleblower," the attorney said.

A teaching moment

Texto completo: On Sept. 15, Turner Classic Movies rolled out its weekly edition of "Silent Sunday Nights" with a 1927 comedy, "Two Arabian Knights."
The film was considered lost for decades until it turned up in the collection of producer Howard Hughes along with the Chicago-set underworld melodrama "The Racket" (also from 1927) and other titles. For many TCM fans, this was a discovery, one of many such finds on TCM in any given month.
And so was the Chicago woman introducing it.
In Chicago, and in national film preservation and history circles, Jacqueline Stewart made a name for herself long ago. She's a professor at the University of Chicago department of Cinema and Media Studies.
Earlier this month Stewart, 49, was appointed director of the UChicago Arts initiative known as Arts + Public Life, an ambitious, far-flung series of projects and brick-and-mortar facilities connecting South Side communities with various arts programs. Stewart also directs the South Side Home Movie Project and, at the Harper Theater in Hyde Park, Cinema 53, a screening and discussion program.
Film history, especially the history of African-American cinema, holds a special interest to this Hyde Park native. In 2016 Stewart appeared on TCM in a discussion of "Pioneers of African-American Cinema," a hefty DVD collection of rare early-20th-century work. She went on to live appearances at the 2018 and 2019 TCM Film Festival in Hollywood. And now she's the host of "Silent Sunday Nights."
When the announcement came Sept. 9, the vast majority of online and print headlines from east to west, from The New York Times to the Los Angeles Times and points in between, framed Stewart's TCM hosting gig the same way: as the venerable film channel's first on-air, ongoing African-American presence.
On Twitter, the repository of all that is supportive and venal about our national cultural discourse, the love poured in along with a few haters and skeptics. A lot of the love came with no little frustration. A typical tweet carrying the #JacquelineStewart hashtag: "It's 2019 and it took #TCM this long to hire an African American host?? Shame on you!"
On Wednesday, I met with Stewart to talk about TCM and the response.
"I mean, obviously it feels very late in our history to celebrate the first African American anything," she told me. "And yet, when we look at what's happening across our culture, we've had a lot of significant black firsts only recently: the Obama presidency, Lonnie Bunch appointed as head of the Smithsonian Institution (and) Elizabeth Alexander running the Mellon Foundation. This is significant movement! And it demonstrates that there are lot of incredibly talented people ready to move into all kinds of roles if someone at the very top flips the switch."
The first-black-host language phrasing, Stewart reflected, "is something of a double-edged thing. But it's a necessary double-edged thing. We should celebrate these firsts."
Added Gil Robertson, president of the African-American Film Critics Association based in Los Angeles: "This speaks to TCM's commitment to recognizing diverse audiences. As an academic she's offering a different take on these films, and all kinds of films. She brings a lot of value to this role that may, in time, expand. At least I hope it does."
Stewart and I met at Peach's at Currency Exchange Cafe, a terrific component of the radically transforming "Arts Block," thanks primarily to UChicago, underneath the Green Line "L" on East Garfield Boulevard in the Washington Park neighborhood.
There's a lot of well-spent university money invested in this block. On the corner of Garfield Boulevard and Prairie Avenue sits the renovated two-story Arts Incubator, realized by Theaster Gates and now overseen by Stewart.
"We need more spaces for community engagement with South Siders," Stewart said. "For so long, this side of Washington Park has been like an ocean between the university and the surrounding communities. But we're starting to build bridges."
Hosting TCM's "Silent Sunday Nights" represents a different kind of arts and public life, with Stewart expanding her national role in cinema history and awareness. The TCM marketing team has been typically savvy about introducing its newest host and letting her be the vibrant, engaging cinema studies educator on camera. In Atlanta a few weeks ago she filmed her first batch of TCM intros -- three months' work of weekly appearances.
And this Sunday night the 1912 version of "Cleopatra," with turn-of-the-century stage star Helen Gardner as the Egyptian queen, airs at 11:45 p.m. Chicago time, intro'd and outro'd by Professor Stewart.

Texto completo: A friend recently shared his concern about the level and extent of hate in this country. His dismay echoed mine and that of many others. The Progressives seem almost totally unrestrained in their effort to regain power.
The New York Times printed a completely unsubstantiated allegation of sexual abuse against Justice Kavanaugh from 30 years or so ago. In fact the person allegedly abused has no recollection of the incident. The allegation had been previously ignored by both the Washington Post and the Senate considering his nomination to the Supreme Court.
Luna County has long had more registered Democrats than Republicans, although I think the disparity is easing somewhat recently. In my opinion and experience Luna County Democrats are more conservative than Democrats elsewhere and far more rational and pragmatic than Progressives.
Maybe it is the rural nature of the county or the influence of farmers, ranchers, and Hispanic families. I don't routinely see the kind of hate here that is reflected in the Internet headlines, although there are surely some very partisan opinions expressed at McDonald's and elsewhere.
Anti-Semitism, a symptom of greater problems of societal discord, seems to be growing. There is the White Supremacist/Neo-Nazi kind of hate of the so-called alt-right and increasingly the hate of the extreme left, often trying to mask itself as anti-Zionist or anti-Israel hate.
The reflexive Muslim hostility to Jews is a fairly recent phenomenon of the last 70 years or so. The loathing of Trump and his followers is, of course, recent. However, Trump Derangement Syndrome was preceded by Bush Derangement Syndrome.
There seems to be a rational sequence for irrational Trump hate that echoes Sharansky. They demonize Trump employing double standards so they can delegitimize his Presidency. They seem also to wish to delegitimize the Constitution and conservative opinion and perspectives in the courts and in the schools and in the media, including social media. They rewrite history.
Dealing with hate is challenging. We can all try to be more civil and respectful in our discourse and actions. There would seem to come a time, however, when being tolerant of intolerance becomes suicidal. Can we demand that the ignorant become more informed, the stupid raise their IQ's, and those caught up in mindless emotion become more rational? That doesn't seem like it would do much good.
I am asking for a little help here. Is it only my imagination that we have become more hateful? Does anyone out there have any suggestions on how we can reduce the level and intensity of animosity? Please email me at frheacox@gmail.com with any ideas. I hope reflection will cause us all to be more mindful of the temptation to hate and more sensitive to the opportunities to work together for the common good.

Texto completo: The legislation would give lawmakers an additional two months to iron out differences in the 12 spending bills needed to keep the government funded.
WASHINGTON -- Congress on Thursday gave final approval to a short-term spending bill that would punt the threat of a government shutdown to just before Thanksgiving, giving lawmakers an additional two months to resolve their differences over paying for President Trump's policies.
The measure ensures that all federal agencies and departments, as well as a number of health care and community programs, will maintain their funding through Nov. 21, just before Congress is scheduled to depart Washington for its Thanksgiving break. The Senate voted 82 to 15 to pass the bill, clearing it for the White House just days before funding was set to expire on Oct. 1. Mr. Trump is expected to sign it.
"That's the easy part," Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the minority leader, said Thursday in a floor speech. "The hard part is getting a bipartisan appropriations process back on track."
That task promises to be a difficult one, given bitter differences between Democrats and Republicans over several elements of Mr. Trump's agenda, none more acute than the disputes over financing construction of a wall on the southwestern border, and his immigration policies.
Ahead of the vote, the lawmakers tasked with producing the dozen annual spending bills tussled over efforts to allocate $ 5 billion for the border wall.
The funding is part of the bill funding the Department of Homeland Security, which allocates money for carrying out the administration's hard-line immigration policies. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved the bill for a vote on the floor, with only one Democrat, Senator Joe Manchin III of West Virginia, joining Republicans to advance it.
"This bill does present challenges, as we all know," said Senator Shelley Moore Capito, the West Virginia Republican in charge of the subcommittee that crafted the homeland security legislation. She assured her colleagues that the other agencies within the department -- including the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the Coast Guard and the Secret Service -- would be adequately funded.
But Senator Jon Tester of Montana, the subcommittee's top Democrat, reminded his colleagues that the president has redirected funds from across government agencies to the southwestern border wall, asking, "Why are we rewarding these tactics with another $ 5 billion?" The panel rejected the amendment to remove that money from the legislation, with Republicans arguing that the money would also provide for roads, gates, cameras and sensors as well as additional fencing.
Mr. Tester, along with his Democratic colleagues, unsuccessfully pushed to add language that would prevent money for military construction projects from being diverted to the border wall. It failed, one day after the Senate approved a resolution to terminate the national emergency that Mr. Trump has declared at the border, allowing him to take money that Congress provided for other purposes and steer it to building the wall.
"I take very seriously the role we have, as appropriators, to ensure that we are able to express the will of the legislative body and not just echo what may be requested of us," said Senator Lisa Murkowski, Republican of Alaska. But she voted -- "reluctantly," she said -- against the change, which she said belonged instead on a bill to fund military construction.
Republicans delayed a full committee hearing on that measure. Senator Brian Schatz of Hawaii said the action had been postponed because his fellow Democrats had planned to offer a similar provision to block money from being diverted to wall construction, and, he said, "we were going to prevail."
The overall process, traditionally hailed as a bipartisan one, has also been stymied in part because of disagreements over funding levels for some of the bills or what constituted so-called poison pills, partisan policy items that could prevent the legislation from garnering the necessary 60 votes on the Senate floor.
"It's no secret that we've had mixed success," said Senator Richard C. Shelby of Alabama, the chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee. "We still have a long way to go in fulfilling our duty to fund the government."
Mr. Shelby is expected to discuss the effort to pass the 12 annual bills with Mr. Trump in the coming days.
Lawmakers also unanimously agreed to send four additional spending bills to the Senate floor, though some Democratic senators signaled they would side with the Democrat-led House on some provisions when the two chambers meet to reconcile their legislation.
If members of Congress cannot reach a funding compromise with the administration, including for the Department of Homeland Security and military construction projects, they may have to resort to a stopgap spending bill for the remainder of the new fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1.
Such legislation would maintain last year's funding levels, in effect nullifying some of the spending increases negotiated in the budget agreement that congressional leaders and the administration reached this year. The July agreement established a nearly $ 1.4 trillion framework for defense and domestic programs, but the dozen bills lay out how that money will be divided across the federal government.
With the passage of the stopgap spending bill on Thursday, senators have less than two months to pass the legislation through the full chamber, negotiate a dozen bills with the House and secure the president's signature.

Texto completo: President Trump attacked the US officials who gave information to the whistle-blower on Thursday morning, according to the New York Times, claiming that whomever did it was “close to a spy."
“You know what we used to do in the old days when we were smart with spies and treason, right? We used to handle it a little differently than we do now," Trump said, according to the Times.
The president reportedly made the remarks before a gathering of American diplomats at the United Nations on Thursday.
Also Thursday, Trump traded insults with his chief critic from the House intelligence committee's hearing on a whistleblower complaint about his conduct.
Trump tweeted Thursday that committee Chairman Adam Schiff "has zero credibility" and is pushing "Another fantasy to hurt the Republican Party!"
Schiff, a Democrat, quickly responded: "I'm always flattered when I'm attacked by someone of the president's character."
Joseph Maguire, acting director of national intelligence, told the committee a whistleblower "did the right thing" by coming forward to report concerns over the White House's handling of a call between Trump and Ukraine's leader.
The complaint details a call between Trump and Ukraine's president in which Trump pressures the leader to investigate political rival Joe Biden.

Santa Anita faces existential questions as fall meet opens

Texto completo: ARCADIA — Santa Anita opens its 23-day fall meet Friday with many questions to answer, and the future of horse racing in Southern California may be at stake.
As Santa Anita opens with a nine-race program, including three graded stakes races, horse owners, trainers and the operators of Santa Anita have bigger questions than which horse runs fastest.
— Will it be a safer meet than the winter-spring season from December through June, when 30 horses died either in morning workouts or during afternoon racing?
— Will Hall of Fame trainer Jerry Hollendorfer, banned from all race tracks owned by the Stronach Group since June 22, be allowed to race horses at any time during the meet?
— Is the horse population in Southern California large enough to allow the track to follow through on its plan to hold four-day race weeks, as opposed to the three-day schedule track officials were forced to adopt during the final portion of the spring meet?
— Will racing fans stay away, from both the track and the betting windows, like happened during Del Mar’s 36-day summer meet that ended Sept. 2? Del Mar enjoyed a very safe meet, but a hangover from Santa Anita’s troubles hurt its business.
— What kind of spotlight will come with the Breeders’ Cup on Nov. 1-2? Horse racing’s biggest event also raises the pressure on Santa Anita to run a safe meet.
One thing is perfectly clear, and carries no question marks: This is the most important meet in the track’s history.
“For what’s at stake, I think absolutely (it’s the most important),” said Aidan Butler, the new acting executive director of California racing for Santa Anita’s parent company, the Stronach Group. “There are a lot of eye balls on Santa Anita, both on the positive and the negative. I think we need to put our best foot forward and make sure things are done better than they’ve ever been done historically in any country.
“The way I look at it, if this many people are interested, let’s show ’em what horse racing can do. Let’s show ’em how good horse racing, when done right, truly is.”
California governor Gavin Newsom is watching closely. He issued a scathing review of horse racing when he met with reporters from the New York Times this week.
“What happened last year was unacceptable, and all of the excuses be damned,” he told the Times. “We own that going into the next season, and we’re going to have to do something about it.
“I’ll tell you, talk about a sport whose time is up unless they reform. That’s horse racing. Incredible abuses to these precious animals and the willingness to just spit these animals out and literally take their lives is a disgrace.”
The 42-year-old Butler, a native of Great Britain who came to the Stronach Group from a Toronto law firm in 2018 and assumed his new position in early August, says he sees the need for horse racing to adapt and not conduct business as usual.
“Just because things back in the day were done a certain way and were acceptable does not mean they’ll be acceptable in today’s day and age,” he said.
For example, he cited the days when a racing fatality was treated as back-page news. The nightmare at Santa Anita has changed all of that.
“The way I actually look at it is, if a horse gets injured, everything that happened around that horse, what happened, why did it go on, that needs to be addressed, needs to be looked at,” Butler said. “This is a very fast-paced, active sport and accidents do happen. But that being said, transparency I think will set us all free. I hate to say back in the old days no one cared, well no one cared about a lot of stuff going back a few years.
“There are so many eyeballs on us now that it makes everybody wan to be better. I think if we’re going to try to grow the sport — and I’m not here to keep the status quo, I’m here to try and grow the sport — if we’re going to do that, we need to get confidence back, show (the sport) is as good and safe as can possibly be.”
Thoroughbred owner Jon Lindo is taking a wait-and-see approach, while agreeing that this is Santa Anita’s most important meet ever.
“I think it’s huge,” he said. “Right now, Santa Anita has to earn back the trust and the confidence of not only the horsemen, the owners and trainers, but the fans and the general public. The messages sent during that last meet, that was so confrontational, with the new management team in place we need to see if it’s one that everyone can work with toward a common goal.
“I mean, if this goes the wrong way, we could be out of business. That’s how important it is. It’s a short meet and unfortunately I think we’re all watching, not because we want to see the races, but we just want to see this thing go smoothly. They’ve got to earn my trust back.”
Two-time Kentucky Derby-winning trainer Doug O’Neill is taking an optimistic view.
“After the success of Del Mar (no fatalities during live racing), I can speak on the behalf of the majority of the horsemen that we’re real excited to continue it and have a real great Santa Anita,” he said. “There’s no reason why we shouldn’t.”
Is this Santa Anita’s most important meet ever?
“I haven’t thought of it in those terms,” O’Neill said, “but it’s just real important that we all work together and continue to work together, have a good open dialogue and realize we need to share in all the great times and share in all the accidental stuff.
“From what I can see, I really like the way Santa Anita is going into the meet and we’ll know more as we get going. I know we’re all optimistic that we’re going to have a heck of a meet.”
But that doesn’t mean there is no anxiety in the executive offices at Santa Anita this week. Even Del Mar officials admitted to some nervousness on the eve of their pivotal meet.
“Am I a little bit apprehensive? Of course,” Butler said. “I’ve got a few butterflies because I want everything to go as well as it should. But if preparation and hard work and having the right people around (means anything), my confidence level is pretty good.”
The Hollendorfer situation is still under review. The 73-year-old trainer with more than 7,600 lifetime victories was banned from the Stronach Group’s five race tracks — Santa Anita, Golden Gate Fields, Gulfstream Park, Laurel Park and Pimlico — after his fourth fatality at Santa Anita on June 22.
Butler would not comment on Hollendorfer, citing litigation, but he did offer a rebuttal to people who believe the Stronach Group banned Hollendorfer in an attempt to take the onus off the race track.
“There is absolutely no truth to that whatsoever,” he said. “I was involved, I was there, I was on the grounds and that was never once contemplated or thought of.”

Lakers training camp: 5 key questions as LeBron James, Anthony Davis join forces

Texto completo: After their sixth consecutive season out of the playoffs, expect the Lakers to begin training camp this weekend by talking about fresh starts and clean slates. The upcoming season might be new, but it’s not fresh or clean – the Lakers are still trying to learn from the last one.
Take Tuesday night’s appearance of LeBron James, Anthony Davis, Kyle Kuzma, Dwight Howard, Quinn Cook and Talen-Horton Tucker at a WNBA playoff game in Las Vegas. There’s subtext: The players were among the Lakers invited to Vegas by James, who is trying to do more to create team chemistry this year after the franchise strained at the seams while stumbling to a 37-45 record in his first season in L.A.
It’s a new group with the same measuring stick: A veteran-laden roster that is expected to be more competitive than last season and perhaps even bring the Lakers back to their longtime place as a title contender.
With Lakers media day scheduled for Friday morning in El Segundo, here are the top stories to follow between now and the Oct. 22 regular-season opener against the Clippers:
1. What is the balance of power between Anthony Davis and LeBron James?
James has so far insisted that Davis will be the focal point, something Davis reiterated to Yahoo Sports in an interview earlier this month: “To have a guy like LeBron, someone of his caliber, go tell management and ownership and the coaches that he wants me to be the focal point is an honor. I know what comes with that, and that’s a lot of heavy lifting. I want to be able to do that.”
Davis has been the focal point of every team he’s ever played for, but he’s yet to win big in the postseason. James has also been the focal point of every team he’s ever played for, and while signs of physical decline might be more evident in his 17th NBA season, the four-time league MVP is still going to be the one running most of the team’s plays.
There’s a natural fit to Davis’ and James’ games, particularly as pick-and-roll threats. That partnership also extends off the court, where the two men have appeared together at a variety of offseason events and share the same agent (and are slotted for starring roles in a “Space Jam” movie). But when push comes to shove, who takes the last shot? Who takes the lead in dictating habits in practice and the locker room?
There’s the matter of Davis’ leverage: He’s got just one year left on his deal, and his agent Rich Paul has promised that he will enter free agency next summer (even though the Lakers are the presumptive favorite to re-sign him). That will weigh on the minds of the team’s lead decision-makers, who must find ways to make Davis feel comfortable within the franchise. But it’s also up to James, as a co-star, to make sure the relationship remains as close as it’s appeared so far.
2. What is Frank Vogel’s stamp on the team?
The month-long process that finally led the Lakers to two-time NBA head coach Frank Vogel was a tortured one. His own introduction was overshadowed by the specter of Magic Johnson. But the 46-year-old New Jersey native has handled the awkward circumstances of his hiring as well as anyone could, outlining a bright vision for the coming season. He’s also no stranger to competing at a high level, as his best Indiana Pacers teams can attest.
The circumstances around Vogel, however, would be tricky for any coach to thread. From the politics of having two superstars, to working with an assembly of coaches who some observers have colored as possible successors, he’ll have plenty of challenges coming to L.A.
Vogel’s calling card in the past has been rugged and accountable defenses that have done just enough on offense. He’s said he’s eager to show how he’s evolved since a truncated stint in Orlando and a year-long sabbatical from coaching. But time is of the essence for Vogel to show how he can assert himself in a position that’s experienced a lot of recent turnover.
3. Who is the starting point guard?
Anyone who has watched James in the past two decades understands he will assume most of the playmaking duties. The question is who is the additional guard who starts alongside Danny Green.
There are several candidates on roughly the same footing: Rajon Rondo, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Avery Bradley, Quinn Cook and Alex Caruso. There have been few signs so far of how the Lakers plan to divine a starting guard from the mix, particularly given that there are so many different strengths on the table without a clear-cut, No. 1 option on the depth chart.
There’s a good chance that the early part of the season will see a fair amount of juggling between those options to see how they fit alongside Davis, James and everyone else.
4. What does Dwight Howard bring to the table?
No one ever argued Dwight Howard can’t make a good first impression. In a preseason conference call with reporters, the eight-time All-Star’s words rang of humility.
“My goal is just to win, there’s nothing else that matters,” he said. “Whatever I have to do to be a great teammate, whatever I have to do on the court, it’s all about winning.”
The problem is Howard is well-versed in finding the right opening lines, but he hasn’t found a way to follow through on them. Including his previous Lakers tenure, he’s been an ill fit with nearly every roster he’s been a part of, despite repeated preseason oaths that he’s changed.
The compelling part of Howard is his talent. In Charlotte for his last healthy season, he averaged 16.6 points and 12.5 rebounds. The Lakers could benefit from solid and steady production in the post, as long as Howard is ready to get with the program.
There’s no problem for the team if it goes south: Howard’s reported contract details have him on a short leash. But if the Lakers can squeeze value from him, that could add a good deal of upside to their potential.
5. Can the Lakers finally get some luck with player health?
Even the summer is not kind. DeMarcus Cousins tore his ACL in August and is likely out for the year. The New York Times reported Tuesday that Kyle Kuzma, another key component for the team, might miss part of training camp with the left foot injury that kept him out of the FIBA World Cup for Team USA.
The Lakers are already walking a perilously thin rope, even before you consider that James, 34, is coming off a season when he played the fewest games of his career, and the offseason roster moves have resulted in a significantly older squad. The practice of load management is currently en vogue after Kawhi Leonard sat out nearly a quarter of the regular season then led Toronto to the 2019 NBA title, so it’s certainly possible the Lakers could look to lessen the regular-season burden on their stars.
That could help down the road, but they have to get to the postseason first. The Lakers have to win enough games in a deep Western Conference to earn a playoff spot. Having to play any significant length of time without any of their stars could prove damning to that effort. Even though the Lakers have added a second superstar, that also means losing one of their best players would create a void that is even more difficult to replace.

A reluctant, but stalwart hero of the Brett Kavanaugh saga

Texto completo: Every good story needs a hero, and the saga of Brett Kavanaugh’s rise to the Supreme Court has provided one: Leland Keyser.
She also became a victim when her longtime friend, Christine Blasey Ford, decided to hit refresh on a decades-old high school incident that apparently only Ford remembers.
Keyser is the other female student whom Ford named as having been at the small party where Kavanaugh allegedly pinned her down on a bed and groped her. She is also the friend who swore under penalty of perjury that she doesn’t recall such a party or, in fact, ever having met Kavanaugh. Her comments echoed those of the other partygoers Ford named, none of whom remembered such a gathering.
This isn’t what places Keyser on the heroes’ roster. What earns her that distinction is her steadfastness, at great personal suffering, in refusing to change her story despite what she describes as pressure to she rethink her initial statement. According to a new book, "The Education of Brett Kavanaugh" by New York Times reporters Kate Kelly and Robin Pogrebin, some of Keyser’s erstwhile friends and acquaintances tried to persuade her to say she didn’t remember the party, not that it didn’t happen.
Keyser, reportedly a registered Democrat, has become increasingly convinced that Ford’s story isn’t true and doesn’t make sense, according to the book.
According to the book, Ford’s team of friends and advisers apparently saw Keyser as an obstacle to Ford’s narrative and brainstormed ways for her to get onboard. The book cites a group text among Ford’s acquaintances from soon after her testimony. Cheryl Amitay, who attended the same girls’ high school as Ford, wrote: "Maybe one of you guys who are friends with [Keyser] can have a heart-to-heart."
A man who had gone to a neighboring boys’ school chimed in: "Perhaps it makes sense to let everyone in the public know what her condition is." To which Amitay responded, "Leland is a major stumbling block."
Keyser, a former professional golfer who has undergone numerous operations on her back and neck, has suffered addiction during her adult life. Although recovering, she told Kelly and Pogrebin she was concerned that this history would be used against her if she didn’t come up with a more-acceptable recollection of events. When pressed, however, she refused to take the easy route and protect herself.
For her integrity and valor under perceived pressure, she has been punished. Even Ford seemed to turn on her old friend, mentioning Keyser’s "significant health challenges," during her testimony, and seeming to suggest that her friend might have diminished capacities: "I’m happy that she’s focusing on herself and getting the health treatment that she needs."
This may have been one of the sweetest condemnations in the history of tossing inconvenient friends under the bus. But, importantly, Ford planted a seed of doubt about Keyser’s credibility, which has been cultivated by the Times writers. On CNN’s "Reliable Sources" Sunday, Kelly pointed to Keyser’s "memory issues ... because she has a history of substance abuse, which she acknowledges."
Oof. What a gut punch. If no one in recovery can ever be trusted again, then the world of rehabilitative addiction therapy may as well shutter its doors.
In fact, Keyser remembers very well the summer of 1982, when Ford believes the alleged incident occurred. It was the year after her grandmother introduced her to golf and Keyser became consumed with the sport, according to another book published this past summer, "Justice on Trial," by Mollie Hemingway and Carrie Severino. Keyser worked full-time in the golf pro shop at a Washington-area country club and had little time for socializing. Her hard work at school and in sports paid off with stellar grades, seven varsity letters, and acceptance to the University of Virginia, followed by a professional golfing career and a coaching position at Georgetown University.
Today, Keyser keeps a low profile, as was always her preference. She is, indeed, in fragile health from her injuries and surgeries. But Keyser can stand tall for having remained true to her convictions despite being exposed and pressured by those who seemed to have used her struggles against her. In my book, that’s heroic.

Texto completo: Did Trump improperly pressure Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate his political rival, Joe Biden, and his son, Hunter, as Democrats contend? A timeline of events that led to the release of a five-page summary of Trump and Zelensky's conversation.
July 24
Special counsel Robert Mueller testifies before two House committees about Russia's "sweeping and systematic" interference in the 2016 election. Mueller found numerous contacts between Russians and Donald Trump's presidential campaign but no conspiracy to influence election results.
July 25
President Trump calls Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, urging him to fight corruption and suggesting he investigate Democratic rival Joe Biden and his son Hunter, who had business interests in Ukraine when his father was vice president and working closely with the Ukrainian government.
Aug. 12
A whistleblower reports an “urgent concern” to the inspector general for national intelligence, Michael Atkinson. The New York Times and The Washington Post say the Ukraine call and whistleblower complaint are related.
Aug. 26
After preliminary review, the inspector general finds the complaint credible and reports it to the acting director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire.
Sept. 9
The inspector general reports the complaint without its substance to House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif. The inspector general says Maguire disagrees that the complaint merits “urgent concern,” which would have required reporting to congressional intelligence committees within seven days.
Three House chairmen – Schiff; Foreign Affairs Chairman Eliot Engel, D-N. Y. ; and Oversight and Reform Chairman Elijah Cummings, D-Md. – announce a wide-ranging investigation into the dealings with Ukraine by Trump and his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani.
Sept. 17
The inspector general tells Schiff that Maguire and the Justice Department have told him not to report the substance of the complaint to Congress.
Sept. 19
The House Intelligence Committee meets behind closed doors with Atkinson, who doesn’t disclose details about the complaint.
Sept. 24
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. , announces that the House will begin a formal impeachment inquiry into Trump – the culmination of a months-long investigative battle between Democrats and the White House that came to a head over the president's efforts to press Zelensky to investigate the Bidens.

Texto completo: Sarah Broom's "The Yellow House," a sweeping memoir spanning 100 years, two hurricanes, and 11 siblings, is a tribute to home. Set in a shotgun house in New Orleans East, this story reminded me of the importance of shelter in the middle of a storm.
Long before Broom was born, her mother Ivory Mae purchased the Yellow House in 1961, when she was only 19 years old and New Orleans East was a promising neighborhood home to new housing developments and a major NASA plant. The first chapters map out what Broom calls "the world before me" - her mother's strict upbringing, first and second marriages, and the purchase of her first and only house.
By the time the author is born in 1979, the youngest of 12 children, the Yellow House has become a 13th character in the memoir - unruly and falling apart around them. Broom's father, who died when she was only 6 months old, tended not to finish the home improvement projects, even projects inspired by the destruction of Hurricane Betsy in 1965. Bathrooms, stairs, bedrooms, and walls were left unfinished. Holes in the cupboards served as doorways for lizards and flying cockroaches. You needed pliers to work the sink.
Widowed for a second time and raising a full house, Broom's mother fixed and patched what she could. Still, the condition of the house was a source of shame for Broom growing up, and she knew better than to invite outsiders to her home. "You know this house not all that comfortable for other people," her mother would warn.
The story of the Yellow House mimics the story of their neighborhood - a story of misplaced intentions, tragic outcomes, and the attempt to hold everything together with flimsy tape. Over time this thriving community experiences white flight, the civil rights movement, and Hurricane Betsy. Seven miles from the city's celebrated French Quarter and 50 times as large, New Orleans East is the part of the city that's often left off maps and missing from history books. "There are no guided tours to this part of the city," Broom writes, "except for the disaster bus tours that become an industry after Hurricane Katrina..."
Readers will enjoy the way Broom mixes the personal and the historical. The chapter about New Orleans' poorly constructed levees and the damage caused by the Mississippi River Gulf Outlet begins with a story of her Uncle Joe being forced to slap Broom's sister Deborah out of a panic attack when Hurricane Betsy's waters flooded their house - 20 feet high in 15 minutes. Broom shows readers the well-known Canal and Bourbon streets, but we also see the servers driving from the East into work each morning to feed hungry tourist, the author among them. "The Yellow House" is a masterful depiction of issues surrounding race, class, and inequality in the South's most mythologized city.
Sarah M. Broom is a writer whose work has appeared in the New Yorker, The New York Times Magazine, The Oxford American, and O, The Oprah Magazine among others. The New Orleans native was awarded a Whiting Foundation Creative Nonfiction Grant in 2016 and was a finalist for the New York Foundation for the Arts Fellowship in Creative Nonfiction in 2011.
Ariel Felton received her B.F.A. in English from Valdosta State University and her M.F.A. in writing from SCAD. Her writing has been published in The Progressive, The Bitter Southerner, Scalawag, Under the Gum Tree, Savannah Magazine and more.

Texto completo: WAUSAU - Hanif Abdurraqib likes book festivals, ice cream and talking to people in new places. When he visits Wausau for the Central Wisconsin Book Festival this week, he'll look to check all that off his list.
The Columbus, Ohio-based writer will read poems from his new book "A Fortune for Your Disaster" at 7:30 p.m. Friday at the Wausau Museum of Contemporary Art, as part of the third annual Central Wisconsin Book Festival. He'll come to Wausau by way of Portland and leave for New York afterward, according to his online tour schedule.
Abdurraqib has been nationally recognized ahead of his visit to Wausau. He's on the longlist for the 2019 National Book Award for Nonfiction for his February book "Go Ahead in the Rain: Notes to a Tribe Called Quest," which became a New York Times bestseller. His first collection of essays, "They Can't Kill Us until They Kill Us," was released in 2017 and named a book of the year by Buzzfeed, NPR, the Los Angeles Review, Pitchfork and the Chicago Tribune, among others. He published his first full-length poetry collection, "The Crown Ain't Worth Much," in June 2016.
He's done book festivals in Brooklyn and Los Angeles before, Abdurraqib said, but he is excited to visit central Wisconsin and learn about a new place, where literature is inevitably consumed differently than it is anywhere else.
The reading is free and open to the public, but organizers are asking people to reserve their free tickets on Eventbrite to guarantee a spot, as it's expected to be a popular event.
Readings are just as much part of Abdurraqib's work as actually sitting down to write, he said in an interview with the Wausau Daily Herald. It's important to him to be present and have conversations with people who are reading what he does, no matter where they are.
While his book tour boasts a list of bigger metropolises — Los Angeles, Seattle, Miami — Abdurraqib said it's important to him to read in smaller communities and outside the places he might be expected.
"If I had it my way, I would just do house shows in the Midwest for a year," he said.
So Abdurraqib won't just read some poems and head home afterward. He ends every reading with a Q&A session, he said. He often receives questions about music and sneakers — two topics he frequents — but likes to leave it open.
The reading will also undoubtedly include some bad jokes, he said. Despite "A Fortune for Your Disaster" being a heartbreaking read, it can also be funny at times. As a performer, he tries to balance those emotions so there are times for people to laugh.
"Heartbreaking is the primary color, so as a writer and performer I bring the secondary color to the forefront," he said. "So it's not only sad, it's about color coordination."
He also hopes people stumble upon something new in his reading. It could be fun for people who don't consume poetry or go to readings often because it's not all "traditional" poetry, he said. He sometimes includes fiction or connects to other interests, maybe tailoring the talk to the community where he reads.
Connecting place in writing matters to Abdurraqib. He said the city of Columbus has been his greatest resource as a writer because of the confidence and care that comes from one's own community. He writes best where he's comfortable, he said.
In Columbus, he can still recognize a street name despite the city's rapid change. He encourages Wausau writers to look for the same in their own community. Place can be a great resource for people to share details of their homes that might otherwise be neglected, he said.
"I think art has opened up a lot of possibility for me," Abdurraqib said. "It can do the same for others."
Another panel of writers, a separate event also part of the Central Wisconsin Book Festival, will talk about their experiences living and writing in central Wisconsin. They'll share what it's like trying to get published in a relatively rural area, and why they continue to pursue writing in Wisconsin rather than a bigger city. The panel will be from 10:30 a.m. to noon on Saturday at the Marathon County Public Library Wausau Headquarters.
Although the book festival will mark Abdurraqib's first visit to Wausau, he's been to Wisconsin before to read in Eau Claire and visit Milwaukee and Madison.
When it comes to music, Abdurraqib admires Wisconsin artists Milo (Kenosha), Volcano Choir and Waukesha-born Les Paul.
He also used to go birding, he said, when he briefly moved away from Ohio and lived in Connecticut. He had his own books and binoculars, and enjoyed those long stretches of quiet patience just waiting for something to happen.
His favorite kind of cheese, though, is in Ohio. He said he prefers the dill cheddar from Grandpa's Cheesebarn outside Columbus.
As for his time in Wausau, Abdurraqib will spend a day in central Wisconsin and is always looking for recommendations on where to find the best food and ice cream, he said.

Texto completo: Is the economic and social decline of rural America inevitable, as the magnet that attracts capital and human talent to urban centers exerts an ever stronger pull? Some very smart people think so.
“There are powerful forces behind the relative and in some cases absolute economic decline of rural America,” writes New York Times columnist Paul Krugman, “and the truth is that nobody knows how to reverse those forces.”
Closer to home, officials in both Vermont and New Hampshire publicly worry that an exodus of young people is contributing to a rapidly aging population and a shrinking workforce.
Against this backdrop, though, some other observers, such as Sarah Smarsh, author of the memoir Heartland and host of the podcast The Homecomers, are detecting hints of an emerging counter-narrative. One part has to do with attitudes about rural life, both among people who live in the country and those who live in cities.
Given that about 80 percent of the population lives in urban areas, it is perhaps surprising that a Gallup survey late last year found that if they could live anywhere, 39 percent of Americans said a rural area or small town would be their No. 1 choice. “If Americans did sort themselves according to their desires,” Gallup reported, “there would be an exodus from the big cities and, to a lesser degree, from small cities and towns, accompanying a movement to rural areas.” It appears that in many cases, economic motives — the pursuit of career and other kinds of opportunities — drives migration to cities, not a decided preference for urban living itself.
Another survey, this one conducted for National Public Radio, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, found that despite the challenges facing rural communities, rural Americans tend to be optimistic about their future. About four in 10, for example, said their lives have turned out better than expected; a majority said they are better off financially than their parents were at the same age and expect their children to do better financially than they have. Most said they felt a sense of attachment to their communities, and younger ones especially expressed a commitment to help their community solve its problems.
Researchers also have identified a “brain gain” in Minnesota and Nebraska, countering the long-identified “brain drain” from rural to urban. Despite losing high school graduates, those states are gaining residents with higher skills and education. For example, researcher Ben Winchester of the University of Minnesota Extension service found that between 2000 and 2010 most of Minnesota’s rural counties gained in the number of 30- to 49-year-old, early- to mid-career residents with resources and connections.
And The Christian Science Monitor reported this summer that a new generation of rural entrepreneurs is settling on the Great Plains. Rather than going off to big cities to acquire skills and then returning home decades later, these young people are often returning right after college and putting their education and social media skills to work immediately in establishing unconventional agricultural enterprises and other ventures.
All this is not to underestimate the challenges that face rural America, lack of economic opportunity and addiction chief among them. But it does suggest that the prospect of rural life continues to hold attractions for many Americans and that young people may be figuring out ways to live where they want to live. That does not seem to us to confirm the narrative that rural areas are condemned to become wastelands. And climate change is an X factor that could lead to population gains in rural areas.
There’s plenty that the federal government could do to help: enact universal health care, for instance; alleviate student debt, making it easier for rural youngsters to stay home after college (this especially would help in Vermont and New Hampshire); invest in infrastructure and economic development. Several progressive Democratic presidential candidates have proposed various measures to reinvigorate rural life and bolster economic opportunity, and we invite readers to take a look at those policies as the race takes shape. It’s in the best interests of the entire nation to ensure that all its geographic sections thrive and that none are left behind.

Steve Dalachinsky, 72, Avant-Garde Poet and Familiar Sight at Jazz Clubs and Art Shows

Texto completo: A familiar sight in downtown New York clubs as both a spectator and a performer, he often read his poems to jazz accompaniment.
To write about the life of Steve Dalachinsky, one first has to decide what to call him. "Poet" comes to mind, given all of his books of poetry, the poetry awards and the countless times he read his work, often accompanied by jazz musicians, in the avant-garde clubs of New York and environs.
But Mr. Dalachinsky was always wary of the term. A mini-documentary Straw2gold Pictures made about him in 2013 opens with 45 seconds' worth of Mr. Dalachinsky talking about the label and whether he wants or deserves it, a rambling musing that ends with him saying, "I forgot the question." A 2016 article about him in The Villager quoted him as saying both "I don't even like being called a poet" and "Let's put it this way: I'm a poet."
"Steve didn't want to be pigeonholed in any way," his wife, Yuko Otomo, said by email, "although towards the end of his life he realized he wasn't good at anything but writing poetry."
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
So over what might have been his objections, he will here be called a poet. But he could also be called a jazz aficionado, one so knowledgeable that musicians enlisted him to write liner notes for their albums. Music critics said that if you saw him in the audience at a club, you knew you were about to hear some good music.
He could be called a collagist, whose artwork turned up in exhibitions. And he could be called an omnipresent figure on the avant-garde scene, known in and around SoHo, where he lived, both for carrying forward the sensibility of the Beat generation and for nurturing new jazz talent.
Mr. Dalachinsky was in his element on Sept. 14 at the Islip Art Museum on Long Island, where he gave a reading after having attended a concert by the Sun Ra Arkestra that afternoon in Manhattan. Not long after the reading, his wife said, he had a stroke and a cerebral hemorrhage. He died the next day at Southside Hospital in Bay Shore. He was 72.
"The whole avant scene -- music, poetry, visual art -- in New York City is going to change now because he's not around," the guitarist Loren Connors, one of many musicians who collaborated with Mr. Dalachinsky, said by email. "He was a poet, but he had a lot of music in him. His modulation of sound and rhythm was unsurpassed."
When he wasn't performing himself, Mr. Dalachinsky was there, encouraging and absorbing the work of others, especially free jazz musicians, who were part of a scene he documented in a long-running monthly column for The Brooklyn Rail.
"Whereas most writers would say to their editor, 'I'd like to see So-and-So next Thursday and review the show,' Steve was already seeing everybody, so it was just a matter of highlighting the shows he'd been to that were most worth mentioning," David Mandl, who gave him that column in 2008 when Mr. Mandl was The Rail's music editor, said by email.
"Steve went to as many shows in a month as I did in two years," he added, "multiple shows every night."
Steve Smith, reviewing a Dalachinsky performance in 2013 in The New York Times, described his reading style: "He rushed one phrase and elongated the next; occasionally he stuttered on a single syllable, and then released the pent-up tension in a gush."
In the same review, he complimented Mr. Dalachinsky's taste in musicians.
"I have trouble recalling any significant, edifying or exhilarating free-jazz or total-improvisation concert I've attended," Mr. Smith wrote, "at which Mr. Dalachinsky has not been in the audience, rough-edged, congenial and ready with an opinion."
Steven Donald Dalachinsky was born on Sept. 29, 1946, in Brooklyn. His father, Louis, was a house painter, and his mother, Sylvia (Wolf) Dalachinsky, was a homemaker and office worker.
Mr. Dalachinsky graduated from Midwood High School in Brooklyn and attended Brooklyn College "for about 30 seconds," as he told The Villager. More important was what he had been learning by knocking around town.
In an interview last year for a segment of the radio program "Jazz Night in America" commemorating the pianist Cecil Taylor, who died in April 2018, he recalled a particularly formative moment when, walking by a nightclub when he was 15 or 16, he heard Mr. Taylor's music wafting through the door.
"The music went right inside me," he said, "and my addiction to free jazz began."
Before he became known for his poetry performances, Mr. Dalachinsky had a humbler distinction: He was a street peddler.
"With only a table and merchandise kept in his apartment a few blocks away, he has for more than a quarter-century displayed a selective stock of records, Beat literature and his own books," Richard Kostelanetz wrote in "Soho: The Rise and Fall of an Artists' Colony" (2003).
Mr. Dalachinsky, in an interview for that book, recalled that early in his street-vendor career he had to defend his territory against a young artist who went by the name Samo and who would become a hot art-world commodity under his actual name, Jean-Michel Basquiat.
"I used to chase Samo away from my corner on West Broadway and Spring, where he sold handmade postcards," Mr. Dalachinsky said. "He was a real brat. If only I had those postcards now."
Mr. Dalachinsky never went in much for regular jobs, although he did serve as superintendent of his apartment building on Spring Street for years, work that led to "A Superintendent's Eyes," a poetry collection published in 2000.
"The poems, assembled over 20 years, are a sometimes joyous, sometimes shattering glimpse of life seen from behind the headlines," Alan Kaufman wrote in a review for A Gathering of the Tribes Magazine. They mixed the mundane -- overstuffed trash cans, money worries, which tenants tipped best -- with bigger themes.
The clutter in Mr. Dalachinsky's own apartment was the stuff of legend.
"Living in our tenement shoe box, Steve didn't have a study or free space to work in," his wife, whom he married in 1986 after almost a decade together, said. "I've never seen any poet who walks and writes on scraps of paper. The whole world was his desk."
Much of his poetry was inspired by the jazz he loved. His book "The Final Nite & Other Poems: Complete Notes From a Charles Gayle Notebook, 1987-2006," for instance, consisted of poetry he wrote in response to listening to Mr. Gayle, a multi-instrumentalist, over the years, including this:
I stand outside
on the edge of my shadow
at the edge of the doorway
& the nite is crying
small tears
for me
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Mr. Dalachinsky was well regarded in France and other countries. In 2007 he received the PEN Oakland/Josephine Miles Book Award, and in 2013 came an Acker Award, celebrating avant-garde achievement. In addition to books, he made recordings, including "Phenomena of Interference" (2005), with the pianist Matthew Shipp.
Besides his wife, Mr. Dalachinsky is survived by a sister, Judy Orcinolo.
His final reading was at the opening of an exhibition related to death. Accompanied by trumpet, it was a wide-ranging poem made of words, sounds and breaths, and lasted some 13 minutes.
"You go where you must," he said midway through the piece. "You always go where you must."

WeWork’s Adam Neumann Isn’t the Only Hotshot Tech CEO Stepping Down This Week

Texto completo: The knives are out for tech chief executives this week, as multiple resignations have shown.
A trio of CEOs resigned from their respective posts by Wednesday morning: WeWork’s Adam Neumann, eBay’s Devin Wenig and Juul’s Kevin Burns. While the timing may have been a coincidence, all three companies are currently experiencing some form of a public-facing, tumultuous period.
WeWork Co-Founder and CEO Adam Neumann
Perhaps the most high-profile ousting of a tech CEO since Uber’s Travis Kalanick, WeWork CEO Adam Neumann’s departure from the company he co-founded a decade ago is quite significant. Reports of the confirmation of his resignation came Tuesday evening, with two co-CEOs announced to take over: the We Company’s CFO Artie Minson and Amazon alum Sebastian Gunningham. Neumann will remain as a non-executive chairman on the We Company’s board.
SEE ALSO: Elizabeth Warren Wants to Send CEOs to Jail for Company ‘Mishaps’
The former CEO’s dubious business dealings have impeded the company’s public debut (and massive valuation) in recent weeks, so much so that even major investor SoftBank urged that the IPO be scrapped altogether. The public fallout has been closely followed by the media and public with bated breath, down to the details of Neumann’s eccentric partying and bizarre quotes.
Perhaps Neumann said it best, in an email to WeWork employees on Tuesday, writing: “Too much focus has been placed on me.”
Juul Co-Founder and CEO Kevin Burns
On Wednesday, Juul announced the exit of CEO Kevin Burns, confirming he will be replaced by K.C. Crosthwaite. Crosthwaite will be taking the helm at Juul after a stint as an executive at Altria, the large tobacco company which owns a 35% stake in Juul, The New York Times reported. Burns, whose past positions included being president & COO at yogurt company Chobani, appears to be a scapegoat amid the slew of vape-related regulations that Juul has been the target of this month.
According to CEO of public relations firm 5WPR, Ronn Torossian, who specializes in crisis management, pushing out Burns will likely backfire for Juul.
“Juul has faced disaster after disaster in recent weeks. The removal of the CEO is, in my opinion, a misstep on the company’s part,” Torossian told Observer in a statement. He went on to note that Burns himself recently asked non-smokers to avoid using Juul vapes, which shows that he “cared about the potential health risks of the item more than the company’s bottom line.”
Despite Burns’ ousting, Juul still faces bigger obstacles, including the banning of their device by domestic and international officials. “Removing him—unlike the recent removal of other embattled CEOs—will not help build trust with the public and shows that Juul doesn’t actually understand how to dig itself out of this hole,” Torossian concluded.
eBay CEO Devin Wenig
EBay’s gradual decline may not have been as closely watched as tech unicorns WeWork and Juul, but the company’s internal turmoil is nonetheless noteworthy. In an announcement on Wednesday morning eBay’s board named Scott Schenkel as interim chief executive officer, replacing Devin Wenig until a new candidate is named. As The Wall Street Journal noted, eBay has been assessing its business model amid fierce marketplace competition this year, making Wenig’s departure unsurprising after his four years at the company.
“In the past few weeks it became clear that I was not on the same page as my new Board. Whenever that happens, it’s best for everyone to turn that page over. It has been an incredible privilege to lead one of the world’s great businesses for the past 8 years,” Wenig wrote in a tweet
EBay’s struggle to maintain its status as Amazon’s main competitor has been evident within the past year. For example, earlier this month the Silicon Valley company was bypassed, in terms of quarterly sales, by Canadian e-commerce startup Shopify.

The Senate Takes On Campus Censorship; Students' demand for 'safety' from 'harm' has begun eating away at academic freedom.

Texto completo: Universities have long been centers of political correctness. But campus administrations increasingly seem to be indulging students who, when faced with uncomfortable ideas, complain of feeling "harmed" or "unsafe." This is reaching its breaking point and making it hard for professors to teach.
As part of my oversight work in the Senate, I'm seeking answers from some of the nation's top universities about incidents that have taken place on their campuses. These incidents give me concern about the state of academic freedom:
• Last spring, Harvard dismissed Ronald Sullivan and his wife, Stephanie Robinson, as faculty deans of the residential college Winthrop House. Their offense? Mr. Sullivan, who is also a defense lawyer, had agreed to join Harvey Weinstein's legal team. Every criminal defendant in this country, rich or poor, should have access to a lawyer. The American Bar Association states that a lawyer's client representation is not an endorsement of that client's activities. But students protested and are suspected of vandalizing areas outside Mr. Sullivan's home with graffiti stating "Down w Sullivan!" Administrators caved in to the protesters, and the couple were forced out of their administrative roles.
• Duke fired an award-winning professor, Evan Charney, after 20 years. The reason? He challenged his students to think beyond their own ideology with a "radical free speech" teaching method. Duke's administration cited the professor for a "tendency to provoke negative reactions, and perhaps harm" his students. If asking students to consider arguments other than their own and analyze an issue from all angles causes "harm," I think it's fair to ask what the point of higher education is.
• A professor at Sarah Lawrence College, Samuel Abrams, published an op-ed piece in the New York Times last October discussing the widespread liberalism among college administrators. Students responded by defacing his office door and demanding he be fired. Media reports indicate school administrators may have taken a blame-the-victim approach, supposedly even accusing the professor of creating a "hostile work environment."
• In March, two Villanova professors, Colleen Sheehan and James Matthew Wilson, wrote in these pages how new course-evaluation questions, such as rating professors on "diversity and inclusion," have created a chilling academic environment in which faculty are afraid to teach once-common subjects such as Frederick Douglass. They're even afraid to teach "Catholic doctrine on marriage and the family" at Villanova—a Catholic school.
Campuses were once places of vigorous debate. Now many appear dominated by groups of angry students with closed minds and the administrators who kowtow to them. On many campuses, "Bias response teams" investigate allegations of supposed discrimination. True cases of discrimination need to be investigated and handled with care. But media reports indicate many such complaints are frivolous and politically motivated.
Students who can think critically for themselves are best equipped to tackle the most difficult challenges we face in our democracy. College professors must be free to teach in order for this to happen.
Mr. Grassley, an Iowa Republican, is chairman of the Senate Finance Committee.

House approves marijuana banking bill in historic vote

Texto completo: Marijuana Moment is a wire service assembled by Tom Angell, a marijuana legalization activist and journalist covering marijuana reform nationwide. The views expressed by Angell or Marijuana Moment are neither endorsed by the Globe nor do they reflect the Globe's views on any subject area.
The House of Representatives passed a standalone marijuana reform bill for the first time in history on Wednesday.
The chamber advanced the legislation, which would protect banks that service the cannabis industry from being penalized by federal regulators, in a vote of 321-103.
For six years, lawmakers have been pushing for the modest reform, which is seen as necessary to increase financial transparency and mitigate risks associated with operating on a largely cash-only basis — something many marijuana businesses must do because banks currently fear federal reprisal for taking them on as clients.
The Secure and Fair Enforcement (SAFE) Banking Act was sponsored by US Representative Ed Perlmutter. It cleared the House Financial Services Committee in March and was officially scheduled for a floor vote last week. The vote was held through a process known as suspension of the rules, meaning it required two-thirds of the chamber (290 members if all were present) to approve it for passage.
While the House has approved historic cannabis amendments in the past, including one this summer that would protect all state marijuana programs from federal intervention, those have had to be renewed annually. This is the first time a standalone reform bill was approved in the chamber, and the policy will be permanently codified into law if the Senate follows suit and the president signs it.
“If someone wants to oppose the legalization of marijuana, that's their prerogative, but American voters have spoken and continue to speak and the fact is you can't put the genie back in the bottle. Prohibition is over," Perlmutter said in a floor debate prior to the vote. “Our bill is focused solely on taking cash off the streets and making our communities safe and only congress can take these steps to provide this certainty for businesses, employees and financial institutions across the country."
US Representative Denny Heck made an impassioned case for the bill, sharing an anecdote about a cannabis shop security guard who was killed on the job. He emphasized that the legislation would mitigate the risks of violent crime at these businesses.
“You can be agnostic on the underlying policy of whether or not cannabis should be legal for either adult recreational use or to treat seizures, but you cannot be agnostic on the need to improve safety in this area," he said.
“This bill is not only timely, but extremely necessary," US Representative Barbara Lee said. “Right now the cannabis industry needs access to safe and effective banking immediately."
US Representative Patrick McHenry, ranking member of the House Financial Services Committee, raised concerns about the legislation and suggested that the bill would provide drug cartels with access to financial services. He was one of just three lawmakers who rose in opposition to the bill.
The proposal hasn't been without controversy, even among pro-reform advocates. After Majority Leader Steny Hoyer announced his intent to put the bill on the floor by the end of the month, several leading advocacy groups including the ACLU, Drug Policy Alliance, and Center for American Progress wrote a letter asking leadership to delay the vote until comprehensive legalization legislation passed.
The groups have expressed concerns to Financial Services Chairwoman Maxine Waters that approving the banking bill first could jeopardize the chances of achieving more wide-ranging marijuana reform that addresses social equity issues, like legislation introduced by Judiciary Chairman Jerrold Nadler. They said they were caught off guard when Hoyer announced the vote.
But as the vote approached, advocates and lawmakers wasted no time emphasizing the need to go further than the banking bill.
“I have long fought for criminal justice reform and deeply understand the need to fully address the historical racial and social inequities related to the criminalization of marijuana," Waters said in a Tuesday statement. “I support legislation that deschedules marijuana federally, requires courts to expunge convictions for marijuana-related offenses, and provides assistance such as job training and reentry services for those who have been disproportionately affected by the war on drugs."
She reiterated that point during debate on the floor, stating that the banking legislation “is but one important piece of what should be a comprehensive series of cannabis reform bills."
Nadler also released a statement stating that while he would vote yes on the SAFE Banking Act, he is “committed to marking up [his legalization bill] and look[s] forward to working with reform advocates and my colleagues in this important effort going forward."

The View’s Sunny Hostin connects with others by telling her truth

Resumen: A former federal prosecutor and legal analyst, The View’s Sunny Hostin has made a name for herself by speaking her mind.

Texto completo: If you want to be on the talk show that The New York Times calls the most important political show on TV, it doesn’t hurt if you’re a former federal attorney with plenty of street smarts.
“There isn’t a day that goes by that someone doesn’t stop me and say, ‘Thank you for saying what I was thinking,’” says Sunny Hostin, co-host of The View and a legal correspondent for ABC News. “Never could I have imagined as a kid from the South Bronx being in this position. ”
Having witnessed a violent crime against her uncle when she was just 7 years old, Hostin knew early on that she wanted to work on behalf of the underserved. While at a neighbor’s party with her family, a man barged in and accused her uncle of having an affair with his wife. Hostin recalls what happened next as though it occurred in slow motion.
“He stabbed my uncle in the stomach,” she says. “I remember family members pulling him into the bathroom to help him and seeing the blood on the black-and-white tile. ”
The police were called but Hostin recalls that they barely investigated the incident, and their lack of urgency rattled her and her relatives. Not long after, her family moved from the Bronx to Stuyvesant Town, N. Y. , where she was enrolled in the Catholic school across the street from their new apartment. She settled in quickly, but the experience of having her uncle's attack go virtually ignored by the system stayed with her. “It was part of what fueled my drive when I became a federal prosecutor years later,” she says.
Born to a Puerto Rican mother and African American father, Hostin’s birth name is Asunción Cummings, a name that TV host Nancy Grace found so difficult to pronounce she suggested Hostin change it. “‘No one will remember you,” Hostin recalls the former Court TV journalist saying after one of Hostin’s first television appearances.
The new spin on her name (Sunny is a modified family nickname) may have been easier for Grace to pronounce, but it also belied Hostin’s Latino heritage.
“I wish I could take back that decision,” she says regretfully. “Had I not changed it, perhaps people would identify me as being Afro Latina more. It’s such a big part of who I am. My family doesn’t call me Sunny; they don’t like it. My grandmother in particular was very upset about it. ”
Hostin’s Puerto Rican grandmother was the family matriarch and one of her greatest influences. “My mom had me at 18 and was taking classes and working to make ends meet, so I spent more time with my grandmother than my own mom,” she says. “She insisted we speak Spanish, so at one point my father asked, ‘When is this child going to learn English?’” Some Latino families wanted their kids to assimilate but Hostin’s wasn’t one of them. “They wanted us to retain our culture and not become too Americanized but at the same time, getting an education was extremely important. I was the first in my family to attend college. To them that was the path to financial security. ”
Being a straight-A student came naturally to Hostin, whose aptitude was so high she even skipped fourth grade. But it was her street smarts that came in handy when she took a job as a federal prosecutor. Unlike many of her counterparts who came from wealthy backgrounds, Hostin never hesitated to march into the neighborhoods where criminal activity was common. “I grew up in those types of communities, so I wasn’t fearful. I was one of the few who knocked on doors, sat on plastic-covered couches and got a lot of people to come in as witnesses who would never have talked otherwise. ”
She was incredibly successful — “I won every case!” — but it didn’t erase the nagging feeling that it wasn’t the career she had intended originally. “In college I interned at NBC and loved it. What I really wanted was to be in front of the camera,” Hostin says. Her mom, however, was having none of it.
“She thought that was unstable, akin to being an actress,” she says. “My family equated things like law with financial security, so I applied to Notre Dame and earned a scholarship. ”
While her legal career turned out to be a great fit in many ways, Hostin missed New York. When she and her husband, orthopedic surgeon Emmanuel Hostin, welcomed their son, Gabriel, Hostin quit her job and moved back to New York to be close to her family. “I thought I would be a stay-at-home mom for a while, but it didn’t take long before I started driving everyone crazy, and I was ready to go back to work,” she says. While speaking at an event, a producer from Court TV invited her to do some commentary on the network and “then I just sort of got discovered. ”
She may have taken a winding road, but eventually Hostin also found herself on both ABC and CNN, where she gained a following for her willingness to say things that no one else would, even if that meant going head to head with power players like famed defense attorney Mark Geragos or CNN’s own Don Lemon. Having a voice on legal panels during memorable news cycles that included polarizing events like the George Zimmerman trial and the Ferguson, Mo. , protests helped her make her mark.
Little did she know then that it would be great training ground for having a seat at the table on The View.
Making an Impact
Ratings for The View last season — Hostin’s third — were the highest in years, with the show averaging nearly 3 million viewers per episode.
When you break it down, the five female co-hosts share only 37 minutes of airtime, but according to Hostin it’s not the quantity of the time you’re given so much as the quality that counts. “When there’s something any one of us feels strongly about that other women can’t speak to in the same way, we cede the table,” she says of the energy between herself and Meghan McCain, Whoopi Goldberg, Joy Behar and Abby Huntsman. “This is why it’s so important to have diversity in front of the camera. ”
Whether the issue is border patrol, gun control or the Trump administration, political discussions make up a significant amount of the show’s airtime, and Hostin has been holding her own alongside her big-name co-stars, as well as guests with huge opinions of their own. “When there’s talk about the border, or how much aid the current administration allegedly gave to Puerto Rico, or about children being torn from their families, I know as an Afro Latina, I have to get it right,” she says. “Thanks to my job, I have an incredible platform to ask questions that others can’t ask. I can give a voice to people — like my uncle — who might not have one otherwise. ”
Hostin will have more opportunities to give a voice to the voiceless when her new docuseries, Truth About Murder With Sunny Hostin, premieres Oct. 22 on Investigation Discovery. In the six-episode series, Hostin travels across the country to uncover the stories behind notorious homicides.
Unlike other shows that focus almost entirely on the perpetrators, this one will shine a spotlight on the victim and the families and communities affected. “Having investigated so many crimes against women as a prosecutor, it was important to me to reach women especially, and Investigation Discovery has the highest female viewership in cable television,” Hostin says. “We’ll talk about the warning signs of violence against women and show coverage of victims of color. ”
Familia First
Despite juggling so many high-profile projects, Hostin picks up her kids, Gabriel, 16, and Paloma, 13, from school every day. “The View ends at noon, so I go to every track meet and every game. … I look at my calendar and if my kids have an activity, I often just don’t make it to other things,” she says.
Recently, she missed her children’s piano recital for the first time. “I had to interview a woman who lost her daughter to violence for our new docuseries,” she says. “I Facetimed my kids during a break and said, ‘I’m so proud of you’ and their response was, ‘We’re really proud of YOU, Mom!’”
With so many good things cooking both professionally and personally, what does Hostin consider her true calling? “You can’t live a perfect day without doing something for someone who can’t repay you,” she says. “I should have been a statistic, the product of biracial teenage love in the Bronx. My true calling is to show that if I can become who I’ve become, anyone can. ”

Texto completo: Press is protection against corruption In a recent letter to the editor Mr. Laszlo Stephan all but accused the press of being traitors in their investigation of Donald Trump and his administration.
Well, I hate to burst your bubble, but to my way of thinking, they are the only ones who are keeping this country from becoming a dictatorship.
Perhaps Mr. Stephan should take an adult course in world history to fully comprehend the danger in threatening the freedom of the press.
If Donald Trump has much to fear from The New York Times and Washington Post, it’s his own doing. The corruption he brought to the White House has only been extended as our commander in chief.
People should pray that this president isn’t given four more years to undermine our nation’s greatness.

Spaying or neutering pets has reduced euthanasia

Texto completo: You know that sense of happiness and purpose you get when you are met with wags and wet kisses or purrs and head rubs from your best friend after a long day? That describes how I felt after reading a recent analysis by the New York Times.
After examining data from municipal shelters in the nation's 20 largest cities, the Times noted a sharp decline – 75 percent since 2009 – in pet euthanasia.
To everyone who views their pets as members of their family, this is as good as it gets. And the findings are especially sweet for those of us work in the animal community, because the analysis credits spaying and neutering for the decline in the number of unwanted animals put to sleep.
Spaying/neutering pets has become the norm for responsible pet owners in America, though not everyone is sold on the idea. Some think that desexing our dogs and cats is a bad thing or can be detrimental to our pets' health. They raise some interesting points that deserve to be explored.
Myth: Spay/neuter is bad for my pet's health. My experience proves the opposite: that spay/neuter could be the single best decision you make for your pet's health. Here's why: spay/neuter helps ward off cancer and other diseases. Spaying is the only way to completely prevent pyometra, a costly and possibly deadly uterine infection, and is the only way to reduce the likelihood of breast tumors that are malignant or cancerous in about half of dogs and 90 percent of cats. Studies have shown that pets who are spayed/neutered also live the longest. Although some will say there are studies that show their negative health effects for large dogs who are spayed/neutered as puppies, these studies cover a very small portion of purebred dogs and the link between the two is unclear at best.
Myth: Spay/neuter will change my pet's behavior. The truth is that spay/neuter will improve your pet's behavior in a good way. Dogs will be less inclined to mark their territory and cats will have less of an urge to spray. Part of the reduced lifespan of unaltered pets can be attributed to their increased urge to roam, exposing them to fights with other animals, getting struck by cars and other disasters.
Myth: I don't need to spay/neuter my pets until they are older. On the contrary, the benefits of spaying/neutering pets when they are young (about 3 months and as little as three pounds) is well documented. After all, puppies and kittens can reproduce as early as 4 months of age. What's more, one female cat and her offspring can produce more than 400,000 cats, and one female dog and her offspring can produce more than 60,000 puppies. And we know that spay/neuter in puppies and kittens is very safe; they are back to normal faster than their adult counterparts.
Myth: Spay/neuter is expensive. Taking care of your pets in this way does not have to break the bank. Altered Tails is just one example of a high-volume, high-quality clinic that makes spaying/neutering pets affordable. Thanks to funding from organizations such as PetSmart Charities, the Petco Foundation, Nina Mason Pulliam Charitable Trust and others, we are fortunate to offer spay and neuter services for an average of 75 percent less than the usual cost. You can look for specials on spay/neuter by reputable organizations too.
Since 2003, Altered Tails has performed 200,000 spay and neuter surgeries at our Phoenix and Mesa clinics. We also are one of seven Valley animal welfare groups that participate in the innovative Fix.Adopt.Save. initiative designed to reduce intake and euthanasia in community shelters. Since the initiative launched in 2012, the intake of animals into shelters has declined by 40 percent and the euthanasia rate has plummeted by 86 percent.
The benefits are clear: spaying/neutering your pet is the right thing to do.
Dr. Nellie Goetz is executive director of Altered Tails, a non-profit organization that provides accessible and affordable high-quality spay/neuter services. For more information, visit www.alteredtails.org.

Texto completo: Adam Neumann turned WeWork into one of the most valuable start-ups in the world largely through the force of his outsize personality. He persuaded investors to give him billions of dollars and employees to believe that the shared-office company was changing the world.
That same mix of ambition and idealism forced Mr. Neumann to step down as chief executive after a lengthy board meeting on Tuesday. He was under pressure from directors and investors after he led a botched attempt to take the closely watched company public. The announcement marked a swift and stunning fall for Mr. Neumann, who had enormous control over WeWork and spoke about the company with missionary zeal -- he has said the company aimed to "elevate the world's consciousness."
WeWork expanded with breakneck speed in recent years, putting co-working locations in dozens of countries and becoming the largest commercial tenant in Manhattan. It attracted a private valuation of $ 47 billion as recently as January, with top Wall Street bankers telling Mr. Neumann that his company could be worth a lot more once its shares traded on the stock market.
Mr. Neumann, 40, was the company's charismatic frontman, a towering, hard-partying Israeli with long hair and a penchant for leather jackets and tequila. He used the company to fund his pet projects, maintained a lavish lifestyle complete with private jets and luxury homes. And Mr. Neumann was highly impulsive -- he once banned meat at the company, forcing executives to quickly come up with a rationale for why.
When it came time to list WeWork on the stock market, this all proved too much for the institutional investors who make or break the fortunes of publicly traded companies. After the company filed its offering documents with the Securities and Exchange Commission last month, investors began scrutinizing its business model and Mr. Neumann's behavior, and sentiment quickly turned against WeWork.
Last week, the company decided to delay its offering after bankers and investors signaled that the company might be worth just $ 15 billion. Now, with his resignation as chief executive, Mr. Neumann joins an ignominious club that includes Travis Kalanick, who was ousted as the chief of Uber before he could take it public.
"Spending too much too soon on unproven business models only heightens the risk that a company's race for global domination can become a race to oblivion," said Len Sherman, an adjunct professor at Columbia Business School and an expert in entrepreneurship.
Mr. Neumann will be nonexecutive chairman of WeWork's parent, the We Company. WeWork named two current executives, Sebastian Gunningham and Artie Minson, co-chief executives. The company will conduct a search for a new permanent chief executive, according to four people who asked for anonymity to discuss a delicate subject.
A WeWork spokeswoman, Gwen Rocco, said in an emailed statement, "There is no search for another chief executive either underway or planned."
Mr. Neumann, who controlled a majority of the shareholder votes, was ultimately the one who decided to step down. But he did so after he lost the support of some of his key backers, including SoftBank, the Japanese technology giant, which is WeWork's biggest outside investor.
On Sunday, Mr. Neumann met with the chairman and chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, Jamie Dimon, and later in the day had dinner with Bruce Dunlevie, a partner at Benchmark Capital and a director of the We Company, to discuss his options. Then on Tuesday, Mr. Neumann and his board met at the Midtown Manhattan offices of JPMorgan to nail down the management shake-up, according to two people familiar with the meeting.
In a statement, Mr. Neumann said the scrutiny of his personal life and management was hurting the company. "Since the announcement of our I.P.O., too much of the focus has been placed on me," he said in a note to employees that was reviewed by The New York Times.
The management shake-up is the most significant step the company has taken to win over Wall Street after the botched initial public offering and signals that power may be swinging away from the founders of fast-growing businesses toward investors. Other high-flying start-ups, including the ride-hailing companies Uber and Lyft, have also struggled this year, and their share prices have fallen sharply after their stock market debuts.
"Investors saw through Lyft, and they saw through Uber as well," said Matt Stoller, a fellow at the Open Markets Institute, a Washington think tank. "This one has simply been rejected. Investors are saying, 'We're not going to tolerate this nonsense anymore."'
One of investors' biggest concerns has been that Mr. Neumann exercised too much control over the company through special voting shares. He will now lose much of his power over the company.
Each of his special shares will have three votes, down from 20 votes earlier this year, according to two people briefed on the change, who were not authorized to disclose it. Mr. Neumann will not be able to control more than a minority of the board's directors, and he won't have control over any of the board's committees, according to one of those people.
Analysts also criticized deals in which Mr. Neumann took stakes in buildings and leased them to WeWork, an arrangement that might have allowed him to personally profit at the company's expense. A WeWork entity later took over the management of the properties, a move designed to eliminate conflicts of interest. He also returned a $ 5.9 million payment the company made to him for use of the trademarked word "We."
"The fundamental question here is: Does it help to be a really strong and at times abrasive personality to be innovative?" said Walter Isaacson, a professor of history at Tulane University who knows Mr. Neumann. "The answer is it doesn't always help, and at times it goes too far."
Still, Mr. Neumann's departure as chief executive might not be enough to bolster interest in WeWork's shares. Investors have also expressed concerns that the company is spending too much money and is unlikely to turn a profit in the foreseeable future.
WeWork is now considering slowing down that growth sharply. It could lay off as many as 5,000 employees, according to one person briefed on the matter. We employed more than 12,500 employees as of June 30, according to its regulatory filings.
The company's losses have ballooned as it has spent huge sums taking on new leases and refurbishing its locations. In the first half of the year, its operating losses totaled $ 1.37 billion, about twice as much as it lost in the same period last year. The company used up nearly $ 1.5 billion to run its business and expand in the first half of the year and had just under $ 2.5 billion in cash at the end of June.
WeWork had hoped to raise up to $ 4 billion from the public offering and up to $ 6 billion more in bank loans that were contingent on the I.P.O. The new chief executives will now have to perform a delicate dance with investors. They probably need to slow We's expansion to allay fears about its finances, but not so much that the company loses its allure as a turbocharged business.
"Our core business is strong, and we will be taking clear actions to balance WeWork's high growth, profitability and unique member experience while also evaluating the optimal timing for an I.P.O.," Mr. Minson and Mr. Gunningham said in a statement.
Despite the company's problems, analysts say, Mr. Neumann and WeWork have been the driving force in the flexible-office-space business, which is transforming commercial real estate. Professionals, start-ups and big corporations alike are flocking to locations run by WeWork and others, attracted by shorter leases and nicely designed spaces.
But it might take a more seasoned chief executive who has run businesses with a steady hand to convince investors that WeWork can become a sustainable business, not just a fast-growing one.
Other so-called unicorn companies -- businesses backed by venture capital firms that are worth more than $ 1 billion -- have had to make similar transitions. In 2017, under pressure from investors, Mr. Kalanick resigned as chief executive of Uber. He was replaced by Dara Khosrowshahi, a former chief executive at Expedia, who set about trying to improve the culture at Uber and preparing the company for an I.P.O.
Uber and WeWork have something else in common: Their growth was fueled in part by money from SoftBank. The Japanese company has plowed billions of dollars into WeWork and other start-ups. Softbank's chief executive, Masayoshi Son, has given founders of those businesses wide leeway and has looked the other way at excesses until investors in the public markets push back.

Texto completo: The White House has reportedly determined that the whistleblower at the center of recent controversy will have to be allowed to speak to congressional investigators.
Two individuals briefed on the matter told the New York Times that the White House has reversed course and is working out a deal as to how the member of the intelligence community who filed the complaint would meet with members of Congress.
The meeting would allow the whistleblower, whose identity is not publicly known, to discuss at least some details of his complaint with investigators in Congress, although other reports Tuesday indicate that the White House is moving to release the whistleblower’s complaint to Congress in full. If both occur, Congress would have access to both the complaint and would have the ability to talk to the person who filed it.
The complaint in question alleges that Trump urged Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky a number of times during a July 25 phone call to work with his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani to investigate Joe Biden’s son, Hunter, and his ties to a Ukrainian-owned energy company.
While vice president, Biden threatened to withhold $1 billion in U.S. loan guarantees if Ukraine did not fire its top prosecutor, who had been accused of corruption and had been investigating the oligarch who owned the company.
The Washington Examiner reached out to the White House for comment, but did not immediately receive a response.

Texto completo: Washington • Talk among House Democrats of impeaching President Donald Trump has sharply escalated amid the dispute over Trump’s efforts to pressure Ukraine to investigate his potential 2020 rival, former Vice President Joe Biden.
While many House Democrats from safe seats have been calling to impeach Trump for months, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi had been reluctant lest such a move endanger members from moderate districts — including newly elected Democrats who won previously Republican seats in the 2018 midterm.
But the Trump-Ukraine affair — including the Trump administration’s refusal to share with Congress a whistleblower complaint about the matter — may be shifting that calculus.

The rising furor has heightened interest in how the impeachment process works. Here’s what you need to know:
What is impeachment?
The Constitution permits Congress to remove presidents before their term is up if enough lawmakers vote to say that they committed “treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.”
Only three presidents have been subjected to impeachment proceedings. Two were impeached — Andrew Johnson in 1868 and Bill Clinton in 1998 — but ultimately acquitted and completed their terms in office. A third, Richard M. Nixon, resigned in 1974 to avoid being impeached.
What is a ‘high crime’?
The term “high crimes and misdemeanor” came out of the British common law tradition: It was the sort of offense that Parliament cited in removing crown officials for centuries. Essentially, it means an abuse of power by a high-level public official. This does not necessarily have to be a violation of an ordinary criminal statute.
In 1788, as supporters of the Constitution were urging states to ratify the document, Alexander Hamilton described impeachable crimes in one of the Federalist Papers as “those offenses which proceed from the misconduct of public men, or, in other words, from the abuse or violation of some public trust. They are of a nature which may with peculiar propriety be denominated POLITICAL, as they relate chiefly to injuries done immediately to the society itself.”
What is the process?
In both the Nixon and the Clinton cases, the House Judiciary Committee first held an investigation and recommended articles of impeachment to the full House. In theory, however, the House of Representatives could instead set up a special panel to handle the proceedings — or just hold a floor vote on such articles without any committee vetting them.
[ Read more: As House Democrats move toward impeachment inquiry of Trump, Utah’s Rep. Ben McAdams not yet on board ]
When the full House votes on articles of impeachment, if at least one gets a majority vote, the president is impeached — which is essentially the equivalent of being indicted.
Next, the proceedings move to the Senate, which is to hold a trial overseen by the chief justice of the Supreme Court.
A team of lawmakers from the House, known as managers, play the role of prosecutors. The president has defense lawyers, and the Senate serves as the jury.
If at least two-thirds of the senators find the president guilty, he is removed, and the vice president takes over as president.
How does a House impeachment inquiry start?
This has been a subject of dispute. During the Nixon and Clinton impeachment efforts, the full House voted for resolutions directing the House Judiciary Committee to open the inquiries. But it is not clear whether that step is strictly necessary, because impeachment proceedings against other officials, like a former federal judge in 1989, began at the committee level.
The House Judiciary Committee, led by Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., has claimed — including in court filings — that the panel is already engaged in an impeachment investigation. Trump’s Justice Department has argued that since there has been no House resolution, the committee is just engaged in a routine oversight proceeding.
Whether or not it is necessary, it has not been clear whether a resolution to formally start an impeachment inquiry would pass a House vote. Currently, The New York Times counts 161 members who say they favor impeachment proceedings, 75 who say they oppose them or are undecided, and 199 who have not responded to the question.
What are the rules for a Senate trial?
There are no set rules. Rather, the Senate passes a resolution first laying out trial procedures.
“When the Senate decided what the rules were going to be for our trial, they really made them up as they went along,” Gregory B. Craig, who helped defend Clinton in his impeachment proceeding and later served as White House counsel to President Barack Obama, told The Times in 2017.
For example, Craig said, the initial rules in that case gave Republican managers four days to make a case for conviction, followed by four days for the president’s legal team to defend him. These were essentially opening statements. The Senate then decided whether to hear witnesses, and if so, whether it would be live or on videotape. Eventually, the Senate permitted each side to depose several witnesses by videotape.
The rules adopted by the Senate in the Clinton trial — including ones limiting the number of witnesses and the length of depositions — made it harder to prove a case compared with trials in federal court, said former Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., who served as a House manager during the trial and is also a former U.S. attorney.
“Impeachment is a creature unto itself,” Barr said. “The jury in a criminal case doesn’t set the rules for a case and can’t decide what evidence they want to see and what they won’t.”
What are the standards for impeachment and removal?
The Constitution does not specify many, making impeachment and removal as much a question of political will as of legal analysis.
For example, the Constitution does not detail how lawmakers may choose to interpret what does or does not constitute impeachable “treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.” Similarly, there is no established standard of proof that must be met.
Is the Senate obligated to hold a trial?
The Constitution clearly envisions that if the House impeaches a federal official, the Senate is then supposed to proceed to holding a trial. But there is no obvious enforcement mechanism if Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., the majority leader, were to simply refuse to convene one — just as he refused to permit a confirmation hearing and vote on Obama’s nominee, Judge Merrick Garland, to fill a Supreme Court vacancy in 2016.
Still Walter Dellinger, a former acting solicitor general in the Clinton administration, said it is unclear whether it would be McConnell or Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. who wields the authority to convene the Senate for the purpose of considering House-passed articles of impeachment.
Either way, though, he noted that the Republican majority in the Senate could vote to immediately dismiss the case without any consideration of the evidence if it wanted.
To date, Senate Republicans have given no indication that they would break with Trump, especially in numbers sufficient to remove him from office. In their internal debate about what to do, some Democrats have argued that this political reality means that they should instead focus on trying to beat him in the 2020 election, on the theory that an acquittal in the Senate might backfire by strengthening him politically. Others have argued that impeaching him is a moral necessity to deter future presidents from acting like Trump, even if Senate Republicans are likely keep him in office.
In that same Federalist Paper written in 1788, Hamilton wrote that the inherently political nature of impeachment proceedings would be sure to polarize the country.
Their prosecution, he wrote, “will seldom fail to agitate the passions of the whole community, and to divide it into parties more or less friendly or inimical to the accused. In many cases it will connect itself with the pre-existing factions, and will enlist all their animosities, partialities, influence and interest on one side or on the other; and in such cases there will always be the greatest danger that the decision will be regulated more by the comparative strength of parties, than by the real demonstrations of innocence or guilt.”

Texto completo: CTA trains shouldn't just be fast. They should be safe.
The CTA continues to neglect its most precious resource: people. ("Crime's up on CTA trains, ridership's down. Fix one to help fix the other," Sept. 23.)
Two years ago, Mayor Rahm Emanuel published an op-ed in The New York Times, boasting in the headline that, "In Chicago, The Trains Actually Run on Time" (July 3, 2017). The piece was written in the middle of New York City's "Summer of Hell," when emergency repairs to Penn Station's tracks resulted in a significant service cut for commuters, causing a bottleneck and worsening an already out-of-control overcrowding problem.
Emanuel wrote that city control and improving the CTA, rather than expanding it, was why we were without a transit crisis. He was accurate on timeliness, but failed to mention our ongoing crisis in rider safety.
While our transit systems are vastly different from one another, they serve the same purpose: moving people. In order to reach that end, we need riders. New York is dense, and leads the nation in using transit; over half of its residents use public transportation. Chicago serves less than third of the city's population through the CTA. When you compare transit agency employment numbers, even when adjusting for population, we come up short on employees. Riding both, you can certainly feel the difference.
It is best to remember that upgraded camera systems, though cost-effective, are no replacement for people. Cameras don't have arms or legs. They can't see outside of their designed range. They can't detect odors that aren't supposed to be present on a train. Above all, they can't prevent crimes as they're happening. What consolation do riders have, knowing it takes upward of a day to pull video from a CTA train (after the correct train is identified) or to rely on the live feed of a station from a control center miles away? The lack of CTA employees on the platforms hurts not only the transit authority, but unfairly projects to visitors that Chicago is a dangerous and uncaring city.
I hope one day the CTA will hire more station managers who can help provide directions and maintain an active presence on the platform. Until then, would-be riders may consider cost-effective alternatives, such as the Divvy bikes, e-scooters, and Uber/Lyft.
--Daniel Russell, Schaumburg

Security cameras alone won't solve CTA crime
Your feature concerning increased crime on CTA stations and trains, (Sept. 19) was right on time. After riding both the Red and Green lines daily for over a decade, I can think of two reasons that illegal activities are proliferating.
First is that cameras alone can't stop anybody from doing anything. Since the CTA discarded train conductors, we only have an emergency "help" button. Criminals would likely wreak vengeance on any passenger they see using it to report them.
Second, except for in suburban Oak Park, neither police nor security are seen on the trains. It should be noted that infractions are rare while riding through Oak Park.
Two Chicago mayors ago, there were frequent police, both in uniform and in plain clothes, who randomly checked moving trains. Today, police, K-9 patrols and private security often are non-existent on the rails. Nuisance violations, such as loud music, throwing garbage on seats and the floor, drinking alcoholic beverages, smoking, vandalizing, gambling, and even openly selling drugs have become prevalent. Nuisance level criminals are escalating to violent crimes.
After reading your Tribune report, authorities should take action to control criminals. Otherwise CTA riders will eventually learn how the 1800s stagecoach passengers felt as they passed through bandit territory.
--Dr. Hiram Broyls, Chicago

Lightfoot wrong to keep pot sales from downtown
If we are to believe Mayor Lori Lightfoot, keeping recreational marijuana dispensaries out of downtown would maintain a "family friendly environment." Will she revoke all alcohol licenses in downtown Chicago for the same reason? I grow weary of politicians masking their true motives behind "think of the children" rhetoric. The mayor campaigned on transparency. She should be held to that promise. Relying on "save the children" as a motive is disingenuous at the least, and deceptive at the most. We need a mayor we can trust.
-- Rich Lange, Woodridge

Texto completo: It's in everyone's benefit if physicians participate in research.
About a decade from now, public health statistics will begin to show a substantial decrease in cervical cancer in the United States and other developed countries. That's because in 2006, young people began receiving vaccines against a sexually transmitted virus, HPV, that causes cervical cancer. By preventing HPV infections today, those vaccines have the potential to avert hundreds of thousands of cervical cancer cases.
The HPV vaccine exists because Dr. Douglas Lowy, a physician, and his research collaborator Dr. John Schiller recognized the potential for it after more than a decade studying the family of infectious agents to which HPV belongs.
Unfortunately, Dr. Lowy's career transition from stethoscope to microscope might not be as feasible today as it was a few decades ago. The number of physicians able to engage in scientific research either alongside a medical career or after medical training has waned greatly. Physician education in medical school has shifted away from basic science. In addition, federal funding has declined. After adjusting for inflation, the 2013 N.I.H. budget was 21.9 percent below its 2003 level. These and other trends have driven the proportion of medical doctors engaged in scientific research to a paltry 1.5 percent of the physician work force.
Time and again, physician-scientists have changed the history of medicine by identifying a problem in the clinic and taking to the lab to address it. Alexander Fleming watched men die of sepsis during World War I while serving in the Royal Army Medical Corps, then returned home to create penicillin. Sidney Farber, a young physician at Children's Hospital in Boston, committed himself to finding treatments for childhood leukemia, and laid the foundation for modern cancer chemotherapy.
In the 1970s, the physicians Michael Brown and Joseph Goldstein set out to understand how a young child's arteries could be as clogged as those of an overweight septuagenarian. This patient-inspired research led to the discovery of LDL-cholesterol receptors, and paved the way for the statin drugs that are taken by millions of people every year in the United States alone.
And more recently, the research efforts of two physicians, Brian Kobilka and one of us, Dr. Lefkowitz, seeking to understand how hormones conferred their biological effects, led to the discovery of a large family of receptors that have formed the basis for the development of hundreds of F.D.A.-approved medications.
The biomedical research establishment has long recognized the importance of clinical experience to medical research. In the 1950s and 1960s, during the Korean and Vietnam Wars, physicians were conscripted within a few years of their medical school graduation. Of those young physicians commissioned as officers in the United States Public Health Service, a small fraction was posted to the N.I.H., where they cared for patients and also learned to perform laboratory research.
This program essentially trained an entire generation of medical professors, and its graduates went on to engage in research that has produced major insights into cancer, infections and heart disease, forming the basis for lifesaving therapies. Indeed, physician-scientists account for 37 percent of Nobel Prizes in Physiology or Medicine.
Of course, medical doctors are not the only people who can make great medical discoveries. The discoverers of the structure of DNA and the developers of CT scans had no medical background. But there could not be a worse moment than now to allow the vital role of physician-scientists to disappear. Trends like an aging global population and the resurgence of infectious disease have increased the need for medical advances.
Meanwhile, science is becoming more relevant to medical practice with the emergence of innovations like precision medicine, which requires a detailed understanding of disease mechanisms and genetic data in order to determine the best treatment for each individual patient. More than ever, we need doctors who are competent at both the lab bench and the hospital bedside.
Unfortunately, the career path of the physician-scientist has become longer and a lot less appealing. In the United States, about 20,000 graduates emerge from medical school each year, many with significant debt. Many physicians are well into their 30s by the time they complete their clinical training. Doctors who decide to take the research path face the daunting prospect of many more years struggling to win grants and establish a lab. According to N.I.H. statistics, researchers with medical degrees on average receive their first major N.I.H. grant only at age 45.
Recognizing the problem, the National Institutes of Health's Physician-Scientist Workforce report, published in 2014, laid out a road map to address it. Nonetheless, the number of young doctors pursuing research continues to wane.
In response, six physician-scientists from across the country have formed a nonprofit organization, the Physician-Scientist Support Foundation, to raise funds to support the research efforts of talented young medical students and physicians. The foundation aims to mentor and inspire new doctors to undertake research programs to solve unmet medical needs.
Physician-scientists are among the most highly trained investigators in the research enterprise. Their efforts will be crucial to improving health care. Our world needs a growing, corps of professionals who bring a human understanding of patients to medical research, and a researcher's expertise to improving patients' lives.
We need to ensure that the brightest young doctors can contribute to further advancements in their field, or we risk stalling the engine that consistently delivers better medicine, longer lives and a stronger economy for Americans and people around the world.

Trump declares war on California. But why?

Texto completo: I’m on a number of right-wing mailing lists, and I try to at least skim what they’re going on about in any given week; this often gives me advance warning about the next wave of manufactured outrage. Lately I’ve been seeing dire warnings that if Democrats win next year they’ll try to turn America into (cue scary background music) California, which the writers portray as a socialist hellhole.
Sure enough, last week Donald Trump effectively declared war on California on two fronts. He’s trying to take away the Golden State’s ability to regulate pollution generated by its 15 million cars, and, more bizarrely, he’s seeking to have the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) declare that California’s homeless population constitutes an environmental threat.
More about these policy moves in a moment. First, let’s talk about two Californias: the real state on America’s left coast, and the fantasy state of the right’s imagination.
The real California certainly has some big problems. In particular, it has sky-high housing costs, which in turn are probably the main reason it has a large population of homeless residents.
But in many other dimensions California does very well. It has a booming economy, which has been creating jobs at a much faster pace than the nation as a whole.
It has the nation’s second-highest life expectancy, comparable to that in European nations with much higher life expectancy than America as a whole. This is, by the way, a relatively new development: Back in 1990, life expectancy in California was only average.
That is, as I said, California’s reality. But it’s a reality the right refuses to accept, because it wasn’t what was supposed to happen.
You see, modern California — once a hotbed of conservatism — has become a very liberal, very Democratic state, in part thanks to rapidly rising Hispanic and Asian populations. And since the early years of this decade, when Democrats won first the governorship, then a supermajority in the State Legislature, liberals have been in a position to pursue their agenda, raising taxes on high incomes and increasing social spending.
The usual suspects are trying to portray California as a terrible place — beset by violent crime and rampant disease — in sheer denial of reality. And they have seized on the issue of homelessness, which is, to be fair, a genuine problem.
The striking thing about the right’s new focus on homelessness, however, is that it’s hard to detect any concern about the plight of the homeless themselves. Instead, it’s all about the discomfort and alleged threat the homeless create for the affluent.
Which brings me to Trump’s war on California.
The attempt to kill the state’s emissions rules makes a kind of twisted sense given Trump’s policy priorities. His administration is clearly dedicated to the cause of making America polluted again, and in particular to ensuring that the planet cooks as quickly as possible. California is such a big player that it can effectively block part of that agenda.
Declaring the homeless an environmental threat, however, aside from being almost surreal coming from an administration that in general loves pollution, is pure nonsense. It can be understood only as an attempt both to punish an anti-Trump state and to blacken its reputation.

Apparently bored media outlets attack Pence over Mackinac Island motorcade

Texto completo: The press has found another reason to be mad at the Trump administration, because it did not have enough already.
Newsrooms pumped out headlines this weekend criticizing Vice President Mike Pence for bringing an eight-car motorcade to Mackinac Island, Michigan, which has banned the general use of motor vehicles since 1898.
“A Motorcade on Mackinac Island? Pence’s Visit Breaks a Long Tradition,” declared the New York Times.
The report's subhead adds, “The popular Michigan vacation spot has preserved its quaint atmosphere in part by keeping automobiles out for more than a century — until the vice president came to visit.”
Time magazine went with this, “A Motorcade on Michigan's Mackinac Island? Some Call Vice President Mike Pence's Flouting Vehicle Ban 'Disrespectful.’”
“Pence had a motorcade. But when Ford visited car-free Mackinac Island, he traveled by horse-cade,” read a Washington Post headline published Sept. 22.
The Chicago Tribune reported, “Mike Pence arrives in 8-vehicle motorcade on Michigan’s Mackinac Island — which has prohibited cars since 1898.”
“Michiganders Furious About Mike Pence’s 8-Vehicle Motorcade On Carless Mackinac Island,” said the always reliably outraged HuffPost.
Apparently, it was a slow news weekend.
Look, these headlines are not wrong. A motorcade on the island is unusual. But it is neither entirely unprecedented nor is it anything deserving of breathless news coverage.
For starters, and contra what the Post’s headline suggests, Ford, the only sitting president to visit Mackinac, brought a Secret Service vehicle onto the island in 1975. It is just that he did not use it and his team kept it out of sight. Secondly, it is true that Ford did not travel with as big of a security detail as Pence, who is the first sitting vice president to visit the island. But a lot has changed in the world of federal security since then. Namely, two attempted presidential assassinations and the Sept. 11 attacks. Just remember that: The newsrooms highlighting the difference between Ford and Pence's motorcades either omit or bury the fact that Ford himself was almost assassinated the same year he visited Mackinac.
Lastly, it should probably be noted that the City of Mackinac Island has carved out exemptions explicitly for “public safety” and “public service” vehicles, under which a White House motorcade is surely included. Sections 66-64 of the code of ordinances reads:
The following motor vehicles are exempted from restricted use and only in accordance with enumerated uses: (1) Public safety vehicles shall have no restrictions in usage so long as such vehicle is being used in the normal course of public safety service. (2) Public service and utility vehicles when used to provide, maintain and repair basic public utilities such as electrical, water, sewer and telephone, as well as roadway maintenance and repair. (3) Utility carts/vehicles when operated as a means of conveyance of goods and property and only on that property owned by the utility cart/vehicle owner. In those instances that such vehicle must cross a public roadway to access one parcel of land to another of same ownership, such crossing shall be at that point of minimal distance between the parcels and at a speed only enough to maintain a forward motion. There shall be no crossing of parcels of land having different ownership than that of which is owned by the cart owner. Transit from one parcel to another not contiguous to one another shall not involve the use of a public roadway to bypass another parcel owned by another. (4) Golf carts, when used for the game of golf. Approved usage of a golf cart shall be only that which is owned, operated and maintained by the owner of a public or private golf course and provided only for guests, customers or others engaged in the actual playing of golf. (5) Lawn tractors/mowers, when used in the care and maintenance of yards and lots.
Did Mike Pence bring a massive, eight-car motorcade onto a quaint, idyllic island that has banned automobiles since the 19th century? He sure did. Is it highly unusual? I suppose so. Did the vice president violate the city’s ordinances? It does not look like it. Did he at least violate its long-standing traditions? Yeah, seems like it.

Good story, everyone. You really nailed him.

With everything else going on, between the Trump-Ukraine-Biden controversy and climate change protests this week, the Pence motorcade incident seems like maybe not the best use of our time and attention. If anything, the story is useful only insofar as it is another data point highlighting the fact that federal security details and demands have ballooned in the past 44 years. That actually seems like a story worthy of exploration, far more interesting than this Mackinac mini-controversy.

Democrats have gone to the extreme on taxpayer-funded abortion

Texto completo: The Democratic presidential primary so far has revealed the candidates’ positions on abortion are extreme, to put it mildly. If these Democrats have their sights set on the Oval Office, they would be smart to moderate their stance on the issue, because they are quite far from public opinion.
Just last week, both Sen. Bernie Sanders and Mayor Pete Buttigieg expressed shockingly extreme views on abortion — views that don’t match up with the vast majority of the American public.
During a CNN climate change town hall, Sanders explained that the U.S. should fund abortion for poor women in third world countries when asked if population control was part of his solution for climate change. The optics of white and wealthy Sanders advocating for fewer births in primarily black and brown poor countries is painful.
During a radio interview, Buttigieg pushed abortion without limits, including up until birth (at least), when he suggested that human life may begin only when a baby takes her first breath, even referencing parts of the Bible for justification. “There’s a lot of parts of the Bible that talk about how life begins with breath," he said. "Even that is something that we can interpret differently...most Americans can get on board with the idea of, ‘I might draw the line here. You might draw the line there.’ The most important thing is the person who should be drawing the line is the woman making the decision.”
Then there’s front-runner, former Vice President Joe Biden, who reversed course on federal funding for abortion after caving to the pro-abortion lobby. “We would never support someone who supported Hyde, period,” NARAL Pro-Choice America President Ilyse Hogue told the New York Times.
Biden, Sanders, Buttigieg and frankly all the Democratic candidates should reevaluate their stance on abortion if they hope to win the general election.
“By a double-digit margin, a majority of all Americans oppose any taxpayer funding of abortion (54% to 39%),” reads the eleventh annual Marist Poll survey on the issue. Even more (75%), Americans don’t want to fund overseas abortion—the kind Sanders would export to developing nations to keep the population down. That type of funding was recently stopped as part of the reinstituted Reagan-era Mexico City policy. “Opposition to [funding abortion abroad] includes most Republicans (94%) and independents (80%) and a majority of Democrats (56%).”
The Democratic party platform went off the rails at least as far back as 1992 when it suggested support for taxpayer-funded abortion. “Democrats stand behind the right of every woman to choose, consistent with Roe v. Wade, and regardless of ability to pay,” reads the 1992 party platform. The party platform from 1996 and 2000 read the same.
The 2004, 2008, 2012 and 2016 Democratic party platforms contain similar language on taxpayer funding for abortion. Noticeably different, however, is the language in 2016 party platform, which goes to far as to specifically condemn defunding the nation’s largest abortion provider, Planned Parenthood. It also condemns other attempts to disentangle taxpayer dollars from abortion services.
“We will continue to stand up to Republican efforts to defund Planned Parenthood health centers, which provide critical health services to millions of people. We will continue to oppose—and seek to overturn—federal and state laws and policies that impede a woman’s access to abortion, including repealing the Hyde Amendment,” reads the 2016 party platform.
Democratic Party leaders are out of touch with the majority of Americans, who oppose federal funding for abortion; it does not seem to matter to them that Americans —Republican, independent and Democrat alike — don’t support federal funding of abortion overseas. And most Americans, even among those who would call themselves pro-choice on abortion, know that it’s wrong to abort a 7 lb. baby who happens to be on the other side of the birth canal.
If the Democrats continue to reject commonsense policies regarding abortion, their party risks once again alienating more moderate voters, both young and old. That makes it all the more likely that President Trump will be elected next November to serve a second term.
Jeanne Mancini is president of the March for Life.

He made a joke about Pocahontas during a ceremony honoring Native American World War II veterans.
He launched his political career by falsely claiming that the first black president was not really American.
He launched his presidential campaign by describing Mexicans as “rapists.”

He has been accused of sexual assault or misconduct by multiple women.
He enthusiastically campaigned for a Senate candidate who was accused of molesting multiple teenage girls.
He waved around his arms, while giving a speech, to ridicule a physically disabled person.

He uses a phrase popular with dictators — “the enemy of the people” — to describe journalists.
He attempts to undermine any independent source of information that he does not like, including judges, scientists, journalists, election officials, the FBI, the CIA, the Congressional Budget Office and the National Weather Service.
He has tried to harass the chairman of the Federal Reserve into lowering interest rates.
He said that a judge could not be objective because of his Mexican heritage.
He obstructed justice by trying to influence an investigation into his presidential campaign.
He violated federal law by directing his lawyer to pay $280,000 in hush money to cover up two apparent extramarital affairs.
He made his fortune partly through wide-scale financial fraud.
He has refused to release his tax returns.
He falsely accused his predecessor of wiretapping him.
He claimed that federal law-enforcement agents and prosecutors regularly fabricated evidence, thereby damaging the credibility of criminal investigations across the country.
He has ordered children to be physically separated from their parents.
He has suggested that America is no different from or better than Vladimir Putin’s Russia.
He has called America a “hellhole.”
He is the president of the United States, and he is a threat to virtually everything that the United States should stand for.

Texto completo: Three prominent digital publishers are pooling their video ad space in an effort to better compete against Alphabet Inc.-owned YouTube, other digital platforms and TV networks.
BuzzFeed Inc., Group Nine Media Inc. and Insider Inc. are creating an ad sales alliance to sell video advertising across all three companies' websites, apps and YouTube channels, the companies said.
The group is also in conversations with Discovery Inc., a major investor in Group Nine, as well as other media companies about joining the group, according to executives at BuzzFeed and Group Nine Media. A Discovery representative confirmed the talks.
The alliance, which doesn't have a name yet, will sell ads as an independent body, the companies said. Participating publishers will share ad revenue based on the amount of ads they deliver.
YouTube is the dominant seller of digital video advertising. Alphabet Inc. does not break out YouTube's financials, but analysts have estimated that the video giant brings in more than $15 billion in annual ad revenue.
Other tech giants including Facebook Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Snap Inc. are also becoming bigger players in the business.
But marketers have repeatedly bumped up against offensive, highly charged or otherwise unwanted content on YouTube. Early this year, for example, marketers including Nestlé SA and McDonald's Corp. suspended advertising on YouTube after a report highlighted inappropriate user comments appearing under videos featuring underage girls.
"We continue to hear from clients that they're looking for a more brand-safe environment, but still needed the scale they get on the platforms," said Christa Carone, president of Group Nine Media, whose brands include NowThis, Thrillist and the Dodo.
The companies said they expect the alliance to help them land larger ad deals. "For all of us to get together in a room like this, we're not going to do a deal that we could have normally gotten on our own," said Ken Blom, senior vice president of ad strategy and partnerships for BuzzFeed.
Publisher ad alliances aren't new, though the strength of Google, Facebook and, increasingly, Amazon in online ad sales is making the case more compelling for some.
In the U.K., the Guardian, the Telegraph and News U.K. banded together last year to form the Ozone Project, which sells ad space across their sites. News U.K. and The Wall Street Journal share a common owner.
"That's why media companies are merging," said Catherine Sullivan, chief investment officer at Omnicom Media Group North America. "Everyone is trying to compete with platforms; this helps, even though they are not going to be as big as the platforms."
BuzzFeed, Group Nine and Insider say they have nearly 100 million subscribers across their YouTube networks and are generating more than 1 billion video views across their own sites and apps every month.
Advertising executives said they don't expect this alliance to pull marketers' ad budgets away from YouTube, but they like the idea of simplifying buying across publishers.
Some advertisers also said the publishers will need to offer something beyond mass reach and brand-safe environments. "There has to be something more proprietary of them coming together—what else are they offering that's unique?" said Christine Peterson, managing director and digital investment lead at Mindshare USA, part of WPP PLC.
The brand safety pitch is compelling, but there are caveats there, too. "There are trusted news sources some brands don't want to be aligned with because of politics," Ms. Peterson said.
The publisher alliance also comes as digital media companies are more vocally exploring the notion of merging to better position themselves against tech competitors. BuzzFeed Chief Executive Jonah Peretti publicly floated the idea in a New York Times interview last year, tossing out names of potential partners including Vice Media LLC, Vox Media Inc., Refinery29 Inc. and Group Nine.
Vice has had talks to buy Refinery29, people familiar with the matter said in July.
The video ad-sales alliance is not a precursor to a merger, said Ms. Carone. "There is no discussion right now on a merger or an acquisition."

Texto completo: NEW YORK – It's the Superbowl of diplomacy.
And like any scripted, high-profile event, the annual United Nation's General Assembly is bound to have its share of hiccups, misunderstandings and bizarre moments.
Sure, statecraft can be plodding and dry. But pack all of the world's most powerful leaders (Read: big egos) into a few New York blocks, and the unexpected can happen.
Here's a look at the most viral moments from the United Nations.
'Didn’t expect that'
President Donald Trump, always the showman, got a noteworthy response to his United Nations address last year. It just wasn't the response he was looking for.
It was laughter.
"In less than two years, my administration has accomplished more than almost any administration in the history of our country," Trump said, echoing a line he has used dozens of times on the campaign trail.
But his counterparts, apparently, weren't buying it as a plausible pitch on the world stage. Or weren't sure what he meant. Or something. They laughed. Trump paused, and then recovered with a rare show of humility.
"Didn’t expect that reaction, but that’s okay," Trump said to more laughter and then a round of applause.
Efforts to make sense of the moment only seemed to draw renewed attention to it. Trump's former ambassador to the U. N. , Nikki Haley, posited that world leaders laughed at Trump because "they loved how honest he is. "
'Rocket man'
Trump shocked the General Assembly during his first trip to the U. N. in 2017 by taking language he used on Twitter and amplifying it in front of world leaders.
"Rocket Man is on a suicide mission for himself and for his regime," Trump told his counterparts of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. "The United States is ready, willing and able, but hopefully this will not be necessary. "
The saber rattling, which took place within an institution intended to avoid global conflict, eventually gave way to a softer stance.
Trump has since credited his tough language at the U. N. and elsewhere with fostering a better relationship with Kim. While the two leaders have met three times, critics have noted Kim continues to build a nuclear weapons programs despite U. S. objections.
Scuffle in the hall
The United Nations is all about decorum. Until the fistfights break out.
A scuffle in the United Nations headquarters in 2011 briefly distracted from the diplomacy. It all began when Turkey's president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, tried to rush onto the floor to listen to a speech by Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas.
He apparently was using the wrong door, and by some accounts was pushed by a U. N. guard. That set off a fracas between U. N. guards and Erdogan's security forces.
One U. N. guard was taken to the hospital with a rib injury, and the New York Times reported at the time that there were unconfirmed reports of bloodstains on the floor.
Short and sweet?
Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi was given 15 minutes to speak.
He took 90, instead.
In a rambling first address to the United Nations in 2009, Gaddafi condemned the institution because, he argued, non Security Council members had no power.
"We just speak and nobody implements our decisions," Gaddafi said. "We are mere decoration, without any real substance. "
Smell the sulfur
Trump isn't the first U. S. president to have words with Venezuela.
Former Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez made headlines in 2006 by calling then President George W. Bush the "devil. " But Chavez didn't stop there.
"The devil came here yesterday, and it smells of sulfur still today," Chavez said.
With a dramatic flair, Chavez made the sign of the cross on his chest, and looked to the ceiling as if saying a prayer to God.
John Bolton, then U. S. ambassador to the U. N. , said the remarks were "insulting. "
Long before Twitter
And then there are the classics, many of which played out amid the heightened tensions of the Cold War.
In 1962, U. N. Ambassador Adlai Stevenson used a Security Council meeting to put the U. S. S. R. on the spot about whether it was installing missiles in Cuba. Stevenson demanded that Soviet diplomat Valerian Zorin not "wait for the translation" and answer his question immediately. When Zorin hesitated, Stevenson famously fired back that he was prepared to wait "until hell freezes over" for an answer.
Two years earlier, it was the Soviets' turn to stage some drama at the U. N. Nikita Khrushchev, first secretary of the Communist Party, reportedly pounded his shoe on his desk to protest a speech made by a delegate from the Philippines.
The Philippines official had been criticizing Soviet expansion into Eastern Europe.

We were told our institutions of democracy would save us

Texto completo: Once upon a time, there was an ideal. It was called the United States of America.
And in 2016, the presidency of the United States was captured by the flamboyantly incompetent star of a TV reality show, a man who doesn't believe in any ideal beyond his own enrichment and aggrandizement. Some shaken observers assured us everything would yet be all right. The institutions of democracy - the courts, the Congress, the news media and the agencies of the federal government - would save America from the worst consequences of one of its worst decisions.
"The Guardrails Hold," exulted the headline of a piece by the late conservative columnist Charles Krauthammer. He was highlighting acts of resistance to Donald Trump's bizarre excesses by entities as varied as the Boy Scouts of America and the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
That was in August of 2017. It has since become painfully clear Krauthammer exulted too soon. The vaunted institutions of democracy have proven largely unequal to the task of checking Trump's transgressions.
The courts? The record is mixed; Trump's bid to rig the Census was rejected, his Muslim ban was not.
The Congress? A hotbed of spinelessness that has given Trump less trouble than the Washington Generals give the Harlem Globetrotters.
The news media? Aggressive reporting is met with widespread apathy and partisan claims of "fake news." The New York Times reported that Trump committed "outright fraud" as a businessman. Nobody cared.
Which brings us to federal agencies and last week's news that the acting director of national intelligence is apparently shielding Trump from questioning over allegations of still-unrevealed misconduct. It seems Trump, who has a history of cavalier behavior with classified information - he once blurted intelligence secrets to Russians in the Oval Office - had an interaction with a foreign leader wherein he made an unspecified "promise" that so troubled one official it led to the filing of a formal whistleblower complaint.
As first reported by The Washington Post, Intelligence Community Inspector General Michael Atkinson found the complaint credible and designated it a matter of "urgent concern." That's a legal finding requiring notification of congressional oversight committees. But acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire has refused to provide that information to lawmakers.
It's important to note the context here.
Earlier this month, the Justice Department launched an antitrust investigation of four automakers after they reached agreement with the state of California to maintain higher fuel-efficiency standards than the federal government requires. It can be no coincidence that Trump has long been at war with that state.
At roughly the same time, officials at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reportedly were threatened with termination for contradicting Trump's claim - he tried to prove it by marking a map with a Sharpie - that Alabama was menaced by a killer storm.
Now here's the acting DNI throwing his body between Trump and accountability. We are seeing the credibility of the federal government mangled in service to this guy's fragile ego. How weak the guardrails of democracy turn out to be. Even this one - a government of, by and for the people is looking suspiciously like a government of, by and for Trump.
But where guardrails fail, things crash and fall apart. Something to remember as we wait out the long years until next November.
We were told our institutions would save us. They'll be lucky if they can save themselves.

Texto completo: “Nowhere is the tenacious Chinese preference for sons more clear than in China's orphanages," Kay Ann Johnson wrote to open her 2004 book “Wanting a Daughter, Needing a Son: Abandonment, Adoption, and Orphanage Care in China," which examined the fate children faced in China during the government's crackdown on overpopulation.
In an orphanage in the Hubei Province, “nearly all the infants and healthy older children are girls," she observed, and added: “At this fundamental level — the level at which someone decides to keep or abandon a child — the gender bias of Chinese society is overwhelming."
An Asian studies scholar whose adoption of a baby girl from China led her to spend years researching the impact of the country's one-child policy on rural families, she had taught at Hampshire College for many years.
Dr. Johnson died Aug. 14 of complications of metastatic breast cancer. She was 73 and lived in Amherst.
While working on an oral history of a village in North China in 1991, Dr. Johnson adopted a 3-month-old girl, Tang Li (who became known as LiLi), from an orphanage in Wuhan, a city in China's Hubei Province. She and her husband, Bill Grohmann, already had a biological son.
China was more than a decade into enforcing its one-child policy, a draconian effort by the Communist government to curb the country's population growth. The rule required families to make painful decisions about whether or not to keep their children.
They would pay stiff fines to keep children born “out of plan"; hide them from authorities; abandon or relinquish them; or find friends and relatives who could surreptitiously adopt them. In a culture that generally values boys over girls, those decisions were even more complicated for families when the child was a girl.
“Like most adoptive parents, I wondered about the people who gave birth to my daughter and apparently left her on the streets of a big city," Dr. Johnson wrote in her 2016 book “China's Hidden Children: Abandonment, Adoption, and the Human Costs of the One-Child Policy."
Dr. Johnson wanted LiLi, whose full name is Lee Helen Tang Li Johnson, to learn about the plight of parents in China and understand how she came to be among the first of 120,000 Chinese children to be adopted internationally.
“Such understanding, I imagined," Dr. Johnson wrote, “could help mitigate feelings of bitterness against her birth parents, and above all help assuage a young child's often unspoken worries about 'what was wrong with me,' 'what did I do wrong to lose my parents,' worries that my daughter articulated when she was only 3 years old."
For more than 20 years, Dr. Johnson focused her research on Chinese villages where birth parents found themselves in a lopsided clash with a state bent on controlling population. The policy was also applied in cities, but villagers were usually more daring about trying to resist it. Dr. Johnson presented her research in often painful case studies based on interviews with birth parents who described facing the ruthless policy.
One of those parents, Jiang Lifeng, already had a son when she became pregnant. She planned to keep the child and hoped to have a daughter. She avoided detection (and possibly forced sterilization) during pregnancy tests imposed by the authorities by using a friend's urine. She delivered a girl, Shengshi. But nine months later the infant was taken from her bedroom by seven men, presumably government representatives, and driven away in a van.
Jiang recalled that “she 'felt the sky fall down' on her as she staggered after them, shocked and aghast at what had just happened," Dr. Johnson wrote. Jiang somehow caught up to the van and rode with the men and Shengshi to a local birth planning office, where she and her husband, Xu Guangwen, pleaded for the girl's return. Officials refused.
The couple were told that they could adopt her after she had been taken to an orphanage. But that, Dr. Johnson said, was a lie.
“The government had taken their baby, stripped them of their parental rights, and left them heartbroken and powerless to do anything about it," she wrote. “It had been nothing short of a kidnapping by the government, leaving them no recourse."
Reviewing “China's Hidden Children" in Foreign Affairs magazine, Columbia University professor Andrew J. Nathanwrote that Dr. Johnson's “extraordinary book conveys the intense suffering of ordinary people struggling to build families against the will of an implacable bureaucracy."
Dr. Johnson was born in 1946, in Chicago. Her father, D. Gale Johnson, was an agricultural economist and the chairman of the economics department at the University of Chicago. Her mother, Helen Wallace Johnson, was a homemaker who volunteered at the University of Chicago Hospitals.
Dr. Johnson graduated with a bachelor's degree and a master's, both in political science from the University of Wisconsin Madison and also received a doctorate, writing a thesis about women's rights and family reform in China. Along the way she learned to speak Chinese fluently.
She taught political science at the University of California San Diego for five years and, in 1979, joined the faculty at Hampshire, where she was a professor of Asian studies and political science. For the past few years she ran Hampshire's Luce Initiative on Asian Studies and the Environment.
Dr. Johnson's first book, “Women, the Family and Peasant Revolution in China" (1983), was adapted from her thesis. “China's Hidden Children" was published in 2016, soon after China ended its one-child policy, in part to increase its labor supply, and officially announced that married couples would be allowed to have two children.
A service will be announced for Dr. Johnson. In addition to her husband and her daughter, who lives in Madison, Wis., and is a doctoral candidate in American studies at Yale University, Dr. Johnson leaves a son, Jesse Johnson of Hefei, China; a stepdaughter, Elena Ritter; and a brother, David Johnson of Sinking Spring, Pa.
Dr. Johnson's adoption of LiLi was among the first of a Chinese infant in the United States.
Shanti Fry had heard about the adoption from a friend, which led her to adopt an infant from the same orphanage as LiLi and to become the founding president of the New England chapter of a support group, Families with Children from China.
“Kay really opened the door, and word quickly spread in the Massachusetts community that this could be a viable option," Fry told the Times. Dr. Johnson had advised her group and two agencies that subsequently arranged adoptions from China.
“I imagine Kay going to China," said Fry, who adopted a second girl there, “figuring a way to adopt a child, forging her way through Chinese bureaucracy, and then giving us the confidence to let us adopt."
In “China's Hidden Children," Dr. Johnson wrote that her “role as an adoptive mother has positioned me as an empathetic audience for the Chinese adoptive parents and birth parents I have met as part of this study."
She added that she hoped she had “done justice to their stories as I try to provide an account of the experiences of parents and children caught in the population policy currents of this era."

Texto completo: SAN FRANCISCO -- Until recently, when friends came to Chanel Miller's apartment, she would throw a bag over the Glamour Woman of the Year award that she received in 2016.
It was given to Emily Doe, the name that identified her during the 2016 trial of Brock Turner, the Stanford University student charged with sexually assaulting her. He was found guilty, and at his sentencing hearing, she read a victim impact statement that would later be published on BuzzFeed and read aloud on CNN and the floor of Congress, stoking outrage that preceded the broader #MeToo movement.
But while millions of people read or heard her words, many in Ms. Miller's life didn't know she was Emily Doe until The New York Times reported it this month.
"It let me have a life in which this never happened," she said of her decision to keep the assault and trial hidden. She wanted a chance to define herself, she said, beyond "the nameless, faceless, half-naked body from this case."
"Know My Name," her memoir coming out Sept. 24, chronicles how she has tried to make sense of what happened and how it changed her life. She fleshes out her story beyond being a victim -- although she does write unflinchingly of the indignities she endured after the assault, including an hourslong exam at the hospital to collect physical evidence for a rape kit. Fourteen people saw her unclothed and unconscious; even more saw pictures of her that way in court.
"There's no sense of boundaries," Ms. Miller, 27, said. The scrutiny of the case often felt profoundly invasive, and when it ended, she felt discarded by the authorities involved. "They just sort of say, 'All right, it's over. Go back to your life.' And you step out and you say, 'What life?"'
'I had no headline'
On Jan. 17, 2015, Chanel Miller was seven months out of college and working at an educational technology start-up when she decided to accompany her younger sister to a Stanford fraternity party. She remembers going, having some drinks and, hours later, regaining consciousness in the hospital.
What happened in between she pieced together primarily from news reports. She was found unconscious behind a dumpster with Mr. Turner on top of her, she said, by two graduate students who intervened and held Mr. Turner until the authorities arrived. He was arrested and later charged with three counts of felony sexual assault.
The trial began in March 2016 and captivated the public, with headlines often describing Mr. Turner as the "Stanford swimmer." "It had a prestigious university, it had an Olympic hopeful, an athlete, heroes who stepped in," said Alaleh Kianerci, the district attorney who represented Ms. Miller in court. "I just really tried to make sure that Chanel didn't get too caught up in that."
But it seemed unavoidable. "I remember thinking, after reading the news about him, that I wished I had more extracurriculars," Ms. Miller said. "The fact that I had no headline, it was just so clear to me that I was nobody."
Later in March, Mr. Turner was convicted of the three charges and faced up to 14 years in prison. In June 2016, however, the presiding judge, Aaron Persky, sentenced him to a mere six months in county jail, of which he served three. Mr. Turner lost his swimming scholarship at Stanford and registered as a sex offender. Through his attorney, he declined to comment.
Judge Persky's sentence prompted a backlash, with many criticizing it as too lenient. Voters recalled him in 2018, the first such action against a California judge in decades. He declined to comment.
'Shame grows when it's in a contained space'
In the year between the assault and the trial, Ms. Miller alternated between panic attacks, dissociation and "exploding with rage." She eventually quit her job and moved across the country, first to Rhode Island for an art program and then to Philadelphia to live with her boyfriend. She tried to distract herself by trying new experiences, like stand-up comedy and scuba diving.
She wrote her statement at a moment she felt particularly worn-down by the trial, after she learned the probation officer on the case had twisted her words to recommend a moderate county-jail sentence for Mr. Turner and, adding insult to injury, misidentified her as white (she is half Chinese).
Incensed, she decided that her statement "would no longer be a sad journal entry about my feelings. My DA had asked me to address the judge directly, but I would speak directly to Brock," she writes in the book.
Her letter addressed him starting with the second sentence: "You don't know me, but you've been inside me, and that's why we're here today."
"I've read dozens of these letters," said Ms. Kianerci, the district attorney, "but hers was different. She has an incredible ability to describe in excruciating and vivid detail what victims go through."
Her statement went viral, yet most in her life remained unaware of the trial, something she now thinks may have stalled her recovery. "Shame grows when it's in a contained space," she said. "As soon as you let a little bit of air in, the shame loses its power."
Women across the country sent her letters of support. California Gov. Jerry Brown signed a bill that imposed mandatory minimum sentences in sexual assault cases. Her words were used to make sure "no future Brock Turners get a slap on the wrist," said Ms. Kianerci.
Ms. Miller began working with a therapist, disclosing that she had been sexually assaulted. The therapist, unaware Ms. Miller was the victim in the Stanford case, urged her to read the statement that so many people were sharing online.
'People who love you want to suffer with you'
Philippa Brophy, a literary agent, had already read Ms. Miller's statement when a mutual family friend told her Ms. Miller was interested in writing a book. Ms. Brophy went to Andrea Schulz, the editor in chief of Viking, who promptly snatched up the proposal.
Ms. Miller often wrote between the hours of midnight and 7 a.m., when she felt comforted knowing that loved ones were sleeping and she could be "completely honest with how I'm feeling and not have to worry about protecting other people."
In an interview late last month, she mentioned the movie "The Farewell," in which a Chinese-American character, played by Awkwafina, avoids discussing her grandmother's terminal cancer with her. Ms. Miller said she tried to do the same with her family and friends, putting on a brave face to shield them from her pain.
"An incredible thing I've learned is the people who love you want to suffer with you," she said. "I spent so much energy trying to protect them from everything, when the whole time, they really did just want to be beside me, weathering the storm."
A college friend, Alison Green, said the news that Ms. Miller was Emily Doe "completely took my breath away." She recalled reading her impact letter. "It's so strange to think that this whole time it was Chanel," she said, "because her words changed me without even knowing they were her words."
Ms. Miller credited the #MeToo movement and the many women coming forward as "the reason why I feel like I can come out now."
She and Ms. Schulz, her editor, spoke to each other weekly while they worked on the book. "I kept hearing in what was happening around us these echoes of the outrage that she had loosed, and the chorus of voices that joined in to hers to say, 'This is happening to us, too,"' Ms. Schulz said.
'I just figure out where it lives inside my life'
On a walk through her neighborhood in San Francisco, Ms. Miller stopped to examine a tree with white blossoms and an intoxicating scent. She circled it several times until she spotted a lime. "Wait, there's no way a lime tree smells this good," she said, inhaling deeply. At her apartment, she hummed in delight while eating dessert. She shared a joke from one of her old comedy sets and said she wanted to improve her Mandarin.
There is still trauma, she said, but what's changing is "the time it takes for me to come back from it, and my ability to get on my own two feet each time it ambushes me again." She frequently clenches her fist, a vestigial habit from the trial. Ms. Miller said she's learned "to incorporate my body into all conversations."
"Before, I wanted the assault to not be a part of my life, and that was the goal," she added. "Now it's accepting that it will always be a part of my life, and I just figure out where it lives inside my life."
In 2014, a few weeks before Ms. Miller graduated from the University of California, Santa Barbara, a gunman killed six people nearby before taking his own life. Hearing the father of one of the victims speak at a vigil, Ms. Miller realized his ability to "so quickly convert his grief into action and articulation" was motivated by a desire to protect others from experiencing a similar pain.
"There's never going to be a day where he's like, 'I'm moving on,"' she said. "I feel the same."

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- President Trump is trying to deflect attention from a firestorm of controversy around revelations that he pressed Ukraine's leader to investigate a domestic political rival, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.
Mr. Trump is doing so by saying the real issue is possible corrupt activity involving Ukraine by Mr. Biden, one of the leading Democratic challengers in the 2020 presidential race, and Mr. Biden's son.
Here is what we know and do not know about the involvement of the former vice president and his son, Hunter Biden, in Ukraine.
Did Joe Biden do anything wrong?
The issue here is whether Mr. Biden used his position as vice president to help a Ukrainian energy company that was paying Hunter Biden by pushing for the ouster of a Ukrainian prosecutor. The prosecutor's office had oversight of investigations into the oligarch who owned the company.
As The New York Times reported this spring, no evidence has surfaced that the former vice president intentionally tried to help his son by pressing for the prosecutor's dismissal.
In fact, some of the vice president's former associates said he never did anything to deter other efforts to go after the oligarch, Mykola Zlochevsky. Those efforts included a push by Obama administration officials for the United States to support criminal investigations by Ukrainian and British authorities, and possibly for the United States to start its own investigation, into the energy company, Burisma Holdings, and its owner, Mr. Zlochevsky, for possible money laundering and abuse of office.
What evidence is Mr. Trump citing?
The president has often been vague about the specifics of his allegations, but one detail that he and his allies have repeatedly cited is the former vice president's threatening to withhold $ 1 billion in United States loan guarantees if Ukraine's leaders did not dismiss the prosecutor. Mr. Trump's campaign on Saturday publicized footage of Mr. Biden recounting the threat.
"I said: 'We're leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor's not fired, you're not getting the money,"' Mr. Biden recounted at a 2018 event sponsored by the Council on Foreign Relations. "Well, son of a bitch, he got fired," Mr. Biden continued, in footage that was not included in the Trump campaign video.
The prosecutor general, Viktor Shokin, was soon voted out by the Ukrainian Parliament.
His dismissal had been sought not just by Mr. Biden, but also by others in the Obama administration, as well other Western governments and international lenders. Mr. Shokin had been repeatedly accused of turning a blind eye to corruption in his office and among the Ukrainian political elite, and criticized for failing to bring corruption cases.
Did Hunter Biden do anything wrong?
Hunter Biden has not been accused of legal wrongdoing related to his work for Burisma, which paid him as much as $ 50,000 per month in some months for his service on the board of the directors. He said in a statement this year that he never discussed Burisma with his father.
But he has been criticized by government watchdog groups in the United States and Ukraine for what they characterize as the perception of a conflict of interest, and trading on his family name by allowing it to be used to burnish the reputations of Burisma and Mr. Zlochevsky.
Starting in 2012, Mr. Zlochevsky has faced a long series of accusations of money laundering and tax evasion, as well as overseeing the awarding of lucrative gas licenses to his companies while he was the head of the Ukrainian Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources under the Russia-aligned government of the former president Viktor F. Yanukovych.
When Hunter Biden joined the board of Burisma, he had no experience in Ukraine. He has a professional history including a number of roles that intersected with his father's political career. When his father represented Delaware in the Senate, Hunter Biden worked with a credit card issuer in the state. He also worked at the Commerce Department under President Bill Clinton and as a lobbyist on behalf of various universities, associations and companies.
Did Joe Biden's push to remove the prosecutor help Hunter Biden's employer?
Mr. Zlochevsky's allies were relieved by the dismissal of Mr. Shokin, the prosecutor whose ouster Mr. Biden had sought, according to people familiar with the situation.
Mr. Shokin was not aggressively pursuing investigations into Mr. Zlochevsky or Burisma. But the oligarch's allies say Mr. Shokin was using the threat of prosecution to try to solicit bribes from Mr. Zlochevsky and his team, and that left the oligarch's team leery of dealing with the prosecutor.
Mr. Shokin was replaced by a prosecutor named Yuriy Lutsenko, whom former Vice President Biden later called "someone who was solid at the time." Mr. Zlochevsky's representatives were pleased by the choice, concluding they could work with Mr. Lutsenko to resolve the oligarch's legal issues, according to the people familiar with the situation.
While Mr. Lutsenko initially took a hard line against Burisma, within 10 months after he took office, Burisma announced that Mr. Lutsenko and the courts had "fully closed" all "legal proceedings and pending criminal allegations" against Mr. Zlochevsky and his companies.
The oligarch, who had fled the country amid investigations by previous prosecutors, was removed by a Ukrainian court from "the wanted list," and returned to the country.
This year, though, Mr. Lutsenko's office moved to restart scrutiny of Mr. Zlochevsky.
The Times reported that Mr. Lutsenko had been communicating with Mr. Trump's personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, who has become a leading voice in accusing the Bidens of corruption. And allies of Mr. Biden and Mr. Zlochevsky accuse both Mr. Lutsenko and Mr. Giuliani of injecting politics into the equation.
Ukraine's new government replaced Mr. Lutsenko last month.

Texto completo: El presidente Donald Trump reconoció este domingo en el jardín sur de la Casa Blanca que en su conversación el 25 de julio con el recién elegido presidente de Ucrania, Vladimir Zelensky, habló sobre uno de sus principales competidores electorales, Joe Biden .
Esta afirmación llega después de que se acusara al mandatario estadounidense de forzar a su homónimo ucraniano para que investigara a Biden y a su hijo, Hunter Biden , por las actividades empresariales de este último en su país.
“La conversación que tuve fue en gran medida de felicitación”, dijo el presidente a los reporteros. “ No queremos que nuestra gente, como el vicepresidente Biden y su hijo, generen corrupción en Ucrania . Ucrania tiene ya muchos problemas”, añadió Trump antes de trasladar las intenciones de Zelensky de deshacerse de la corrupción en su país.

El viernes, el presidente había dicho que “no importaba” lo que había hablado con el ucraniano pero, después de que este domingo New York Times, Washington Post y World Street Journal revelaran nuevos detalles, salió al paso con el cambio estrategia discursiva. Hay quien especula con la idea de que Donald Trump detuvo la ayuda militar a Ucrania hasta que Zelensky accedió investigar al candidato presidencial demócrata, algo que el presidente negó tajantemente este domingo.
Los demócratas han exigido al presidente que publique la grabación de la llamada para demostrar que no tiene nada que ocultar. El senador demócrata por Connecticut, Chris Murphy dijo que si se confirma que Trump solicitó ayuda extranjera para interferir en su carrera a la reelección, habría traspasado los límites. Por su parte, Biden dijo ayer que el republicano había “abusado de su poder” presidencial.

Texto completo: America’s massive debt will doom us. That’s common wisdom, but wrong.
In Manhattan, a giant clock displays not only the total — almost $23 trillion for now — but your share, ticking up every second. Pundits say it's trouble. But U. S. debt fears have lurked forever and those troubles are no closer now than decades ago. In some ways, they’re further off.
Here’s how to see that, using tools that show when debt truly becomes problematic.
The $23 trillion total seems jaw-dropping, but says little about what really matters: How readily Uncle Sam can pay the piper.
Pundits cite our debt-to-GDP ratio as evidence of a debt addiction. With $21 trillion of GDP, that ratio is 103% — lower than Italy’s and Japan’s, but higher than Germany’s and Britain's. Debt topping GDP sounds dire. But that's misleading. The federal government itself owns more than a quarter of U. S. debt, money the government essentially owes itself. It’s an accounting entry. As an asset and a liability, it effectively cancels out. Otherwise, net outstanding public debt is $16. 7 trillion— 76% of GDP. That’s still unimportant.

Studebakers shine at vintage shows: The automaker died but its cars live on
Why? Because debt-to-GDP is apples-to-nonsense. Debt piles up year after year. GDP is an estimate of economic activity in a single year, ignoring long-term assets that back a country’s liabilities. America’s hard assets via Federal Reserve data — business equity, real estate, fixed income holdings, cash — amount to $175. 3 trillion, 10 times public debt. But again, that's irrelevant.
Government solvency isn’t about paying off debt. It’s about affording interest payments and rolling over maturing bonds. Currently, annual U. S. interest payments represent just 9. 8% of tax revenues, lower than any time in the 1980s and 1990s, when they peaked at 18. 4%. If debt didn’t doom us then, why would it now?
Naysayers often rebut that by saying it’s all thanks to low-interest rates, which may reverse. Fair point. A 30-year Treasury bought 30 years ago carried 8. 15% interest. Today, we can refinance at about 2%, a heckuva deal. Plus,10-year debt is cheaper too. But rates only matter to the government’s finances at issuance. Since America’s debt averages about six years in maturity, short-term rate wiggles don’t create danger.
For debt to become a problem, Uncle Sam must spend like a drunken sailor for decades (which he may). Or interest rates must skyrocket and stay there, with the country's interest payments ballooning and investors demanding more return for more risk. Do you see any signs of that now? Maybe someday. But not any time soon.
Pockets of debt trouble do exist around the world. To see them, look to markets. Compare low-default-risk Treasury rates to similar-maturity rates from other issuers — it's called a credit spread. For example, South Africa and Turkey are both suffering significant debt pressure. How do you know? America can borrow for 10 years at 1. 62%. Investors demand 8. 82% to lend to South Africa. Turkish rates are 15. 18%.
Use that same approach to assess corporate debt. Corporate America doesn’t have a debt problem, despite frequent fears that hinge on its debt total alone. Overall corporate spreads have declined this year. To be sure, oil price pressures have squeezed the tiniest U. S. shale-oil drillers. Bonds of less-creditworthy drillers now yield 10. 3%, up from 7. 4% a year ago. That rise — while rates overall plunged — signals trouble. No shock: Driller defaults are climbing.
But while problems with debt darken isolated patches, debt doom doesn’t loom over America.

Texto completo: It's immoral for the same kind of radical fools, whose faulty ideas enabled this mess, to now demand even more restrictive firearms regulations.
At Iowa's Mason City high school in the 1970s, students sometimes hunted before classes began. We routinely left rifles, shotguns and ammo in our vehicles, in full view. Custodians mopped up blood on hallway floors from pheasants, ducks, quail and other fowl, which were stored in our lockers during the school day. In the parking lot, a classmate showed me his double-barrel, over-and-under, .12-gauge Browning Citori, as teachers, students, and other passersby thought nothing of it. But if that occurred today, arrests would result.
Recent mass shootings have predictably fueled new, clueless demands for more gun control. However, government agencies and watch lists, federal or otherwise, aren't nearly as effective as the collective, real-time intelligence that U.S. communities can glean about wackos with dangerous political beliefs.
But rather than empower local leaders to investigate, report, and effectively deal with such troubled souls, liberals, since the 1960s, have undermined the moral authority of educators, ministers, coaches, law enforcement officers, service club members and preachers. There's simply not much government can do about mass shooters, and what's been done hasn't been very effective. That's because people, NOT firearms, cause mass killings, and penalizing law-abiding gun owners for violence perpetrated by creeps and sociopaths is morally wrong, and dangerous.
While red-flag laws may prevent some suicides, it's unproven that they'd stop any mass murders. Dr. Richard A. Friedman, the highly regarded psychiatrist, told The New York Times on August 8, 2019, that even "experienced psychiatrists fare no better than a roll of the dice at predicting violence."
Mass shootings were nearly nonexistent when public schools featured classroom prayer and the overwhelming majority of kids were raised in two-parent homes. Back then, far more families regularly attended church services, and teachers were respected – partly because they could freely discipline unruly students.
Instead of listening to violence-provoking music, everyday Americans preferred Johnny Cash, Karen Carpenter, The Beach Boys, Cass Elliot, Elvis Presley, Anne Murray and Dean Martin. On TV, we watched "The Andy Griffith Show," "Green Acres," "Gunsmoke," "The Beverly Hillbillies," and "Bonanza."
From second grade through middle school, many boys, myself included, carried a Cub Scout knife or a Boy Scout knife. We sometimes fought, but we NEVER pulled a knife – at school, or elsewhere. Today, a knife at school gets students suspended, or expelled. In the 1970s, sheriffs and police would sometimes preemptively jail potential troublemakers for their, and society's, benefit. Some who were locked up expressed gratitude upon their release. But if this happened now, the ACLU would sue.
Wicked, not innocent, individuals should be punished. Gun-free zones are laughable, as many school shootings and other massacres have transpired in them. Obviating this carnage means making weapons available to intended victims, forcing would-be criminals to consider the possibility of armed resistance. In some particularly gruesome mass murders, aircraft, vehicles, and fertilizer were weaponized; should we ban those?
The crime-infested cities of Chicago, Baltimore, Atlantic City, Detroit, New Orleans, East St. Louis (Illinois), Oakland, Newark, and others with extremely high murder rates per capita are governed by pro-gun-control political hacks. These clueless politicians lack credibility, but they keep getting elected — which exemplifies cultural decay. The naivete of many Americans has proven fatal to innocent, lawful victims, who were denied the right to prevent their own slaughter.
This societal breakdown — facilitated by misguided, politically correct policies — is causal to mass shootings. Because conservatives opposed and warned against such ludicrous, culture-poisoning actions, it's immoral for the same kind of radical fools, whose faulty ideas enabled this mess, to now demand even more restrictive firearms regulations.
Todd Blodgett of Clear Lake served on President Reagan's White House staff and as an adviser to the 1988 presidential campaign of George H.W. Bush. He also worked for the Republican National Committee and the FBI.
It's immoral for the same kind of radical fools, whose faulty ideas enabled this mess, to now demand even more restrictive firearms regulations.

Texto completo: U.S. Border Patrol agents are reported to be dismayed that they are now reviled by many Americans rather than respected. Dismayed, perhaps, but surely not surprised, what with the mistreatment of migrants at the southwestern border and the routine violation of civil liberties at the northern, typified by recent checkpoints in Lebanon and on the Champlain Islands in Vermont.
It’s hard to keep your hands clean when you are tasked with a dirty job.
It wasn’t always this way, as The New York Times reported last week. For many years, Border Patrol agents labored in obscurity, enduring long periods of boredom punctuated by occasional high-octane chases to interdict smuggling of humans or drugs.
That changed when the agency became the face of the Trump administration’s systematic persecution of immigrants. The agency is said to be now undergoing a crisis in morale and mission as the result of the scrutiny it is receiving. Franciso Cantu, author of The Line Becomes a River, a memoir of his years with the agency from 2008 to 2012, told the Times, “The intense criticism that is being directed at the Border Patrol is necessary and important because I do think that there’s a culture of cruelty or callousness. There’s a lack of oversight. There is a lot of impunity.”
Which brings us to the checkpoint that about 20 Border Patrol and Homeland Security agents erected for a full day earlier this month between exits 19 and 18 of Interstate 89 in Lebanon, snarling traffic and impeding hundreds of motorists who were doing nothing more nefarious than going about their busy daily lives.
This police-state extravaganza, mounted 95 miles from the Canadian border, netted a total of four undocumented immigrants, or “illegal aliens” as the Border Patrol would have it.
Three separate checkpoints conducted in June, July and September on the Sandbar Causeway between Milton and South Hero, Vt., have resulted in the detention of exactly one person “illegally present” in the country, according to the VtDigger news organization.
That the Border Patrol, with 1,800 jobs it is unable to fill, should waste resources in such a fashion is nothing less than a scandal.
Border Patrol representatives decline to provide the rationale for the decision of when and where to conduct checkpoints, other than to allude to it being driven by “intelligence.” That certainly cannot be the case, given the paltry yield of detentions. In fact, nobody in their right mind would set up a checkpoint at the same place for three separate months in the same summer. Surely, the word has spread through the migrant community by now.
Moreover, no one with an ounce of intelligence would snarl traffic all day in close proximity to a major medical center, to which patients and health care workers must have unimpeded access, just to inquire about the immigration status of motorists and their passengers. If that doesn’t rise to cruelty, it surely counts as callousness. Or worse yet, trying to make a point.
Not everyone, of course, is troubled by this show of farce.
Ray Allen, sheriff of Vermont’s Grand Isle County, applauds the checkpoints. “If nothing else,” he told VtDigger, “it’s sending out a message that you need to be careful when you’re coming through Vermont, that we are watching.”
State Rep. Leland Morgan, R-Milton, said, “We have to secure our borders, and if it inconveniences a person once in a while, that’s just the way it is. You have to have some compromise, you can’t let everybody do everything they want to do. There has to be some control, and I’m all for that.”
These statements are remarkable in two respects. First, it is doubtful that a state as heavily dependent on tourism as Vermont wants to send a message to prospective visitors that they need to be “careful” when traveling in the Green Mountain State because they are being watched by the authorities. That does not sound to us like an enticing vacation spot.
Second, for an elected Republican official to endorse inconveniencing and controlling the civilian population is the exact opposite of traditional conservative thought, which holds that the essence of liberty is the right to be left alone, to be free from government intrusion in one’s private affairs unless there is probable cause to suspect wrongdoing. These checkpoints are surely the kind of thing that the nation’s founders sought to preclude when they wrote the Fourth Amendment’s prohibition against unreasonable searches and seizures.
It is vital to resist these random, warrantless motor vehicle stops. They are a dangerous precursor to a society where armed representatives of the government can stop anyone, anytime, for any reason — at the polling station, at the grocery store, coming out of the library — and demand to see identification.
Having to routinely “show your papers” is a hallmark of authoritarian government, a direction in which America could be headed unless the public says loudly and firmly, “No.”

Texto completo: DeLancey Floyd Smith and David Scott Gelinas were married Sept. 21. Julie Lynn Miller, a Universal Life minister, officiated at a private estate rented for the occasion in Calistoga, Calif.
Mrs. Gelinas, 30, is known as Elsie. She is a senior product marketing manager at Sun Basket, a San Francisco meal delivery service. She graduated from Wesleyan University and received an M.B.A. from the University of Chicago.
She is a daughter of Nancy A. Brown and Scott F. Smith of New York. The bride's father is a partner in the New York office of Covington & Burling, a law firm, and is the chairman of its corporate practice. Her mother is a trial lawyer in the New York office of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
The bride is a maternal great- great-granddaughter of the late Carr V. Van Anda, who was the managing editor of The New York Times from 1904 to 1925. She is also a paternal granddaughter of the late Ray S. Smith Jr., a Democrat, and a member of the Arkansas House of Representatives from 1955 to 1982.
Mr. Gelinas, 34, is a vice president for mergers and acquisitions in the power, energy and renewables sectors in the investment banking unit of Guggenheim Partners, a financial services company; he works in the bank's San Francisco office. He graduated from Cornell, where he was president of his class in his junior year, and, while still a student at Cornell, he was elected as an alderman in Ithaca, N.Y., a position that he held in 2006 and 2007.
He is the son of Suzanne K. Gelinas and Kenneth P. Gelinas of Manchester, N.H. The groom's mother is a jewelry designer in Manchester. His father is the managing partner of Gelinas & Company, a certified public accounting firm in Manchester.
The couple met in 2013 when Mr. Gelinas began working at a New York investment bank where Ms. Smith already was employed. A year later, the couple began dating, after both had moved to San Francisco to work in the investment bank's office there.

Texto completo: Back in the late 1940s and early 1950s, outdoor historical dramas were popular. There was "The Lost Colony" in North Carolina and "The Common Glory" in Williamsburg. I have fragmentary memories of maybe having seen one in Rock Creek Park in the early '50s. Is that possible?
- Mac Coinich, Annandale
In the summer of 1950, Washingtonians were excited about a new 4,000-seat performance space set to open. Its name: the Sesquicentennial Amphitheater, "Sesqui" for short.
Doesn't really roll off the tongue, does it? You probably know it by a different name: Carter Barron Amphitheatre. It was Carter T. Barron , the Washington representative of the Loews Theater chain, who spearheaded construction of the outdoor venue.
Barron was executive vice chairman of the National Capital Sesquicentennial Commission, formed to commemorate the 150th anniversary of the establishment of Washington as the nation's capital.
Many ideas were proposed to celebrate Washington's sesquicentennial, but the only one to get off the ground - or on the ground - was the amphitheater constructed in a natural bowl in Rock Creek Park near 16th Street NW and Colorado Avenue. Playwright Paul Green (1894-1981) was commissioned to create a piece christening it.
Green "really was on the cutting edge of all kind of things. And he was terribly bold," said John Roper , author of the 2003 biography "Paul Green, Playwright of the Real South."
A white North Carolinian, Green was a devoted integrationist, the perfect choice for a theater that, because it was on federal land, was required to be integrated. His Pulitzer Prize-winning 1927 play "In Abraham's Bosom" is about an African American field worker eager to open a school for black children.
Green had spent time in Europe and collaborated with Kurt Weill and Lotte Lenya . He'd made good money in movies, too, penning the screenplay for 1932's "The Cabin in the Cotton," in which Bette Davis delivers the immortal line "I'd like to kiss you, but I just washed my hair."
But Green had tired of Broadway and Hollywood and was eager to find a new way to connect with audiences. His idea: a genre he called "symphonic drama." These would be large productions that explored and celebrated aspects of U.S. history and were mounted in the very places where that history took place.
"The Lost Colony" debuted in Manteo, N.C., in 1937 and continues to this day, only ceasing operations during World War II when it was feared the theater lights might attract German submarines. "The Common Glory" in Williamsburg opened in 1947 and ran for 30 years.
For Washington the city, Green chose as his subject Washington the man. The show was called "Faith of Our Fathers" - or "FOOF," as newspaper headline writers quickly dubbed it - and it covered G eorge Washington's public life from 1783 to 1798.
Many in the cast and crew of 120 were taken from the theater departments of local universities. (Also in the show, as Pierre L'Enfant , was Pernell Roberts , who later starred in "Bonanza" and "Trapper John, MD.")
The show opened on Aug. 4, 1950, with President Harry S. Truman in the audience. Brooks Atkinson of the New York Times was among those underwhelmed by Green's play. "The inspiration it seeks to convey is dissipated amid a clutter of quick, poster-like episodes and laborious changes of scenery," he wrote.
The hometown crowd was just as critical. "Impressive but disappointing" was the verdict of The Washington Post's Richard L. Coe , who wrote: "To fill his huge stage, [Green's] scenes must be broad and heavy, the very qualities he at the same time is trying to tone down in his central figure."
Coe did praise the lighting, by James Waring , and the music, especially the chorus led by Washington National Cathedral's Richard Dirksen .
Green was known to tinker with his creations and that was true of "Faith of Our Fathers." When the play returned for its second season in 1951, the author promised "a different attitude." He told Coe: "We have a new beginning and a new ending. The action now starts when Washington was 27 years old and carries him through 40 years until the laying of the Capitol cornerstone."
Green added more "Indian ritual dances," choreographed by Myra Kinch , as well as scenes from the battle of Lexington and Washington's inauguration.
The space had a new name, too, in honor of Barron, who the previous November had died of a brain tumor at age 45.
Alas, the changes didn't help. Ticket sales never achieved the desired level. Plus, residents near the amphitheater complained about the "noise and dust" of the show. "Faith of Our Fathers" closed after its second season and never came back.
But over the ensuing decades, Carter Barron Amphitheatre did host all manner of entertainments. Deferred maintenance closed it in 2017. A National Park Service spokeswoman told Answer Man they're committed to reopening after design work for the rehabilitation is completed in 2020.

Declarations: Why They'll Never Stop Targeting Kavanaugh

Texto completo: Here are the reasons, in no certain order, that the accusations against Justice Brett Kavanaugh will never stop and his foes on the progressive left never let up.
Because progressives have to prove they were right to advance the sexual-assault accusations of Christine Blasey Ford. They lost that battle; Justice Kavanaugh sits on the court. They won't stop the assault until they can prove they were right to launch it.
Because people become fixated on their targets. Because #MeToo continues as a potent cultural force. Because as the court assumes an ever more powerful role in American life, confirmation hearings and their aftermath will become more brutal and never-ending.
Because the authority and legitimacy of future rulings that are not pleasing to progressives (most prominently, perhaps, on Roe v. Wade) can be undermined through footnotes that say "the 5-4 decision was joined by a justice credibly accused of sexual assault."
Because the steady drum of allegations diminishes not only Justice Kavanaugh's stature but that of the court itself, which will be helpful when Democrats attempt to pack it.
Because the crazier parts of the progressive left increasingly see politics as public theater, with heroes and villains, cheers and hisses from the audience, and costumes, such as outfits from "The Handmaid's Tale." Because modern politics is, for the lonely and strange on all sides, entertainment and diversion. And one's people must be entertained.
Because many progressives believe deep in their hearts that conservative men are both sexually obsessed and repressed, that conservatism is a way of looking at the world in which women are lesser, mere prey. They think this is behind everything, including conservative reservations about or opposition to abortion. In this view, conservative jurists who say things like "60% of my clerks were women" and "I coach the girls' soccer and debate teams" are engaged in an elaborate cover. They hate the modern world. Behind closed doors they're always swinging caveman's clubs.
Because where there's smoke there must be fire. There was Ms. Ford, then the Yale rumors. There's no way there isn't something to it.
So it will never end.
For Democrats, it is not "good politics," and most of them know it. What was done to Justice Kavanaugh had a positive impact on 2018 Senate outcomes -- for Republicans. There was a backlash. Women worried their sons and husbands would be targeted in a prosecutorial atmosphere that had abandoned due process.
People are complicated. Jill Abramson, who covered the 1991 Clarence Thomas hearings as a reporter for The Wall Street Journal, told a story years later. Anita Hill had just testified. During a break, Ms. Abramson went for lunch in the Supreme Court cafeteria. As she stood waiting to pay for her food she chatted with another reporter about how Ms. Hill's testimony had been lethal for Judge Thomas. The cashier, a middle-aged black woman, overheard, gave Ms. Abramson a baleful look, and said: "They'll do anything to bring down a black man." It was clear she supported him. In Ms. Abramson's view it was an early sign of broader public opinion.
In an excerpt from a new book by two of its reporters, the New York Times this week famously reported another allegation of sexual misconduct by an undergraduate Mr. Kavanaugh. The Times later corrected its story to note the purported victim refused to be interviewed for the book and friends say she has no memory of such an incident. Democratic presidential contenders had already called for Justice Kavanaugh's impeachment. Soon they changed the subject. But they'll return to it.
What is kind of horrifying is the extent to which all this stems from the charges brought last year by Ms. Ford. Mr. Kavanaugh, she said, had drunkenly attempted to force himself on her at a high-school party.
I watched her testimony, as I've written before, with a bias. In my experience women in such matters are telling the truth. I assumed her charges would be substantiated.
And yet they were not, not at all, not even after a year. Not a single witness emerged to corroborate her account. The woman Ms. Ford described as a close, lifelong friend who could back up her account said she remembered no such party or gathering and had in fact never met Brett Kavanaugh. Now she admits she does not herself believe Ms. Ford's story.
Throughout the drama those who believed Judge Kavanaugh's denials operated at a disadvantage: Any criticism of Ms. Ford would be treated as a smear, so there was almost none.
I'm reminded of this by the riveting book "Justice On Trial," by Mollie Hemingway and Carrie Severino. Most such investigations are written by liberal journalists for a liberal audience; Ms. Hemingway and Ms. Severino are conservatives who went forward with journalistic seriousness and paid attention to information others might ignore. They suggest "where there's smoke there's fire" can't be applied to the Kavanaugh case because from the moment he was nominated to the court he was targeted by pyromaniacs.
A leftist feminist group linked him to allegations of sexual harassment against another judge, for whom he'd clerked a quarter-century before. An activist group accused him of supporting the "problematic trope that the Constitution should be 'colorblind.'" Another group said his judicial philosophy amounted to supporting the "white supremacist patriarchy."
This was par for the course for a Republican nominee, but soon after Ms. Ford's charges came the New Yorker story in which a Yale classmate of Judge Kavanaugh said that during her freshman year he exposed himself at a drunken dorm party and caused her to touch his genitals. But the story didn't hold -- the reporters were unable to find a witness to corroborate it, the accuser had "significant gaps" in her memories, and it took six days of "carefully assessing her memories" and consulting with an attorney provided by Democrats, to name Judge Kavanaugh.
The since-disgraced lawyer Michael Avenatti then brought forward a woman who claimed she was gang raped at a high-school party by Mr. Kavanaugh and his friends, as were other young women. Her story fell apart too.
Then a charge came in through Democratic Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse. A constituent had called his office to say a man believed to be Mr. Kavanaugh had sexually assaulted a woman on a boat in Newport, R.I., in 1985. Now there was a fourth accuser! Eventually the Judiciary Committee tracked down the constituent, an anti-Trump activist who'd called for a military coup. He later recanted his accusations on Twitter and apologized.
A letter to Sen. Kamala Harris's office claimed Judge Kavanaugh had sexually assaulted a woman while driving home from a party. The accuser was a political activist who later admitted her charge was "just a ploy" made because she was angry. Asked if she'd ever met Judge Kavanaugh she said, "Oh Lord, no."
In both cases the accusers seemed shocked you couldn't just . . . lie.
"Normally the burden of proof is on the accuser," write Ms. Hemingway and Ms. Severino, "but the media were not even paying lip service to that principle."
They weren't.
The charges will probably never stop, but at this point many of us, having seen what Justice Kavanaugh was put through because of ideology and politics, will never find them believable.

If Maya Moore wants to devote the rest of her life to something besides basketball, fans should cheer her on

Texto completo: We haven’t heard much from Maya Moore since her surprising announcement last February that she was skipping this WNBA season with the Lynx to focus on her family and faith. So last Monday, when she posted a fresh video to her public Facebook page, fans parsed every word, seeking clues about her future.
Moore is trying to get a new trial for a friend, Jonathan Irons, serving a 50-year sentence for a non-fatal shooting that happened when he was 16. Since explaining her sabbatical decision in The Players Tribune, Moore has given just two interviews, to The New York Times and the Associated Press. She told both she believes prosecutorial misconduct led to a wrongful conviction for Irons, since no physical evidence tied him to the crime scene. Moore started a change.org petition to help publicize Irons’ case with the hashtag #WinWithJustice.
Earlier this week, Moore visited Washington, D.C. to speak to the Congressional Black Caucus and join a panel discussion about criminal justice reform and sports. This is Moore’s life now, her focus, her mission. Irons is scheduled to be in court Oct. 9 for an evidentiary hearing to try and reopen the case, and Moore plans to be there, according to the AP.
Regardless how this turns out, Moore’s selflessness and dedication to her cause should be applauded, celebrated. Instead, too many people have made it clear they care about only one thing: whether she returns to basketball. In the Facebook video, Moore says, “I’m dedicating my life to freeing Jonathan the same way I dedicated myself to each game in the WNBA.” Some fans and media types pointed to the word “dedicated,” past tense, as evidence she plans to retire. And that’s all they want to talk about.
Nice job missing the point. In more than 30 years around professional sports, I’ve never covered an athlete with Moore’s depth, compassion and grace. There’s nothing phony or self-serving about her. When she speaks of her faith and devotion to God — subjects that make some of us roll our eyes — it’s genuine, clearly the driving force in her life. The autographs she signed for thousands of fans over the years include a reference to her favorite Bible verse, Colossians 3:23, a passage she embodies: “Whatever you do, do your work heartily, as for the Lord rather than for men.”
That’s exactly what Moore is doing. Moore felt she couldn’t give equal attention to basketball and criminal justice reform, so she chose cause over sport. No other athlete in the modern era stepped away from their sport in the prime of their career (she’s 30) for altruistic reasons, to serve others. Not Michael Jordan. Not LeBron James. Not Barry Bonds. Not Tom Brady. She didn’t just write a check and show up for the ribbon cutting. She’s immersed in it.
And no other athlete takes such painstaking care to communicate as precisely as Moore does. Whether a public service announcement, a Lynx promotion or a one-on-one interview, nothing comes out of Moore’s mouth without careful consideration. You never really know an athlete, but I’ve never known Moore to lie. We can take her at her word.
Here’s what Moore told the AP last Monday, in a story not widely circulated in the Twin Cities, about her basketball future: “Definitely not thinking about it right now. There’s so much on my plate to prioritize. When I released the Player’s Tribune article I said I wanted to take a full year. I won’t be a pro basketball player for a year. Maybe sometime this spring I’ll figure out what’s next. For now, I’m trying to be in the moment. It’s a wild journey I’m on.”
We live in a country that demands our athletes perform well, win, and carry themselves nobly. When they fail, we pile on. Some athletes bring the ire on themselves — the drug cheats, the abusers of women. But often we’re so negative and critical that we never stop to appreciate the few truly good ones that pass in our midst.
Moore does everything we expect of our superstars, in every way. A few years ago, she stayed late after a practice at a local high school (this was before the Mayo Clinic Square practice facility opened) to meet with and sign autographs for a group of patient young girls. Moore said they reminded her of herself. It was genuine Maya, at her finest and most generous. She did things like this a lot.
Sure, the Lynx would love to have her back. Before taking her leave, Moore agreed to multi-year contract that kicks in when she returns — if she returns. WNBA Rookie of the Year Napheesa Collier filled her small forward position, but fitting Moore back into a retooled Lynx roster is a problem Coach Cheryl Reeve would relish.
But if Moore needs more time to assist Irons, pursue deeper reform, or finds another cause that feeds her passion, good for her. We’ve seen her best. Not even Lindsay Whalen can match her legacy of success — four WNBA championships, two Olympic gold medals, two world championship golds, and two NCAA titles. In every calendar year from 2009 to 2017, with UConn, the Lynx or Team USA, Moore won a championship or a gold medal. In basketball, there’s nothing left for her to win or prove. She’s a Hall of Famer if she never plays another minute.
Athletic success gave Moore a platform and a megaphone that she’s using to help those in need. She did not stick to sports. Props to her. And if Moore ultimately chooses to devote her life to something besides basketball, let’s celebrate that too. There aren’t enough Maya Moores in the world, doing their work heartily, for the benefit of many.

The GM strike is about us all

Texto completo: The United Auto Workers' five-day-old strike against General Motors is hugely important because it involves so many of the key concerns that American workers writ large are worried about: from factory closings to wage stagnation to jobs moving overseas to corporate America's increased use of low-paid temps. These are many of the economic factors, we are told, that got Donald Trump elected three years ago.
Ever since the walkout began Sunday night, UAW leaders have said the strikers are fighting not just for themselves, but for the larger interests of American workers - and taxpayers. They're right.
The federal government arranged a $50 billion rescue package for GM a decade ago; that hinged on labor accepting major money-saving concessions. The strikers are saying there's something wrong that so soon after, the company, despite earning $35 billion in profits in North America in the past three years, has laid off thousands of American workers and closed assembly plants in the U.S. while opening plants in Mexico.
The strikers are simultaneously angry about another big issue, one they say shows, to use a Trumpian term, how rigged the economy is - a sentiment shared by millions of Americans. Despite those massive profits racked up by GM, the company offered the UAW a raise totaling just 4% over four years.
Meanwhile, many workers ask why GM is demanding they pay more for health coverage after the company made $14 billion in stock buybacks in recent years.
With corporations increasingly using temps, freelancers and independent contractors, making the American workplace less stable and secure, the UAW is demanding that GM use fewer temps. Seven percent of the company's factory workers are temps, who earn $15 an hour; some temps have worked for GM for three years. The strikers are demanding that the temps be given regular jobs with pay commensurate to the far higher pay of the regular GM workers they work alongside.
It's not as though these would be the first concessions workers are being asked to accept. To help keep GM afloat, the UAW agreed in 2007 to a two-tier wage, with the top tier making $28 an hour and the lower tier $16 to $19 an hour. That system remains in force (with the second tier ultimately rising to $29 an hour), but with GM so profitable, its workers want the two-tier system ended.
The current strike is the latest in a long line of confrontations between a union that had long been America's most powerful union and an automaker that had long been America's largest corporation, showdowns that played a huge role in shaping the nation's economy.
In my new book, I write of earlier, historic UAW strikes against G.M. In the Flint sit-down strike of 1936-37, 2,000 workers, furious about poor treatment and production speed-ups, sat down in their plant for 44 days and got GM to finally recognize and bargain with the union. That labor victory sparked the tremendous wave of unionization that took place in the late 1930s.
In 1945, frustrated that wages were not keeping up with inflation, 175,000 GM workers walked out in a 113-day strike. Concerned that such strikes undermine efficiency and production, the company agreed to a landmark five-year contract several years later that gave its workers huge pay increases as well as the best health coverage and pensions in industrial America. That contract set a pattern that was instrumental in creating America's great middle class.
The UAW and GM are not the mighty giants they once were. But both remain important, iconic players in America's economy. The results of the current strike could, like the UAW-GM battles of old, have big ripple effects across the economy.
In other words, this fight isn't just about them. It's also about us.

Texto completo: President Trump claimed that "it doesn't matter" if he asked the Ukrainian government to investigate 2020 presidential front-runner Joe Biden.
Trump made the comments about the investigation into whether or not he requested a foreign government to dig up dirt on a political opponent while he was speaking to reporters in the Oval Office with Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison on Friday.
The issue of Trump allegedly making the request is at the center of an ongoing intelligence and congressional investigation. An intelligence community whistleblower filed a complaint pertaining to a "promise" the president made to a foreign leader. While many of the details surrounding the interaction in question remain unknown, it has since been reported that the conversation "deals with Ukraine," according to the New York Times.
Trump: 'It doesn't matter' if I asked Ukraine to investigate Biden
After labeling the whistleblower "partisan," Trump was asked if he ever spoke with Ukraine about the Bidens.
The president answered, "It doesn’t matter what I discussed, but I will say this: Somebody ought to look into Joe Biden’s statement because it was disgraceful where he talked about billions of dollars that he’s not giving to a certain country unless a certain prosecutor is taken off the case. So somebody ought to look into that."
Trump then claimed that the media "wouldn't" investigate Biden "because he's a Democrat and the fake news doesn't look into things like that." He later acknowledged that he doesn't know the identity of the whistleblower.
Intelligence Community Inspector General Michael Atkinson determined the complaint to be "credible and urgent," which forced him to notify congressional oversight committees of it. He appeared in front of the House Intelligence Committee on Thursday.
Biden's connection to Ukraine dates back to 2016, when he threatened to withhold $1 billion loan guarantees unless the country removed a top prosecutor who was looking into an energy company, according to the New York Times. The former vice president's younger son, Hunter Biden, was a board member of that company.

Paul Krugman: Trump declares war on California

Texto completo: I’m on a number of right-wing mailing lists, and I try to at least skim what they’re going on about in any given week; this often gives me advance warning about the next wave of manufactured outrage. Lately I’ve been seeing dire warnings that if Democrats win next year they’ll try to turn America into (cue scary background music) California , which the writers portray as a socialist hellhole.
Sure enough, this week Donald Trump effectively declared war on California on two fronts. He’s trying to take away the Golden State’s ability to regulate pollution generated by its 15 million cars, and, more bizarrely, he’s seeking to have the Environmental Protection Agency declare that California’s homeless population constitutes an environmental threat.
More about these policy moves in a moment. First, let’s talk about two Californias: the real state on America’s left coast, and the fantasy state of the right’s imagination.
The real California certainly has some big problems. In particular, it has sky-high housing costs, which in turn are probably the main reason it has a large population of homeless residents.
But in many other dimensions California does very well. It has a booming economy, which has been creating jobs at a much faster pace than the nation as a whole.
It has the nation’s second-highest life expectancy, comparable to that in European nations with much higher life expectancy than America as a whole. This is, by the way, a relatively new development: Back in 1990, life expectancy in California was only average.
At the same time, California, having enthusiastically implemented Obamacare and tried to make it work, has seen a sharp drop in the number of residents without health insurance. And crime, although it has ticked up slightly in the past few years, remains near a historic low.
That is, as I said, California’s reality. But it’s a reality the right refuses to accept, because it wasn’t what was supposed to happen.
You see, modern California — once a hotbed of conservatism — has become a very liberal, very Democratic state, in part thanks to rapidly rising Hispanic and Asian populations. And since the early years of this decade, when Democrats won first the governorship, then a supermajority in the state Legislature, liberals have been in a position to pursue their agenda, raising taxes on high incomes and increasing social spending.
Conservatives confidently predicted disaster, declaring that the state was committing “economic suicide.” You might think that the failure of that disaster to materialize, especially combined with the way California has outperformed states like Kansas and North Carolina that turned hard right while it was turning left, might induce them to reconsider their worldview. That is, you might think that if you haven’t been paying any attention to the right-wing mindset.
What is happening instead, of course, is that the usual suspects are trying to portray California as a terrible place — beset by violent crime and rampant disease — in sheer denial of reality. And they have seized on the issue of homelessness, which is, to be fair, a genuine problem. Furthermore, it’s a problem brought on by bad policy — not high taxes or excessively generous social programs, but the runaway NIMBYism that has prevented California from building remotely enough new housing to accommodate its rising population.
The striking thing about the right’s new focus on homelessness, however, is that it’s hard to detect any concern about the plight of the homeless themselves. Instead, it’s all about the discomfort and alleged threat the homeless create for the affluent.
Which brings me to Trump’s war on California.
The attempt to kill the state’s emissions rules makes a kind of twisted sense given Trump’s policy priorities. His administration is clearly dedicated to the cause of making America polluted again, and in particular to ensuring that the planet cooks as quickly as possible. California is such a big player that it can effectively block part of that agenda, as shown by the willingness of automakers to abide by its emissions rules. Hence the attempt to strip away that power, never mind past rhetoric about states’ rights.
Declaring the homeless an environmental threat, however, aside from being almost surreal coming from an administration that in general loves pollution, is pure nonsense. It can be understood only as an attempt both to punish an anti-Trump state and to blacken its reputation.
What should you take away from Trump’s war on California?
First, it’s yet another illustration of the intellectual imperviousness of the modern right, which never, ever lets awkward facts disturb its preconceptions.
More ominously, the apparent weaponization of the Environmental Protection Agency is more evidence that Trump — whose party fundamentally doesn’t believe in democracy — is following the modern authoritarian playbook, in which every institution is corrupted, every function of government is perverted into a tool for rewarding friends and punishing enemies.
It’s an ugly story, and it’s scary, too.

Texto completo: SCRANTON - As a young boy, Rashad Jennings wore goofy glasses and struggled academically. His peers picked him last for kickball.
On Friday, the former NFL running back, best-selling author and Dancing with the Stars champion, told Frances Willard Elementary School students to never settle.
“I remember what it was like to sit in those seats,” he said. “I don’t think I’m anything special, but I think I’m in a special place to influence.”
Jennings, who played for the Jacksonville Jaguars, Oakland Raiders and New York Giants, spent time in Lackawanna County this week to speak to students in Scranton and Riverside and help raise money for Allied Services’ dePaul School.
Jennings’ visit with Willard students was coordinated by teacher Juli Avvisato, who has known Jennings’ agent since childhood.
“I’m hoping students see some inspiration for what can be in their future,” Avvisato said. “I hope our students inspire to be anything they can be.”
Jennings, whose autobiography “The IF in Life: How to Get Off Life’s Sidelines and Become Your Best Self” spent time on the New York Times bestselling list, spoke to students about his children’s book series, Arcade. He emphasized the importance of reading and how he worked hard to overcome academic struggles.
After the speech in the auditorium at West Scranton High School, Jennings posed for photos and gave hugs. Students asked him about his favorite food (sushi), song (“Slow Dancing In A Burning Room” by John Mayer) and the hardest hit he felt in the NFL (Clint Session).
Jennings, the season 24 champion of Dancing with the Stars, signed the cast of third-grader Jaden Tavares, who said he now plans to keep his arm cast forever.
Aiden Diaz, 9, said Jennings inspired him to read. All Willard students will receive a signed copy of an Arcade series book.
“I like the Steelers, but the Giants are my second favorite team,” Aiden said “I’ll definitely read his book.”

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump said Friday it "doesn't matter" if he asked the government of Ukraine to investigate Democratic opponent Joe Biden and his son, and that it should be done anyway.
"Someone ought to look into Joe Biden," Trump told reporters while declining to discuss investigations into whether he and aides are pressuring Ukraine to investigate one of his most prominent political opponents.
That question is the subject of an ongoing congressional investigation and, reportedly, the still-secret complaint of a whistleblower in the intelligence community.
Biden said in a written statement that, if true, the reports show "there is truly no bottom to President Trump’s willingness to abuse his power and abase our country. This behavior is particularly abhorrent because it exploits the foreign policy of our country and undermines our national security for political purposes. "
Speaking with reporters in the Oval Office, Trump said his conversations with world leaders are “always appropriate, at the highest level always appropriate. ”
Asked whether he discussed Biden in this conversation, Trump said: "It doesn’t matter what I discussed. "
More: Joe Biden: Trump suggestion of wrongdoing in Ukraine not credible
The Wall Street Journal reported Friday that, in a July phone call, Trump "repeatedly pressured" Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky, to investigate Biden's son, who had business interests in the country. The Journal said Trump told Zelensky "about eight times to work with Rudy Giuliani, his personal lawyer, on a probe, according to people familiar with the matter. "
As Democrats look at allegations that Trump and aides sought to pressure Ukraine into helping the president's re-election bid, they are also seeking details of a still-secret complaint by an unnamed intelligence official regarding the president's talks with foreign leaders.
"We're determined to do everything we can to determine what this urgent concern is," said Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Cal. , chairman of the House Intelligence Committee.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. , called on the Trump administration to release the complaint to lawmakers. "We must be sure," she said, "that the President and his Administration are conducting our national security and foreign policy in the best interest of the American people, not the President’s personal interest. "
Biden also called on Trump to release a transcript of the telephone call in question, saying "such clear-cut corruption damages and diminishes our institutions of government by making them tools of a personal political vendetta. "
While campaigning in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, Biden said accusations swirling around Hunter Biden's business interests in Ukraine, are entirely bogus and political.
"Not one single credible outlet has given credibility to these assertions – not one single one," Biden said. "So I have no comment other than the president should start to be president. ”
Meanwhile, the U. S. and Ukraine governments announced that Trump and Zelensky, will meet with next week at the United Nations.
Trump's relationship with Zelensky – including a July 25 phone conversation – is the subject of a congressional investigation, and perhaps part of the whistleblower complaint as well.
The Washington Post, citing unnamed people familiar with the matter, reported that "a whistleblower complaint about President Trump made by an intelligence official centers on Ukraine. "
Congressional Democrats said they don't know what is in the whistleblower complaint because the Trump administration is preventing them from seeing it. Trump administration officials have declined to discuss the matter publicly.
Earlier this month, Schiff and two other Democratic House committee chairs asked the administration for a transcript of the Trump-Zelensky call, and other records related to Ukraine. In a letter to administration attorneys, lawmakers referenced news reports that Trump or his allies are urging Ukraine to investigate the business dealings of Biden's son Hunter.
The Democrats said they want to review "reported efforts by President Trump, the President’s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, and possibly others to pressure the government of Ukraine to assist the President’s reelection campaign. "
They added that "a growing public record" indicates that Trump and Giuliani "appear to have acted outside legitimate law enforcement and diplomatic channels to coerce the Ukrainian government into pursuing two politically-motivated investigations under the guise of anti-corruption activity. "
In a summary of the July phone call with its president, the Ukraine government said Trump expressed a desire for a "complete investigation of corruption cases, which inhibited the interaction between Ukraine and the USA. "
Trump aides have promoted news stories saying that, in 2016, then-Vice President Biden threatened to withhold $1 billion in U. S. aid if Ukraine's government did not dismiss its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin.
At the time, Biden's son Hunter was on the board of an energy company owned by a Ukraine oligarch who was being investigated by the prosecutor, who was accused by U. S. officials of ignoring corruption in his own office.
The Ukrainian Parliament eventually voted out the prosecutor.
In addition to the existing Ukraine probe, the House Intelligence Community is seeking to learn the details of the whistleblower complaint. On Thursday, it met behind closed doors with the inspector general of the intelligence community.
Schiff said the inspector general believes the allegation is serious enough to warrant transmission to Congress. But the release is being blocked by acting national intelligence director Joseph Maguire, who is scheduled to testify before the Intelligence Committee next week.
Schiff said others in the administration are also trying to hide the complaint against Trump.
"We do know that the Department of Justice has been involved in the decision to withhold that information from Congress," Schiff said. "We do not know, because we cannot get an answer to the question about whether the White House is also involved in preventing this information from coming to Congress.
"There is no privilege that covers whether the White House is involved in trying to stifle whistleblower complaints," Schiff said.

Elizabeth Warren's 'selfie lines' are becoming so well known that people lined up in an airport

Texto completo: Senator Elizabeth Warren's “selfie lines" are becoming so well-known that they appear to be popping up spontaneously, including at Chicago O'Hare Airport this week, CBS News reported.
As Warren traveled to Iowa on Thursday, a small crowd of travelers gathered around her at an O'Hare gate and formed a line to take photos, according to CBS News reporter Ed O'Keefe, who witnessed it unfold.
O'Keefe reported that the crowd included airport employees, travelers, and even flight crew members.
The Cambridge Democrat has been holding so-called “selfie lines" throughout her campaign, staying behind after her rallies end to take photos and meet with supporters. (“Selfie line," of course, is a bit of a misnomer, since an aide is the one snapping the photos.) During a rally in New York City that drew a campaign-estimated 20,000 people on Monday, Warren stayed for more than four hours taking photos and meeting attendees.
She later told MSNBC's Rachel Maddow, “Yeah, I was there four hours, but I'll tell you what, so was the last guy in line."
The lines have become such a mainstay of Warren's rallies that they are increasingly well-organized, with campaign workers managing the line, according to the New York Times.
Warren was flying through O'Hare on her way to Iowa this week, where she's campaigning along with nearly the entire Democratic field. The Globe reported Friday that among them, the field of candidates is scheduled to appear at 90 events in the state, including the Polk County Democrats' Steak Fry.

Texto completo: Tropical Depression Imelda was nowhere near as widespread as Hurricane Harvey. But in some areas, the flooding was worse.
ANAHUAC, Tex. -- Sitting in a chair next to a green cot inside a disaster shelter, his small dog on his lap, Edmund Hann was in a daze. Two years ago, Hurricane Harvey flooded his home in Winnie, Tex. On Thursday, Tropical Depression Imelda did the same.
"I never thought I'd go through it a second time," said Mr. Hann, 81, who moved back into his rebuilt home 15 months ago. "It was 31 inches of water in Harvey. And this one right here has got to be at least 40 inches."
Across southeast Texas, residents called the deluge Harvey 2.0.
From Houston to Galveston, Tropical Depression Imelda soaked this patch of the state for much of the week. It intensified on Thursday near Beaumont, Tex., and surrounding rural towns, with severe flooding that shut down highways, left hundreds of residents stranded and reflected some of the highest rainfall totals in the region since Hurricane Harvey in August 2017.
The city of Beaumont was pummeled with nearly 25 inches of rain. In southwestern parts of the city and into Jefferson County, almost 42 inches were recorded this week, with much of it coming in the last 24 hours, the National Weather Service said on Thursday. Chambers County -- which includes Mr. Hann's town, Winnie -- received 36 inches of rain this week, local officials said.
Gov. Greg Abbott declared a state of disaster in 13 counties, including Chambers County, Beaumont's Jefferson County and Houston's Harris County.
More than 1,000 people were rescued in Harris County, the county judge, Lina Hidalgo, said at a news conference on Thursday afternoon.
In nearby Orange County, officials said at least 400 high-water rescues were made, most in the hard-hit Vidor area across the Neches River from Beaumont.
Nearly 140 people from Winnie and other Chambers County towns were staying at the American Red Cross shelter in Anahuac, Tex., after the authorities and volunteers rescued them by boat, high-water rescue vehicles and, at times, a dump truck.
Vehicles were abandoned in the ditches of country roads nearby. A hospital evacuated some patients but remained open, with employees trudging barefoot across the sopping floor to treat the patients who remained. Residents said they had seen cattle in flooded fields, their noses poking out from under the water.
At least 800 houses and businesses were flooded in Chambers County, and officials rescued at least 300 people on Thursday, as well as a few dozen dogs, cats and horses. The officials said rescues were complicated by the swift-moving floodwaters that shut down parts of Interstate 10 and turned rural ranches and country roads into lakes.
"A lot of people are getting flooded in their cars," said Ryan Holzaepfel, the fire marshal in Chambers County. "They think they can drive through the water, but it's deeper than they think."
In Beaumont, drivers were inundated as the water around them reached as high as their door handles. Exxon Mobil shut down its chemical plant in the city and was closely monitoring its refinery on the same site. The Beaumont Police Department said it had been overwhelmed with calls, fielding nearly 600 requests for assistance by Thursday morning.
In some ways, there was no comparison between Harvey and Imelda. Imelda came nowhere close to the widespread scale and devastation wrought by Harvey, ranked as one of the costliest hurricanes in America, second only to Hurricane Katrina, and the cause of dozens of deaths. It also battered a wider region, lingering for days as a tropical storm and dropping more than 50 inches of rain in some areas, while Imelda's heaviest rains have come in more isolated pockets.
But for those in Beaumont, Winnie and other nearby towns, Imelda felt like a sequel.
In certain areas of southeast Texas, it was "higher water than Harvey," said Mr. Holzaepfel, the fire marshal. "It's flooding homes that did not flood through Harvey."
On Thursday, there were limited reports of deaths and injuries. A young man drowned after being electrocuted while trying to move his horse, his family said. The Harris County Sheriff's Office said on Twitter that another man had been extracted from a submerged van and was pronounced dead.
During Harvey, deadly flooding in Beaumont shut off running water and nearly turned the city of 120,000 into an island. Carla Cruz, 23, remembers it all too well. She remembers how water flowed through her home on Calder Avenue, how it took more than a year to replace the furniture, and how she couldn't drink the tap water or shower in the house for two weeks after the storm.
On Thursday, her dog began howling around 4 a.m. Ms. Cruz woke up and swung her feet out of bed to see what was wrong. When her feet hit the ground, she felt the cold water and heard a splash. Her heart sank.
"It was too late for us to try to save furniture and clothes," she said. As Ms. Cruz and her family grabbed a few belongings, the water rose to their knees. When they stepped outside, it was to her waist.
"Outside my house, it was basically like a lake," said the Beaumont native. Her car was filled with water.
Ms. Cruz, a server at an Italian restaurant, said city residents live with "a little PTSD." They exchange nervous glances whenever it rains for more than an hour.
On Thursday, that sense of panic resurfaced for many.
"I know it's weather and we can't control it," she said, "but we went through this already."
As in Harvey, people in the area were stranded, unable to check on the condition of their homes because the roads were impassable. Many, like Jody Chesson, stayed with friends, in shelters or at hotels.
Mr. Chesson, 53, an operator at the Goodyear chemical plant in Beaumont, said he was driving slowly early Thursday morning, headed into work, when he drove his Jeep Wrangler into deep water.
"I put my brakes on, but it was at the hood," Mr. Chesson said. "By the time I stopped, it was over the hood."
He tried backing up, but the Jeep was dead.
"Water was just gushing in," he said.
He could not open the driver's side door. He opened the passenger door, climbed on top of the Jeep and called 911. He was told no one could help him at the time, and so he swam and walked to a nearby hotel. Then the hotel started to flood, and Mr. Chesson and others went to the upper floors. Hours after he abandoned his Jeep at Interstate 10 and Highway 69, he was still stranded at the hotel.
At the Red Cross shelter in Anahuac on Thursday afternoon, children watched cartoons on a screen and raced toy cars in a corner. A woman lay curled up on a cot, a Red Cross blanket wrapped tightly around her. The parking lot was packed with fire trucks, air boats attached to trailers and camouflage emergency vehicles.
The shelter was about 20 miles away from Winnie, in one of the few places that remained accessible to vehicles.
Ellen Barber, 67, lay on her back on a cot in the middle of the room, her cane by her side. She was trying to sleep, but was still too shaken up to rest. The waters started coming into her ground-floor apartment in Winnie at about midnight, she said. She grabbed her medicines and her grandfather's Bible, called 911 and was evacuated. On the drive from Winnie to Anahuac, she said, she could not tell where the fields and the land began and the rivers and bayous ended.
"This was unexpected -- Harvey was expected," Ms. Barber said. "To me, this is worse."

Texto completo: Our guide to the city's best classical music and opera happening this weekend and in the week ahead.
ANTHONY BRAXTON at Miller Theater (Sept. 25, 8 p.m.). Miller's utterly indispensable Composer Portraits series reaches its 20th season this year, two decades in which these concerts have made or cemented the reputations of dozens of composers. Braxton's portrait is more of a retrospective than an introduction, in advance of his 75th birthday next year. The JACK Quartet and Either/Or are on hand here, with the conductor Richard Carrick, for eight works dating between 1968 and 2006.
212-854-7799, millertheatre.com
JUILLIARD ORCHESTRA at Alice Tully Hall (Sept. 21, 7:30 p.m.). Fresh from becoming the first woman to lead the first night of the Proms in London, and a few weeks before starting her tenure at the Netherlands Radio Philharmonic Orchestra, the Juilliard alumna Karina Canellakis opens the school's season conducting Missy Mazzoli's "Sinfonia (for Orbiting Spheres)," Strauss's "Ein Heldenleben" and Beethoven's Piano Concerto No. 2, with Kaliya Kalcheva as the soloist.
212-721-6500, lincolncenter.org
NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC at David Geffen Hall (Sept. 26, 7:30 p.m.; through Sept. 28). One of the most enticing programs of the Philharmonic's entire season, these concerts pair Schoenberg's revolutionary "Erwartung," featuring Katarina Karneus as the vocal soloist, with Bartok's terrifying one-act opera, "Bluebeard's Castle." Nina Stemme, the great dramatic soprano of our time, sings Judith in the Bartok, opposite the Bluebeard of Johannes Martin Kränzle, in a production directed by Bengt Gomer. Jaap van Zweden conducts.

ORPHEUS CHAMBER ORCHESTRA at Carnegie Hall (Sept. 26, 8 p.m.). The Canadian pianist Jan Lisiecki joins the Orpheus players for Mendelssohn's Piano Concerto No. 2, a piece that they released on record, to some effect, in February. Also on the bill are Mendelssohn's "Italian" Symphony and the premiere of "Shift, Change, Turn and Variations" by Jessie Montgomery, a work in a long line of music that dwells on the turning of the seasons.
212-247-7800, carnegiehall.org
'PORGY AND BESS' at the Metropolitan Opera (Sept. 23, 6 p.m.; through Oct. 16). The Met's season opens with a gala performance of this Gershwin classic, in a new and reportedly strong production by James Robinson. David Robertson conducts a cast that includes Angel Blue as Bess, Eric Owens as Porgy, Golda Schultz as Clara and Latonia Moore as Serena. After its initial run, the production returns in January with a similar cast. Elsewhere in the Met's first week, Massenet's "Manon" returns (Tuesday at 7:30 p.m., through Oct. 26), with Lisette Oropesa in the title role and Michael Fabiano as the Chevalier des Grieux; and Anna Netrebko strides the stage she rules in Verdi's "Macbeth" (Wednesday at 8 p.m., through Oct. 12), opposite Matthew Polenzani, Ildar Abdrazakov and Plácido Domingo, who will continue to sing at the house while it awaits the results of the Los Angeles Opera's investigation into accusations of sexual harassment against him.
212-362-6000, metopera.org
ADAM TENDLER AND JENNY LIN at the Catacombs of the Green-Wood Cemetery (Sept. 24-27, 7:30 p.m.). Liszt's "Harmonies Poétiques et Religieuses" is hardly ever heard in its entirety, and makes such demands of its players that two pianists will be on hand here. They'll find themselves plentifully employed. A massive cycle of 10 piano pieces, "Harmonies" includes some of the composer's most famous and pyrotechnic music, not least "Funérailles," but also some of his most tender and gentle, including "Bénédiction de Dieu dans la Solitude." The performance begins at 7:30 p.m., but there's a whiskey tasting before that, starting at 6 p.m.

The smearing of Brett Kavanaugh continues

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — A Columbia Journalism Review poll released this year found that half of all Americans have “hardly any confidence at all” in the media, which beat out even Congress as the institution for which the public has the lowest confidence. It’s not hard to see why. Last week, CNN reported that the CIA was forced to pull a highly placed source inside the Kremlin because of concerns that President Trump might burn him — when it turns out the decision to extract the source was made before Trump took office because of leaks from senior Obama administration officials.
Now, The New York Times has published an adapted excerpt from a new book by Times reporters Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly in which they breathlessly describe a “previously unreported story” about how Max Stier, a male college classmate of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, notified senators and the FBI that he saw Kavanaugh expose himself to a girl at a Yale party and that “friends pushed his penis into the hand of a female student.”
One small problem: In the book, Pogrebin and Kelly write that the female student in question “refused to discuss the incident” and that “several of her friends said she does not recall it.” That calls the entire allegation into question. Yet the Times did not include this vital information in the excerpt it published.
Pogrebin and Kelly conveniently blamed their editors for the omission. Why didn’t they insist it be included when they reviewed the story before publication? And how then do they explain the fact that they also failed to mention it in an interview with NPR? When asked by Terry Gross the specific question “Are there other women who have come forward?”, they repeat their uncorroborated accusation without mentioning that this “other woman” not only did not come forward but also does not recall the incident.
The Times was later shamed into appending an editors’ note to the story saying “the book reports that the female student declined to be interviewed and friends say that she does not recall the incident. That information has been added to the article.” Too little, too late. This is simply journalistic malpractice. Indeed, if prosecutors in a court of law were to do what the Times did — fail to disclose evidence that goes toward negating a defendant’s guilt — they could have their case thrown out and face potential disbarment for prosecutorial misconduct. But apparently in the court of public opinion, anything goes.
That’s not all. In their article, the reporters innocuously describe Stier as someone “who runs a nonprofit organization in Washington.” They fail to share with readers in the story the fact that Stier was a member of Bill Clinton’s legal team at the same time that Kavanaugh was working for independent counsel Kenneth Starr on the other side of the Monica Lewinsky investigation. That seems relevant information that could call his motives into question.
Amazingly, the Times story leaves out the one truly newsworthy revelation in the book. During the Kavanaugh hearings, Leland Keyser — whom Christine Blasey Ford named as a witness to her alleged assault — never testified, but her lawyer wrote the Senate Judiciary Committee that while she “has no recollection of the incident in question ... she believes Dr. Ford’s account.” In their excellent book, “Justice on Trial,” Mollie Hemingway and Carrie Severino first broke the news that Keyser told friends she did not in fact believe Ford. But Pogrebin and Kelly got Keyser to speak on the record for the first time. “It would be impossible for me to be the only girl at a get-together with three guys, have her leave, and then not figure out how she’s getting home” she told them, adding “I just really didn’t have confidence in the story.” She also said she was pressured by many who “wanted me to remember something different” and threatened “behind the scenes that certain things could be spread about me if I didn’t comply.”
For some reason, the Times did not find this news fit to print — perhaps because it strengthens the case that Kavanaugh was smeared. The only thing more shameful than the Times’s irresponsible reporting was news of all the Democratic presidential candidates who seized on the Times story to call for Kavanaugh’s impeachment. In light of Keyser’s comments, they should be apologizing to Kavanaugh instead. And if the media wants to understand why it has surpassed Congress as the least-trusted institution in the country, here is a textbook example.

House 'impeachment' circus frays Democratic unity

Texto completo: Impeachment fatigue is beginning to fracture the House Democratic Caucus.
Tuesday’s circus-like atmosphere in the House Judiciary Committee, where Democrats conducted a raucous “impeachment” hearing featuring former Trump 2016 campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, was over. But it was followed Wednesday morning by a noticeable impeachment hangover in the halls of the Capitol.
House Democrats heading into a weekly closed-door planning meeting were eager to get back to the legislative agenda, but the media remained focused on the hearing and the party’s efforts, led by House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, to ferret out the evidence many liberal Democrats are seeking to impeach President Trump.
Liberal Democrats ratcheted up the impeachment frenzy Tuesday when Massachusetts Rep. Ayanna Pressley introduced a resolution calling on the House Judiciary panel to open an impeachment inquiry into Justice Brett Kavanaugh over new, but now in question, proof of allegations of sexual misconduct dating back to his teenage years.
Moderates, meanwhile, fear the impeachment saturation could doom their reelection efforts.
“Am I concerned? The answer is yes!” Democratic Florida Rep. Donna Shalala told the Washington Examiner. “In my district, I’m not getting asked about impeachment. I’m being asked about healthcare, I’m being asked about the environment, and about infrastructure. It’s not like around the country they are thinking about impeachment. It’s a Washington phenomenon as far as I can tell.”
Shalala and other Democrats now regularly express concern privately to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi that the wall-to-wall impeachment effort by House Democrats is blocking their legislative agenda from public view. How can they convince constituents they are working on lowering prescription drug prices, some Democratic lawmakers have complained, when the news cycle revolves primarily around Nadler’s weekly confrontational hearings related to impeachment?
Pelosi tells lawmakers to stay “on message” about the Democratic agenda, which includes a House-passed gun background check bill and will soon include a prescription drug measure Shalala is eager to advance.
“She’s doing what she can do,” Shalala said. “She’s saying, 'Keep your eye on the ball.' That is what she is saying to us.”
Pelosi has privately clashed with Nadler over his aggressive impeachment agenda, arguing the public does not support it and it does not have the 218 votes to pass on the House floor. So far, about 137 Democrats say they would vote to open an official impeachment inquiry.
But Pelosi sites public polling that shows little enthusiasm for impeachment. A Politico/Morning Consult poll released Wednesday found just 37% of voters back impeaching Trump.
Pelosi adamantly denies the House is conducting a formal impeachment probe, but has stopped short of criticizing Nadler and has said she supports his efforts. “Our relationship is fine," Nadler told the Washington Examiner on Tuesday. “I'm not going to comment beyond that.”
The relationship between the two veteran lawmakers has become strained. While Pelosi has blocked the House from formally voting to open an impeachment inquiry, Nadler declared he is authorized to begin one even without a House vote.
Tuesday’s event marked the first official hearing in the impeachment inquiry. It was a nearly six-hour event loaded with made-for-TV theatrics from both the lawmakers and Lewandowski, the lone witness Democrats believe can help prove Trump tried to block a two-year investigation into his campaign.
The “ridiculous” hearing, as one senior Democrat labeled it, led Tuesday’s news coverage, and reporters swarmed lawmakers Wednesday to talk about the fireworks.
“It looked like a lot of theatre yesterday, when you have witnesses that come to a committee and don’t want to tell the committee anything.” House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot Engel said. “It actually shows the administration’s contempt for Congress. Then it becomes ridiculous. That is what we had yesterday, and I think it’s clear that is what we are going to continue to have.”
Democratic Rhode Island Rep. David Cicilline lamented a poll that indicates voters believe Congress mostly conducts investigations and little else. He blamed the media.
“There was virtually no coverage on the work we have done,” said Cicilline, who backs impeachment. “Part of the responsibility is frankly on the journalist to also cover the work that’s being done by the Democratic majority. We are doing our best to communicate all of that but you know, people are interested and there is a lot more cable coverage of investigations and oversight. It’s better television.”
Few Democrats, meanwhile, are eager to launch a second impeachment inquiry regarding Kavanaugh.
A seemingly blockbuster New York Times story published Saturday about Kavanaugh's conduct in college unraveled in the following days, and lawmakers in the House and Senate quickly cooled to the idea trying to remove him from the Supreme Court, despite Democratic presidential candidates calling for his ouster.
Nadler, whose panel would lead such an inquiry, dismissed the idea outright.
"We have our hands full with impeaching the president right now, and that's going to take up our limited resources and time for a while," Nadler said during an interview Monday on WNYC.

Texto completo: Today is Thursday, Sept. 19, the 262nd day of 2019. There are 103 days left in the year.
Today's Highlight in History:
On Sept. 19, 2008, struggling to stave off financial catastrophe, the Bush administration laid out a radical bailout plan calling for a takeover of a half-trillion dollars or more in worthless mortgages and other bad debt held by tottering institutions. Relieved investors sent stocks soaring on Wall Street and around the globe.
On this date:
In 1881, the 20th president of the United States, James A. Garfield, died 2½ months after being shot by Charles Guiteau; Chester Alan Arthur became president.
In 1934, Bruno Hauptmann was arrested in New York and charged with the kidnap-murder of 20-month-old Charles A. Lindbergh Jr.
In 1985, the Mexico City area was struck by a devastating earthquake that killed at least 9,500 people.
In 1995, The New York Times and The Washington Post published the manifesto of Unabomber Ted Kaczynski (kah-ZIHN'-skee), which proved instrumental in identifying and capturing him.
Today's Birthdays: Author Roger Angell is 99. Actor David McCallum is 86. Singer-songwriter Paul Williams is 79. Actor Jeremy Irons is 71. Celebrity chef Mario Batali is 59. Country singer Trisha Yearwood is 55. News anchor Soledad O'Brien is 53. Celebrity chef Michael Symon is 50. "Tonight Show" host Jimmy Fallon is 45. Rapper Eamon is 36.

Same story: disrespect for women

Texto completo: This time of year, back-to-school time, used to evoke fresh notebooks and clean slates, unsharpened pencils and new beginnings.
These days, it brings reruns of the same old story and evokes a familiar dread.
It's the season of “Access Hollywood" and Harvey Weinstein, of Brett Kavanaugh-The-Trial and Brett Kavanaugh-Possible-Impeachment-Sequel. It's the season Antonio Brown surges onto the field as a New England Patriot just days after being accused of rape.
It's the season that has demonstrated, four years running, how little America thinks of women.
First, there was Donald Trump's pussy-grabbing, dismissed as locker room talk, and the dawning realization that the guy who bragged about getting away with it was going to get away with that, too. The following fall brought Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein's horror show, teaching us an entire industry could be complicit in enabling a powerful man and crushing women, even the women we envy.
A year later, we got a chance to watch these lessons play out in real time. In the fall of 2018, when allegations of sexual misconduct emerged against Supreme Court nominee Kavanaugh, our government institutions were paralyzed by the intrusion. Many people defaulted to the assumption that the men seeking power belong in it, because how scary is it if that power structure shifts? What then?
A Supreme Court appointment could be dashed over a mere accusation! We fretted over this for a couple of weeks until he was confirmed.
Now, Kavanaugh is back in the news because a new book by New York Times reporters revealed the FBI never chased down the individuals who might have corroborated claims of his bad behavior. The FBI was in a rush, after all, and hadn't he already been vetted? Wouldn't we have heard something before now if there was something to hear?
The latest stories show it hasn't gotten any easier for us to confront these challenges to power. The willingness to put one's head in the sand and accept the word of an entitled man to protect a brand is just as instinctive today as it was four years ago. Individuals and institutions alike are still willing to turn a blind eye if they're winning.
MIT was happy to accept millions from Epstein, a convicted pedophile, as long as no one found out about it. (News flash: We did.) The New England Patriots benefited from Brown's dazzling performance on Sunday, dodging pesky questions about a woman's claims that he had sexually assaulted her three times. (Addressing it would have been awkward, what with team owner Robert Kraft still mired in his own sex scandal in Florida.) So, carry on, ladies. Nothing to see here.
That is not to say that any one of these men is guilty (except Epstein, who was convicted and whose crimes continue to unspool in garish detail). It's wrong and counterproductive to convict any man on our worst assumptions. But haven't we learned yet how corrosive and diminishing it is to reflexively ignore women's voices, to assume the worst of them ?
The US Senate last year did not have to declare Kavanaugh guilty to conduct a full investigation before declaring him innocent. The Patriots do not need to declare Brown a rapist before saying they won't tolerate it if he is, and declaring the actions and language ascribed to him as abhorrent.
MIT did not need to own the crimes of Jeffrey Epstein; he was the sexual predator. It merely needed to admit that it took Epstein's money while hoping that no one would notice. Instead, it covered up the details, which dribbled out over time.
The New York Times bobbled the handling of the latest book's revelations about Kavanaugh, giving President Trump and other critics an opening to delegitimize them. That's unfortunate, because it landed at the same time as another book by New York Times reporters who broke the story about Weinstein, and that provides a master class tutorial on news gathering, objectivity, and doggedness.
Like all the women who told the #MeToo stories they prompted, Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey put themselves on the line to tell a truth the world might learn from.
How disappointing that it hasn't.
“What She Said" is an occasional column on gender issues.

Striking workers remind us that they saved GM

Texto completo: During the debate over whether the federal government should save the U.S. auto industry in late 2008, a driver rammed into my old Saturn in a late-night accident while it was parked in front of my house. Fortunately, no one was hurt, but I needed a new car.
I strongly supported the rescue effort, so I felt an obligation to look to a Detroit-based car company organized by the United Auto Workers union for a replacement. I got a Chevy Malibu - my kids called it "Dad's Boo" - and remain happy that I did.
In organizing what critics called the "bailout" of General Motors and Chrysler, President Barack Obama was defying popular sentiment. Yet what was in many ways the most radical step he took to revive a U.S. economy in free fall turned out to be one of his most politically beneficial initiatives.
The effort was far closer to what could be called "socialism" than anything in Obama's health-care plan, although he was, in fact, trying to keep the auto companies under private ownership. But socialism or not, the rescue was key to his success in 2012 in carrying Michigan and Ohio, states that would elude Hillary Clinton in 2016.
And it worked - witness GM's $35 billion in North American profits over the past three years. The taxpayers got most of their money back and, by certain measures, even turned a modest profit off the government's investment. Either way, a catastrophe was averted. It wasn't just two big companies that were saved. So were suppliers whose collapse would have devastated the Midwest.
My support for the bailout was rooted in practical economic concerns: Our economy was teetering and could not afford the damage an auto-sector implosion would inflict. But my passion for it came from a concern for the lives of the workers involved and a lifelong respect for the UAW.
Unions get knocked for being unconcerned about the health of the companies they organize. The UAW showed how untrue this is. It made sweeping concessions to management to persuade federal officials to undertake the investment of public money - and to keep the companies alive.
Among the gripes of UAW workers who struck GM this week is the tiered wage system that Neal Boudette described well in the New York Times: "Workers hired before 2007 make about $31 an hour, and can retire with a lifelong pension. Those hired after them (now more than a third of the work force) start at about $17 an hour and can work their way up to about $29 an hour over eight years. They also have to rely on 401(k) retirement accounts instead of pensions. In addition, G.M. uses temporary workers (about 7 percent of the staff) who earn about $15 an hour, and do not have vision or dental benefits."
The rank and file don't like the idea of people doing the same labor at radically different pay levels. And then there are the plant closures that have slashed about 14,000 North American jobs, as well as the announcement that the Chevy Blazer would be built in Mexico.
Symbolically and substantively, the closure this year of the legendary GM plant in Lordstown, Ohio, that had produced Chevy Cruzes was an especially heavy blow - and it flew in the face of President Trump's promise in a 2017 speech in nearby Youngstown that factory jobs are "all coming back. They're all coming back." So confident was Trump that he told his supporters not to sell their homes.
The bottom line is that the strikers are fighting not only for greater fairness and a larger share of the company's success but also for work itself. Too late to avert the strike, GM finally put an offer on the table to begin addressing some of these issues. But the rank and file are restive for more, and for good reason. Those of us who supported keeping GM alive a decade ago - and put our wallets where our mouths, pens and votes were - didn't do so to make it easier for management to outsource jobs or hold down pay and benefits forever. Every Democratic candidate for president should be joining the UAW's picket lines to drive that point home.
The cliche is singularly appropriate in this case: The struggle for employment, pay and benefits in the auto industry is where the rubber meets the road in our too often very abstract discussion of the challenges facing U.S. wage earners in an economy undergoing rapid transformation. The battle at GM is a fight that unions and workers cannot afford to lose.

New York Times reporter apologizes and deletes racist and homophobic tweets

Texto completo: New York Times reporter Gina Chérélus apologized for a series of old tweets in which she denigrated gays, those of Asian descent, and white people.
"Say what you want, but I hate going to Asian nail salons. They feel f---ing entitled, and don't know anything but basic ghetto shit," Chérélus said in a tweet from 2012. "I'm not saying all Asians aren't able, but this can really cause you to make hasty generalizations."
Chérélus posted multiple tweets in which she derided "faggots," "dykes," and "queer" people.
The reporter, who is an editorial assistant for the Times, also made several tweets criticizing white people.
"These white folks man... Lol," she said. "Some white people really just don't get it... Trying so hard to argue against something you JUST DON'T GET."
"Bonnie's storyline on #BigLitteLies really irritates me for a number of reasons. I am just ready for her to snitch and the blame to fall on the white women (but we know that won't happen)," Chérélus said in a tweet from this summer.
TweetTweet
Chérélus apologized for the tweets and said they were from when she was in college. "I have deleted offensive tweets from when I was in college nearly a decade ago. I am truly sorry," she said.
Tweet
The tweets caught the attention of President Trump's son Donald Trump, Jr., who called them part of the "rampant hatred" at the New York Times.
Tweet
The discovery of the tweets come as Trump allies have said they plan on collecting old social media posts from hostile journalists and using them to fight back against hostile coverage against the president.
In the past several months, the Times has had to reckon with several Twitter controversies, including an editor apologizing over comments made about Jews.
This past week, the Times was forced to delete a tweet on its account about an allegation against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh which was blasted as insensitive.

Texto completo: Some years ago, when I was younger and somewhat more excitable, I wrote a series of essays about Pope Francis' liberalizing efforts, arguing that the supreme pontiff's choices risked a schism in the Catholic Church.
At the time my argument was criticized by Catholics on both sides of the church's theological-political divides. Liberal Catholics accused me of hysteria, disloyalty or both. More conservative Catholics suggested I was importing anxieties from my childhood Protestantism into the more stable ground of Catholic faith.
But in the seventh year of the Francis pontificate, those "Protestant" anxieties are now everywhere in Catholic discussions, and both liberals and conservatives are deploying the "s" word promiscuously to describe developments that they dislike.
Thanks to a question from my colleague Jason Horowitz, the pope himself weighed in recently, noting that "there has always been a schismatic option in the church, always." That's demonstrated by recent history as well as the deep past, the miniature schisms after the First and Second Vatican Councils as well as the big 16th- and 11th-century breaks. In each case, Francis argued, the schism tended to be an "elitist separation stemming from an ideology detached from doctrine  so I pray that schisms do not happen, but I am not afraid of them."
That papal formulation is an excellent way to understand what the different Catholic factions think is happening right now. When liberals talk about schism, they have in mind the activities of the conservative wing of the U.S. church, which they believe is engaged in an "elitist separation" driven by right-wing ideology and money - one that simultaneously seeks to depose Francis (the former papal nuncio Carlo Maria Viganò's letter alleging papal complicity in a sex-abuse cover-up being the main attempted coup) and indulges in narratives that veer close to sedevacantism, the belief that the pope is not, in fact, the pope.
The anti-Francis spirit in U.S. Catholicism was the "schism" my Times colleague was asking about, and it clearly preoccupies the pope's inner circle. But meanwhile conservative Catholics fear that a different "elitist separation" is happening - one led by liberal theologians and funded by German money, which seeks a kind of Episcopalian evolution on contested moral issues. Conservatives see this version of schism being advanced in Germany itself through a doctrinal renovation that the Vatican keeps trying to gently redirect, and in Rome through the upcoming synod on the Amazonian region, which they fear will undermine clerical celibacy and welcome pantheism and syncretism.
The underlying dynamic is basically what I anticipated years ago. The partway liberalization of the Francis era has encouraged the church's progressives to push further, while many conservatives have been flung into intellectual crisis or a paranoia-flavored traditionalism. And the overlap of theological and national divisions means that national churches could evolve away from one another at a rapid pace.
But having been alarmist in the past, now that everyone is talking schism I want to be more cautious. The pope has risked a great deal in his pontificate, but he has consistently avoided pushing conservatives into a theologically untenable position, choosing ambiguity over a clarity that might cleave his church.
This ambiguous style, which also encompasses a selective mix of transparency and stonewalling around sexual abuse, has maddened part of the Catholic right.
But it has also ensured that the sharpest conservative opposition is online rather than institutionalized, or among retired cardinals rather than governing archbishops. The U.S. church as a whole is not opposed to Francis; websites and Twitter feeds cannot make a schism. And if - let us say - the Amazonian synod allows for married priests in special circumstances and produces a document with faintly heretical formulations, then as with Francis' ambiguous shift on remarriage and communion, the change will matter, but not enough to break the church.
In Germany, on the other hand, the schismatic spirit isn't just a matter of the maximally online; the German church's current leaders are well advanced in a coherent ideological project that could require a break with Rome.
But the German churchmen are also convinced that Francis and his appointees are ultimately on their side, that Catholic history is bending in their direction, that the next conclave will bring a still-more-liberal pope. So their incentives are to push and then pull back, to advance but then accept correction, rather than pressing their differences with the Vatican to a breaking point.
Which suggests that while the Francis legacy includes certain preconditions for a schism, any true break awaits some new development - another ecumenical council, or at least a different pope.
And this, to return to an argument I have made before, should create incentives for a more open and charitable style of debate between Catholic factions, rather than just endless suspicion and invective. Because if everybody is talking about schism, for the time being nobody is in it - and that "for the time being" could last, like many situations in a fallen world, for an unexpectedly long time.

Texto completo: New York Times bestselling author, actor, producer and director Henry Winkler will be in Naperville next month to discuss his new "Alien Superstar" middle-grade series of books.
Winkler and his writing partner, Lin Oliver, will sign copies of the book at 7 p.m. Friday, Oct. 4, at Naperville’s Community Christian Church, 1635 Emerson Lane.
The appearance is sponsored by Anderson’s Bookshop in downtown Naperville. For tickets, visit AlienSuperstarAndersons.brownpapertickets.com.
Winkler, who first gained fame as the Fonz in TV’s "Happy Days," added author to his list of achievements in 2003 as he co-authored his critically-acclaimed Hank Zipzer series of children’s books.
Inspired by his own experiences, Winkler, whose undiagnosed dyslexia made him a classic childhood underachiever, shared his tales of a high-spirited and funny boy with learning differences. He paired with author and TV and film writer Oliver to launch that popular series for middle grade readers.
Now the team hopes to replicate their children’s literature success with their new "Alien Superstar" series.
Winkler last visited an Anderson’s Bookshop event in 2014 when the writing duo was featured at Anderson’s Annual Young Adult Conference.
In their new book, no one is shocked by the six-eyed alien strolling around the Universal back lot. The tourists think he’s part of the show.
It doesn’t take long for Buddy to land a role on a popular TV show, playing (of course) an alien. He becomes an overnight heartthrob and is suddenly faced with legions of adoring fans, rides in glamorous limos, and appearances at "all-the-shrimp-you-can-eat" red carpet parties. But can Buddy maintain his secret identity while in the spotlight?
Winkler is an Emmy award-winning actor, writer, director and producer who has created some of the most iconic TV roles, including Gene Cousineau in "Barry."
Oliver is currently the executive director of the Society of Children’s Book Writers and Illustrators.

Texto completo: Sometimes when I'm talking about my state of well-being, I refer to myself in the third person as a Delicate Petunia. My body and mind are quick to wilt when left untended. Feeling crushed by a volley of life events this year -- a sick parent, a tough breakup, a tumultuous cross-country move -- I started sacrificing the routine maintenance I need to keep going, instead focusing all of my energy on the problems at hand. I shriveled. A week sans stretching left my neck so stiff I couldn't turn my head. Multiple nights without popping my night guard over clean teeth had me constantly fretting about my next dental checkup. My mind circled back on itself before bed, and I couldn't sleep. Once I realized these troubles had put me at a loss, I then tried to make up the deficit with expensive, indulgent remedies like massages and green tonics, in hopes of reviving myself.
But in recent months, I've queued up a routine with a few simple, inexpensive ways to nurture myself in as little as 15 minutes a day, so that I can feel steady even during life's inevitable droughts and downpours. (I also started going to therapy, because although I find these tools helpful, they can't replace professional medical help. Here's some advice on finding a therapist, if you're looking.) In collaboration with picks from Wirecutter, a New York Times company that reviews and recommends products, here are five cheap(ish) things I use to take care of myself in 15 minutes or less.
Sunscreen as skin care
Applying face sunscreen is an easy way to stall wrinkles and skin cancer. It's also a budget-friendly way to make me feel as if I'm doing something nice for my skin without splurging on lotions and potions that I don't know will work. I prefer the lightweight EltaMD UV Clear Broad-Spectrum SPF 46 sunscreen for my sensitive skin, and I find that a bottle lasts for months. Wirecutter has several affordable, great options too.
Effortless toothbrushing
I sometimes yearn to skip this step in my nightly routine so I can just get to bed already. Since getting an electric toothbrush, though, I've found that persuading myself to brush is easier. Wirecutter's pick, the Oral-B Pro 1000, does most of the work for me. The Oral-B is a cinch to use, and it makes my teeth feel scrubbed clean (I just turn it on and attempt to follow the American Dental Association's guidelines for two solid minutes). Every time I go to Costco, I treat myself to replacement heads alongside a giant bag of snap pea crisps. Balance!
A bright water bottle you won't be able to ignore
As the United States Geological Survey says, a whopping 60 percent of the human body is water, so you need to replenish the supply to, you know, function. Besides keeping my mucosal membranes moist and lubricating my joints, I notice that drinking water throughout the day just helps me feel better and more alert. To keep up my reserves, I bring a water bottle everywhere I go. Wirecutter recommends the Hydro Flask 21oz Standard Mouth water bottle, which is leakproof, durable and available in fun, eye-catching colors. I recommend sipping while commuting, while at your desk, and even when you go out to the bar. If you struggle with remembering to drink water, the delightful Twitter account @tinycarebot can prompt you to hydrate as well as take other small breaks.
A soothing meditation app
Although meditation apps can't replace help from a medical or mental health professional, they're handy tools that can help calm you. If you're just starting out, if you're looking for structured meditations, or if you're the type of person who uses Google Maps because you like being told what to do (guilty), consider Headspace, Wirecutter's favorite meditation tool. With multiple recommendations from friends, my therapist, and even a family I babysat for, I bought Headspace after trying out a few free meditations. Headspace offers options based on time limits -- even for one minute -- or for processing emotions like anxiety or stress. I've graduated to mostly meditating on my own, but when I'm feeling extra frazzled I still pop on my headphones for a guided session to give my buzzing mind a break.
Yoga from anywhere
When I'm traveling or too squeezed for time -- or, let's be real, lacking the funds to get to a yoga studio -- I turn to YouTube's free exercise videos. I do Yoga With Adriene's videos regularly to stretch my tense muscles. (Make sure you're in good health before starting an unsupervised exercise routine.) Adriene's videos have great sound quality, sometimes her cute dog pops into view, and her prompts are never judgmental. And you can choose from tons of videos that vary in length and focus. I've even done a seven-minute stretch in a hotel room after a long day of walking a trade-show floor. If you want to make at-home workouts a regular thing, check out ClassPass's audio classes or apps like The Underbelly from the yoga teacher, New York Times contributor and body-positivity activist Jessamyn Stanley.

Don't revisit the Kavanaugh fight. Learn from it.

Texto completo: When then-Sen. Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.) made the agonizing decision nearly a year ago to vote against the confirmation of Brett M. Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, she was well aware that she was probably sealing her doom in her uphill race for reelection.
"Clearly, the vote hurt me," Heitkamp said Monday. "It energized the Republican base. It for them defined the Democratic Party as - what I heard over and over again - the word that basically was used to describe the Democrats was a 'mob.' "
She is not the only one who believes the fight that ensued over allegations that Kavanaugh committed sexual misconduct decades ago hurt Democrats in their quest to make gains in red-leaning parts of the country. In focus groups with conservative and moderate white working-class women, the organization Galvanize USA - which is trying to bring those voters back into the Democratic fold - was hearing much the same thing.
While many of the women said they welcomed the #MeToo movement, they worried about how their husbands and sons would fare in a climate in which "public accusations without proof or fair trial are enough to bring down powerful and successful men," according to an analysis done by the Topos Partnership research organization.
It added: "The idea that a single transgression could permanently derail a man's life is a deeply troubling thought to these women, whose families include husbands, sons, fathers, and nephews who may or may not have behaved blamelessly themselves."
Here's why this particular group of voters is important: As we head into the 2020 presidential campaign, white women without college degrees are the shakiest part of President Trump's base and a slice of the electorate that both parties see as a bellwether.
In 2016, exit polls and other post- election analyses indicated that Trump won this cohort by more than 20 percentage points, but its support for him has eroded dramatically since then. The latest Post-ABC News poll indicated the president was at best running even with his leading Democratic challengers among white women without college degrees. Only 42 percent said they approve of his handling of the presidency in the survey conducted during the first week of September, which marked a 12-point drop since July.
So no doubt another fight over now-Supreme Court Justice Kavanaugh is one that Trump and the Republicans would love to have - and might get. According to a new book by two New York Times reporters, Max Stier, a Yale University classmate of Kavanaugh who now heads a well-respected, nonpartisan organization in Washington, claims to have seen Kavanaugh expose his penis to a woman at a drunken college party. That conforms with behavior in a separate incident described by another accuser, Deborah Ramirez. However, the woman Stier claims to remember as the victim in this incident has told friends she has no recollection of this happening.
There is plenty here that bears examination. Why did the FBI, when it was alerted to Stier's recollection last fall, neglect to even interview him? And why did it fail to contact people whom Ramirez said could corroborate her account? Was this slipshod investigatory work by the FBI, or was it the product of political pressure the FBI was getting from congressional Republicans and higher-ups in the Trump administration?
What is not warranted at this point is the call for Kavanaugh's impeachment by no fewer than four of the Democratic presidential contenders: Sens. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) and Kamala D. Harris (Calif.), former housing and urban development secretary Julián Castro and former congressman Beto O'Rourke (Tex.).
Heitkamp, for one, thinks Democrats should tread cautiously. "There's no do-overs" on the Kavanaugh confirmation, she told me. "You can talk about impeachment. It's not going to happen. So the important thing is to figure out what in the process went wrong and how do you fix that process."
Those who favor pushing for Kavanaugh's impeachment will argue that there is now more evidence that he committed perjury during his Senate testimony. But this would not come as a revelation to most Americans.
Polling around the time of the Senate confirmation vote showed that only 1 in 4 believed that Kavanaugh was being entirely honest about his actions. "The problem that he had with his veracity was a pivotal point for me," said Heitkamp. "I think he lied repeatedly about small stuff, and you know, when people lie about small stuff, they'll lie about big stuff. But I think for the democracy, it's more important that you get to what was happening internally at the FBI."
The Kavanaugh fight is over. But its unanswered questions need answers. We owe future justices - and ourselves - something better than a mystery.

Comey 'would love to see maximum transparency' in Kavanaugh investigation

Texto completo: Don't blame the FBI for not following every lead in its investigation into Justice Brett Kavanaugh, said former FBI Director James Comey.
"I would love to see maximum transparency, but I think the focus on the bureau is misplaced," Comey told an audience Monday evening during a book discussion in Washington, D.C., with his former special assistant Josh Campbell.
In contrast with other inquiries that are directed internally and "special agents will follow leads the ends of the earth," Comey said the constraints of the Kavanaugh inquiry can be traced back to the White House and Congress. “I promise you it wasn't an FBI decision," Comey said.
Kavanaugh is back in the news this week after a pair of New York Times reporters brought to light an allegation that the judge made inappropriate sexual contact with a female student at Yale University in the mid-1980s. The FBI reportedly did not investigate the newly-publicized claim, which came from a fellow male student.
During Kavanaugh's confirmation process, the Republican-led Senate Judiciary Committee gave the FBI a week to conduct its reopened background check and they interviewed 10 witnesses about the alleged instances of sexual misconduct. That number is only a fraction of the more than 50 names provided by the bureau by lawyers for Christine Blasey Ford and Deborah Ramirez, two women who leveled accusations against Kavanaugh.
Democrats are calling the FBI's supplemental background investigation a "sham" and are demanding answers about who constrained their efforts. Liberal activist organizations and some 2020 Democratic candidates have also called for Kavanaugh to be impeached.
On the Republican side, Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley, who was chairman of the Judiciary Committee during Kavanaugh's confirmation, defended the panel's review as "incredibly thorough." "My team spoke with 45 individuals and took 25 written statements," Grassley said on the Senate floor on Monday. "In the end, there was no credible evidence to support any of the allegations."
Although Comey was not director during the Kavanaugh saga last year after having been fired by President Trump in May 2017. Republicans and Democrats alike, however, have criticized him for his handling of investigations into Hillary Clinton's emails and Russian election interference, as well as his handling of sensitive information. Trump has stirred outrage against the FBI, describing the bureau as "corrupt" and full of "dirty cops."
No stranger to backlash in the political arena, Comey offered insight into the conundrum faced by his successor, Christopher Wray, while also stating he does not want to be an "armchair quarterback" that creates blowback for the current director.
Where the FBI's credibility is an issue, Comey said the response in an ideal world would be to offer all the facts to "foster confidence" in the American people.
"As the FBI director, you have to be thoughtful about what impact you making a disclosure about what you did during an investigation might have on future Senate relationships or future White House relationships, but those are the places for people to go ask questions," Comey said. "What did you allow the bureau to do and what didn't you allow the bureau to do?"

Texto completo: Nearly one year after Justice Brett Kavanaugh was accused of sexual misconduct during an eleventh-hour attempt to derail his nomination, a New York Times "bombshell" article was just published alleging more sexual misconduct. The piece, based on an upcoming book on the subject, was updated a day later with a rather important note that undercut the previous day's claim: The woman in question has no recollection of the alleged assault.
Still, the intended damage had been done. Several Democratic presidential candidates such as Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren (but notably, not Joe Biden) called for Kavanaugh's impeachment. Meanwhile, the usual suspects on the Left bloviated about how a sexual deviant is supposedly seated on the highest court in the land.
What was meant to unite Democrats has also ignited renewed conservative support for Kavanaugh. And for the most part, conservatives of all stripes, both strident Trump supporters and Never Trump devotees, are decrying the leftist smear tactics on display in the renewed attack on Kavanaugh.
While it is true that some conservatives voted for President Trump because of the opportunity to place at least one justice on the Supreme Court, many who were just as concerned about the makeup of the bench chose not to support him on Election Day.
Never Trumpers may take issue with much of what the president says and does, but this does not mean they approve of smear campaigns built on nothing but baseless accusations. If the defense of Kavanaugh were simply about tribalism, those who routinely condemn the Trump administration would not extend support to a man nominated by the president.
Intraparty politics must be, and largely have been, set aside.
Take, for example, National Review writer David French, who is well-known for his criticism of the president. But his dislike of Trump does not bleed into his defense of Kavanaugh, whose accusers French says lack credibility:
In the last 24 hours, I’ve seen a number of progressives marveling at the renewed conservative ferocity in defense of Kavanaugh. But where is the acknowledgment of the very substantial differences between the claims against Kavanaugh and virtually any other recent high-profile claim of sexual misconduct — either in the #MeToo era or before? The Democrats cannot and will not remove Kavanaugh. When the Senate voted for his confirmation, it not only endorsed his considerable qualifications, it rejected accusations of misconduct that were never supported by meaningful evidence. To call him 'credibly accused' is to continue to smear a man. He was never 'credibly accused' by any meaningful standard, and he is not 'credibly accused' today.
Democrats may look at French and others who routinely lambaste President Trump and question their passionate defense of Kavanaugh. But the real question is, why wouldn't they defend him?
If the tables were turned and a Democrat appointed a left-leaning judge who was then subjected to a smear campaign, defending that individual against unsubstantiated claims would be a task not confined to one political party. Unfounded claims of sexual impropriety should never be used in an effort to eradicate the political opposition. The Democrats’ embrace of such tactics will surely have political consequences and may even push some reluctant voters to vote for Trump in 2020.
But not all who offer a defense of the justice do so because of their allegiance to President Trump. Thankfully, many who regularly criticize our commander in chief are capable of treating any news about Kavanaugh with the individual attention it deserves. Yet don't expect the same from his detractors on the Left, who rush to impugn the justice based on his politics alone.

Texto completo: One of the two New York Times reporters behind the much-maligned article detailing a new accusation of sexual misconduct against Brett Kavanaugh acknowledged that she knew the Supreme Court justice in college.
Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly adapted a story from their upcoming book for an article in the New York Times about Kavanaugh. The piece, which was published on Saturday, alleged that one of Kavanaugh's classmates at Yale University said he made inappropriate sexual contact with a female student. However, the article failed to mention that the female student who was the alleged victim has no recollection of the supposed event and declined to be interviewed.
Pogrebin appeared on WMAL's "Mornings on the Mall" to discuss the omitted details Tuesday morning, and she acknowledged that she and Kavanaugh were both in Yale University's class of 1987.
"I was in Brett's class at Yale," she admitted. "It didn't influence it. We weren't friends. I knew him to kind of say hello."

Pogrebin went on to say, "I had varsity athletes as roommates, and he hung with kind of an athletic crowd, and so, we overlapped to that extent." She said it did help her reach out to people for the book.
The New York Times' article failed to acknowledge the connection between Pogrebin and Kavanaugh.
Back when the first allegations of sexual misconduct against Kavanaugh came out about a year ago, Pogrebin and Kelly appeared on the New York Times' podcast "The Daily."
In the episode, which aired on Oct. 2, 2018, Pogrebin acknowledged they were classmates, said she was "in his freshman year dorm," and that she "has a vague memory of him." Kelly also revealed she grew up in the Washington, D.C., area and went to a private all-girls school that was similar to Kavanaugh's. However, she acknowledged that the two schools have not been linked.

GOP leader slams 'declining journalistic principles' in Kavanaugh reporting

Texto completo: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell condemned the decrease in journalistic standards following a New York Times story that claimed to have evidence proving Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh engaged in sexual misconduct decades ago.
“I’m distressed about the declining journalistic principles so much on display across all of the world of journalism, up to and including of all publications, the New York Times,” McConnell said Tuesday in a briefing with reporters. “It’s a very distressing development.”
McConnell said the Times “ought to be embarrassed” and all reporters “ought to feel badly” about the Kavanaugh story.
The piece was published Saturday night and made new claims relating to old allegations of sexual misconduct against Kavanaugh stemming from his teenage years.
One claim included a report by an old classmate who said he witnessed Kavanaugh with his pants down at a party and saw Kavanaugh’s friends push his genitals into the hands of a female partygoer.
The story was updated the next day to include the fact that the woman in question was not interviewed for the story and told friends she does not recall the event described by the former classmate.
The New York Times also omitted the background of that classmate, Max Stier, who served as a defense attorney for President Bill Clinton during his impeachment. Stier at the time was pitted against Kavanaugh, who worked for then-independent counsel Ken Starr.
“I know most of you went to journalism school,” McConnell said. “My guess is the first class you had was about including all of the relevant points on both sides of the argument.”
The article also touted seven people who could corroborate a story by former Yale University classmate Deborah Ramirez involving Kavanaugh, where at another party he allegedly pushed his genitals into her face while she was severely intoxicated.
But none of the seven people were firsthand witnesses, and some never connected the event specifically to Kavanaugh.
The New York Times has stood by the story, and the reporters said they accidentally removed the reference to the woman described in the second sexual misconduct claim who said she did not remember such an incident.

Resumen: Climate change is a major talking point in the Democratic presidential primaries. When will they pay attention to the solution that actually works?

Texto completo: Want to do something about climate change by reducing carbon emissions? If you’re serious, that “something” has to include a massive commitment to the construction of new nuclear power plants worldwide, as well as making sure that existing nuclear power plants don’t go offline until they can be replaced by new ones.
Nuclear power is the only major, established, proven source of power that has zero carbon emissions. Of the carbon-free alternatives, only hydroelectric has a long track record as a major power source, and you can only dam so many rivers; solar and wind are still in the teething stages and are unlikely to carry the load any time soon.
Nuclear power is reliable, safe and well understood. If you oppose nuclear power but call climate change a crisis, then you’re speaking nonsense, unless you simply want to reduce energy consumption in America to something like what’s seen in current day Venezuela, in which case you’re just speaking a different kind of nonsense.
A select few are being honest about what is required
Most, but not all, of the Democratic candidates for president are vague on the subject, silent or opposed to nuclear power. But not all. Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey has been a "full-throated" supporter of nuclear power, and nuclear power gets a big boost from Andrew Yang’s climate change plan.
According to Yang’s plan, "Nuclear power is a crucial component in the move toward creating sustainable, carbon-free energy for the United States. However, many people — including some other candidates — dismiss it out of hand. Why does it have such a bad reputation? . . . First, the public’s perception of its safety has been skewed by TV shows like 'Chernobyl' and 'The Simpsons. ' "
USA TODAY Editorial Board:Phase out nuclear power? Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders locked in absurd arms race
Yang continues: "When the (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, Nuclear Energy Agency and National Aeronautics and Space Administration) analyzed the actual danger of nuclear energy compared with other sources, they found that it caused orders of magnitude fewer deaths than fossil fuel-based energy. And that’s not even considering the long-term impact of climate change from burning fossil fuels. With modern reactors, safety is drastically increased, and nuclear waste is drastically decreased. "
That’s exactly right. Yang is particularly interested in reactors powered by thorium instead of uranium, because thorium is more efficient and more plentiful, and because thorium reactors can’t produce materials suitable for use in nuclear weapons. Plus: “Thorium reactors produce less waste than uranium reactors. Thorium waste remains radioactive for several hundred years instead of several thousand years. Thorium-based molten salt reactors are safer than earlier-generation nuclear reactors, and the potential for a catastrophic event is negligible, due to the design of the reactor and the fact that thorium is not, by itself, fissile. ”
If this is a national emergency, nuclear can't be ignored
Yang is absolutely right to make these points, and he has gotten some well-deserved attention. But it’s surprising that he hasn’t gotten more, given how much we’re hearing about the crisis nature of climate change. Because if you take climate change seriously, you have to take nuclear power seriously. As Michael Shellenberger writes in Forbes, if Germany and California had based their emissions plans on nuclear instead of “renewables” like solar and wind, they’d have 100% clean power now.
But they didn’t, and they don’t, and the question is whether the rest of us will learn from their mistake. The International Energy Agency reports that planned nuclear retirements will already lead to 4 billion metric tons of extra carbon dioxide emissions. If it makes sense to keep functioning reactors online longer rather than replacing them with fossil fuels, then surely it makes sense to replace fossil fuel plants with new nuclear reactors.
There’s something of a renaissance going on in nuclear technology, with small "inherently safe" reactors being put forward to fill gaps in supply. These reactors could be mass-produced on assembly lines for much lower costs (current reactors are custom-built on site) and because of their small size could more easily be placed where needed.
Sure, people are scared and invoke things like Chernobyl or Three Mile Island, but when they do, they’re mostly thinking about the absurdly dramatized fictional versions of those incidents. (Shellenberger's column is headlined, "The reason they fictionalize nuclear disasters like Chernobyl is because they kill so few people"). Yang’s plan specifically recognizes this, noting that nuclear power causes orders of magnitudes fewer deaths than fossil fuels.
And the change could be done quickly. As Joshua Goldstein, Staffan Qvist and Steven Pinker note in The New York Times, France and Sweden “decarbonized their grids decades ago and now emit less than a 10th of the world average of carbon dioxide per kilowatt-hour. They remain among the world’s most pleasant places to live and enjoy much cheaper electricity than Germany to boot. They did this with nuclear power. And they did it fast, taking advantage of nuclear power’s intense concentration of energy per pound of fuel. France replaced almost all of its fossil-fueled electricity with nuclear power nationwide in just 15 years; Sweden, in about 20 years. In fact, most of the fastest additions of clean electricity historically are countries rolling out nuclear power. ”
Andrew Yang’s right. So why wait?
It's simple:Nuclear power is too costly and too risky
It’s time for our leaders to get their heads out of thriller movies and start supporting a massive shift to nuclear power. Because it’s a crisis, and in a crisis, you do things you haven’t done before.

New Allegation Reignites Fierce Debate Over Kavanaugh

A new account of alleged sexual misconduct by Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh has put both Republicans and Democrats on political offense.
A book excerpt printed in the New York Times this weekend included a previously unreported assertion that Mr. Kavanaugh had exposed himself to a female classmate in college—though the paper later updated its story to say that the female student declined to be interviewed and with friends telling the paper that she didn't recall the episode.
Justice Kavanaugh faced similar accusations during his confirmation process last year, igniting weeks of national controversy.
He has denied all allegations of sexual misconduct, and declined to comment on the latest account.
But the new allegation—which hasn't been independently confirmed by The Wall Street Journal—has temporarily revived a dynamic that dominated national politics in the run-up to the midterms last year: Democrats are calling for a thorough investigation of the allegations or for Justice Kavanaugh to step down, while Republicans are denouncing the claims as spurious and politically motivated.
Many Republicans viewed the backlash to the allegations against Mr. Kavanaugh during his 2018 confirmation hearings as a motivating factor for conservative voters across the country that helped the GOP expand its majority in the Senate.
"This laughable suggestion is already earning scorn throughout the country, across the political spectrum," Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) said Monday. "A majority of senators — and the American people — rightly rejected these politics of unsubstantiated personal destruction last year."
President Trump tweeted about the allegations on Monday, repeatedly targeting the New York Times.
At the same time, the new allegation prompted some Democrats to channel national liberal support (and dollars) against incumbents like Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, a centrist Republican who voted to confirm Justice Kavanaugh and faces a competitive re-election race next year.
While it seems unlikely that the latest controversy will play an important factor in next year's elections, the episode illustrates just how much emotion lingers over Justice Kavanaugh's fraught confirmation hearing—and how quickly politicians are willing to seize the moment to motivate loyal voters.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – The House Oversight and Reform Committee said Monday it would be investigating Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao for alleged ethics violations.
Chairman Elijah Cummings, D-Md. , and Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, D-Ill. sent a letter to the secretary, who President Donald Trump appointed to the position at the beginning of his term, requesting documents and information about alleged conflicts of interest.
The committee sought additional information about her alleged use of her official position to benefit her family's shipping company, Foremost Group, and initial failure to divest ownership of stock in Vulcan Materials, a construction company that received substantial funding from the Transportation Department.
“The Committee is examining your misstatements of fact, your actions that may have benefitted the company in which you continued to hold shares, and your compliance with ethics and financial disclosure requirements,” Cummings and Krishnamoorthi wrote in the letter.

Cummings and Krishnamoorthi were reacting to reports in the New York Times and Politico earlier this year that Chao had used her position as Transportation Secretary to benefit Foremost Group and "increase its influence and status with the Chinese government, which has extended hundreds of millions of dollars in low-interest loans to the company for the purchase of foreign-flagged ships. "
They also said that Chao had reportedly appeared in Chinese media interviews with her father about Foremost Group – with the seal of the Department of Transportation behind them on some occasions and with her father boasting of her influence within the federal government.
According to the New York Times, Chao does not currently have any formal affiliation or stake in her family's company, but she and her husband Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell have received millions of dollars of gifts from her father James Chao.
McConnell's campaign also has "received more than $1 million in contributions from Ms. Chao’s extended family, including from her father and her sister Angela, now Foremost's chief executive," the Times wrote.
The Wall Street Journal had first reported Chao's initial failure to divest from stock in Vulcan Materials. The committee noted that the Department of Transportation admitted in June 2019 that Chao's May 2018 financial disclosure report had contained "inadvertent misstatements of fact" regarding Chao's ownership of the shares.
The committee gave Chao a deadline of Sept. 30 to comply with its requests, though the Trump administration has been reluctant to comply with House Democrats' oversight requests.

This is the Brett Kavanaugh mess we feared

Texto completo: In September 2018, I warned about the abbreviated FBI investigation into allegations that Brett Kavanaugh engaged in sexually aggressive behavior: "If Democrats retake one or both houses in November, they will be able to investigate, subpoena witnesses and conduct their own inquiry. The result will be a cloud over the Supreme Court and possible impeachment hearings. ... Kavanaugh has not cleared himself but rather undermined faith in the judicial system that presumes that facts matter."
And sure enough, two New York Times reporters have found multiple witnesses to the allegations from Deborah Ramirez that Kavanaugh exposed himself during a dorm party at Yale. One newly discovered witness had information concerning yet another, similar event. That witness, Max Stier, is the chief executive of Partnership for Public Service, a nonpartisan group that, among other things, tracks nominations and confirmations. According to the Times report, he brought the information to the Senate Judiciary Committee (to whom? And who knew about this?) and to the FBI. (I have relied on Stier for expertise about the federal government and found him to be scrupulously nonpartisan and honest.) He might have been a compelling witness. The New York Times now reports that the woman involved in the incident Stier witnessed does not remember it.
Democratic candidates Sens. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Kamala Harris, D-Calif., as well as Julián Castro, are arguing for impeachment on the theory that Kavanaugh lied about his past conduct and engaged in sexually abusive behavior. There is certainly merit in the idea that regardless of the Senate's unwillingness to remove him, the American people should understand just who this justice is, how the investigation of him was rigged and how his elevation to the Supreme Court has sullied the institution. That might figure prominently if and when a Democratic president has the chance to reshape the court.
Ilyse Hogue, head of NARAL Pro-Choice America, told me, "Americans should be appalled that GOP Senators are complicit in the cover-up of Brett M. Kavanaugh's abuses rather than demanding all evidence be brought (to) light before confirmation." She continued, "We can't undo the wrongs that have been done to these women, but we can and will make those who refused them justice pay at the polls next year. We're hearing from voters from Maine to Colorado who are committed to make this count."
And speaking of Maine, it's Republican Sen. Susan Collins who will once more receive the lion's share of the criticism and anger. Not only did she cast the last holdout vote on the premise that Kavanaugh would uphold the right to an abortion (!), but she accepted an obviously fraudulent investigation. Had she demanded a real inquiry, including witnesses we now know about, the truth might have come out before Kavanaugh was elevated to the court. The Supreme Court might not have been grievously diminished. Collins was already high on the list of progressives' targets for 2020. This will be one more reminder that she utterly failed in her role to render advice and consent on judicial nominees.
The latest Kavanaugh revelations, as we predicted, were inevitable. The cursory and artificially restricted FBI investigation was a farce, a Kabuki dance to give Republicans cover to vote for him. When a Democratic majority in the House and a Democratic president (if they prevail in 2020) decide to waive privileges, open the investigation up to scrutiny and demand that FBI Director Christopher Wray testify, more and more evidence will tumble out. And then what? We'll revisit the fight we had in the Kavanaugh hearing. While a Democratic House might impeach him for lying under oath, the Senate would never obtain a two-thirds majority that would leave the "Kennedy seat" to be filled by a Democratic president.
Kavanaugh already is tainted in the eyes of those who believe he lied when he denied any and all allegations of sexual conduct as well as excessive drinking. A cloud hangs over the Supreme Court as things stand, and perhaps it would get darker with some investigation. The credibility, fairness and honesty of the court will be in doubt for as long as he sits on the court.
If Democrats do win the White House, they may pursue this, or worse, ratchet up the Supreme Court wars by adding seats. (Kavanaugh's vote shouldn't count! And the Gorsuch seat was illegitimate too!)
The Supreme Court will continue to hemorrhage respect and legitimacy. And the pattern will continue, another institutional casualty in the Trump era. If only Collins had displayed the courage to demand a legitimate investigation, both parties, the Senate and the Supreme Court might have avoided this debacle.

The story of Samuel Chase, the only Supreme Court justice ever impeached

Texto completo: Calls to impeach Supreme Court Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh came from at least four Democratic presidential candidates over the weekend as the New York Times revealed a third alleged incident of sexual misconduct when Kavanaugh was a young man.
If the House voted for an impeachment trial, Kavanaugh wouldn't have a lot of company in the ranks of justices past. Only one other justice has ever been impeached, and it was more than 200 years ago.
Samuel Chase was a frequent subject of the rumor mill for his entire life. As a lawyer in Annapolis in the 1760s, he was expelled from a debating society for "extremely irregular and indecent" behavior. He was also an early critic of the Stamp Act and headed up Anne Arundel County's chapter of the Sons of Liberty.
His height and broadness added to his gruff and intimidating personality. He also had a reddish-brown complexion, earning him the nickname "Old Bacon Face" - which some might consider its own impeachable offense.
In 1776, Chase signed the Declaration of Independence representing Maryland. By the 1780s, he had moved to Baltimore, where he rose through the ranks as a judge.
President George Washington nominated Chase to the Supreme Court in 1796. At the time though, the highest court in the land had little to do, so justices still served on lower courts.
And those lower courts are where Chase's problems arose.
While presiding over the 1800 sedition trial of Thomas Cooper, Chase railed against Cooper during his instructions to the jury, seeming to act more as a prosecutor than a judge.
Before a treason trial in Philadelphia, he showed defense attorneys his opinion before the trial had taken place. He later sentenced the man to death. (President John Adams pardoned him.)
At a sedition trial in Richmond, he sat a juror who said he had already made up his mind that the defendant was guilty.
And while presiding over a grand jury in Delaware, Chase angrily refused to dismiss a grand jury after they declined to charge a man with sedition.
Later that same year, he campaigned for Adams's reelection - an overtly partisan move that caught the ire of Democratic Republicans and their victorious candidate, Thomas Jefferson.
In a 2003 speech, former chief justice William H. Rehnquist put it like this: "Chase was one of those people who are intelligent and learned, but seriously lacking in judicial temperament."
Once they had the reins of power, the Democratic Republicans overturned a law that had created lower courts in a bid to limit the power of Federalist judges installed by Adams.
But that didn't stop Chase. In 1803, before a Baltimore jury, Chase denounced the Democratic Republicans for overturning the law.
When Jefferson found out about it, he sent a letter to a congressman friend of his strongly suggesting that - cough cough, hint hint - only Congress could do something about Chase.
The next year, the House voted 73 to 32 to impeach him, charging that he "tend[ed] to prostitute the high judicial character with which he was invested."
The Senate trial took place in February 1805. Over 10 days, senators heard from more than 50 witnesses, according to Rehnquist. Chase maintained that he could not be impeached for poor judgment but only indictable offenses.
Two-thirds majorities were needed to convict on each of the eight articles of impeachment. If the votes had gone strictly down party lines, Democratic Republicans would have had more than enough; at the time, they dominated the Senate 25 to nine, according to the Senate Historical Office.
But that isn't how the votes went. Though majorities found Chase guilty on three of the eight articles, none passed the two-thirds threshold.
Old Bacon Face had dodged the frying pan.
And a precedent had been set, Rehnquist said, that "a judge's judicial acts may not serve as a basis for impeachment."
In more than 220 years, only eight federal judges have ever been removed from office via impeachment, according to House records - all for serious charges outside of court proceedings, such as perjury, tax evasion and, in one case, joining the Confederacy.

Harris says Kavanaugh should be impeached even though alleged victim knows nothing about an attack

Texto completo: Sen. Kamala Harris said she still supports the impeachment of Justice Brett Kavanaugh, even after the New York Times issued an editor's note on a story that brought forward a previously unreported allegation of sexual misconduct.
The Times said they "did not include one element of the book's account regarding an assertion by a Yale classmate that friends of Brett Kavanaugh pushed his penis into the hand of a female student at a drunken dorm party. The book reports that the female student declined to be interviewed and friends say that she does not recall the incident."
Confronted with the update during a Monday interview on NPR, the California Democrat said, "Well, I would say that the fact that someone doesn’t remember the details of the incident doesn’t mean there’s lack of evidence if there are other witnesses who can establish that the fact occurred. And so I wouldn’t say there’s no evidence. And I must say, it’s very normal for someone, especially someone who has been subject to this kind of behavior, to not be clear on the details. That’s not abnormal."
NPR's Noel King pressed, "It’s worth nothing though, the witness has not established that this, in fact, occurred. The male classmate of this woman, he says it happened, but no one has proved that it’s happened. Does that trouble you?"
"But you’re getting to exactly the point. Someone should investigate that. Because the fact that something has not been proven, it doesn’t mean it didn’t occur, right? But if you don’t investigate it, if it hasn’t been investigated, then there’s not been a full airing of the issue," Harris said.
Harris added she believes Kavanaugh deserves to be impeached because he lied under oath.

The Democratic presidential candidate was among the first to call for Kavanaugh's impeachment after the Times ran a story previewing a book about the allegations against Kavanaugh that were brought against him during his confirmation process. Other candidates that have called for his impeachment include Sen. Elizabeth Warren, former Rep. Beto O'Rourke, and South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg.
In the Times' preview, Max Stier claimed he witnessed Kavanaugh make inappropriate sexual contact with a female student. Stier said he informed the FBI, but they did not investigate it.

Texto completo: Sen. Lindsey Graham assured the American public that Justice Brett Kavanaugh will not be impeached after the New York Times published a new allegation of sexual misconduct over the weekend.
"As Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I promise you Justice Kavanaugh will not be impeached over these scurrilous accusations," the South Carolina Republican said Monday on Twitter. "What have we learned the last few days? * The @nytimes writes first, verifies later. * Republicans are presumed to be 'guilty.' * Democratic presidential candidates are willing to ruin Justice Kavanaugh’s life for political gain."
"The latest attacks leveled against Brett Kavanaugh are beyond the pale. My heart goes out to Justice Kavanaugh’s family for being forced to endure this ridiculous treatment once again," the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee said.

Graham, 64, became a hero among some conservatives during Kavanaugh's confirmation hearings last fall, when he gave an impassioned speech describing Kavanaugh's treatment as "the most unethical sham" he had seen in his political career.
The New York Times published a new accusation against Kavanaugh over the weekend, based on hearsay from a witness that refused to talk to them. The alleged victim denied the event ever happened according to friends and also refused to talk to the Times. The Washington Post said they had the same story a year ago but declined to run it because they could not confirm it.
Several Democratic presidential candidates have called for the impeachment of Kavanaugh since the new allegation.

Texto completo: Leland Keyser, a high school friend of Christine Blasey Ford, cast doubt on Ford's claims of being sexually assaulted by Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh at a high school party in the 1980s.
“I don’t have any confidence in the story,” Keyser told New York Times reporters Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly in their new book, The Education of Brett Kavanaugh: An Investigation, a copy of which was obtained by the Washington Examiner.
Last summer, Keyser seemed to say that, although she didn’t remember the event, she still believed Ford.

“Ms. Keyser does not refute Dr. Ford's account, and she has already told the press that she believes Dr. Ford's account,” Keyser’s attorney wrote last year. “However, the simple and unchangeable truth is that she is unable to corroborate it because she has no recollection of the incident in question.”

But Keyser now says she lacks confidence in Ford’s account. “We spoke multiple times to Keyser, who also said that she didn’t recall that get-together or others like it,” Pogrebin and Kelly wrote. “In fact, she challenged Ford’s accuracy.”
"Those facts together I don't recollect, and it just didn't make any sense," Keyser told the authors.

The allegation against Kavanaugh became public last September during his Supreme Court confirmation process. Ford alleged that in the summer of 1982, Kavanaugh and Mark Judge, a classmate from the all-boys Georgetown Prep, sexually assaulted her in the upstairs room of a home in suburban Maryland.
Ford, who attended all-girls sister school Holton-Arms, was unable to recall specifically when or where the incident occurred or how she got to or from the party. She said that, in addition to Kavanaugh and Judge, another Georgetown Prep classmate, P.J. Smyth, was also at the party, although she says he didn’t witness the assault. Ford said her high school friend, Keyser, was also there.
Kavanaugh vehemently denied the accusation; Judge and Smyth said they have no recollection of the party.
"It would be impossible for me to be the only girl at a get-together with three guys, have her leave, and then not figure out how she's getting home," Keyser told Pogrebin and Kelly. "I just really didn't have confidence in the story."
Pogrebin and Kelly, however, say Ford’s story “rings true” and challenged Keyser’s recollections. “It is possible that Ford’s account is wrong and that Keyser’s lack of recollection is proof of that,” they wrote, but said “Keyser’s memory might be affected by her struggles with alcohol and other substances.”
Both Ford and Kavanaugh testified in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee last year.
“There were four boys I remember being there: Brett Kavanaugh, Mark Judge, P.J. Smyth, and one other boy whose name I cannot recall. I remember my friend Leland Ingham attending,” Ford said during her opening statement, referring to Keyser by her unmarried name.

Ford claimed that “Brett groped me and tried to take off my clothes … I believed he was going to rape me.”

Kavanaugh testified that he “immediately, categorically, and unequivocally” denied the allegations. “I swear today under oath before the Senate and the nation, before my family and God, I am innocent of this charge,” he said.
He pointed to Keyser’s statements that she didn’t remember the event. “All four people allegedly at the event, including Dr. Ford’s longtime friend, Ms. Keyser, have said they recall no such event,” Kavanaugh said. “Her longtime friend, Ms. Keyser, said under penalty of felony that she does not know me and does not believe she ever saw me at a party ever.”

During her testimony, Ford downplayed the fact that Keyser didn’t have any recollection of the incident. “Leland has significant health challenges, and I’m happy that she’s focusing on herself and getting the health treatment that she needs,” Ford said. “I don’t expect that P.J. and Leland would remember this evening.”

A few days before the hearing, Keyser’s attorney said, “Simply put, Ms. Keyser does not know Mr. Kavanaugh and she has no recollection of ever being at a party or gathering where he was present, with, or without, Dr. Ford.”

"Keyser later said she felt pressure by both [Ford classmate Lucy] Gonella and Ford's friend Monica McLean to change her story," Pogrebin and Kelly wrote.
"I was told behind the scenes that certain things could spread about me if I didn't comply," Keyser told the authors.
A group text recounted in the book between Ford’s friends following the hearing included discussions on how to convince Keyser to modify her story. Cheryl Amitay, a grade behind Ford at Holton, urged Keyser’s friends to talk to Keyser. “Maybe one of you guys who are friends with her can have a heart to heart,” Amitay texted. “I don’t care, frankly, how f---ed up her life is.”
Amitay called Keyser “a major stumbling block.”
Another Ford classmate, Lulu Gonella, said she was to meet with Keyser within an hour.
Another friend, a man who’d gone to Holton’s brother school, suggested making Keyser's "addictive tendencies" — the authors describe in the book her struggles with alcohol and drugs — widely known. “Perhaps it makes sense to let everyone in the public know what her condition is,” the man texted.
McLean, a former FBI agent, denied pressuring Keyser to the authors.
Kavanaugh was confirmed to the nation’s highest court by a vote of 50–48 last year. The book, published by Portfolio, goes on sale Tuesday.

Texto completo: The renewed effort by the New York Times to smear Justice Brett Kavanaugh is not just another media scandal. It should be seen as part of an effort to lay the groundwork for reopening the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh's past, with the ultimate dream of removing him from office.
As most of you know by now, the Times published a shoddy piece of journalism on Sunday, which had to be amended after Mollie Hemingway highlighted an egregious omission. The piece, an adaptation of a new anti-Kavanaugh book, centers around a second accusation of Kavanaugh thrusting his penis at a Yale classmate. But the original article failed to disclose that the alleged victim would not speak, and that friends said she had no recollection of the incident.
Nonetheless, the story was enough for 2020 Democratic presidential candidates Sens. Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris, Bernie Sanders, former Rep. Beto O'Rourke, South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg, and former Health and Human Services Secretary Julian Castro to call for impeaching Kavanaugh.
Even in stopping short of calling for his impeachment, the traditional liberals (and relative moderates) in the race — Joe Biden and Sen. Amy Klobuchar — called for more investigation.
"We need to get to the bottom of whether the Trump Administration and Senate Republicans pressured the FBI to ignore evidence or prevented them from following up on leads relating to Justice Kavanaugh's background investigation, subsequent allegations that arose, and the truthfulness of his testimony to the Senate," Biden said in a statement, adding, "We must follow the evidence to wherever it leads."
Klobuchar called the whole process of investigating claims against Kavanaugh during his confirmation a "sham," saying more leads need to be followed and more documents need to be turned over, telling ABC's George Stephanopoulos, "to do any of this, George, you need a new president."
It's important to recall the stakes here. Before Kavanaugh was even nominated, liberals were already bitter over judicial nominations. They viewed Justice Neil Gorsuch's seat as "stolen" because Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell had successfully blocked Barack Obama's nominee to replace Antonin Scalia, Merrick Garland, by denying him a hearing or vote. But while Gorsuch was replacing one of the most conservative members of the Supreme Court and thus not dramatically changing the ideological balance, the replacement of swing vote Anthony Kennedy with somebody more conservative had the potential to shift the court further to the Right, and even put Roe v. Wade at risk. That's why, before Kavanaugh was even mentioned as the nominee, the Left was prepared to deploy any tactics necessary to undermine any candidate for the court.
With Kavanaugh on the court and no conservative justices above age 71, Democrats have no clear path to regaining a majority on the Supreme Court through normal means in the next presidential term, so they have been exploring alternate means. Several Democratic presidential candidates have already expressed openness to court packing. But the idea of court packing is fraught with peril.
Thus, it seems quite likely at this point that any Democratic president elected in 2020 would be under significant pressure from the Left to, at a minimum, reopen an FBI investigation into Kavanaugh that can be framed as an effort to uncover the truth and ensure the integrity of our institutions. The ultimate goal would be to impeach him, but at a minimum, the hope would be that such an investigation would maintain a cloud over Kavanaugh in hopes of intimidating him into upholding Roe, or delegitimizing any decision overturning the ruling.

Bret Stephens: Those who have known tyranny make the most of liberty

Texto completo: A woman and her young daughter, no older than 6 or 7, are shopping for groceries in a corner store of a bombed-out city. It’s sometime around 1947. The war is over, the Germans are gone, the Gestapo is no longer hunting Jews. Some of their local henchmen have been imprisoned or shot. Many just took off their uniforms and returned to their former lives.
The mother speaks with the trace of a foreign accent. As she reaches for her wallet to pay, the grocer says: “Why don’t you people go back to where you came from?”
Where, precisely, would that even be? The woman had fled Moscow for Berlin as a girl, after the Bolsheviks came to power in 1917 and arrested her father, who was never to be heard from again. Later, when still in her 20s, she had fled Berlin for Milan, sometime between Hitler’s coming to power in 1933 and Mussolini’s enactment of the racial laws in 1938.
She and her daughter were citizens of no country, living under a made-up name. They had nowhere to return, no place to go, no way to stay, and nothing they could do about any of it. To go back to the Soviet Union would have been suicidal. Israel did not yet exist. Germany was out of the question. America’s doors were mostly shut.
This was the life of a refugee in postwar, pre-reconstructed Europe. It changed dramatically the following year, when Harry Truman signed the Displaced Persons Act, marking the first time that U.S. immigration policy became actively sympathetic to the utterly dispossessed.
Thanks to the law, mother and daughter arrived in New York on Nov. 13, 1950, with only $7 between them, but without the weight of fear on their backs.
What Truman did became precedent for decisions by subsequent administrations to admit other refugees: Some 40,000 Hungarians fleeing Soviet tanks after 1956 (including a young Andy Grove, later the CEO of Intel); hundreds of thousands of Cubans fleeing Castro’s repression after 1959 (including a young Gloria Estefan); as many as 750,000 Soviet Jews fleeing persecution by a succession of Kremlin despots (including a young Sergey Brin).
There were so many others. More than 1 million Vietnamese, Laotians and Cambodians after the fall of Saigon. Hundreds of thousands of Iranians after Khomeini’s revolution. Over 100,000 Iraqis since the fall of Saddam Hussein. Similar numbers of Burmese. Altogether, some 3 million refugees have been welcomed by the U.S. since the Refugee Act of 1980, more than by any other country.
By almost any metric, America’s refugees tend to succeed, or at least their children do. Whatever they do to enrich themselves, they enrich the country a great deal more. Empirical data on immigrant success overwhelmingly confirm what common sense makes plain. People who have known tyranny tend to make the most of liberty. People who have experienced desperation usually make the most of opportunity. It’s mainly those born to freedom who have the knack for squandering it.
But beyond the material question of enrichment is the spiritual one of ennoblement. Of what can Americans be more proud than that we so often opened our doors to those for whom every other door was shut?
All of which makes this a moment of unique shame for the United States.
The Trump administration has made no secret of its xenophobia from its first days in office. The number of refugees arriving in the country plummeted from around 97,000 in 2016 to 23,000 in 2018. Last week, The Times reported that the White House was considering options to cut the numbers again by half, and perhaps even bring it down to zero.
As if to underscore the spirit of cruelty, the administration also declined to grant temporary protected status to Bahamians devastated by Hurricane Dorian. And the Supreme Court issued an order allowing for a new rule that effectively denies asylum protections for refugees arriving through a third country — a victory for executive authority when that authority is in the worst possible hands.
Critics of this column will almost certainly complain that the United States can’t possibly take everyone in — a dishonest argument since hardly anyone argues for taking in “everyone,” and a foolish argument since America will almost inevitably decline without a healthy intake of immigrants to make up for a falling birthrate.
Critics will also claim that “very bad people,” as Donald Trump likes to say, might take advantage of a generous asylum and refugee policy. Here again I’m aware of nobody advocating a “let-the-terrorists-come-too” immigration policy. Only a person incapable of kindness — a person like the president — can think that kindness and vigilance are incompatible, or that generosity is for suckers.
The mother and daughter whose story I told at the beginning of this column are, as you might have guessed, my own grandmother and mother. I thank God it was Harry Truman, not Donald Trump, who led America when they had nowhere else to turn.

Pin the Asterisk on Kavanaugh; Christine Blasey Ford was motivated by politics, her lawyer asserted in April.

Texto completo: It's just shy of a year since Brett Kavanaugh took his seat on the Supreme Court. On cue, the New York Times on Sunday published a "previously unreported story" claiming that as a Yale undergraduate at a "drunken dorm party," Mr. Kavanaugh had his pants down while friends pushed his genitals "into the hands of a female student." The accusation is similar to Deborah Ramirez's assertion last year in the New Yorker about another drunken Yale party.
What has happened since is familiar. No sooner is the "bombshell" story dropped than it starts to look like a dud. It emerges, for example, that this new allegation isn't really new—the Federal Bureau of Investigation and senators knew about it during Mr. Kavanaugh's confirmation hearings—and the Times never spoke to the man who had made the charge, Max Stier.
On Monday the Times added a humiliating "editors' note" admitting its story omitted a crucial fact: The purported victim declined to be interviewed and friends say she does not recall such an incident. That hasn't stopped the Democrats' 2020 candidates—including Cory Booker, Julián Castro, Kamala Harris, Beto O'Rourke, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Pete Buttigieg—from calling for the justice's impeachment.
In short, the "new" accusation fails for the same reason the earlier ones did: lack of evidence. Any fair-minded reading of "Justice on Trial: The Kavanaugh Confirmation and the Future of the Supreme Court" by Mollie Hemingway and Carrie Severino would lead to the conclusion that the accusations that Mr. Kavanaugh is a sexual predator remain at best unsubstantiated and at worst fabricated. And one way to read Sunday's Times story is as confirmation that, after a year of investigation, the evidence for Christine Blasey Ford's allegation of sexual assault is as thin as ever.
The Times story was adapted from a new book on the case by Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly, both reporters for the paper. But as Ms. Hemingway has written, their book did contain a bombshell: a statement from Ms. Blasey Ford's high-school friend Leland Keyser, who was pressured to corroborate the claim that Mr. Kavanaugh had tried to rape Ms. Blasey Ford. "I don't have any confidence in her story," Ms. Keyser told Ms. Pogrebin and Ms. Kelly.
With no evidence, the prospects for unseating Justice Kavanaugh are nil. So why the continuing assaults? Because if you throw enough mud, it leaves a stain. Ms. Blasey Ford's lawyer, Debra Katz, laid this out in an April speech at the University of Baltimore:
"He will always have an asterisk next to his name. When he takes a scalpel to Roe v. Wade, we will know who he is, we know his character, and we know what motivates him, and that is important. It is important that we know, and that is part of what motivated Christine."
These remarks—suggesting that Ms. Katz's client had motivations other than the truth—surfaced only this month with the release of Ryan Lovelace's "Search and Destroy: Inside the Campaign Against Brett Kavanaugh." Mr. Lovelace's scoop cries out for follow-up reporting, but the Times won't touch it.
This is what Democrats do when they believe there could be a fifth vote to overturn Roe, the 1973 decision that upended the laws of all 50 states to legalize abortion. It's why Sen. Ted Kennedy in 1987 slandered Judge Robert Bork as a man working for an America where "women would be forced into back-alley abortions" and "blacks would sit at segregated lunch counters." It's why Judge Clarence Thomas was savaged in 1991, when he faced his own last-minute inquisition over alleged sexual harassment. And it's why the assassination of Justice Kavanaugh's character continues.
A new documentary on Justice Thomas's confirmation, called "High-Tech Lynching" and airing Wednesday on FoxNation, reveals why smears can still be effective even if they have been discredited or have failed to derail a nominee. At the time of the Thomas vote, a Gallup poll showed Americans found Mr. Thomas more credible, by a 2-to-1 margin, than his accuser, Anita Hill. But when allies assured him he had been vindicated, Justice Thomas wasn't buying.
The new justice told his friend Armstrong Williams that he won confirmation because African-Americans remained loyal to him. In 15 to 20 years, he predicted, "I guarantee you the opinion of me will be unfavorable among that community" because "the liberal media special-interest groups will stop at nothing."
As if to underscore his point, the documentary features Sen. Orrin Hatch saying that Joe Biden—then chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee—had told him he didn't believe Anita Hill. Now that he's running for president, Mr. Biden has flipped the Thomas narrative, apologizing to the woman he told Mr. Hatch he didn't believe. For good reason: Most Americans didn't believe her, either.
It's good that folks are exposing the flimsiness of the latest allegations against Justice Kavanaugh. But those making and propagating these charges aren't interested in getting to the truth. And they ought to be called out as the smear merchants they are.
Ms. Katz puts it well: It's all about the asterisk.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — Democratic presidential candidates on Sunday demanded that Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh be investigated or impeached in response to a new allegation that he exposed himself to a female classmate at a drunken dorm party years ago at Yale University.
The allegation surfaced Saturday night in a New York Times report. A classmate, Max Stier, said he saw Kavanaugh with his pants down at the party, where friends pushed Kavanaugh’s penis into the young woman’s hand, The Times reported. Stier notified senators and the FBI before Kavanaugh’s confirmation, but the FBI did not investigate, The Times reported.
The Washington Post last year confirmed that two intermediaries had relayed such a claim to lawmakers and the FBI. The Washington Post did not publish a story, in part because the intermediaries declined to identify the alleged witness and because the woman who was said to be involved declined to comment. The Times article, drawing from reporting for a forthcoming book, is based on interviews with "two officials who have communicated with Mr. Stier."
Stier, the chief executive of a nonpartisan group in Washington, declined to comment Sunday. A court spokeswoman said Kavanaugh had no comment. The woman did not return a call seeking comment.
The political fallout from the new allegation suggested the divisions surrounding Kavanaugh’s nomination last year will continue to be felt in the 2020 campaign. Republicans denounced the Times report as an effort by the media to smear Kavanaugh. Some seized on the fact that the story — labeled as a news analysis — did not mention that, according to the book, the woman involved in the alleged incident has told friends she does not recall it.
On Sunday morning, President Donald Trump tweeted that Kavanaugh should "start suing people, or the Justice Department should come to his rescue."
"The lies being told about him are unbelievable. False Accusations without recrimination. When does it stop? They are trying to influence his opinions. Can’t let that happen!" Trump tweeted.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, wrote that the "far left’s willingness to seize on completely uncorroborated and unsubstantiated allegations during last year’s confirmation process was a dark and embarrassing chapter for the Senate."
Impeachment calls came from Sen. Kamala Harris of California, Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and former Housing and Urban Development Secretary JuliÃ¡n Castro, all Democratic presidential candidates.
"He was put on the Court through a sham process and his place on the Court is an insult to the pursuit of truth and justice," Harris said in a tweet. "He must be impeached."
Warren tweeted: "Last year the Kavanaugh nomination was rammed through the Senate without a thorough examination of the allegations against him. Confirmation is not exoneration, and these newest revelations are disturbing. Like the man who appointed him, Kavanaugh should be impeached."

Texto completo: President Donald Trump vigorously defended Brett Kavanaugh on Sunday following a new allegation of sexual misconduct during the Supreme Court justice's college years, as some leading Democratic presidential contenders raised fresh suspicions that Kavanaugh was untruthful during last year's Senate hearings leading to his confirmation to the high court.
In an early-morning tweet, Trump called on the Justice Department to "come to Kavanaugh's rescue," and accused critics of trying to deter the justice from rulings favorable to the administration. The president's angry ripostes came a day after The New York Times reported that a male former classmate at Yale had told the FBI about witnessing an episode similar to, but separate from, an already publicized account by a female classmate, Deborah Ramirez, who said an inebriated Kavanaugh had thrust his penis in her face during a Yale party in the 1980s.
The authors of The New York Times story said Kavanaugh did not speak to them about the newly reported allegation.
Many of the Democrats who want to challenge Trump in 2020 have frequently referred to the string of sexual-misconduct allegations against the president himself, but there has been little appetite for making the Kavanaugh case a major campaign talking point, in part because the episode was so polarizing. In the ensuing months, the president has often invoked the case at fiery rallies, insisting that Kavanaugh was the wronged party.
But with the campaign season now underway in earnest, the previous allegations, coupled with newly reported information, are again becoming part of the discourse.
Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Kamala Harris of California both called for impeachment proceedings against Kavanaugh, with Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont saying he supported "any appropriate constitutional mechanism" being used against the newest justice.
Warren tweeted that the new allegation was "disturbing," adding: "Like the man who appointed him, Kavanaugh should be impeached." Harris declared on Twitter that "Brett Kavanaugh lied to the U.S. Senate and most importantly to the American people," and Sanders said on Twitter that he should never have been nominated.
Sen. Amy Klobuchar, a Minnesota Democrat who, like Harris, sits on the Judiciary Committee and is seeking the Democratic nomination, repeated her deep misgivings about Kavanaugh in an interview Sunday on ABC's "This Week," citing his judicial views on the power of the presidency as well as the past and current sexual misconduct allegations.
On Twitter, Trump blasted "Radical Left Democrats and their Partner, the LameStream Media" for targeting Kavanaugh and "talking loudly of their favorite word, impeachment."
"He is an innocent man who has been treated HORRIBLY," Trump wrote in one tweet. In another, he urged that the justice sue for "liable," later correcting the spelling to "libel." Trump also accused Kavanaugh critics of acting out of unhappiness over high court rulings.
"They are trying to influence his opinions," the president tweeted.
Many commentators, however, called the situation yet another troubling instance of the president seeking to politicize the Justice Department and federal law enforcement by calling on the department to intercede on Kavanaugh's behalf.
The New York Times article focused on Ramirez's student days and her account of a party at which Kavanaugh, then a freshman, "pulled down his pants and thrust his penis at her, prompting her to swat it away and inadvertently touch it."
The story said the FBI had failed to interview witnesses who may have been able to provide corroborating testimony, and that the paper's 10-month investigation suggested there was evidence to support Ramirez's account.
The New York Times also disclosed a previously unreported allegation: "A classmate, Max Stier, saw Mr. Kavanaugh with his pants down at a different drunken dorm party, where friends pushed his penis into the hand of a female student."
The article said Stier, who heads a nonprofit organization in Washington, has not come forward publicly with his account, but notified senators and the FBI at the time.
The authors of the Times story said Kavanaugh declined to answer questions about Stier's account, and the article said the FBI did not investigate his claim.

Texto completo: Reagan didn’t meet with Taliban; Disney didn’t dismantle castle A photo circulating on social media shows former President Ronald Reagan in the Oval Office meeting with a group of men wearing turbans.
In a Twitter post that includes the photo, the caption reads, "NeverTrumpers, a president meeting with the Taliban, this is horrific!"
A Facebook post of the photo falsely claims, "Ronald Reagan meets with the Taliban. ‘These gentlemen are the moral equivalents of America’s Founding Fathers’ — Ronald Reagan, 1985."
The item is untrue on many levels, according to PolitiFact.com.
The Taliban didn’t form until the mid 1990s, years after Reagan was out of office. The photo wasn’t taken in 1985 and Reagan never compared the group to the Founding Fathers.
The photo is from a Feb. 2, 1983, meeting between the president and Afghan freedom fighters to discuss Soviet atrocities in Afghanistan, PolitiFact said.
The quote was likely taken from a Reagan speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference in 1985, PolitiFact said.
Reagan was talking about Nicaraguan rebels when he said, "I’ve spoken recently of the freedom fighters of Nicaragua. You know the truth about them. You know who they’re fighting and why. They are the moral equal of our Founding Fathers and the brave men and women of the French Resistance."
The Twitter post, which showed up after President Donald Trump recently announced he had called off a scheduled meeting with the Taliban, has been shared more than 1,700 times, PolitiFact said.
Harris didn’t sue Exxon as AG Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Kamala Harris, during a recent climate town hall broadcast on CNN, told viewers she would fight big oil companies that "profit off of harmful behaviors."
Moderator Erin Burnett asked the California senator how she would fight.
"Would you sue them? Sue Exxon Mobil?" Burnett said.
Harris claimed, "I have sued Exxon Mobil."
That statement falls short of the truth, according to PolitiFact.com.
In 2016, when Harris was California’s attorney general, her office investigated Exxon over allegations the organization lied about the risk to its business from climate change, PolitiFact said. But there is no public record and nothing her campaign could provide to show she filed a lawsuit.
"(Harris) launched an investigation into Exxon," campaign spokesman Ian Sams told PolitiFact.
In fact checks other media did on the subject, The New York Times said, "An investigation, yes. A lawsuit, no." CNN said, "Though Harris has sued other big oil companies, she has not sued ExxonMobil."
Castle not dismantled for hurricane A photo showing the spires being removed from the Cinderella Castle at Walt Disney World in Orlando, Florida, in preparation for Hurricane Dorian, has been shared hundreds of times on social media.
A caption with the photo reads, "BREAKING: Workers have begun removing spires of Cinderella Castle at Magic Kingdom ahead of Hurricane Dorian."
The image has been flagged by Facebook as part of its effort to combat false news and misinformation, according to PolitiFact.com.
"It’s just another iteration of a long-running hoax about Florida hurricanes," PolitiFact said.
In the false photo, a crane appears to be lifting a spire off its base and another spire is completely gone. However, in the original photo, the crane is in the same position while it was reportedly being used to remove holiday lights, PolitiFact said. Both spires are intact.
In the altered photo, it appears someone cloned the blue sky and placed it over part of one spire and completely removed the other spire from the picture.
Disney World told PolitiFact on Sept. 4 that the theme park would not dismantle the castle in preparation of Hurricane Dorian.
According to PolitiFact, Snopes.com debunked this story in October 2017, but the falsehood can be traced back as far as 1997 to a Chicago Tribune story headlined, "25 secrets of the Magic Kingdom," which aimed to dispel a rumor that the castle could be taken apart and said the castle is built to withstand hurricane winds.

Texto completo: Mollie Hemingway and Carrie Severino, authors of Justice on Trail: The Kavanaugh Confirmation and the Future of the Supreme Court, ripped into the latest sexual misconduct allegation against Justice Brett Kavanaugh in a raucous Saturday evening tweet storm.
Tweet
"So I’m reading the new anti-Kavanaugh book by shockingly (really) biased reporters at NYT," Hemingway wrote. "All claimed anonymous sources are anti-Kavanaugh while all but a tiny few on-record sources are downright effusive. Just interesting how highly they contradict each other."
Hemingway was referencing The Education of Brett Kavanaugh, which was written by New York Times reporters Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly. The book highlights a previously unreported allegation of sexual assault against Kavanaugh and offers fortification for previous accusations Deborah Ramirez made.
"I haven’t really complained about lack of corporate media coverage of our exhaustively reported and researched book," Hemingway also said. "In part because it’s a huge bestseller, so it seems wrong. But comparing it to the coverage of this (*shockingly* weak) book is making me want to complain."
Tweet
Hemingway and Severino's book details specifically how unprovable accusations about his personal conduct marred Kavanaugh's contentious confirmation.
TweetTweet
The latest accusation against Kavanaugh was published by the New York Times on Saturday, and alleges he exposed himself and put his penis in a woman's hand during his time at Yale.

'Uncorroborated and unsubstantiated': McConnell backs Kavanaugh after fresh sexual assault allegation

Texto completo: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell issued two tweets on Sunday defending Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh after a New York Times story reported on another sexual misconduct allegation that was brought up during his confirmation last year.
"The far left’s willingness to seize on completely uncorroborated and unsubstantiated allegations during last year’s confirmation process was a dark and embarrassing chapter for the Senate," McConnell tweeted, adding the country still believes in due process and "I look forward to many years of service to come from Justice Kavanaugh."
Tweet
President Trump has also been defending Kavanaugh all Sunday, tweeting, "the Radical Left Democrats and their Partner, the LameStream Media, are after Brett Kavanaugh again, talking loudly of their favorite word, impeachment. He is an innocent man who has been treated HORRIBLY. Such lies about him."
McConnell's tweets come as several Democratic presidential candidates are calling for Kavanaugh to be impeached following the Times' story. Candidates California Sen. Kamala Harris, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Julián Castro, and Beto O'Rourke have said Kavanaugh should be removed from the court.
Max Stier, one of Kavanaugh's classmates at Yale University, claimed that he witnessed him make inappropriate sexual contact with a female student. Stier informed the FBI during his confirmation process last year, but the FBI did not investigate it.
The allegation was similar to the one brought up by Deborah Ramirez, who accused Kavanaugh of drunkenly thrusting his penis into her face at a party.

Hunting for a home? Take these steps now

Texto completo: Do you want affordable housing? If you're young and can't quite afford a house, you'll probably say, "Heck yes!"
But if you already own your dream home, you'll more likely say, "OK, just not near me."
These opposing attitudes are among the top national problems troubling our housing market.
Lower-income, first-time buyers clamor for the construction of affordable homes. But most existing homeowners want their homes to rise in value. They lobby their communities against construction, becoming NIMBY (Not in My Backyard) neighbors.
City councils usually cave to NIMBY demands, blocking development, particularly at the lower-cost end – jacking up home prices. Homeowners love it. Would-be, low-end buyers seethe. So do property owners seeking to sell to real estate developers.
Politicians' main desire is re-election. Their voter and campaign funder base? Homeowners. So they mostly side with NIMBYs, which makes it tough for teachers, police officers, nurses and other service workers to buy in the communities they serve. In California, things are so bad that state legislators tried limiting local councils' avenues to block construction. Approvals have finally started trickling in. But so have opponents' lawsuits.
The frustrating truth: Affordable housing and appreciating home values are in natural opposition. So don't wait for politicians to deliver the impossible. Whether you own or are hunting, weigh these steps now.
Aiming to buy? Calculate what you can afford. Start by determining a monthly payment that easily fits your budget. Mortgage lenders will reverse-calculate this into a targeted home price range. Don't stretch like so many did in 2005, speculating they'd sell at a profit in a few years. Housing isn't a short-term play. Besides, while I anticipate stocks and the economy doing well for the next few years, when they eventually tank, home prices will almost surely follow.
Remember: Location is key Ignore today's trendy neighborhoods. Instead, envision neighborhoods owners will increasingly covet in decades ahead. Prefer up-and-coming neighborhoods to posh, established ones. Choose those with natural or legal barriers to development. That restricted supply will help your home's value.
If you already own in an ultra-posh neighborhood, consider selling to rebuy in an up-and-coming region millennials will crave when they're middle-aged and paunchy.
Also, refinance, especially if your rate is adjustable. Current 30-year rates average around 3.55% – which is near record lows. Figure how much you can save by locking in these low rates. Then shop for the best mortgage deal.
Ignore outdated thinking Ignore the many conventional, wise-sounding but wrong voices of yesteryear still arguing you should send in extra payments to pay down your mortgage faster. If your house's long-term appreciation rate won't be faster than today's ultra-low and income tax-subsidized rates, you shouldn't be buying it or owning it in the first place. If you should generate extra cash, plug it into liquid savings, like stocks and bonds.
Lack of liquidity ultimately causes more financial loss and mortgage default dilemmas than carrying a mortgage slightly longer.

A MONDAY NIGHT PARTY!

Texto completo: Whether it was "a ballyhooed game full of the snap and crackle people have come to expect of these taffy pulls," as Stan Isaacs wrote in Newsday, or simply a penalty-marred mess of a game largely was beside the point.
When the Jets visited the Browns on Sept. 21, 1970, it was a seminal event in the history of sports media, one that the current NFL schedule will acknowledge by having the teams meet again Monday night at MetLife Stadium.
The rematch of the Browns' 31-21 victory coincides with the celebrations of the NFL's 100th season and the 50th season of "Monday Night Football," and is a nod to the key role the latter played in the success of the former.
But none of that was a sure thing that hot night in Cleveland, when 85,703 people packed Municipal Stadium for what essentially was a television experiment.
Commissioner Pete Rozelle had been pushing for a prime-time package for years, and after CBS and NBC turned him down, hesitant to disrupt their entertainment schedules, he convinced a reluctant ABC to go along.
It began with a first meeting between two champions of the 1960s - neither of which has won a title since - and a marquee star in the Jets' Joe Namath.
The larger idea was to make the announcers and the telecast itself part of the show, and to broaden its appeal to an audience presumed to be bigger and more diverse than on a typical Sunday afternoon.
Hence producer Roone Arledge's move to add two colorful characters alongside play-by-play man Keith Jackson in acerbic, verbose Howard Cosell and amiable, countrified Don Meredith to play off one another.
It began immediately, when during the opening of the first telecast, Cosell introduced a montage of brutal sacks - most of which would be penalized in 2019 - from Meredith's career as an NFL quarterback.
"Dandy Don Meredith, how does it feel to review the glories of yesterday?" Cosell asked.
(The entire game is available on YouTube, including ads, the first of which features Super Bowl IV quarterbacks Len Dawson and Joe Kapp pitching Gillette razors.)
It did not take long for the love-him-or-hate-him appeal of Cosell to work its magic.
In his review, The New York Times' Jack Gould wrote, "His parochial partisanship for the Jets was grating enough, but his miscalls of what happened on the field, particularly with respect to penalties, suggested boxing is really more his bag."
No one was certain how nighttime football would work, but the ratings were strong, beating CBS and NBC and securing 35 percent of televisions in use.
That was without any viewers in Cleveland, where the game was blacked out in an era before even sold-out games were unavailable in home markets. That policy changed in 1973, but initially the NFL was so concerned about home-market blackouts erasing the biggest market of all that neither New York team hosted a Monday night game until 1979.
ABC paid $8.5 million for that first season of Monday night games, a smidgen under the $1.9 billion ESPN pays for the privilege now.
As for the game itself, the Jets dominated statistically but were undone by four turnovers (to the Browns' none), a 94-yard kickoff return by former Giant Homer Jones to open the second half and 13 penalties for 161 yards.
Namath finished 18-for-31 for 298 yards, a touchdown and three interceptions, including 10 completions for 172 yards to George Sauer.
Down 24-21, the Jets took over at their 4-yard line, but in the final minute, the Browns' Billy Andrews intercepted a Namath pass and returned the ball 25 yards for the clinching score. It was the only interception of his career.
One of the extra cameras that ABC added for the event found Namath standing still in frustration, with his head down and hands on his hips after Andrews' TD, a dramatic shot the network displayed again in slow motion as the telecast closed.
During an on-field interview before the game, Cosell had asked Namath if he agreed with coach Weeb Ewbank's assertion that the 1970 Jets might be better than the '68 Super Bowl champions.
"No, I don't," Namath said, "but I hope he's right."
He wasn't. Namath broke his right wrist in Week 5, and the Jets finished 4-10.

Bitter End's quirky decor outshines its food The outdoor space is diverting and a lot of fun.

Texto completo: Had I not brought my cousin's 5-year-old to dinner at Bitter End in Wells, I might never have recognized the magic of its outdoor space. Sometimes it takes a kid to refocus your perspective.
What I initially saw as an expanse of grassy lawn interrupted by a few quirky assemblages - crippled outboard motors roosting like crows along a purposeless fence, gnawed lobster buoys suspended above a row of overturned wooden skiffs - turned out to be the stuff that ignites a child's imagination.
Instead of finishing his order of undersalted marinara-simmered meatballs ($10) and terrifically crisp, toasty onion strings with house-made smoked tomato ketchup ($9), my young guest spent nearly the entire night away from the table.
"Daddy! Come take a selfie of me," he squealed to his father, first while propping up an orange steel anchor, then from an oversized throne crafted from driftwood and salvaged lumber. He calls all photos, including the ones I took of our lazily plated dishes, "selfies."
That night I snapped a lot of "selfies" in Bitter End's evocative half-playground, half-sculpture garden.
"Well, there's a rusty metal wheel back there," head chef Richard Ellis said, "so I wouldn't want to think about it as a playground. But I see why you would say that. We just like to keep it funky, you know. There are things everywhere to look at - antiques and sports memorabilia from Pete's collection, inside and outside."
Pete is Peter Morency, who with his wife, Kate Morency, owns and manages Bitter End, as well as Pedro's, a Mexican restaurant in Kennebunkport. The couple has become known across southern Maine for the whimsical and nostalgic design sense that personalizes both spaces, as it once did at Pier 77 and The Ramp Bar and Grill, a property they sold in 2016.
On weekends when the weather allows, live music on Bitter End's wood-slatted patio stage adds another layer to the diverting atmosphere. And with a free-standing outdoor bar the Morencys cheekily refer to as "The Rear End" supplying cocktails to more than 50 customers, it's easy to see why our server told a table of visitors from Virginia, "We're open all year, but summer is when this place actually comes alive."
In the winter, Bitter End retracts into a 30-seat, New American bistro, serving hearty, mostly from-scratch dishes like plump, deep-fried belly clams ($25) that are ideal for dunking into a runny, caper-juice-thinned version of tartar sauce the kitchen refers to simply as "remoulade." I used nearly an entire ramekin, first on the clams, then on the mound of crisp, hand-cut fries interred underneath.
My tablemates also stole some to dip our shared order of truffle fries ($8). They needed it because although tossed with minced garlic, oregano, thyme and barely-there truffle oil, the fries remained underseasoned.
Other dishes went too far in the other direction, smothering any nuance with acid. This was certainly the case with puckery veal-bone demiglace ladled over a tenderloin petite filet ($28). I winced when I tasted the watery, intensely sour red-wine sauce and couldn't figure out if the culprit was an acerbic wine or the kitchen failing to finish the sauce with butter. Regardless, the sharp demi saturated the plate's three, lonely-looking shiitake mushrooms and then leached into the under-dressed pappardelle.
And on the pan-fried haddock entree ($25), alongside an enormous pile of excellent mashed potatoes, sat another harshly acidic (and again, too wet) accompaniment: a scruffy heirloom tomato salad that had been allowed to macerate for an entire day in red wine vinegar, truffle oil and garlic. A pungent waste of the summer's best produce.
Fortunately, not all of this season's bounty is quite so mistreated. Ellis' caramel-drizzled blueberry crumble ($8) - its sweet-crust shell and sugary top layer sparkling in the glow from the string lights suspended overhead - reads as more of a sticky single-serving pie. Break the buttery case apart and a tiny cataract of Maine lowbush blueberries tumbles out, trailing behind cinnamon-and-nutmeg scented juices.
I was also pleased to discover that Bitter End's judiciously limited forays into other cuisines are, on the whole, pretty good. The best of these dishes might be a skewer of four gigantic scallops, pan-seared until just past custardy and balanced atop a black berm of soy-and-sesame infused forbidden rice ($26). Pools of an unemulsified, "broken" Thai-inspired vinaigrette of ginger, chili paste, tamarind paste and pineapple balance out the plate splendidly.
Even the Levantine fatoosh, essentially just a green salad tossed with Kalamata olives in a seductive cumin, citrus and yogurt dressing ($8), turned out to be a winner, despite the scarceness of crisp-toasted pita shards that normally make a fatoosh a fatoosh.
"Fat tush?" our 5-year-old guest exclaimed when our server set down the plate. Through uncontrollable giggles, he insisted someone take a "selfie" of him with the fat tush.
Luckily for our neighbors, who must have grown weary of hearing him gleefully repeat the name of the salad a dozen times or more, he got distracted when he spotted a snarl of knotted nautical ropes dangling over the pink bathroom door. We compromised on a "selfie" there, and quickly polished off the rest of the fatoosh before he scurried back.

Read more listings for art , classical music , dance , pop music , television and theater .
September
Sept. 18
MIDNIGHT TRAVELER The filmmaker Hassan Fazili (who is credited as director, with Emelie Mahdavian) and his family became refugees from Afghanistan after the Taliban targeted him. This documentary is a first-person account of their journey toward safe harbor.
Sept. 20
AD ASTRA After exploring the Amazon in "The Lost City of Z" (2017), the director James Gray ventures -- well, to the stars, with Brad Pitt as an astronaut searching for his father (Tommy Lee Jones) in space. Ruth Negga and Donald Sutherland are also in the cast.
AMBITION Bob Shaye, the founder of New Line Cinema, directed this story of a musician (Katherine Hughes) whose rivals start dropping dead.
AMERICAN DREAMER A driver (Jim Gaffigan) for a ride-share service ends up with a drug dealer (Robbie Jones) as a fare. Which one is the American dreamer?
AUGGIE Richard Kind plays a married retiree who becomes overly infatuated with a virtual reality companion.
BRITT-MARIE WAS HERE Pernilla August plays a woman who ditches her philandering husband and moves to a small, quirky town. Tuva Novotny directed.
CORPORATE ANIMALS Patrick Brice ("The Overnight") directed this sendup of workplace retreats, in which a group of co-workers is trapped while spelunking in New Mexico. Demi Moore plays the boss; Jessica Williams and Ed Helms also star.
DIEGO MARADONA Even if you don't know anything about the Argentine athlete who gives this documentary its title ("the most talented -- and bizarrely self-destructive -- soccer player of his generation," The New York Times wrote in 2008), you will be in the hands of Asif Kapadia. He's the documentarian and archival-footage whiz who profiled the racecar driver Ayrton Senna in "Senna" and Amy Winehouse in "Amy."
DOWNTON ABBEY Take that, PBS: The cast of Julian Fellowes's celebrated TV series reunites for a big-screen sequel in which Downton is graced by a visit from King George V. With Michelle Dockery, Maggie Smith, et al. Michael Engler, a veteran of four episodes of the show, directed.
THE GAME CHANGERS Arnold Schwarzenegger is one of many athletes on hand to extol the nutritional and bodybuilding benefits of a plant-based diet. Louie Psihoyos ("The Cove") directed.
LORO The flamboyance of Silvio Berlusconi may well be matched by the flamboyance of the director Paolo Sorrentino ("The Great Beauty," "The Young Pope") in this satire. It's set in the mid-2000s, when the former prime minister, having lost power, was plotting a return. With the Sorrentino regular Toni Servillo as Berlusconi.
RAMBO: LAST BLOOD "They drew first blood, not me," Sylvester Stallone radioed in the first Rambo movie. But by God, he'll draw last. Stallone stars in -- and devised the story for -- what is being billed as the final installment of his second-most-beloved franchise (after "Rocky").
RUNNING WITH THE DEVIL Nicolas Cage and Laurence Fishburne play drug traffickers assigned to scrutinize their organization's supply chain.
WHERE'S MY ROY COHN? President Trump reportedly asked that question to express his disappointment in his attorney general at the time, Jeff Sessions. For more illumination on what he meant, catch this documentary from Matt Tyrnauer. It chronicles this notorious New York lawyer's career, which included the prosecutions of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg that made his name in the Cold War. He died from complications of AIDS in 1986.
ZEROVILLE James Franco directed himself as a naïve young man who goes to Hollywood in 1969 with stars in his eyes. Based on a book by the Los Angeles novelist Steve Erickson, it was shot five years ago. Seth Rogen and Megan Fox also star.
Sept. 25
ANTHROPOCENE: THE HUMAN EPOCH Jennifer Baichwal ("Manufactured Landscapes"), Nicholas de Pencier and Edward Burtynsky directed this exploration of what has been called the "Anthropocene" epoch: the (current) period, in which humans' impact on the Earth has overtaken that of natural forces, in theory pushing the planet into a new geological stage.
Sept. 27
ABOMINABLE In this animated feature, a Shanghai girl (voiced by Chloe Bennett) makes the acquaintance of a yeti to whom the title adjective might be ascribed. She resolves to take him home to the Himalayas. It should be helpful that one of her friends is voiced by Tenzing Norgay Trainor, a grandson of the famous Everest mountaineer.
THE DAY SHALL COME Chris Morris ("Four Lions") directed this satire about an F.B.I. agent (Anna Kendrick) who works to ensnare a street preacher (Marchánt Davis) whom she has framed as a terrorist to score a P.R. coup.
THE DEATH OF DICK LONG Two rockers in Alabama try to cover for the unexpected death of their bandmate. Daniel Scheinert, part of the filmmaking team that branded itself "Daniels" ("Swiss Army Man"), directed this comedy.
FIRST LOVE The insanely prolific Japanese director Takashi Miike (who has slowed down this decade, with an average of about two features per year) returns to the yakuza milieu. A boxer and a call girl are caught in the crossfire of a drug operation.
THE GOLDEN GLOVE Fatih Akin directed this fictionalized account of the serial killer Fritz Honka (Jonas Dassler), who murdered prostitutes in Hamburg in the 1970s. Reviewers at the Berlin International Film Festival this year were repulsed.
JIM ALLISON: BREAKTHROUGH This documentary looks at the work of James P. Allison, whose research on the use of immunotherapy for cancer treatment made him a Nobel laureate in 2018.
JUDY Renée Zellweger plays Judy Garland as she prepares for a heavily anticipated London nightclub engagement. It took place, as it turned out, just months before her death in 1969. Jessie Buckley also stars. Rupert Goold directed.
THE LAUNDROMAT Steven Soderbergh takes a break from shooting on an iPhone to put his spin on the story behind the Panama Papers, leaked documents that were said to reveal how a Panamanian law firm had helped wealthy clients launder money and evade taxes. Meryl Streep leads a large cast that includes Gary Oldman and Antonio Banderas as the firm's founding partners.
THE PARTS YOU LOSE Christopher Cantwell, a creator of "Halt and Catch Fire," directed this story of a boy who becomes friendly with a fugitive. Aaron Paul and Mary Elizabeth Winstead star.
PRETENDERS James Franco directs himself again (see "Zeroville," above) in a movie about a film student who is besotted with the French new wave and a mysterious woman -- of whom his friend is also enamored. With Jack Kilmer, Shameik Moore and Jane Levy.
October
Oct. 2
CELEBRATION Shown at the Berlin International Film Festival in 2007, this fly-on-the-wall chronicle of Yves Saint Laurent during the preparations for his final collection was blocked from release by Saint Laurent's business partner, Pierre Bergé, who reportedly did not like his portrayal in the film. Bergé's death in 2017, nine years after that of the designer, has enabled the documentary, now lightly re-edited, to open.
WAR The Bollywood stars Hrithik Roshan and Tiger Shroff meet in an action face-off spectacular.
Oct. 4
THE DISAPPEARANCE OF MY MOTHER The director Beniamino Barrese creates a portrait of his mother, Benedetta Barzini, a former Italian supermodel who worked with Richard Avedon and studied with Lee Strasberg. "Barzini is Barrese's subject (and apparent muse), but she's also his mother, which creates some productive friction," Manohla Dargis wrote after the film played at the Sundance Film Festival.
DOLEMITE IS MY NAME Eddie Murphy plays Rudy Ray Moore, the creator and star of "Dolemite," in a movie that chronicles how Moore brought the beloved blaxploitation title character, a kung-fu-fighting pimp, from comedy records to the screen. The writers Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski have explored the world of low-budget moviemaking before, in "Ed Wood." Craig Brewer ("Hustle & Flow") directed.
JOKER Warner Bros. calls this movie a "cautionary tale," but exactly who is being cautioned is unclear. Is it the actors? Warning: Before this century is out, every single one of you will play a Batman character. It's Joaquin Phoenix's turn today. Robert De Niro also stars, highlighting the apparent influence of "Taxi Driver" and "The King of Comedy." Todd Phillips directed.
LUCY IN THE SKY After experiencing the mind-expanding properties not of L.S.D., but of outer space, an astronaut (Natalie Portman) finds that resuming life on Earth doesn't give her the same high. Jon Hamm also stars; Noah Hawley (TV's "Fargo") directed.
MEMORY: THE ORIGINS OF ALIEN Having sliced the shower scene of "Psycho" every which way in "78/52: Hitchcock's Shower Scene," the documentarian Alexandre O. Philippe reconstructs the creation of "Alien." The film has input from key players (Tom Skerritt, Veronica Cartwright) but also some conspicuous absences (Sigourney Weaver and, except in archival footage, Ridley Scott).
PAIN AND GLORY Antonio Banderas won the best actor prize at Cannes for playing a version of his director, Pedro Almodóvar, who, in the tradition of Fellini's thinly veiled self-portraits, takes stock of his life and career. When the film played at Cannes, Manohla Dargis called it "one of Almodóvar's unqualified best in a while."
SEMPER FI Jai Courtney plays a Marine reservist who could bend the rules to help his brother. Will he? Henry-Alex Rubin (a director of the 2005 documentary "Murderball") directed.
WRINKLES THE CLOWN A clown who terrified YouTube users serves as the jumping-off point for a broader disquisition on clowndom and viral fame. Michael Beach Nichols directed this documentary.
Oct. 11
THE ADDAMS FAMILY They're creepy and they're kooky, mysterious and spooky -- and now they're illustrations once again. (Before the TV series and the live-action movies, they appeared in cartoons for The New Yorker.) Charlize Theron voices Morticia; Oscar Isaac is Gomez.
FANTASTIC FUNGI Brie Larson narrates this tour of the magical world of mycelia, featuring the authors Michael Pollan ("The Omnivore's Dilemma") and Eugenia Bone ("Well-Preserved") and the alternative-medicine advocate Andrew Weil.
GEMINI MAN Will Smith tangles with Will Smith -- playing a younger cloned version of himself. Working for the producer Jerry Bruckheimer, Ang Lee returns to the divisive high-frame-rate technology he used on "Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk." (Movies are usually shot and projected at 24 frames per second; a faster rate reduces blur.) Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Clive Owen also star.
HIGH STRUNG FREE DANCE It sounds like "The Red Shoes" crossed with "Step Up": A Broadway choreographer (Thomas Doherty) and a pianist (Harry Jarvis) both fall for the new star dancer (the ballet-trained Juliet Doherty, who is not related to Thomas).
IN MY ROOM Hans Löw plays a layabout who becomes the last man on Earth. What would you do? (He watches "The Bridges of Madison County.") Elena Radonicich plays the last woman on Earth. Ulrich Köhler directed.
THE KING Dipping into some of the same events covered by Shakespeare's Henry IV plays (without the Shakespeare), this historical picture stars Timothée Chalamet as Prince Hal, soon to be Henry V. With Joel Edgerton as Falstaff. David Michôd ("Animal Kingdom") directed.
LUCKY DAY It's easy to forget that Quentin Tarantino shared his screenwriting Oscar for "Pulp Fiction." His co-winner was Roger Avary, who wrote and directed this crime movie about a safecracker (Luke Bracey) who is released from prison, only to be targeted for death by a character played by Crispin Glover. Nina Dobrev also stars.
MARY Gary Oldman buys a fixer-upper of a boat and casts off with his family. But it turns out that the vessel needs more than sail patching, like maybe an exorcist or a ghostbuster. With Emily Mortimer.
MISTER AMERICA The professional anti-humorist Tim Heidecker stars as a quixotic candidate: a man acquitted of murder (all he did was sell bad e-cigarettes) who turns around and runs for district attorney in San Bernardino, Calif.
PARASITE From Bong Joon-ho, a master of the eco-thriller ("Okja," "The Host"), the title "parasite" might conjure up an image of a different type of movie. But this is a merciless and witty class satire, in which an impoverished family begins to leech the resources of a much wealthier one. In May, Bong became the first South Korean director to win the Palme d'Or.
Oct. 16
STUFFED The filmmaker Erin Derham explores the culture of taxidermy, a discipline that's more conservation-minded than it might appear.
Oct. 18
BY THE GRACE OF GOD Three men (played by Melvil Poupaud, Denis Ménochet and Swann Arlaud) seek to expose the priest who abused them when they were boys. François Ozon directed this drama from France.
#FEMALEPLEASURE The documentarian Barbara Miller profiles five women living in different parts of the world who have all challenged patriarchal social structures.
GREENER GRASS This parody of suburban life stars its writer-directors, Jocelyn DeBoer and Dawn Luebbe, in an absurdist landscape where adults have braces and use golf carts for transportation.
JOJO RABBIT Scaling down after "Thor: Ragnarok," Taika Waititi directed this (somehow) comedy set during World War II. It's about a German boy (Roman Griffin Davis) whose imaginary friend is Hitler (Waititi) and whose mother (Scarlett Johansson) is secretly sheltering a Jewish girl (Thomasin McKenzie, from "Leave No Trace").
THE LIGHTHOUSE In "The Witch," the director Robert Eggers revealed a gift for anachronistic dialogue. Drawing on sources both literary (Herman Melville and Sarah Orne Jewett) and historical, he concocted this black-and-white, claustrophobic pas de deux. It's set in the 1890s at a lighthouse off New England, where two men (Willem Dafoe and Robert Pattinson) can't help driving each other crazy.
MALEFICENT: MISTRESS OF EVIL In this continuation of the 2014 live-action spinoff of "Sleeping Beauty," Maleficent (Angelina Jolie) does not take kindly to the news that Aurora (Elle Fanning) plans to wed.
MISS VIRGINIA A mother (Uzo Aduba, from "Orange Is the New Black") fights to keep her son away from the streets and at a private school that she can't afford.
SERENDIPITY The artist Prune Nourry learned she had breast cancer in 2016 and, during reconstructive surgery, began to think of her body as sculptural material, using the treatment process as inspiration for artwork in multiple disciplines. This documentary, which she directed, captures her medical and artistic experiences.
TRICK Omar Epps plays a detective who must face an escaped murderer presumed to be dead, but who seems to return each Halloween.
ZOMBIELAND: DOUBLE TAP Woody Harrelson, Jesse Eisenberg, Emma Stone and Abigail Breslin -- playing the ragtag group from the original "Zombieland" (2009) -- cope with familial infighting when not splattering zombie brains. Ruben Fleischer, who directed the first film, returns.
Oct. 23
TEMBLORES A man sends shock waves through his evangelical family in Guatemala when he comes out as gay. Jayro Bustamante, whose "Ixcanul" had a following on the festival circuit, directed.
Oct. 25
BAD TRIP Under the guidance of the "Jackass" creator Jeff Tremaine (among other producers), Eric Andre, Lil Rel Howery and Tiffany Haddish play pranks on unsuspecting nonactors while recording them on hidden cameras.
BLACK AND BLUE Naomie Harris plays a New Orleans native who returns to her post-Katrina hometown as a police officer after serving in Afghanistan. But when she captures an execution by one of her colleagues (Frank Grillo) on a body cam, she is forced to go on the run. She can't trust her corrupt fellow cops or civilians, many of whom regard her with suspicion for working with the police. Tyrese Gibson also stars.
THE CURRENT WAR This feature from Alfonso Gomez-Rejon ("Me and Earl and the Dying Girl") dramatizes the race between Thomas Edison (Benedict Cumberbatch), on the one hand, and George Westinghouse (Michael Shannon) and Nikola Tesla (Nicholas Hoult), on the other, to bring electricity to the United States. The movie is said to have undergone substantial changes since its poorly reviewed premiere at Toronto in 2017, when it was in the possession of the Weinstein Company. (It's now being distributed by 101 Studios.)
FARMING Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje wrote and directed this autobiographical feature about a Nigerian boy who is given to a British family that is expected to give him a good life. Incredibly, he becomes a major figure in a skinhead gang after first being targeted by it.
FRANKIE The director Ira Sachs ("Love Is Strange") comes close to vintage Woody Allen territory with this bittersweet comedy about an actress (Isabelle Huppert) who assembles friends and loved ones in Sintra, Portugal, for matchmaking and reconciliation. With Marisa Tomei and Jérémie Renier.
THE GREAT ALASKAN RACE Braving the elements, a champion dogsledder (Brian Presley, who also wrote and directed) must deliver an antitoxin to the victims of a diphtheria outbreak in Nome, Alaska.
THE KILL TEAM Dan Krauss directed this dramatized version of his 2014 documentary, about five American soldiers accused of murdering three Afghan civilians. Nat Wolff and Alexander Skarsgard star.
NO SAFE SPACES The comedian Adam Carolla and the conservative pundit Dennis Prager argue that the concept of "safe spaces" is antithetical to free speech. Interviewees include the conservative commentator Ben Shapiro, the psychologist Jordan Peterson, the professor and activist Cornel West and the lawyer Alan M. Dershowitz.
PORTALS Eduardo Sanchez, one of two directors of "The Blair Witch Project," is one of four directors -- Gregg Hale, Timo Tjahjanto and Liam O'Donnell are the others -- of this anthology film, set after the world has experienced a wave of blackouts.
LIBERTY: MOTHER OF EXILES Fenton Bailey and Randy Barbato ("Inside Deep Throat") directed this documentary in which the designer Diane von Furstenberg examines the history of the Statue of Liberty.
MAKING WAVES: THE ART OF CINEMATIC SOUND With interviews from other veterans of the business, the longtime sound editor Midge Costin ("The Rock," "Days of Thunder") directed this accessible portrait of how sound is constructed for movies.
THE PREY An undercover Chinese cop (Gu Shangwei) is hunted after he winds up in a Cambodian jungle.
SYNONYMS Nadav Lapid (the Israeli feature "The Kindergarten Teacher," which was remade with Maggie Gyllenhaal) won the top prize at the Berlin International Film Festival for this autobiographically inspired film. It follows an Israeli man (Tom Mercier) who is adrift while leading a tenuous life in Paris.
WHEN LAMBS BECOME LIONS Two cousins on opposite sides of the ivory trade in Kenya -- a dealer and a ranger who is permitted to use violence to halt poaching -- are followed over three years in this documentary.
Oct. 30
REDOUBT This is the feature movie component of the artist Matthew Barney's latest exhibition, also called "Redoubt," which was held at Yale -- Barney's alma mater -- this year. Reviewing the show for The Times, Jason Farago called the cinematic component "Barney's most engrossing film in over a decade."
November
Nov. 1
AMERICAN DHARMA On Twitter, Errol Morris alluded to having trouble finding a distributor for his latest movie, a profile of Stephen K. Bannon, President Trump's former chief strategist. At last year's festivals, critics wondered whether Morris had done enough to hold Bannon's feet to the fire, but this is a Morris movie. As in "The Unknown Known" or "Mr. Death," the director is interested in rationalization and denial -- in how Bannon reinforces his worldview and ignores contrary evidence.
THE APOLLO Roger Ross Williams (who won an Oscar for "Music by Prudence") directed this documentary, which covers the history -- and present-day operations -- of this landmark Harlem theater, long a cornerstone of African-American artistry in New York.
EARTHQUAKE BIRD A woman living abroad in Japan (Alicia Vikander) is thrown off balance (even more so, that is) when a young woman (Riley Keough) goes missing. Wash Westmoreland ("Colette") directed.
HARRIET How has it taken this long to get a proper Harriet Tubman feature biopic? Cynthia Erivo plays the abolitionist over a period that includes her escape from slavery and her work with the Underground Railroad. Kasi Lemmons ("Eve's Bayou") directed.
THE IRISHMAN Martin Scorsese's latest feature is, by any measure, one of the year's most eagerly anticipated films. It reunites him with Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci. It's his first movie with Al Pacino, who plays Jimmy Hoffa. It reportedly uses advanced special effects that allowed De Niro to play his character across a range of years. And Scorsese is by far the biggest filmmaker yet landed by Netflix, which ran a teaser trailer during this year's Oscar broadcast. (Hint, hint.)
THE KINGMAKER Lauren Greenfield, no stranger to portraits of cocooned wealth ("The Queen of Versailles"), directed this look at Imelda Marcos, the noted shoe collector and former first lady of the Philippines, as she works to polish the reputation of her husband, the dictator Ferdinand Marcos, and to usher her family back into power.
LIGHT FROM LIGHT It's a haunted-house story, sort of -- except the only specter may be that of grief. Marin Ireland plays a woman with the power to communicate with ghosts; she is contacted by a bereaved husband (Jim Gaffigan) to investigate his home. Paul Harrill directed.
MOTHERLESS BROOKLYN Jonathan Lethem's books have gone relatively neglected by Hollywood. Albert Mobilio, reviewing Lethem's novel "Motherless Brooklyn" for The New York Times in 1999, called the detective material merely "a convenient rack on which to hang his off-kilter humor and dead-on observations." Will those translate? Edward Norton adapted, directed and stars in the movie version, playing a 1950s private eye with Tourette's syndrome. Bruce Willis and Gugu Mbatha-Raw also star.
PARADISE HILLS Alice Waddington directed this sci-fi story in which Emma Roberts is sent to a remote island treatment center that has a disturbing agenda. Awkwafina, Danielle Macdonald and Eiza González play three of her peers. (The genre whiz Nacho Vigalondo, of "Timecrimes," wrote this with Brian DeLeeuw.)
17 BLOCKS Davy Rothbart, a contributor to the public radio series "This American Life," began filming the members of a family in Washington -- the title refers to the stretch between their home and the Capitol -- in 1999. This documentary covers two decades of hardship and heartbreak, and includes unshakable scenes of violence and redemption.
TERMINATOR: DARK FATE He said he'd be back, and he keeps making good on that promise. Arnold Schwarzenegger returns for another sequel, and so does Linda Hamilton as Sarah Connor. No worries if you've lost track of the chronology of the last 28 years of the franchise. This installment is said to pick up from the events of "Terminator 2: Judgment Day" (1991). Mackenzie Davis also stars; Tim Miller ("Deadpool") directed.
WAVES Kelvin Harrison Jr. plays a school athlete in South Florida whose father (Sterling K. Brown) has high expectations for him. The family must then cope with a loss. Trey Edward Shults, who explored similar breakdown territory in "Krisha," directed.
Nov. 6
MARRIAGE STORY Noah Baumbach memorably (and quite personally) addressed the subject of parental separation and its impact on children in "The Squid and the Whale." In his new (and longest) feature, the centerpiece of this year's New York Film Festival, Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver are a divorcing couple sparring over the custody of their son. Laura Dern, Alan Alda and Ray Liotta play lawyers.
Nov. 8
DANGER CLOSE The "Collateral" screenwriter Stuart Beattie scripted this account of the 1966 Battle of Long Tan, when a regiment of the Australian Army was cornered by far more numerous North Vietnamese and Vietcong forces in a rubber plantation in South Vietnam.
DOCTOR SLEEP Stephen King famously disliked Stanley Kubrick's movie version of "The Shining." Yet this film, adapted from King's 2013 sequel to the novel, appears to pay tribute to both S.K.s while following the further adventures of Danny Torrance (Ewan McGregor). Kyliegh Curran plays one of his fellow telepaths. The talented Mike Flanagan ("Gerald's Game") directed.
HONEY BOY Shia LaBeouf, who in 2015 sat through a marathon of his movies at the Angelika Film Center in Manhattan, has always had a penchant for self-dramatization. He wrote the script for this autobiographically inspired movie, about a child star (played by Noah Jupe and Lucas Hedges at different ages) who has some issues to work through with his father (LaBeouf, naturally). Alma Har'el directed.
KLAUS That's Klaus as in Santa Claus. In this animated feature, Jason Schwartzman lends his voice to a postman who's transferred to somewhere in the vicinity of the North Pole and meets St. Nick (J.K. Simmons).
LAST CHRISTMAS Emilia Clarke plays a woman working as a Christmas shop elf in London who meets cute with a mysterious man (Henry Golding). The movie features the songs of George Michael and, as others have observed, the trailer might be obscuring a plot twist. (The most plausible guess comes from several critics: Golding is the ghost of a donor who, per Michael's lyrics, last Christmas gave Clarke his heart.) Emma Thompson and Bryony Kimmings wrote the script, from which Paul Feig directed.
MIDWAY Roland Emmerich restages the Battle of Midway with Patrick Wilson, Ed Skrein and Nick Jonas, among others. The aesthetic looks as if it were closer to that of Michael Bay ("Pearl Harbor") than that of John Ford, who shot a documentary on the battle as it unfolded.
PLAYING WITH FIRE Remember "Three Men and a Baby"? Instead of three men, make it four men, and make those men burly firefighters. Instead of the baby, picture three siblings of various ages. The firefighters must watch those children, whom they have rescued, until the parents are found. With John Cena and Keegan-Michael Key.
PRIMAL You saw "Snakes on a Plane"? This is carnivores on a boat. The ever-busy Nicolas Cage is trapped on a ship that's carrying a menacing menagerie.
Nov. 13
MICKEY AND THE BEAR Annabelle Attanasio got favorable reviews at South by Southwest for this feature writing and directing debut, about a Montana teenager (Camila Morrone) and her father (James Badge Dale), a veteran with post-traumatic stress disorder.
Nov. 15
ATLANTICS Mati Diop became the first black female director to compete at the Cannes Film Festival with this feature; she wound up winning the Grand Prix (de facto second place). This supernaturally inflected film concerns a 17-year-old Senegalese girl (Mame Sané) in love with a young man who leaves by boat in search of work.
CHARLIE'S ANGELS In this reboot of the TV series and the 2000 film, Kristen Stewart, Ella Balinska and Naomi Scott play the latest team of sexy super-operatives. They get instructions from Elizabeth Banks, both onscreen (she plays Bosley, or one of several Bosleys) and as the movie's screenwriter and director.
FORD V FERRARI In the 1960s, after a prospective buyout of Ferrari by Ford fell through, the American car manufacturer sought payback at the 24-hour endurance race in Le Mans, France. Matt Damon plays the car designer Carroll Shelby, Christian Bale the racer Ken Miles. James Mangold, the director of "Logan," is behind the wheel.
THE GOOD LIAR After "Ford v Ferrari," here is knight versus dame: Sir Ian McKellen plays a con man who sets out to fleece a wealthy widow (Dame Helen Mirren). At stake are both her fortune and the crown for best actor in Britain. Bill Condon directed.
THE HOTTEST AUGUST The weather is just one subject on the mind of the Canadian filmmaker Brett Story in this essay documentary, filmed in New York in 2017. It ponders not only climate change, but also changes in the politics and social landscape of the United States.
KOKO-DI KOKO-DA In this film from the director Johannes Nyholm, a Scandinavian couple on a camping trip begin to re-experience the circumstances under which their daughter died.
THE LODGE Still grieving for their mother, a brother and sister (Jaeden Martell and Lia McHugh) are taken on a winter cabin getaway with their father's new girlfriend (Riley Keough), who has an alarming history. Then Dad leaves them alone with her. Veronika Franz and Severin Fiala ("Goodnight Mommy") directed.
RECORDER You've heard of outsider artists, but what about an outsider archivist? Marion Stokes is said to have recorded television for 24 hours a day for more than three decades, leaving behind a videotape library of American life that Matt Wolf's documentary is able to draw on.
THE REPORT Adam Driver plays Daniel J. Jones, an investigator for the Senate Intelligence Committee who concluded that the C.I.A. had misled the public about its use of torture and sought to expose what he knew. Annette Bening plays Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California. Scott Z. Burns (a frequent collaborator with Steven Soderbergh, a producer here) wrote and directed.
SCANDALOUS If you've ever wondered how The National Enquirer prints the things it does, Mark Landsman's documentary traces its history.
SHOOTING THE MAFIA The photographer Letizia Battaglia brought images of the Sicilian Mafia to the public in the 1970s. She is profiled in this documentary.
16 BARS This documentary showcases the hip-hop artist Speech (a.k.a. Todd Thomas of Arrested Development), as he inspires inmates in Virginia to make music in a workshop.
Nov. 22
A BEAUTIFUL DAY IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD Tom Hanks zips on a cardigan to play Fred Rogers. Here, that beloved TV host wages a war of attrition-by-niceness with a hard-bitten journalist (Matthew Rhys). That character was inspired by Tom Junod, who profiled Rogers for Esquire. Marielle Heller ("Can You Ever Forgive Me?") directed.
DARK WATERS In a big change of pace, Todd Haynes ("Carol") directed this social-issue drama, inspired by a New York Times Magazine article about a corporate lawyer who sued DuPont in an environmental case. Mark Ruffalo, Anne Hathaway and Tim Robbins star.
FROZEN 2 Elsa investigates the truth about the past. Didn't she already learn to let it go?
VARDA BY AGNÈS In self-portraits like "The Gleaners and I" and "Faces Places," Agnès Varda, who died in March, put her life on film. So it's unsurprising -- and inspiring -- that she would leave behind a final, free-form autobiographical work in which she reflects on her career and her passions.
THE WARRIOR QUEEN OF JHANSI Devika Bhise plays the warrior queen of the title, who in India in 1857 led a rebellion that challenged the British East India Company.
Nov. 27
KNIVES OUT Taking time out from Jedi skirmishes, the writer and director Rian Johnson tips his hat to Agatha Christie. Christopher Plummer plays a dead family patriarch, the victim of (likely) foul play. Daniel Craig and Lakeith Stanfield investigate a cast of suspects that includes Chris Evans, Jamie Lee Curtis and many others.
QUEEN & SLIM Daniel Kaluuya and Jodie Turner-Smith play what the trailer describes as "the black Bonnie and Clyde" after Kaluuya's character kills a police officer in self-defense. Viral video makes them famous while they're on the lam. Lena Waithe and James Frey wrote the screenplay. Melina Matsoukas, who has made music videos for Beyoncé and Rihanna, directed.
63 UP The director Michael Apted is himself getting up in years, but his seven-year check-ins with his subjects -- first seen as schoolchildren in the 1964 television documentary "Seven Up" -- are a tradition that you hope will see a few more multiples.
THE TWO POPES Anthony Hopkins plays Pope Benedict XVI, and Jonathan Pryce plays the future Pope Francis in 2012. In the movie, the two men work to reconcile their different views of the future of the Catholic Church. Fernando Meirelles directed from a screenplay by Anthony McCarten ("Bohemian Rhapsody").

Dec. 6
THE AERONAUTS Felicity Jones and Eddie Redmayne set out to fly higher than anyone else ever has. It's the 19th century, and their mode of transportation is a hot-air balloon. Tom Harper directed this reteaming of the stars of "The Theory of Everything" (for which Redmayne won an Oscar, and Jones was nominated).
BRAHMS: THE BOY II Brahms is a doll that is perhaps not as inanimate as it seems. He (or it?) befriends a boy who moves onto the estate from the first movie. Katie Holmes stars in this sequel to "The Boy," from the same director, William Brent Bell.
DANIEL ISN'T REAL Patrick Schwarzenegger, son of Arnold, plays Daniel, an imaginary friend reconjured by a too-old-for-games college freshman (Miles Robbins) after a traumatic incident.
IN FABRIC The British director Peter Strickland ("The Duke of Burgundy") seems to be working almost single-handedly to revive the Italian giallo tradition. The movie follows the journey of a killer dress (and not just in terms of style). Marianne Jean-Baptiste plays the first unlucky buyer. Hayley Squires and Leo Bill have the garment later on.
LITTLE JOE Emily Beecham, who won the best actress prize for this movie at Cannes in May, plays one of a team of scientists who genetically engineer a flower that has a strange property: It makes people happy. The same, of course, was also true of the Pod People, and the aroma of "Invasion of the Body Snatchers" wafts through this austerely chilling feature from Jessica Hausner.
PORTRAIT OF A LADY ON FIRE Céline Sciamma won wide acclaim (and a screenplay award) at the Cannes Film Festival for this understated, immaculately appointed 18th-century drama. Noémie Merlant plays an artist hired to paint a portrait of Adèle Haenel, who won't sit for anyone. At first, Merlant's character is forced to work from memory, but the two grow closer.
Dec. 13
BLACK CHRISTMAS Sophia Takal directed (and wrote, with the film critic April Wolfe) this second remake of Bob Clark's 1974 Canadian slasher-film standard. A sorority is terrorized; Imogen Poots leads the cast.
CUNNINGHAM This year, the documentary "If the Dancer Dances" suggested that video, by virtue of being in two dimensions, was limited in its ability to capture Merce Cunningham's choreography. It's fortunate, then, that his centennial year closes out with a documentary that's in 3-D. Alla Kovgan directed this biographical portrait.
A HIDDEN LIFE At Cannes, Terrence Malick polarized critics with this portrait of Franz Jägerstätter (August Diehl), an Austrian conscientious objector who refused to swear allegiance to Hitler. His stance led to his execution by the Nazis in 1943 and later his beatification by the Catholic Church in 2007. The director's signature style -- nature shots, fragmentary voice-over -- struck some as an odd fit. "Malick's prettification of this world is as appalling as is his lack of interest in history," Manohla Dargis wrote from the festival.
JUMANJI: THE NEXT LEVEL Karen Gillan, Dwayne Johnson, Kevin Hart and Jack Black return as video game avatars, but the players who are their puppeteers aren't all the same. The director Jake Kasdan, who had the controller for "Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle" (2017), returns as well.
UNCUT GEMS The brothers Josh and Benny Safdie ("Good Time") have been talking about making this thriller for years. (Josh Safdie was doing research for it in the diamond district when he met Arielle Holmes, who became the star of the siblings' 2015 film, "Heaven Knows What.") Adam Sandler plays a jeweler who has a lot on the line.
Dec. 20
CATS The "Les Misérables" director Tom Hooper uses the latest in what a promotional video calls "digital fur technology" to transform Jennifer Hudson, Taylor Swift, Judi Dench and many others into Andrew Lloyd Webber's singing kitties. The trailer has already been widely mocked, but to quote Rum Tum Tugger, there's "no doing anything abowwowtit."
STAR WARS: THE RISE OF SKYWALKER How exactly is J.J. Abrams going to run with the baton that "The Last Jedi" left him? Will Rey really turn out to have come from nothing? Is that little kid with the broom a Jedi? Will die-hard fans cry heresy no matter where this movie goes? (The answer to that last question is probably yes.) Daisy Ridley, John Boyega and Adam Driver return to that galaxy far, far away.
SUPERINTELLIGENCE Melissa McCarthy is targeted by a superintelligent A.I. entity that wants to observe her romantic interactions -- and take over the world. Bobby Cannavale and Brian Tyree Henry also star. Ben Falcone, McCarthy's husband and frequent collaborator, directed.
BOMBSHELL Nicole Kidman plays Gretchen Carlson, and Charlize Theron portrays Megyn Kelly in a movie about the sexual harassment that pervaded Fox News during the reign of Roger Ailes (John Lithgow). Margot Robbie also stars.
Dec. 25
JUST MERCY Michael B. Jordan plays the lawyer Bryan Stevenson, who in Alabama in the early 1990s defended Walter McMillian (Jamie Foxx), a man sentenced to death even though, The New York Times wrote in 1993, the state built "a case on suspect testimony and withheld crucial evidence that called that testimony into question." Brie Larson plays an activist also fighting for McMillian's exoneration. Destin Daniel Cretton ("Short Term 12") directed.
LITTLE WOMEN Saoirse Ronan, Emma Watson, Florence Pugh and Eliza Scanlen are Louisa May Alcott's March sisters in the latest adaptation of "Little Women." It's given a new spark by Greta Gerwig, who (as with "Lady Bird") wrote the screenplay and directed. Meryl Streep, Laura Dern and Timothée Chalamet also star.
1917 Sam Mendes tries his hand at an old-fashioned war epic with this story of a pair of British soldiers (George MacKay and Dean-Charles Chapman) during World War I. Their assignment: To deliver a message calling off an attack that would, if executed, lead to a battalion's slaughter. With Benedict Cumberbatch.
SPIES IN DISGUISE In this animated feature, Will Smith provides the voice of a secret agent who is transformed by his colleague (Tom Holland), a scientist, into a pigeon, because that's an easy way for him to go undetected. With Rashida Jones.
Dec. 27
CLEMENCY The director Chinonye Chukwu won the top prize at Sundance for this character study of a prison warden (Alfre Woodard) who has been hollowed out by her work. The movie follows her after a botched execution as she prepares to administer the death penalty to another inmate (Aldis Hodge).

Texto completo: Politics and Christianity are increasingly strange bedfellows, and best-selling Christian author and activist Jim Wallis has taken note.
As the author of the megaselling "God’s Politics" in 2006, Wallis now is adding his thoughts on the divided nature of our country in his new book, "Christ in Crisis: Why We Need to Reclaim Jesus."
Wallis will share his book at 7 p.m. Tuesday, Oct. 15, at Naperville’s Community Christian Church, 1635 Emerson Lane. Event tickets are sold exclusively at JimWallisAndersons.brownpapertickets.com.
The presentation is sponsored by Anderson’s Bookshop in downtown Naperville.
In his book, Wallis, a New York Times best-selling author and Christian activist, urges America to return to the tenets of Jesus as the means to save us from the polarizing bitterness and anger of our tribal nation.
Building on "Reclaiming Jesus" — the declaration he and other church leaders wrote in May 2018 to address America’s current crisis — Wallis argues Christians have become disconnected from Jesus and need to revisit their spiritual foundations. By pointing to eight questions Jesus asked or is asked, Wallis provides a means to measure whether we are truly aligned with the moral foundations of our Christian faith.
"Christians have often remembered, rediscovered, and returned to their obedient discipleship of Jesus Christ — both personal and public — in times of trouble. It’s called coming home," Wallis says.
Wallis is a leading figure at the crossroads of religion and politics in America today, the author of eight books, and the founder of Sojourners, a global faith and justice network. He is a public theologian, a speaker and preacher and a faith-based activist.

Texto completo: In the late 1980s, young Raina Telgemeier tried to deliver a report in front of her grade-school class in San Francisco. Before she could finish, she bolted for the restroom, gripped by the symptoms of her intense anxiety.
Over Labor Day weekend, Telgemeier, now a celebrated 42-year-old graphic novelist, strode onto the main stage at the National Book Festival in Washington, D.C., before a thrumming crowd of about 4,000 fans. Radiating confidence, she smiled broadly as she shared her story of nerves and nausea. It is a message of empathy and reassurance that encourages young listeners to talk about what scares them.
"I'm proud to tell you at this moment," Telgemeier said, "I don't have a stomach ache."
There was laughter among her ponytailed legions. Over the past decade, the accidental memoirist has grown into a YA rock star by becoming an open book. Telgemeier's largely autobiographical stories are so accessible and emotionally resonant that there are 13.5 million copies of them in print, as she's tapped into a largely overlooked comics-loving female readership.
Now, because her fans kept asking, she is getting more personal than ever. The Eisner Award-winning author who launched her publishing empire with 2010's "Smile," about her years-long dental adventures as a kid, is prepared to bare new parts of her interior world with "Guts," available Tuesday, which centers on how fear affected her body.
"This is the reality of my life," Telgemeier told her fans. She quickly got to the heart and GI tract of the matter: "I was subject to panic attacks and (was) worrying that something was really wrong with me."
A young girl in a bright-fuchsia shirt soon asked which of Telgemeier's books was the author's favorite - from a shelf that includes not only "Smile" but also such other New York Times bestsellers as "Sisters," "Drama" and "Ghosts." The author nodded to a few titles before replying: "I like 'Guts' because it's so personal and because people are really getting to know me, the person, when they read 'Guts.' "
On one level, she said in an interview the previous day, the book is about how her anxiety manifested itself. Beginning in fourth grade, she developed a fear of vomit (termed "emetophobia") and of how her "guts" acted up, which in turn triggered fear about her food choices.
On another level, the title refers to mustering the courage to receive treatment and share one's honest vulnerabilities with people who care about you. (Seven percent of Americans age 3 to 17 - more than 4 million young people - have been diagnosed with anxiety, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.)
"Guts" is dedicated to "anyone who feels afraid." That signals the approachable tone of the memoir, which tries to help destigmatize mental illness and therapy and provide paths to discussion among young readers.
Telgemeier notes in the "Guts" afterword that she has employed various therapies and meditation apps and has taken anxiety medication, writing: "They've all helped, but I've realized that my phobias and worries are just part of who I am. I do my best to manage them!"
It is that kind of comforting honesty that especially appeals to millions of students.
"Kids today are reading more comic books and graphic novels than ever, and Raina is a big reason why," said Gene Luen Yang, the acclaimed graphic novelist ("American Born Chinese") and past Library of Congress ambassador for Young People's Literature. "She's a true comics superstar who essentially created a brand new category of comics in the American market: middle-grade graphic memoir.
"I still remember hearing discussions in the '90s about whether or not girls would read comics - ridiculous, of course, but Raina's work has proven just how ridiculous," continued Yang, a longtime schoolteacher. "Not to say that only girls read Raina's work."
It took Telgemeier many years before she was ready to share from her own experience. Between ages 11 and 25, she kept a private diary created in comics format. She was inspired by such strips as "For Better or for Worse" and "Calvin and Hobbes," as well as the book series "The Baby-Sitters Club."
In 2002, shortly before graduation from the School of Visual Arts in New York, she created a short comic about the power of reading the Hiroshima graphic novel "Barefoot Gen" - a gift from her father when she was 9. It caught the attention of the publisher Scholastic, which soon hired her to illustrate "The Baby-Sitters Club." It wasn't long before Telgemeier pitched her own story to Scholastic editors.
Telgemeier said some people had doubted whether a memoir about her braces could be popular. But her breakthrough "Smile" is not just about her nearly five-year saga of facial reconstruction after accidentally smashing her front teeth in 1989 but also about the fragile nature of friendship and stirring insecurities in middle school. Students read; critics raved.
Even after the success of "Smile," though, it was a long personal journey to "Guts," her third memoir. "I don't think I was ready to come out of the gate and just start writing about poop," she said with a laugh. Besides, there was some personal work to be done.
Five years ago, she began cognitive behavioral therapy because anxiety "was starting to impede my life," she said. But, "When I went to tackle the thing in my life, I started to see the story in it and started to tell the story - because when you go into a therapist's office, they want to know why you're there and where you are. They want to see how it all connects."
Telgemeier was already 80 pages into a different story at the time. But then she developed writer's block. While she was stuck, a friend asked about the author's passing anecdote about anxiety - that "stomach story." Telgemeier had never written it down, but the friend's question immediately sparked inspiration.
"I said: 'You know what? I've got to go!' " she recounted. "I just sat down, and 11 hours later I had the first couple of chapters sketched out. So it was all in there."
The Bay Area-based author set out to write the kind of book about phobias and anxieties that she wishes had been available to her as a kid. "Reading is where you find your common ground with others," Telgemeier said. As a child, "Sometimes you might not know another kid who's in therapy or tackling a really heavy thing in their life, but you might read a book about it and find yourself."
This year, Telgemeier published the creative guide book "Share Your Smile" to prompt her fans to write and draw their own tales. Now, as she goes on tour in support of "Guts" - which has already charted as an Amazon Top 10 bestseller - she continues to encourage her readers to express their feelings: "You can't connect unless you open up."
The author believes in addressing many aspects of grade school head on, including LGBT representation. Her book "Drama," inspired by her high school theater club experience, features a gay character whose sibling is coming to terms with his sexual identity. The graphic novel won a Stonewall Book Award while also being banned multiple times in Texas.
So will Telgemeier end her memoir series as a trilogy? "I feel like three is a really good number," she said at the festival.
She then noted playfully: "But I have one or two more stories from my childhood that I might want to tell. So maybe I will."

Texto completo: Vermont is one of 20 states, mostly led by Democratic attorneys general, who have rejected the deal, NBC reported.
Vermont Attorney General T.J. Donovan says a proposed settlement with drug manufacturer Purdue Pharma doesn't go far enough, saying he wants more guaranteed relief for people impacted by the opioid epidemic.
Donovan's office sued Purdue Pharma in September 2018, alleging that the company minimized the risks of addiction and misled doctors about the safety of long-term opioid use as it marketed its painkillers, including Oxycontin.
Nearly every U.S. state has sued Purdue Pharma for its role in the opioid crisis, according to CNBC. A reported 27 state attorneys general have signed on to a proposed settlement with the company that was announced this week, according to NBC News.
Vermont is one of 20 states, mostly led by Democratic attorneys general, who have rejected the deal, NBC reported.
The settlement could be worth up to $12 billion, according to the Associated Press, including some money from the company's owners, the Sackler family.
But only a fraction of that amount is guaranteed, Donovan said, explaining why he rejected the settlement.
"Vermont demands more certainty and guarantees regarding the money in order to effectively address the opioids crisis in Vermont," Donovan said. He added that he would like to shut down Purdue Pharma and sell its assets to help people affected by opioid addiction, rather than allowing Purdue to declare bankruptcy and be restructured in the way the proposed settlement lays out.
The New York Times reported that the settlement would not require Purdue Pharma to admit wrongdoing.
"This is going to be much like the tobacco settlements that we've seen in the past," Gov. Phil Scott said of the settlement talks at a news conference Thursday. "This will be I believe we will see many states that will seek restitution, and rightfully so."

With Trinkets, Trump's Campaign Sells Defiance as a Lifestyle

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- The message the president is selling to his supporters is clear.
"You don't have any choice. You have to vote for me," President Trump told a crowd on Monday at a rally in North Carolina, making a point he has revisited often in recent weeks. "Your way of life is under assault by these people."
Now, would they like a straw with that?
It turns out that Mr. Trump's message of outright defiance -- against Democrats, against the news media and, often, against facts -- can exist in tchotchke form. The president's campaign, which is relying on small-dollar donors to bolster his re-election effort, is also courting supporters willing to pay a little bit more for reminders of that message.
And the campaign has been creative in quickly bringing to market a range of products memorializing the president's latest run-in -- defiance as lifestyle.
In July, for example, plastic Trump drinking straws were created to hit back at the growing movement, most noticeably at large coffee and fast food chains, that has called for environment-friendly alternatives to plastic straws. The Trump campaign says its straws are in fact recyclable -- "Liberal paper straws don't work," was the pitch.
Siphoning Twitter rage over the straws created a revenue stream. According to data shared by Trump campaign officials this week, almost 55,000 packs of straws have been sold, netting over $ 823,000 in sales. More than a third of the people who bought the items had never donated to the campaign before that purchase, according to Tim Murtaugh, the campaign's communications director.
Last week, a tweetstorm broke out after the president was photographed with a map showing the path of Hurricane Dorian with a hard-to-miss black line that appeared to have been drawn to extend the storm's possible path into Alabama after he had insisted he had been right in predicting the storm, at one point, was headed to the state.
Mr. Trump said he did not know who had doctored the map with a Sharpie, but that did not stop the campaign from selling something new -- markers with Mr. Trump's autograph on them. As it became clear that administration officials, if not the president, had altered a scientific document, campaign officials tried to direct attention not to the administration's mistake but to the fact that it was being heavily covered by the news media.
"Buy the official Trump marker, which is different than every other marker on the market, because this one has the special ability to drive @CNN and the rest of the fake news crazy!" tweeted Brad Parscale, Mr. Trump's campaign manager.
This week, The New York Times revealed that Wilbur Ross, the commerce secretary, had threatened to fire employees at a federal scientific agency responsible for weather forecasts as Mr. Trump grew angry over the coverage around his Alabama tweets.
But the markers do not appear to have the same appeal the straws did, having sold only about $ 50,000 worth, according to Mr. Murtaugh. Mr. Parscale initially said they had been selling by the "hundreds."
While drinking straws and black markers are churned out the speed of a Twitter news cycle, that is nothing compared with the new varieties of T-shirts that go on the market after Mr. Trump tangles with a Democratic congressman or prominent journalist.
For $ 34, fans can buy a recent model lampooning the CNN anchor Chris Cuomo for unleashing a profanity-laced tirade on a pair of men who called him "Fredo," a reference to the incompetent son of Marlon Brando in "The Godfather." The shirt is meant to mock Mr. Cuomo's assertion that the moniker was a slur against Italians.
The "Fredo" shirt displays the campaign's omnipresent phone number to sign up and receive texts. The campaign closely monitors text sign-ups around each effort, and the results seem to have emboldened officials.
The seemingly unending product line has raised questions about who is hatching the ideas and who is creating the merchandise. Everything officially manufactured by the Trump campaign is American-made, Mr. Murtaugh said in an email.
Most of the merchandise requests are routed through a company called Ace Specialties in Lafayette, La., whose owner, Christl Mahfouz, can often be seen mingling with fans outside Trump rallies. Her team sells hats in exchange for money and the buyer's voting data: Each time a supporter buys a T-shirt or a hat at a rally, a digital interface prompts them to turn over their names, addresses and other voter-specific information for future Federal Election Commission reports.
Publicly, at least, all credit goes to the president.
"President Trump is a master of communication and branding, and his campaign merchandise is emblematic of that," Mr. Murtaugh said. "It gives people a little ownership of the re-election campaign and gives them high-quality merchandise in exchange for their donations."
Mr. Parscale has privately taken credit for some of the more incendiary items, including the straws and the "Fredo Unhinged" T-shirt.
The attention, good and bad, just adds up to more money for Mr. Trump, Jennifer Wingard, a professor of rhetoric at the University of Houston, said in an interview. Ms. Wingard said that in some ways, Mr. Trump understood the very basics of social media influencer culture long before the Kardashians (or the Caroline Calloways) of the world did.
"His obsession with popularity," Ms. Wingard said, "speaks to the social media influencing mind-set that most politicians don't have."
Internally, the commodification of the president's trollish insults, no matter how un-politically correct, are a point of pride: A Pencil Neck illustration -- a crude depiction of Representative Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California, based on a name Mr. Trump called him in a tweet -- hangs in the kitchen of the campaign's headquarters in suburban Virginia.
In some cases, it is not always clear that Mr. Trump understands the nuances of each smaller battle waged on his behalf. When asked if he supported the banning of plastic straws in July, the president said the public had bigger things to worry about before delivering an answer that ultimately did not match the fiery language used by his campaign.
"You know, it's interesting about plastic straws," he said. "So, you have a little straw. But what about the plates, the wrappers and everything else that are much bigger and they're made of the same material? So the straws are interesting. Everybody focuses on the straws. There's a lot of other things to focus. But it's an interesting question."
Mr. Trump may not be interested in the merits of debating the material composition of a straw, but he does instinctively understand the monetary value of slapping his name on one. Officials throughout his campaign are hypervigilant at trying to make sure that only officially sanctioned merchandise is showcased in campaign materials that he might see.
At campaign rallies, supporters are not invited to participate in pro-Trump videos unless they are wearing the official red "Make America Great Again" hat. Campaign aides even scan the crowds for green under the bill of the hat, a telltale sign that a product has been bought through official channels.
Ms. Wingard said that a person's desire to buy a pack of straws or a red hat reflects the work of a campaign trying to monetize everything from heated cultural battles to consequential presidential mistakes, and a president who instinctively understands that a lot of attention -- negative or otherwise -- translates to money.
"He can get bad press, people can make fun of him," Ms. Wingard said, "but the Sharpie campaign shows very flat out that it doesn't matter. He's going to make money off of it."

Despite recent efforts, many obstacles to fixing affordable housing

Texto completo: We will never solve the country's persistent affordable housing problem unless fiscal and land-use policies change dramatically, and unless views and attitudes of American voters and their elected representatives also change.
Essentially it boils down to a problem of money. Because of scant concern on the part of haves for housing affordability challenges faced by have-nots, relatively little political support exists for taxation needed to effectively address and solve affordable housing problems.
In a Sept. 4 Metro section story, Washington Post staff writer Robert McCartney cited the well-documented needs and ambitious goals for providing affordable housing throughout the Washington region. The District, surrounding Virginia and Maryland counties, local businesses, professional and trade organizations, and many civic interest groups admirably share a desire to undertake concerted action.
But McCartney's article identified explicitly and implicitly the diverse obstacles to meeting regional goals: regional funding inadequacy given the amount of money needed to support and subsidize real estate acquisition, construction and rents; limited availability of usable real estate and always-rising costs of land and development; and overly restrictive land-use laws, in particular zoning regulations that constrain residential density or restrict alternative affordable housing types, such as accessory dwelling units or multiunit homes within single-family zones.
Another obstacle is persistent NIMBY (Not In My Backyard) opposition to affordable housing projects, typically voiced by concerned residents of neighborhoods where below-market-rate housing development is proposed. Opponents generally fear that such housing, presumably occupied by a lower socioeconomic class of residents, will reduce property values and adversely affect neighborhood stability and safety.
Although NIMBY-ism reflects local financial concerns, dealing with it is less about money and more about the importance of working directly with citizens and citizen organizations. Gaining public acceptance of affordable housing projects requires transforming attitudes and beliefs based on facts to enhance understanding of project purposes and real impacts.
Yet even when government embraces a policy and fiscal initiative to help solve affordable housing problems, things still can go wrong if the initiative is implemented unsuccessfully.
A prime example is "the Opportunity Zones" investment provision of the 2017 tax-cut legislation. According to a New York Times report, this recently enacted tax policy initiative is being exploited in ways contrary to the basic intent of the law and is ultimately failing to achieve its goals.
The provision enables capital gains tax avoidance if such gains are invested in projects and enterprises within designated, economically disadvantaged opportunity zones delineated by state and local governments. Presumably, a high-priority aspiration of the law is incentivizing subsidized construction of affordable housing by using tax savings as the subsidy source.
But reportedly many designated opportunity zones are economically and socially advantaged rather than disadvantaged. Certainly it's no surprise that advantaged zones are where real estate investors and developers prefer investing. Not-so-poor neighborhoods are deemed safer and more profitable places for investment. And likewise unsurprising, investors and developers are erecting upscale projects: luxury apartment towers and hotels, office buildings, market-rate retail and recreational facilities.
Despite laudable financial objectives, the federal tax law appears to be seriously deficient. It evidently fails to set forth sufficiently specific criteria defining key attributes of disadvantaged opportunity zones delineated by local governments. And it seems to inadequately prescribe and limit the types and purposes of projects eligible for tax-avoiding capital gain investment. Perhaps a wiser, more caring Congress and administration in the future will remedy these deficiencies.
Until the haves sincerely care about the nation's low- and moderate-income workers and the housing challenges they face, and until the haves are willing to foot the bill to address these challenges by paying higher taxes, little progress will be made in solving the problem.

Texto completo: The D.C. Memo is a weekly recap of Washington political news, journalism, and opinion, delivered with an eye toward what matters for Minnesota. Sign up to get it in your inbox every Thursday.
Welcome to this week’s edition of the D.C. Memo. This week in Washington, corporate executives deny there is a problem, the Minnesota congressional delegation talks gun legislation, and Al Franken returns (somewhat). Let’s get on with this.
Keeping an eye on 3M
This week marked the first time Maplewood -based 3M testified in front of the House Oversight Committee. The result? The company said they do not believe potentially cancer-causing chemicals they used in a variety of consumer products — two types of compounds in a group known as PFAS — are harmful unless people are exposed in extremely high concentrations. Read more at MinnPost.
“In many ways Minnesota, my state, is ground zero for for the PFAS contamination that confronts the country,” former Minnesota Attorney General Lori Swanson testified before the committee.

Gun legislation

There were multiple mass shootings over the long recess before Congress went back into session this week. What do members, particularly Minnesota members, intend to do moving forward? Patrick Condon at the Star Tribune has the story.
“If I hear the words ‘common-sense gun legislation’ one more time, I’ll throw up,” Rep. Collin Peterson, of Minnesota’s 7th Congressional District told the Strib. “This is poll-tested nonsense.”
Florida, man
On Wednesday, Peterson effectively voted against the state of Florida. Peterson and all three Republicans in the Minnesota delegation voted against a bill supported by 26 Florida congress members: 13 Democrats and 13 Republicans.
The bill, The Protecting and Securing Florida’s Coastline Act, “permanently extends the moratorium on oil and gas leasing, pre-leasing, and related activities in certain areas of the Gulf of Mexico.”
Only four other Democrats joined Peterson in bucking the Democratic delegation, all from Texas: Reps. Henry Cuellar (TX-28), Lizzie Fletcher (TX-7), Sylvia Garcia (TX-29), and Filemon Vela (TX-34).
Attempting a comeback
Former Sen. Al Franken , who resigned after being accused by eight women of sexual misconduct, will be headlining the Politicon conference, which features pundits from around the country.
Other speakers include Donna Brazille, the former Democratic National Committee chair who leaked debate topics to Hillary Clinton’s campaign in 2016; Sean Hannity, the Fox News host who recently defended the racist “send her back” chants; and Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the former White House press secretary who refused to say that the press are not the “enemy of the people.” Truly an evening to remember.
Franken’s appearance follows a scheduled speaking event in Portland, Oregon on Oct 2.
The President next door
The third Democratic presidential debate was last night. It was the first time we got to see (almost) everyone on one stage: Joe Biden, Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Minnesota’s own Sen. Amy Klobuchar, among others. You can watch the debate here.
Speaking of, former Vice President Walter Mondale withdrew his statement that Klobuchar’s campaign has become a “prayer.” Nevermind, he says. “I had a bad day,” he told the New York Times. “I dismiss and reject what I said.”
Will you be watching? Let me know your thoughts at gschneider@minnpost.com.
In other news
* In a 5-4 decision, the Supreme Court said the Trump administration could continue the “Remain in Mexico” policy, in which asylum seekers are made to remain in Mexico until they receive a hearing. Only Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ruth Bader Ginsburg explicitly dissented.
* Purdue Pharma and its owners, members of the Sackler family, have tentatively reached a $3 billion dollar settlement for the devastation resulting from the opioid epidemic.
* California legislators passed AB-5, a bill that would reclassify independent workers, like Uber drivers, as employees of the company, a move that Uber and Lyft said they will fight in the coming weeks with a ballot measure.
* India is building mass detention camps after almost two million people in the state of Assam were told they could be effectively stripped of citizenship.

What I’m reading

Jennifer Bendery for HuffPost: Controversial Trump Court Pick Gets Expedited Senate Confirmation Hearing
Who is Federal court nominee Steven Menashi and where does he come from? Read this whole piece, but this excerpt should help explain why you should:
Menashi’s past writings include him comparing race data collection in college admissions to Germany under Adolf Hitler; denouncing women’s marches as sexual assault; opposing the ”radical abortion rights advocated by campus feminists and codified in Roe v. Wade”; arguing that diverse communities “exhibit less political and civic engagement, less effective government institutions, and fewer public goods”; and writing that it is “ridiculous” to say that students chanting the Dartmouth football cheer, “Wah-hoo-wah! Scalp ’em!,” are propagating “a racist belief in the inferiority of American Indians.”

California is one of less than a handful of states not investigating Google, which is based in… California. A reporter tries to figure out why.

Texto completo: Community organizers are hoping to save the iconic East Village bodega Gem Spa by rallying longtime customers to spend money at the location this Saturday.
The group #SaveNYC is hosting a "Cash Mob" at the storefront on St. Marks Place and Second Avenue, encouraging people to buy their famous egg creams and other items. 
"Come prepared to spend some money," said the description of the Facebook event.
Gem Spa opened in the 1920s and got its current name in 1957. The bodega has been featured in a painting by Jean-Michel Basquiat and name dropped in poems by Allen Ginsberg.
But the business has faced economic hardship in a rapidly gentrifying neighborhood. The New York Times reported that it was operating at a loss and is in $100,000 debt. It also lost its cigarette and lottery license in April after a former employee was caught selling to an undercover police officer.
Gem Spa is hoping to innovate by introducing new options like a vegan version of its egg cream and appealing to younger customers on social media.
Recently, the bodega installed a guerrilla street art installation after rumors surfaced that Citibank was looking to open a branch in place of the store. The exhibit featured a redecoration of the storefront's awning dubbed "Schitibank" with the bank's signature blue, white and red logo. 
Citi said in a tweet Thursday afternoon that it was never looking to open a branch on the corner. It added that it would like to buy and share Gem Spa's egg creams with the ban

Trump says China is having its ‘worst year in 57 years’

Texto completo: President Donald Trump exaggerated China’s economic slowdown during a recent rally for congressional candidate Dan Bishop in Fayetteville, N.C.
“I want China to do well, and I hope they do well, but they’ve had now the worst year in 57 years,” he said during the Sept. 9 speech.
It’s true that China’s economy is slumping, but 57 years ago, the country was still suffering from a massive famine brought on by Mao Zedong’s economic policies that historians say killed as many as 45 million people. We found it impossible to believe that today’s China is just as bad.
In reality, China’s economy is growing at its slowest rate in about 27 or 29 — not 57 — years.
Slowed GDP growth
The Trump campaign did not say what Trump was referring to, but based on similar statements he’s made in the past, it’s likely that he was talking about economic growth.
China’s gross domestic product grew 6.2% in the second quarter, marking its slowest pace since the first quarter of 1992, the earliest quarterly data available on record. But that’s the slowest quarterly growth in 27 years, not 57.
The slowdown matched analysts’ predictions, as the International Monetary Fund projected that China’s GDP would grow 6.2% over the course of 2019. The last time China’s GDP grew less than 6.2% in a year’s time was in 1990 — 29 years ago — when it grew just 3.9%.
But China saw much harder times before that. For a number of years during the 1960s and ‘70s, the economy was in far worse shape than it is now, according to data from the World Bank.
“In the past 57 years China has had some very bad years in terms of growth and social development,” said David Dollar, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution’s China Center. “The current situation is nowhere near as dire as any of those other periods.”
The Trump campaign pointed to a Wall Street Journal report suggesting China’s growth could be weaker than its official data lets on.
“Some economists who have dissected China’s GDP numbers say more accurate figures could be up to 3 percentage points lower, based on their analysis of corporate profits, tax revenue, rail freight, property sales and other measures of activity that they believe are harder for the government to fudge,” the report said.
But even if China’s GDP growth rate was closer to 3.2%, Trump’s 57-year figure would remain a stretch, since China’s GDP was contracting as recently as 1976, 43 years ago.
Oddly enough, the president accurately described China’s economic slide as the “worst in 27 years” several times in July and August before experimenting with other timelines.
Recently, Trump had said China’s economy was at its worst point in “30, 40 years,” “54 years,” “52 or 54 years,” “30 to 50 years” and “61 years.”
Reports in the Wall Street Journal have also made note of China’s falling currency and diminishing industrial production. But as the New York Times noted, those economic metrics show China struggling, but not to the point of breaking 57-year records.
In August, the Chinese yuan tumbled to its lowest value in 11 years. And in July, China’s industrial output growth slowed to 4.8% from a year earlier, a 17-year low.
Mary Lovely, professor of economics at Syracuse University and a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said China’s economic slump is not particularly shocking to those who track economic growth data.
“As an economy develops, growth rates come down,” she said. “Over the long term, we have seen China’s average growth rate decline, which is what we would expect.”
In the United States, for example, the growth rate is much lower — it was 2.8% in 2018, according to the World Bank — because growth is more dependent on technological advances than making efficient use of existing resources, Lovely said.
Our ruling
Trump said China has “had now the worst year in 57 years.”
China’s GDP recently grew at its slowest quarterly rate in 27 years, and it is projected to grow at its slowest yearly rate in 29 years. So China’s economy is slowing. But it’s not at its worst point in 57 years.
We rate this statement Mostly False.

Debunked! Most Americans do support US engagement in world affairs, not a retreat

Texto completo: A powerful belief about American views of the world has taken hold among foreign policy experts -- that Americans are exhausted from global overreach and want to shed the burdens of global leadership. Arguing that American voters' "foreign policy views stink," New York Times columnist David Brooks opined that, after "Iraq and other debacles, many Americans are exhausted by the global leadership role" and "actively hostile" to key elements of U.S. foreign policy from past decades.
Brooks is not alone in this view. It animates much of foreign policy thinking, among Democrats and Republicans.
There's just one problem: This view is wrong.
The latest annual survey examining American attitudes on foreign policy conducted for the Chicago Council on Global Affairs by polling and market research firm Ipsos Public Affairs shows that, rather than supporting a retreat, large numbers of Americans favor active U.S. engagement in the world and support long-standing pillars of U.S. foreign policy -- alliances, trade, democracy.
The survey, conducted June 7-20, found that American support for taking an active role in world affairs remains near record high, at 69%, compared to 30% of Americans who want to stay out of world affairs. While President Donald Trump has frequently railed against the costs to the United States of maintaining security alliances and trade agreements, a strong majority of Americans (61%) believe that the benefits of staying engaged outweigh the costs.
In a first, the survey asked what people mean by taking an "active part" in world affairs. Large majorities of Americans (70% or more) believe that engaging in trade, providing humanitarian and economic aid, promoting democracy and human rights, defending allies and participating in international organizations form part of such active engagement. And 62% believed increasing spending on defense and diplomacy is part of an active U.S. role. A bare majority (51%) say it includes intervening in other countries, while a larger majority (62%) exclude selling arms abroad from an active role.
When asked what policies would make America safer, majorities cite alliances with other countries (74%), U.S. military superiority (69%), promoting democracy and human rights (56%) and participating in international organizations (54%) as most effective.
While Trump has consistently suggested that U.S. alliances mostly benefit allies rather than the United States, the survey finds Americans reject that view. Sixty percent of Americans believe alliances in Asia are mutually beneficial or mostly benefit the U.S., and 64% believe this when it comes to alliances in Europe.
And Americans are willing to use force to back up these alliance commitments. Fifty-eight percent favor using U.S. troops to defend South Korea if North Korea invaded it, and 54% do so in case Russia invades a NATO ally such as Latvia, Lithuania or Estonia. They also believe we should increase or maintain U.S. troops in South Korea (69%) and Japan (59%). The largest majority yet (73%) believe NATO is essential for European security, and more Americans (78%) believe that we should maintain or increase our commitment to NATO than at any time since the question was first asked in 1974.
It isn't just alliances that receive record levels of support. So does international trade. The survey showed 87% of Americans believe international trade is good for the U.S. economy (up from 59% just three years ago), and 83% think trade is good for American companies (up from 57% in 2016).
What is significant about all of these findings is that despite the political turmoil and deep partisan divisions on many issues, when it comes to America's role in the world there is a large degree of agreement and support among all Americans. Alliances, the bedrock of American military engagement abroad since World War II, enjoy strong and growing public support.
What Americans reject is using force in other countries to try to resolve conflicts. The bitter experiences in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria have left Americans weary of interventionism.
But this concern is not the same as wanting to retreat from the world. Even after decades of war, a major financial crisis, and new challenges to U.S. powers, Americans strongly favor maintaining a leadership role in the world.

Bob Baffert, Justify's trainer
Trainer Bob Baffert went on offense Thursday and said he's never intentionally administered the banned substance scopolamine to any of his horses, including 2018 Triple Crown winner Justify who failed a drug test just weeks before going on to win the Kentucky Derby.
"Justify is one of the finest horses I've had the privilege of training and by any standard is one of the greatest of all time," Baffert said. "I am proud to stand by his record and my own."
According to a report from the New York Times, Justify tested positive for scopolamine after winning the Santa Anita Derby on April 7, 2018. Had Justify not finished among the top two finishers in the Santa Anita Derby, he would not have qualified for the Kentucky Derby. A failed drug test would have meant disqualification from the Santa Anita Derby and no entry into the Kentucky Derby.
Churchill Downs Racetrack President Kevin Flanery issued a statement Thursday afternoon saying Justify's drug tests before and after the Kentucky Derby came back clean.
"Until media reports surfaced Wednesday night, neither Churchill Downs nor the Kentucky Horse Racing Commission had knowledge of any potential positive tests that may have emanated from California in advance of the 2018 Kentucky Derby," Flanery said. "We do know that all pre- and post-race tests for 2018 Kentucky Derby participants came back clean, including Justify.
"In advance of our race each year, the Kentucky Horse Racing Commission conducts pre-race out-of-competition testing for every Kentucky Derby starter and all starters' results were clean. After the race, the top finishers are tested for a myriad of banned substances and the results for all were clean."
The Maryland Jockey Club released a statement Thursday echoing the same results on pre- and post-drug tests conducted for the Preakness Stakes at Pimlico Race Course in Baltimore.
W. Craig Robertson III, an attorney for Baffert, issued a statement Thursday calling the New York Times report "long on sensationalism, short on facts."
In a letter to New York Times reporter Joe Drape, Robertson wrote that the report was "extremely disappointing. Horse racing is a tremendous sport and Mr. Baffert conducts himself with honesty, class and character. They both deserve better."
Dr. Rick Sams, who ran the drug lab for the Kentucky Horse Racing Commission from 2011 to 2018, told the New York Times that scopolamine can act as a bronchodilator to clear a horse's airway and optimize a horse's heart rate, making the horse more efficient.
In comments to BloodHorse.com, Baffert said he's never administered the drug to any of his horses.
The New York Times report said scopolamine can be found in jimson weed, "which can grow wildly where dung is present and become inadvertently mixed in feed, and that 'environmental contamination' is often used as a defense."
"I wouldn't even know how it would come — what form it would come in," Baffert told BloodHorse. "We're always getting notices to be aware of that stuff, but looking for it is like looking for a needle in a haystack. It's tough, especially when you bed on straw.
"I've been fortunate that I've never had one of these before, but I've seen it happen to other trainers out here. You're holding your breath that it doesn't happen to you, but we're sitting ducks. Contamination is hard to control.
"The general public has to be educated that we do have contamination. It's common sense that nobody would intentionally give their horses something like (scopolamine). I wouldn't do that. When it happened, it was like, 'Seriously? That's ridiculous.' I turned it over to my attorney because I was trying to win a Derby."
Chuck Winner, former chairman of the California Horse Racing Board, issued a statement Thursday saying "Justify, along with six other horses in four different barns at Santa Anita, ingested scopolamine from Jimson Weed which was present in the hay that had been delivered to the barns."
Ed Martin, president of the Association of Racing Commissioners International, said the CHRB could have used that as a "mitigating factor" to not disqualify Justify as the Santa Anita Derby winner.
"If that is the case and they have those tests to basically substantiate that, then that would be totally understandable and they did the right thing," Martin said.
That may not be enough to appease Mick Ruis, trainer of Santa Anita Derby runner-up, Bolt d'Oro who is accusing the CHRB of protecting Justify and Baffert. Ruis told the Courier Journal he is considering a lawsuit over the result. Justify earned $600,000 as the winner. Bolt d'Oro earned $200,000 and finished 12th in the Kentucky Derby.
"I think it warrants (a lawsuit)," Ruis said. "The rule was if there was any of that (drug) found, you were disqualified and you had to give up the purse money. Then they never tell anybody that they found out about it. ...
"It's just real disappointing how we have different sets of rules for different people there in Santa Anita. The horse tested positive. Why didn't anybody know about it until now?"
The New York Times reported the California Horse Racing Board waited nine days before the Kentucky Derby to notify Baffert of the failed drug test. In August — two months after Justify had won the Belmont to become the 13th Triple Crown winner — the board disposed of the inquiry during a closed-door executive session.
Robertson wrote that he instructed the CHRB not to have any further contact with Baffert after the first positive test.
"I was confident that Mr. Baffert would ultimately prevail if the CHRB pursued the matter," Robertson wrote. "This left the CHRB with two choices — either pursue a frivolous case that had no merit at great taxpayer expense or exercise reason and common sense and decide to take no further action. ... The CHRB did right by all parties, including the industry, in this case."
Justify never raced again after the Belmont, with his retirement announced in July of 2018. Robertson's letter says Justify "passed any and all drug tests" involved with the Kentucky Derby, Preakness and Belmont.
Justify completed an unprecedented Triple Crown run by winning the Belmont by 1 3/4 lengths over Gronkowski, capping a 6-for-6 career. Justify became just the second undefeated Triple Crown winner ever, joining Seattle Slew (1977).
Co-owned by WinStar Farm, China Horse Club, Starlight Racing and Head of Plains Partners, Justify's training as a 2-year-old was briefly interrupted by a pulled muscle. He didn't race until February of 2018, breaking his maiden with a 9 1/2-length score at Santa Anita.
Justify won his next race on March 11 at Santa Anita by 6 1/2 lengths and then earned his spot in the Kentucky Derby with a three-length victory over Bolt d'Oro in the Santa Anita Derby.
At Churchill Downs, Justify faced a sloppy track and a 136-year "curse" as he tried to become just the second horse in history (Apollo did it in 1882) to win the Kentucky Derby without racing as a 2-year-old. Justify ran just off the outside of early pace-setter Promises Fulfilled, breezed past him entering the final turn and put away Good Magic down the stretch for a 2 1/2-length victory.
Two weeks later he endured a grueling battle with Good Magic on the backstretch and held on for a half-length victory over Bravazo in a fog-filled Preakness, setting up his Triple Crown run at Belmont on June 9.
A son of Scat Daddy out of the Ghostzapper mare Stage Magic, Justify finished with career earnings of $3,798,000. He was purchased for $500,000 at Keeneland's 2016 September Yearling Sale. Coolmore owns Justify's breeding rights, and he commands a $150,000 mating fee. He currently stands at Coolmore's farm in Australia for the Southern Hemisphere breeding season.
Baffert became the second trainer to win two Triple Crowns, matching Sunny Jim Fitzsimmons with Gallant Fox (1930) and Omaha (1935). Baffert, who has won the Kentucky Derby five times, also won the Triple Crown with American Pharoah in 2015.
Elliott Walden, president and CEO of racing operations for WinStar Farm, told BloodHorse the New York Times report "has been very disappointing." Walden said WinStar was informed of the failed drug test in mid-April 2018, turned the matter over to its attorneys and never heard anything further from the regulator.
"It is ridiculous it is even being brought up now," Walden told BloodHorse. "I mean, scopolamine is a known contaminant in California. Other top trainers have dealt with this issue. It is a shame for Bob's reputation, Justify's reputation and our reputation."

Texto completo: HONG KONG – The masked men who recently tossed firebombs at Jimmy Lai's home targeted one of this city's foremost democracy advocates. Lai, a 71-year-old media billionaire, calls this summer's ongoing protest "a martyrdom movement" and "a last-straw movement." It has an intensity and dynamic that bewilders the protesters' opponents in Beijing and in Hong Kong's Beijing-obedient city administration.
Today's mostly young protesters will be middle-aged in 2047, at the expiration of the 50-year agreement that ostensibly accords Hong Kong protected status as an island of freedom. Beijing attempted to whittle away that status with a proposed 2003 law against "subversion." And by devaluing suffrage by the 2014 requirement that candidates for the chief-executive receive approval from a Beijing-loyal committee. And by this year's extradition bill that would have facilitated sweeping Hong Kongers into the maw of China's opaque criminal-justice system.
Monday's New York Times carried a full-page ad paid for by "the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China." Which means, effectively, by the Chinese Communist Party. The ad said: "We are resolutely committed to 'One Country, Two Systems' which provides the constitutional guarantee for Hong Kong's continued development and success as a free and open society." The ad pledged "dialogue to talk through differences and look for common ground with no preconditions."
But the "one county, two systems" formulation, agreed to in 1997, when British authority ended, as a 50-year framework for Hong Kong's relations with the PRC, is an inherently menacing precondition. And Beijing's consistently sinister behavior reveals a determination, as implacable as it is predictable, to incrementally nullify "one nation, two systems" by reducing Hong Kong to just another jurisdiction wholly subservient to China's deepening tyranny.
In 1940, Winston Churchill warned against "a new Dark Age made more sinister, and perhaps more protracted, by the lights of perverted science." That is China's aspiration with "digital Leninism," an application of science through manipulative technologies that neither Churchill nor his contemporary, George Orwell, anticipated.
In her 1951 "The Origins of Totalitarianism," Hannah Arendt argued that a tyrannical regime, wielding bureaucracy and mass media, could achieve permanence by conscripting the citizenry's consciousness. This echoed Orwell's foreboding: "Imagine a boot stamping on a human face – forever." In 1956, Arendt thought her theory had been refuted by a fact – the Hungarian Revolution, which demonstrated that no state can interrupt "all channels of communication." Hong Kong sees Beijing using new technologies in the service of an evil permanence.
"To see what is in front of one's nose," wrote Orwell, "needs a constant struggle." Belatedly, the world is seeing. The Economist recently editorialized: "The West's 25-year bet on China has failed." The wager was that "market totalitarianism" is an oxymoron.
Embedding China in the global economy supposedly would open it to the softening effects of commerce, which would be solvents of authoritarianism. The West's tardy but welcome disenchantment is, as the Economist says, "the starkest reversal in modern geopolitics." If Hong Kong's heroic refusal to go gentle into Beijing's dark night is accelerating this disenchantment, the summer of dissent has been this decade's grandest and most important development.

Texto completo: M.I.T.'s president acknowledged Thursday that he had signed a letter thanking Jeffrey Epstein for a donation in 2012 and said senior members of his administration had approved gifts from the disgraced financier as long as they remained anonymous.
Separately Thursday, the LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman confirmed that he had helped raise funds from Mr. Epstein on behalf of the M.I.T. Media Lab and its director, Joichi Ito, a longtime friend.
The president, L. Rafael Reif, made his disclosure in an email to the university community less than a week after news of the anonymous donations contributed to the resignation of Mr. Ito, the director of M.I.T.'s prominent Media Lab. Mr. Ito stepped down after published reports described how the Media Lab had handled millions of dollars in gifts from or apparently facilitated by Mr. Epstein, who killed himself last month while awaiting trial in a Manhattan jail on federal sex-trafficking charges.
Mr. Reif said he did not remember signing the thank-you to Mr. Epstein in 2012, four years after Mr. Epstein pleaded guilty to a sex charge involving a minor in Florida and the year before Mr. Ito has said he met Mr. Epstein. "I apparently signed this letter on August 16, 2012, about six weeks into my presidency," he said. "Although I do not recall it, it does bear my signature."
Mr. Reif also said that "senior members of the administration" had known of gifts to the Media Lab from Mr. Epstein between 2013 and 2017. He added that Massachusetts Institute of Technology officials had been aware of Mr. Epstein's criminal history "in general terms" and had relied on the judgment of Mr. Ito, who Mr. Reif said had believed that Mr. Epstein had stopped his criminal behavior.
Mr. Hoffman released his statement, first reported by the website Axios, after several inquiries related to his longtime friendship with Mr. Ito.
"My few interactions with Jeffrey Epstein came at the request of Joi Ito, for the purposes of fundraising for the M.I.T. Media Lab," he said. "Prior to these interactions, I was told by Joi that Epstein had cleared the M.I.T. vetting process."
"I am deeply regretful," he added.
Mr. Reif said that his staff allowed Mr. Epstein to make donations having "accepted Joi's assessment of the situation," but insisted that Mr. Epstein remain anonymous so that, Mr. Reif said, he could not use the gifts to "enhance his own reputation."
"I am aware that we could and should have asked more questions about Jeffrey Epstein and about his interactions with Joi," Mr. Reif said. "We did not see through the limited facts we had, and we did not take time to understand the gravity of Epstein's offenses or the harm to his young victims."
Mr. Ito, who apologized last month for accepting money from Mr. Epstein for the lab and for his own outside investment funds, did not respond to a request for comment. He stepped down from the Media Lab -- and other positions, including a seat on the New York Times Company board -- on Saturday, a day after The New Yorker described emails among Media Lab officials about Mr. Epstein's gifts.
According to the emails, which The Times reviewed, Mr. Epstein also helped secure millions of dollars in donations from the Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates and Leon D. Black, the founder of Apollo Global Management, one of the world's biggest private equity firms.
A spokesman for Mr. Gates previously said, "Any claim that Epstein directed any programmatic or personal grant making for Bill Gates is completely false." Representatives of Mr. Black did not return requests for comment.
The 2012 letter to Mr. Epstein that Mr. Reif signed was uncovered by the law firm Goodwin Procter, which M.I.T. hired to investigate the links between Mr. Epstein and the university. The school said last month that it had received roughly $ 800,000 from Mr. Epstein over the past two decades, which had gone either to the Media Lab or to a professor, Seth Lloyd.
The 2012 donation -- believed by the university to be the first from Mr. Epstein after his 2008 guilty plea -- went to Mr. Lloyd, a physicist, Mr. Reif said. Mr. Lloyd said last month he had had a relationship with Mr. Epstein that began in 2004 and ended only after The Miami Herald reported last year about allegations against Mr. Epstein.
"I helped Mr. Epstein protect his reputation, and I disempowered his victims," Mr. Lloyd wrote in a post on the Medium online platform. He did not immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday.
An M.I.T. spokesman said the school had no comment beyond Mr. Reif's letter, which characterized the details released Thursday as preliminary findings from Goodwin Procter's investigation.
Late Thursday, Harvard's president, Lawrence S. Bacow, released a statement detailing Mr. Epstein's gifts to that university, which totaled about $ 8.9 million and ended in 2007, "based on current information," he said. "Epstein's connections as a donor to this university, and other institutions, raise important concerns," he wrote.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Amid Bipartisan Outcry, White House Agrees to Release Ukraine Military Aid

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- The White House on Thursday dropped its resistance to releasing a package of military assistance to Ukraine, amid a bipartisan outcry from lawmakers and an open investigation into whether President Trump and his allies were distorting the United States foreign aid program for their own political benefit.
Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, and Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, said the administration told them on Wednesday night that it would release $ 250 million, which is intended partly to train and equip Ukrainian forces defending against Russian incursion.
The White House had previously requested a review of the spending, ostensibly to ensure that it was being used to further American foreign policy interests. But the delay prompted a swift backlash from Republicans and Democrats in Congress, where there has long been strong support from both parties for Ukraine's efforts to stave off Russian aggression.
And some Democrats suggested that the delay was intended to pressure the government of the newly elected Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, to start investigations of Mr. Trump's political rivals, including the family of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. The inquiries have been sought by Mr. Trump's personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani and other allies.
On Thursday, Mr. Graham sought to put a swift end to the questions.
"I think they've got the message," he said. "If you're listening in Ukraine on C-Span, you're going to get the money."
Mr. Durbin said the administration's change of heart was in part motivated by its unwillingness to defend blocking the aid. He had planned to propose freezing some administrative funds from the Pentagon if future assistance to Ukraine was delayed.
"I think the administration was embarrassed when they saw that we were going to debate it here today," Mr. Durbin said during a Senate Appropriations Committee hearing on legislation that would fund the Defense Department. "But do we really have to go through that kind of exercise?"
"I just want to make sure it is spent in a timely way," he said, adding that with less than three weeks before the end of the fiscal year, it was possible that there would not be enough time to spend the $ 250 million.
A senior Trump administration official confirmed that the funding for the military assistance had been released, but declined to comment on the rationale for the decision or the delay.
"The administration supports Ukraine's efforts of reform and self-defense," the official said, "and these funds will advance Ukrainian efforts toward those ends."
The delay of the aid package has put Mr. Zelensky and his new government in a difficult spot. The United States is a critical ally in Ukraine's struggle to stop further encroachment by Russia, but Washington has long prodded Kiev to fight corruption plaguing its government. There is broad optimism in American foreign policy circles that Mr. Zelensky, a former comedian and a political neophyte, might be able to make progress on both fronts, provided he maintains support from the United States and the West.
"There is near panic in Ukraine today about America's commitment to the U.S.-Ukrainian relationship," said Senator Christopher S. Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut, citing a recent trip to Ukraine where he met with Mr. Zelensky. "They are desperate for a bipartisan signal from the United States that we remain with them, and this is the opportunity to do it."
With some Republicans balking at the prospect of withholding money from other aspects of the Defense Department as penalty, Mr. Durbin ultimately agreed to withdraw his proposal and work with his colleagues to find a compromise.
"We will burn fresh hell if we have to," said Senator John Kennedy, Republican of Louisiana, "but we will come up with something."
Mr. Trump has privately expressed skepticism, complaining in May that Ukrainian officials under the previous government tried to help Hillary Clinton win the presidency in 2016, and asserting that all Ukrainian politicians are "corrupt."
"That's his own opinion, and it's an absolutely correct one, unless maybe it's overstated a little bit," Mr. Giuliani said on Thursday. Ukraine, he said, was "probably one of the more corrupt countries in the world."
He said he had nothing to do with the decisions to delay or release the assistance, and had not discussed the matter with Mr. Zelensky's representatives.
Nonetheless, Mr. Giuliani, who has been communicating with a top aide to Mr. Zelensky about the matters Mr. Trump's allies want investigated, said he expected Mr. Zelensky's prosecutors would begin assessing the matters in the next couple of weeks.
An adviser to Mr. Zelensky asserted that the delay in the assistance was unrelated to the potential investigations.
"I'm very certain that they weren't connected," said the adviser, Igor Novikov, who said he was "incredibly grateful" for the support from Congress and the Trump administration. "It is definitely good news for Ukraine because we consider the United States one of our top partners, and a real and true and tested friend."
Vice President Mike Pence denied last week that the delay in releasing the military assistance was related to Mr. Giuliani's efforts to persuade the Ukrainians to investigate matters related to Mr. Biden, who is the early front-runner for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination.
But, after a meeting with Mr. Zelensky in Warsaw, Mr. Pence told reporters that he and Mr. Trump "have great concerns about issues of corruption," linking those concerns to the military assistance. The president "wants to be assured that those resources are truly making their way to the kind of investments that will contribute to security and stability in Ukraine," Mr. Pence said.
The matter most likely will not be settled with the release of the military assistance.
On Monday, three House committees announced a wide-ranging investigation into whether Mr. Trump and Mr. Giuliani were misappropriating United States government foreign policy tools -- including withholding the military assistance -- to try to help the president politically.
And House Democrats have also signaled that they plan to counter the administration's reluctance to spend the money in upcoming funding measures. In an early draft of the short-term spending bill needed to delay a government shutdown on Oct. 1, obtained by The New York Times, lawmakers included a provision that would extend the money's availability for another fiscal year and prevent the administration from blocking it up again.
The legislation is expected to be finalized in the coming days before an expected vote next week in the House.
During the hearing, the Senate committee's Republican majority also blocked language that would restrict the administration's ability to use military money for the construction of a wall at the southwestern border.

Texto completo: For nearly 20 years, Bob Baffert has been the face of American thoroughbred racing, a trainer who took one fast horse after another to the Triple Crown races, winning many of them. His white hair has made him distinctive, and his silver tongue has made him memorable.
At ease in front of microphones, he has filled up reporters' notebooks on mornings at the track, where he famously shows up in the hour from 8 to 9 -- long after his rivals, who keep to a sunup schedule.
On Thursday, however, after The New York Times reported that Justify, the 2018 Triple Crown winner trained by Baffert, had failed a drug test shortly before the Kentucky Derby, Baffert let his lawyer do most of the talking.
In a letter to The Times released on social media, Baffert's attorney, W. Craig Robertson III, said that Justify's positive test for the banned substance scopolamine had been the result of "environmental contamination" and commended the California Horse Racing Board's handling of the case. As reported by The Times, the board apparently did not follow its own procedures and ultimately closed the investigation without ever disclosing the positive test result to the public.
Scopolamine can occur naturally in jimson weed, which occasionally has been found in horse feed or bedding materials. However, Robertson offered no evidence of contamination; nor did California regulators when offered the opportunity to respond to The Times before the publication of the article. According to experts, the drug can act as a bronchodilator to clear airways and optimize heart rates, making horses more efficient.
The quantity of the drug found in Justify suggested it was not the result of feed or bedding contamination and was intended to enhance performance, according to Dr. Rick Sams, who ran the drug lab for the Kentucky Horse Racing Commission from 2011 to 2018.
In recent weeks Baffert has declined multiple requests for an interview with The Times. The Hall of Fame trainer did so again Thursday, after the article was published.
"The C.H.R.B. did right by all parties, including the industry," Robertson said in the letter, adding, "Horse racing is a tremendous sport, and Mr. Baffert conducts himself with honesty, class and character."
The revelation of Justify's failed test comes as horse racing is under siege. The industry has been shrinking financially and losing its hold on general sports fans for decades. Industry leaders longed for an equine superstar that could transcend the sport during the decades when a series of supposed super-horses came up short in their attempts to become the first the Triple Crown winner since Affirmed in 1978. Then in 2015, under Baffert's guidance, American Pharoah pulled off the feat.
As that breakthrough approached, Baffert was often sentimental and philosophical about his own rise from a third-rate jockey on the bush tracks of Arizona to one of the world's pre-eminent trainers.
Baffert spoke about how a severe heart attack in Dubai had made him face his own mortality. He said he was hurt by an unflattering 2013 report by California regulators after seven horses had died in his care. The report said that Baffert had been giving every horse in his barn a thyroid hormone without checking to see if any of them had thyroid problems.
Baffert also spoke about how a narrow loss in the 2012 Derby, by a horse named after his son Bode, had made him seek inner peace.
As Justify followed in American Pharoah's footsteps, horse racing appeared to have an even stronger chance at stirring back to life. But after 30 racehorses died from injuries at Santa Anita Park in California over the winter and spring, the industry found itself back on the defensive. The Los Angeles County district attorney's office began an investigation, and California lawmakers and animal rights activists called for more regulation and transparency, especially when it came to drugs and horse safety.
Baffert, 66, with his five Kentucky Derby winners and two Triple Crown champions, assumed a role as the sport's affable statesman. In May, in the wake of the Santa Anita deaths, he was the star attraction in support of the California horse racing industry, traveling to the State Capitol in Sacramento to defend his sport before lawmakers.
Baffert told them that the deaths had increased awareness among his colleagues.
"I think the trainers are going to do a better job of policing themselves," he said.
On Thursday, however, others were forced to defend the sport because of an unflattering narrative in which Baffert was a central character.
In a statement, Kevin Flanery, the president of Churchill Downs, the host of the Derby, said neither the track nor the Kentucky Horse Racing Commission had known about the failed drug test before The Times article.
"We do know that all pre- and post-race tests for 2018 Kentucky Derby participants came back clean, including Justify," the statement said.
To qualify for the Kentucky Derby, Justify needed to finish first or second in the Santa Anita Derby in April 2018. He won, but a rule on the books at the time would have required that he be disqualified by a positive drug test, forfeiting both the prize money and entry into the Derby, the first Triple Crown race.
Test results, emails and internal memos in the Justify case show that California regulators did not notify Baffert for nearly three weeks that his Derby favorite had tested positive for scopolamine. The board then pursued an investigation to figure out if Justify might have unintentionally ingested the banned substance.
Four months later -- and more than two months after Baffert and the horse's owners celebrated their Triple Crown victory in New York -- the California board disposed of the inquiry altogether during a closed-door executive session.
The board's chairman, Chuck Winner, has owned horses that Baffert trained. Winner said recently he had not recused himself from the inquiry into Justify and added that the racing board's general counsel had not advised him to do so.
W. Elliott Walden, chief executive and racing manager of WinStar Farm, part of Justify's ownership group, told the industry publication Blood Horse that he knew about the positive test in April 2018. He said he had turned the issue over to his lawyers and then never heard from regulators.
"It is a shame for Bob's reputation, Justify's reputation, and our reputation," Walden told the publication.

Texto completo: Headnote A short film about a Black father and daughter captures the heart of audiences seeing ?Angry Birds 2.?
"Hair Love," a new animated short showing the love between a Black father and daughter, is now in theaters. Premiering right before "Angry Birds 2," the animated short gives insight and relatability of Black fatherhood to a broad audience.
Matthew A. Cherry was inspired to write "Hair Love" about two years ago after seeing viral videos of Black fathers doing their daughter's hair. It was a representation that hadn't been shown before and he thought that it would be great to make an animation film about it. After writing the script, Cherry sent it to his friend Peter Ramsey, an advocate for diversity in animation and Oscar awardwinning director of "SpiderMan: Into the SpiderVerse."
"When I did the script and was ready to make it into a real thing, Peter was one of the first people that I sent it to for feedback. I always had animation in mind because it is a more universal medium that people relate to," said Cherry. "You rarely see a Black family in animation, so it was really important to me to have that representation."
Ramsey liked the script so much that instead of just giving feedback, he came on board as executive producer. Getting support from other Hollywood stars came naturally as well. Cherry created a Kickstarter campaign for "Hair Love" and reached his goal of $75,000 within the first five days. Some of the donators included Gabrielle Union, Dwyane Wade, Yara Shahidi, and Jordan Peale. Issa Rae also came on board to be the sole voice in the animated short.
"The way 'Hair Love' came about was so fresh and straight from the heart. Matt had a vision and he just pursued it. He didn't wait for anyone to give him permission, and he wasn't an animation insider. It was pure passion and drive on his part that made it happen," said Ramsey. "I believed in the project and wanted it to become a reality because it's an intimate look at something that is very normal and happens every day in the real world, but hardly ever seen in movies, especially animated ones."
"Hair Love" centers around a Black father, Stephen, and his daughter, Zuri. Stephen has long locks his wife usually styles. However, when mom is not available right before a big event, Stephen has to figure out what to do. The fiveminute film is mostly silent with the exception of Issa Rae, who plays an online natural hair blogger. Cherry had been a fan of Rae since her YouTube days and thought that she'd be a great fit because of her influence in the natural hair community and her distinct voice. The decision to have the father and daughter be silent was also very intentional. Cherry was inspired by films like "WALL-E" and "Up" that convey emotion through their silence. He wanted audiences to visually pay attention to the actions and expressions of the characters.
Since the release of "Angry Birds 2" on August 14, audiences have given great feedback to Cherry. What has surprised him most is the relatability of the film to audiences of different races. While the film is written, directed and produced by Black people; men, women, and children have shared how they go through the same thing in their families.
"Sometimes as a filmmaker you think that you have to be so broad to appeal to everybody, but there's a universal appeal in being specific," said Cherry. "Little girls have told me how they see themselves in Zuri and boys have told me how they want to be a father like Stephen. It's been amazing seeing how everyone relates to this story."
Along with the short film, Cherry's Kickstarter campaign resulted in a book deal. "Hair Love," the book, is a New York Times bestseller and available at Target, Walmart, Barnes & Noble, and on Kindle. The short film can be seen in theaters before "Angry Birds 2."

Farhad Manjoo: American universities are addicted to billionaires

Texto completo: What gets me is the unctuous, oozing chumminess — the unembarrassed, hat-in-hand genuflection toward the pedophile rainmaker.
There was Joichi Ito, director of Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s prestigious Media Lab, with a problem well known to anyone who’s ever labored in academia: He was low on funds. But unlike, say, the thousands of adjunct professors who toil in American universities at poverty wages, Ito was in charge of an institution that had long cultivated a direct line to corporations, billionaires and pretend-billionaires with reputations to launder. So all he had to do to get money to pay for a researcher was dash off an email: “Could you re-up/top-off with another $100k so I can extend his contract for another year?” Ito asked Jeffrey Epstein in September 2014, according to documents published last week by The New Yorker. In response, Epstein snapped his fingers: “Yes.”
There is still a lot to unpack in the ties between one of America’s most elite universities and a convicted sex offender — ties that led to Ito’s resignation last weekend from MIT as well as several boards, among them that of The New York Times.
But what’s immediately striking about the relationship is the way it echoes the other things we’ve heard about Epstein’s stunningly successful efforts to wriggle his way into the good graces of scientists, technologists and other academic luminaries. The chumminess suggests a deeper and more intractable moral rot in American academia: It shows that when a billionaire (or, in Epstein’s case, a faux billionaire) comes calling, men in the ivory tower can’t resist lowering their golden locks to let the plutocrat climb aboard.
Epstein’s infiltration of MIT shouldn’t even be much of a surprise; from the Kochs to the Sacklers to the Saudis to sundry endowed chairs and fancy corporate institutes, American higher education has long been hooked on billionaires. The billionaires aren’t dumb — they go after the universities because our idea factories have proven to be susceptible to all their wealth.
Giving money to higher education amplifies a billionaire’s legacy. The money greases hiring decisions and shapes curriculums, and it can ricochet across the wider culture for decades, even after the billionaire himself has shuffled off this mortal coil. Note how Charles and David Koch used higher-education philanthropy to push a libertarian intellectual agenda that influenced policy wonk circles across the country. The Sacklers, meanwhile, used their opioid-derived loot to insulate the family name from the horrors that the family business was wreaking across the country.
Epstein’s money, too, inarguably had a pernicious effect on science and tech. How exactly this happened will take a while to figure out. For now, what we can say is that Epstein’s influence exacerbated one of the most pressing problems in the sciences: the systematic exclusion of women.
“Almost every science scholar whom he’s said to have courted or supported is a man,” Slate’s Daniel Engber recently reported of Epstein’s cultivation of intellectuals. Before and after his conviction in 2008, Epstein was a regular on the masturbatory tech gadfly circuit — an attendee and sponsor of “billionaire dinners” and related sausage-factory soirees at which ultrawealthy men (among them the founders of Amazon and Google), elite scientists and various other male luminaries discussed the future they were collectively trying to build (or, depending on your perspective, squander.)
“What happens when women don’t get invited to these dinners is they lose out on professional opportunities,” said Sarah Szalavitz, a social designer and external fellow at the MIT Media Lab whom I’ve long trusted as a keen observer of the industry. “It’s not a grand conspiracy. It’s just a fact: When you have an event on a private beach owned by a sex trafficker, women don’t get invited. They don’t get invited to the private island. They don’t get invited to the sex trafficker’s conferences. They don’t get invited to speak.”
She’s right. As Engber found, when Epstein flew artificial intelligence experts in 2002 and physicists in 2006 to his private island, and hosted a conference at his home in 2010, nearly every scholar he’d picked was a man. The few women who attended were there as bonbons — models picked to sate interests of Epstein’s unrelated to science. “He would alternate between us,” one professor told Engber. “Sometimes he’d turn to his left and ask some science-y questions. Then he’d turn to his right and ask the model to show him her portfolio.”
Szalavitz told me that in a 2013 meeting, she’d warned Ito not to take Epstein’s money; she also told me that in an earlier meeting, she had also warned Nicholas Negroponte, the lab’s co-founder and longtime director, about Epstein.
When I emailed Negroponte to ask about Szalavitz’s warning, he said, “She may have, and would have been right.” In an all-hands meeting at the Media Lab last week, Negroponte defended taking Epstein’s money based on what the lab knew about him at the time. He also boasted about being on a first-name basis with 80% of American billionaires. In an email, Ito did not respond to the question but instead offered a blanket apology: “I remain deeply sorry for my errors in judgment and understand there is no justification for my actions.”
Szalavitz said that she felt Epstein’s donations had consequences for women affiliated with the lab. “I was a contemporary of all those people at all those dinners,” she said. “I always wondered why I didn’t get invited to those things. Now I know: When you include a sex trafficker, you can’t include women.”

Texto completo: Do more to stop the ethylene oxide threat
The Tribune Editorial Board's latest editorial on Sterigenics regarding public officials' responsibility to keep our communities safe does not go far enough ("With Sterigenics cleared to reopen, it's up to state, federal officials to keep residents safe," Sept. 9).
Ambient air monitoring has not proved to be a sufficient tool to identify increased risk and protect our community. In fact, one of the many challenges has been to identify and deploy testing equipment that can detect the carcinogenic gas ethylene oxide, or EtO, even at extremely dangerous levels.
Furthermore, regulators have proved incompetent at protecting our community from this carcinogen for many decades, and few (if any) have any confidence that regulators now have the technology and expertise required to contain this threat.
The Tribune Editorial Board should be calling on public officials to ban the use of EtO in close proximity to all residential communities in Illinois.
Additionally, it should take a stand supporting Illinois House Republican Leader Jim Durkin's proposed legislation to allow a home rule unit of local government to adopt an ordinance that prohibits emissions of EtO within its boundaries.

Use 'Baby on Board' buttons, moms-to-be
In my 80s, bus trips, usually for a doctor's appointment, are limited. However, recently, on a crowded bus, happily standing while holding on to the hanging strap, I noticed an attractive lady sitting in front of me.
This woman smiled and nodded toward me. Well, old but still handsome (though married), I returned her winsome smile with the practiced acknowledgment of 1960s movie star Robert Mitchum.
Well, she stood up and offered me her seat. Assuming she was departing, I sat. The bus stopped, but she remained standing.
Only then did I observe she was at least six months pregnant, and she continued smiling at me. She was the one needing "to take a load off," but she gave me her seat!
Humiliated, I busied myself with my smartphone; later, when I related this indignity to my wife, she laughed.

President hits the links a lot
Regarding reader Earl Beal's Aug. 6 letter "Let Trump take a break": Candidate Donald Trump proudly boasted and tweeted that if elected president, he would be too busy to play golf while working for the people, and he criticized then-President Barack Obama for playing.
As president, Trump has a completely different attitude about playing golf. Since taking office, he is a regular visitor at golf clubs he owns in Virginia and Florida. As of Aug. 31, the president has visited and played golf on his own golf course for a total of 228 days, or roughly 25% of his time.
Trump's message before being elected, "the country is going to hell and Obama is out playing golf," is just another indication of how he deceives the American people to gain their support.
The cost of the president's golf games to American taxpayers runs in the tens of millions of dollars. Also, it directly benefits him economically in the form of golf course revenues.
-- Paul Love, Wauconda

The joys of a cable news-free life
Regarding Stephen J. Lyons' Sept. 9 commentary "'Who won the week?' Me, because I stopped watching cable news": How gratifying it is that Lyons has discovered the pleasures of not watching cable news. I have never subscribed to cable and do not watch the news on the free television networks.
However, I am fully informed, preferring to gather information about national and world events the old-fashioned way. I subscribe to the Chicago Tribune, the Chicago Sun-Times and The New York Times, and also read books and magazines. The amount of knowledge an individual can gain from the printed word is much more than what can be gained from watching television. As Will Rogers once stated, "All I know is just what I read in the papers."
With one very important exception: Podcasts from the BBC World Service are informative and invaluable. BBC broadcasters and reporters are very professional, and you never hear the shouting and tirades that I read about concerning programs aired on Fox and other U.S. cable networks.
-- Larry Vigon, Chicago

Texto completo: Justify failed a drug test one month before the 2018 Kentucky Derby, and the California Horse Racing Board decided to dismiss the case after the colt went on to win the Triple Crown, The New York Times reported Wednesday.
Justify tested positive for scopolamine after winning the Santa Anita Derby in April '18, and qualifying for the Kentucky Derby in the process.
Scopolamine is a banned substance that can enhance performance. Such a result should have resulted in a disqualification, purse forfeiture and the removal of his Kentucky Derby entry. Instead, California regulators waited until April 26, nine days before the Kentucky Derby, to inform Bob Baffert, Justify's Hall of Fame trainer.
Baffert had a second sample tested by an independent lab, and it confirmed the results three days after Justify won the Kentucky Derby.
The board decided that the test results could have come from contaminated food. However, the Kentucky Horse Racing Commission's former drug lab chief, Rick Sams, said the amount of scopolamine in Justify's system suggested it "has to come from intentional intervention."
Two months after dismissing the Justify case, the California board changed the penalty for a failed scopolamine test from a DQ to a fine and a possible suspension
Basketball: The U.S. was ousted from medal contention by France at the World Cup, failing to capture gold at a major tournament for the first time since the 2006 world championships. Rudy Gobert had 21 points and 16 rebounds and France beat the U.S. 89-79 in the World Cup quarterfinals in Dongguan, China. The U.S. had won 58 consecutive tournament games in FIBA and Olympic competition. It was bidding to become the first nation to win three consecutive World Cups. The U.S. already had qualified for next summer's Olympics in Tokyo.
College football: Tennessee sophomore CB Bryce Thompson was reinstated and will be allowed to practice. Thompson had been suspended indefinitely after an Aug. 24 arrest on a misdemeanor domestic assault charge.

Reforming Urge to Rein In Executive Powers

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- Democratic presidential candidates broadly agree that President Trump has shaken the presidency loose from its constitutional limits and say that the White House needs major new legal curbs, foreshadowing a potential era of reform akin to the post-Watergate period if any of them wins next year's election.
In responses to a New York Times survey about executive power, the Democrats -- along with two Republicans mounting primary challenges to Mr. Trump -- envisioned a rebuke of his term by enshrining into law previous norms of presidential self-restraint.
Many called for new laws that would require presidents to disclose their tax returns and to divest from significant assets; bar them from appointing close relatives to White House positions; and constrain their abilities to award security clearances and to fire special prosecutors investigating their administration, among other potential reforms.
The survey is the first and most detailed collection of the candidates' views on a set of issues that they are rarely asked about, yet often prove crucial to the outcome of political fights: the scope and limits of a president's power to act unilaterally or even in defiance of statutes.
The survey -- which elicited answers from 15 Democrats, including all in the top polling tier and eight of the 10 in Thursday's debate -- also focused on recurring constitutional disputes that have arisen under recent presidents of both parties on matters including secrecy and war.
"The American people should fully know how candidates will use the power of the presidency," Senator Elizabeth Warren wrote, echoing other candidates who agreed that voters should know their views before deciding whom to entrust with the power of the White House.
Presidents have "a responsibility to make sure excess power is not used to start endless wars, attack the privacy of Americans, or undermine the democratic values of our country," she added.
But though the candidates "seem committed to reforming the presidency," they might have second thoughts from the vantage point of the Oval Office, said Jack Goldsmith, a Harvard law professor and former senior Justice Department official in the George W. Bush administration who reviewed their responses.
"The next Democratic president will happily accept new rules on tax releases, but will have a harder time accepting constraints on security clearances and emergency or war powers," he said. "Institutional prerogative often defeats prior reformist pledges."
Indeed, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. expressed a more expansive view of presidential war powers after eight years in the Obama White House than he did in 2007 during an earlier run for president.
______
______
The 2020 candidates agreed on some issues, including that Mr. Bush was wrong to claim after the Sept. 11 attacks that he could override surveillance and anti-torture laws because he was the commander in chief.
But they diverged about others, like whether President Barack Obama's invocation of the same power was legitimate. Mr. Obama used similar reasoning to disregard a requirement that he give Congress 30 days' notice before transferring Guantánamo Bay detainees as part of the 2014 Bowe Bergdahl prisoner swap.
Senator Kamala Harris, for example, wrote that while a president can lawfully override or bypass statutes that are clearly unconstitutional, she thought the detainee transfer law -- along with the surveillance and anti-torture laws -- was a constitutional limit that presidents must obey.
"The executive branch is not above the law," she wrote, adding, "As president, I would respect these laws."
By contrast, Mr. Biden defended the decision by Mr. Obama -- then his boss -- to immediately carry out the exchange after the deal was struck instead of waiting 30 days. Obama administration officials argued that a delay would have endangered the captive soldier's life.
"The transfer of detainees from Guantánamo was an exchange of prisoners in a conflict, and therefore a valid exercise of the commander-in-chief power," Mr. Biden wrote.
He participated in an earlier iteration of the survey as a senator seeking the 2008 presidential nomination, and his new answers reflected the understanding of executive authority that he gained from watching close up as Mr. Obama wielded it.
In late 2007, for example, Mr. Biden offered a restrictive view of when presidents may unilaterally direct the military to attack other countries, writing: "The Constitution is clear: Except in response to an attack or the imminent threat of attack, only Congress may authorize war and the use of force."
But in the new survey, Mr. Biden called it "well established" that presidents may launch limited strikes "without prior congressional approval when those operations serve important U.S. interests."
That legal rationale for ordering limited attacks without congressional approval echoed the Obama administration's stance during the NATO intervention in Libya in 2011. But the bombing campaign violated a limit on executive war-making powers that both Mr. Obama and Mr. Biden had said they would respect in the 2007 candidate survey.
Importantly, however, Mr. Biden said both then and now that any bombing of Iranian nuclear sites -- a prospect in which the scope of unilateral presidential war-making authority has repeatedly come up -- would require prior authorization from Congress because it would carry too much risk of escalation into a major war.
Still, several of Mr. Biden's rivals took a more constrained view, suggesting that a rationale of serving American "interests" is not enough to justify even limited strikes without Congress.
"In situations where the use of force is necessary, absent an imminent threat to our national security, I will take that case to Congress and the American people to seek authorization," former Representative Beto O'Rourke wrote.
Most candidates left the door open to using presidential signing statements, when approving bills, to claim a right to bypass provisions they see as unconstitutionally infringing on executive powers. But the answers submitted by the campaign of Senator Bernie Sanders -- which were written in third person -- pledged he would never use them.
"Signing statements circumvent the will of Congress and have no constitutional or legal legitimacy," the response said. "As president, Bernie would not issue signing statements."
The survey revealed broader disagreements about the wisdom of several other potential reforms raised by Mr. Trump's record. Significant numbers of candidates stood on both sides of ideas like curtailing future presidents' latitude to invoke emergency powers and to choose acting agency heads when temporarily filling vacancies.
But the candidates were largely united in rejecting the view of Mr. Trump's legal team, including Attorney General William P. Barr, that obstruction of justice laws do not apply to presidents who abuse their official powers to interfere with investigations for corrupt reasons.
Many also expressed skepticism of the Justice Department's view that sitting presidents are immune from indictment, which bound the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, as he weighed Mr. Trump's attempts to obstruct the Russia investigation. Most said they would sign a law pausing the statute of limitations for offenses by presidents, ensuring that they can still be prosecuted after leaving office.
But they split over what else to do about it. Several said they would direct the department's Office of Legal Counsel to rescind its opinion, while others sidestepped that question. Mayor Pete Buttigieg argued that it would interfere with Justice Department independence for a president to simply direct the office, commonly called O.L.C., to change its legal interpretation.
"Because the integrity of the Justice Department is critical to the rule of law, I do not think it would be appropriate for any president to dictate the legal conclusions that O.L.C. may issue or retract," Mr. Buttigieg wrote.
After The Times began the survey, Protect Democracy, a nonpartisan group of former officials seeking to prevent a decline "into a more authoritarian form of government," lobbied the candidates to participate. Justin Florence, a former Obama White House lawyer and the group's co-founder, praised those who answered the questions.
"With democracy in retreat and autocratic politics on the rise here and around the world, this survey provides critical insights into how each candidate understands the limits on the immense powers they're seeking," Mr. Florence said.
Several prominent Democratic candidates have not answered the questions. They include Mayor Bill de Blasio, who issued a general statement; Julian Castro, the former Housing and Urban Development secretary; former Representative John Delaney; and the businessmen Tom Steyer and Andrew Yang.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Texto completo: Every September, the glitterati descend upon New York, London, Milan and Paris for fashion month in a swarm of stilettos. Like death and taxes, the circus of Fashion Week is inevitable, and often inaccessible unless you're watching Instagram.
Luckily, so is the accompanying release of glossy new fashion titles and beautiful, weight-lifter-worthy coffee table accessories (sorry -- books). Here is a selection of what has just been published and what's to come, so you can enjoy the spirit of the runway shows from the comfort of your couch.
"Unexpected Pucci: Interiors: Furniture, Ceramics and Art Pieces"
By Angelo Flaccavento and Piero Lissoni
Rizzoli, $ 90
Come for the dizzying geometric prints, stay for the deep dive into Emilio Pucci's creative exploits beyond clothing (including deliriously patterned wool rugs and 1960s-era plates and vases). Of course, how much you enjoy this book will ultimately boil down to whether you find the designer's signature motifs dazzling or nausea inducing.
"John Galliano for Dior"
By Robert Fairer
Thames & Hudson, $ 150
Does the world need yet another book dedicated to the illustrious house of Dior? Possibly not (there have been more than a dozen already), but this one features enough backstage runway shots and detailed close-ups of the label's designs from the John Galliano era (the one that ended with the designer's anti-Semitic rant in 2011, which the book does not address) to justify its existence. Dramatic and colorful, Mr. Galliano's more-is-more aesthetic is captured by the photographer Robert Fairer, who documented the designer's collections for over a decade.
"Fabien Baron: Works 1983-2019"
By Fabien Baron; text by Adam Gopnik
Phaidon, $ 200
The art director Fabien Baron has helped transform the look of many major brands and fashion magazines, including Interview and French Vogue, over the course of his career. This retrospective of Mr. Baron's projects, while self-serious at times, is chock-full of design inspiration. Expect a lot of black and white, clean lines and swirling typography.
"Supreme Models: Iconic Black Women Who Revolutionized Fashion"
By Marcellas Reynolds
Abrams, $ 50
Considering that famous black models are still being misidentified in photos, this tribute to black models from the past 60 years couldn't come sooner. It features interviews, photos and essays devoted to industry heavyweights like Iman and Naomi Campbell, as well as next-gen faces like Adwoa Aboah and Joan Smalls.
"Paul's Book"
By Collier Schorr
Mack, $ 40
Youth may be fleeting, but this book is not. The American artist and fashion photographer Collier Schorr, best known for her black and white portraits of bored beautiful youths, presents a collection of photos taken over the course of two years of Paul Hameline, a young French artist and model.
"The International Best-Dressed List: The Official Story"
By Amy Fine Collins
Rizzoli, $ 75
How far would people go to snag a spot on the International Best-Dressed List? According to this history behind the storied list, founded by Eleanor Lambert in 1940 and passed on to Vanity Fair in 2002, pretty far! Enterprising social climbers offered bribes of up to $ 50,000 to try to secure their place among the powerful. Seems like a sound investment.
"Bill Cunningham: On the Street"
By The New York Times
Clarkson Potter, $ 65
Perhaps it's cheating to include this in the roundup, but a book featuring the beloved fashion and society photographer Bill Cunningham's snapshots, which largely shaped what street style photography is today, feels impossible to ignore. (Full disclosure: Mr. Cunningham worked for The New York Times for nearly 40 years.) This book traces his images across five decades, from the 1970s until his death in 2016.

Texto completo: An entertaining collection of Maine lore from Jim Harnedy, and the latest Jack McMorrow mystery from Gerry Boyle
“FORGOTTEN TALES OF DOWN EAST MAINE” by Jim Harnedy Good storytelling is considered a high art form in Maine, and Machiasport author and storyteller Jim Harnedy is in good company with this entertaining collection of 27 fascinating stories of Maine lore.
Several of these stories have been kicking around for a long time, and will be familiar to readers. Others are much less well-known, and will provide a bit of intrigue and curiosity. Harnedy includes stories of ghosts, oddball events, scoundrels, UFO aliens and peculiar history, along with some fun, charming Maine characters.
In “Who Really Discovered America?” he suggests that the Irish, Celts or Vikings were the first Europeans to land in America hundreds of years before Columbus. Of course, indigenous peoples were already here and didn’t need to be discovered — they knew where they were.
“The Serpent of Pocomoonshine Lake” is a tall tale about a lake monster spotted in 1882 as told by someone who “had seen a man who saw the man who said he saw a giant snake” in the water. And there really is such a lake near Baileyville.
Another legendary story is “The Missing White Bird,” a biplane flown by two World War I pilots in 1927, flying across the Atlantic from France to America (before Lindbergh). It is believed the plane made it to America, but then disappeared over Maine. No trace has ever been found.
Other stories include an 1850s political party called “The Know-Nothings” and the shameful trouble they caused in Ellsworth; the elaborate and successful gold swindle in Lubec in 1897; and the bloodless “Pork and Beans War” with Canada in 1838-1842 (not a shot was fired).
For more interesting reading, see “It Happened in Maine” by Gail Parker (2004) and “Strange Maine” by Michelle Souliere (2010).
“RANDOM ACT” By Gerry Boyle Newspaper reporters are normally armed with a cell- phone, a notebook and pen. Jack McMorrow, a stringer for the New York Times, also carries a Glock semi-automatic pistol and sometimes a lead pipe or lug wrench. Jack can be annoying and he likes to be prepared, either to take notes or bash somebody — sometimes both.
“Random Act” is the 12th volume in Maine mystery writer Gerry Boyle’s excellent series featuring the redoubtable Jack McMorrow (following “Straw Man”). The series began in 1993 and just keeps getting better.
Jack is a very good reporter — tenacious, thorough and devious. He won’t lie in his stories, but he will lie to get them. And he will need all his skills to catch a killer and help a friend. There are two parallel stories here, unconnected, but equally suspenseful and well-written.
While shopping for a toilet at Home Depot, Jack comes upon a brutal murder in the garden center. A nutcase has chopped a woman with a hatchet, and Jack suddenly finds himself part of the story. He feels obligated to understand such an apparent random act of violence. Meanwhile, his Iraq war veteran friend, Louis, is unexpectedly visited by his high-school sweetheart, a mysterious woman on the run from a murder in the Caribbean, with $2 million in cash in the trunk of her car. And Jack doesn’t believe a word of her fantastic story.
Jack’s investigation into the Home Depot murder leads him into the dark labyrinth of the local homeless shelter, where good intentions and good deeds may hide something else. And then the U.S. Marshals show up looking for Louis’s girlfriend. Jack and his pals must load up their weaponry because now things look very bad for everyone.
Bill Bushnell lives and writes in Harpswell.

Texto completo: A theater fan could get whiplash trying to decide what to see in Pittsburgh just this month.
September came in like a lion: That's "The Lion King," through Sept. 29 at the Benedum Center, Downtown, and kicking off a weekend that required a spreadsheet to figure out how to see barebones productions' "True West," Pittsburgh Shakespeare in the Park's all-female "Julius Caesar" and the Pittsburgh New Works Festival, all running through Sept. 29, plus Pittsburgh Musical Theater's Broadway at the Overlook that ran just the weekend and Arcade Comedy Theater's first full-length production, "Bubble Boy the Musical," through Sept. 21.
And to further keep our heads spinning, Pittsburgh Public Theater ("A Few Good Men," Sept. 12-Oct. 13) and City Theatre ("Cambodian Rock Band," Sept. 14-Oct. 6) have the official opening to their their 45th seasons on the same night - Sept. 20 - which also brings the introduction of Bricolage Productions next big immersive, "Project Amelia," (Sept. 20-Nov. 3).
With all of that going on now, it's hard to clear the decks and plan ahead, but we're going to try. Here are some coming attractions to look forward to through the fall of 2019:
Oct. 11-12: The buzzy off-Broadway hit "That Golden Girls Show! A Puppet Parody" comes to Pittsburgh for three shows, and it can't get here soon enough for some fans. Within days of the announcement, it was close to selling out. Really, people still can't get enough of the 1980s sitcom and Dorothy, Sophia, Blanche and Rose, who live out their golden years with "cheesecake, laughter, Jazzercise, shoulder pads, sex and the elegant art of the quick-witted put-down" (with strong adult language and themes). Byham Theater, Downtown. $25-$50 at trustarts.org or 412-456-6666.
Oct. 14: The Trust Cabaret Series for 2019-20, bringing Broadway and recording artists to the Cultural District for one-night-only concerts, starts with Grammy nominee Deborah Cox, who came through Pittsburgh as the star of the stage production of "The Bodyguard." Greer Cabaret Theater, Downtown. Two shows at 7 ($60-$70) and 9:30 p.m. ($45-$55), trust-arts.org or 412-456-6666.
Oct. 29-Nov. 3: The PNC Broadway in Pittsburgh subscription series begins with "Mean Girls," the Tony-nominated Tina Fey musical that has been on Broadway since opening in April 2018. The creative team includes Tony-winning director Casey Nicholaw ("The Book of Mormon": "Spamalot"), with a story taken from the 2004 teen comedy: Cady Heron has grown up on the African savanna, but nothing prepared her for the girls in her new school in suburban Illinois, in particular the "Apex Predator," Regina George. Cady devises a plan to end Regina's reign, but learns high school royalty is not so easily toppled. Benedum Center, Downtown. $40-$125 at trustarts.org or 412-456-6666.
Nov. 7-Dec. 8: Pittsburgh Public Theater shows its comedic mean streak with "School Girls, or, the African Mean Girls Play," which The New York Times called "a gleeful makeover of an American genre." Playwright Jocelyn Bioh, a first-generation American whose parents emigrated from Ghana, was inspired by her mother's experience in an elite boarding school, circa 1986, as students prepared to enter the Miss Ghana pageant and a chance to be Miss Universe. Paulina, queen bee of the in-crowd, assumes she'll win. But when Ericka enrolls, Paulina's popularity plummets. Sound familiar? This award-winning "mean girls" play had two sold-out runs off-Broadway last season. O'Reilly Theater, Downtown. $30-$80, ppt.org or 412-316-1600.
Nov. 7-23: PICT Classic Theatre presents the haunted-house tale and Pittsburgh premiere of "The Woman in Black," adapted by Stephen Mallatratt from the book by Susan Hill. The play that has run in London for three decades begins when a young lawyer is sent to settle the estate of a recently deceased widow, who appears to haunt the house she lived in. With light and sound, the play "conjures the most terrifying tale - a ghost story inside the mind of our audience's imagination." For ages 14 and older; "the intent of this show is to frighten," warns PICT. Fred Rogers Studio, WQED, 4802 Fifth Ave. $15-$48, www.picttheatre.org or 412-561-6000.
Nov. 9-Dec. 1: After a triumphant "King Lear" at the Carrie Furnace site, Quantum Theatre returns to Shakespeare, or rather, the Bard's wife. "Shakespeare's Will," starring Sheila McKenna and directed by Melanie Dreyer, zeroes in on the little-known Anne Hathaway "in intriguing complexity and expands its feminist exploration into our present." Featuring original music composed and performed by violinist Dawn Posey. West Homestead United Methodist Church, 515 W. 8th Ave., Homestead. Opening night $55, then $38-$53 (the latter with post-show wine tasting). quantumtheatre.com.
Nov. 9-Dec. 1: The play "Opening Night in Miami" by Kevin Powers and directed by Reginald L. Douglas swirls some big names with colossal cultural and social shifts: Cassius Clay. Malcolm X. Sam Cooke. Jim Brown. It's 1964, and "A Change Is Gonna Come." City Theatre, 1300 Bingham St., South Side. $29-$65 ($15 tickets for under age 30), citytheatrecompany.org or 412-431-2489.
Nov. 19-24: Didn't know "A Bronx Tale" was a musical? It is, and this New York Times' Critics Choice comes with impeccable roots, starting with the team from the 1993 movie of the same name. Chazz Palminteri wrote the original script and the book of the musical, based on his life, and teamed with Oscar-winner Robert De Niro, director Jerry Zaks, choreographer Sergio Trujillo and the great Disney composer Alan Menken to create a musical with elements of "Jersey Boys" and "West Side Story," according to one reviewer. It's also a father-son story that tugs at the heartstrings. Benedum Center, Downtown. Tickets TBA at trustarts.org or 412-456-6666.
Nov. 22-Dec. "Dance Nation" is coming to Patrick Jordan's barebones productions, which has a new philosophy of feel-good - or at least, feel-empowered - fare at holiday time. The play with music, about teen competitors preparing for a dance contest, debuted to rave reviews last year at Playwrights Horizons. Top critics Ben Brantley and Peter Marks could barely contain themselves, inspiring Marks to write in The Washington Post, "I have seen the future, and it is 'Dance Nation.' " Barebones Black Box, 1211 Braddock Avenue, Braddock. Tickets TBA, barebonesproductions.com or 1-888-71TICKET.
COLLEGES
Oct. 3-12: The Carnegie Mellon School of Drama subscription series opens with "Tiger at the Gates," in which Trojan military commander Hector struggles to avoid battle with the Greeks over the abducted Helen, in Christopher Fry's adaptation of Jean Giraudoux's anti-war play "The Trojan War Will Not Take Place." Purnell Center for the Arts, CMU campus, 5000 Forbes Ave., Shadyside. https://drama.cmu.edu/box-office/tiger-at-the-gates/.
Oct. 18-27: Point Park's Conservatory Theatre Company presents the Pittsburgh debut of "Good Grief" by the actor, playwright and Point Park grad Ngozi Anyanwu and directed by City Theatre's Reginald L. Douglas. The play explores what it means to be African in America by mining Anyanwu's own experience growing up Nigerian in the middle-class suburbs of eastern Pennsylvania. Rauh Theatre, Pittsburgh Playhouse, 350 Forbes Ave., Downtown. $25 ($17 seniors; $13 students). www.pittsburghplayhouse.com/tickets.

Texto completo: President Trump told his staff that the nation's leading weather forecasting agency needed to correct a statement that contradicted a tweet the president had sent wrongly claiming that Hurricane Dorian threatened Alabama, senior administration officials said.
That led White House acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney to call Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross to tell him to fix the issue, according to the officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk publicly about it. Trump had complained for several days that forecasters from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration contradicted his Sept. 1 Alabama tweet, the officials said.
Mulvaney then called Ross, who was traveling in Greece, and told him that the agency needed to fix things immediately, the officials said. Mulvaney did not instruct Ross to threaten any firings or offer punitive actions. But Ross then called NOAA acting administrator Neil Jacobs, the officials said. That led to an unusual, unsigned statement from NOAA released on Sept. 6 that backed Trump's false claim about Alabama and admonished the National Weather Service's Birmingham, Ala., division for speaking "in absolute terms" that there would not be "any" impacts from Dorian in the state. The Weather Service is an arm of NOAA, which is an agency within the Commerce Department. The New York Times first reported some elements of the White House involvement.
Trump told reporters Wednesday afternoon that he did not direct NOAA to issue such a statement. "No, I never did that," he said. "I never did that. It's a hoax by the media. That's just fake news."
But the apparent political pressure on a group of scientists who are supposed to be independent led House Democrats on Tuesday to launch an investigation into the Commerce Department's involvement in NOAA's unusual decision to side with Trump over its scientists.
Rep. Eddie Bernice Johnson (D-Tex.), chairwoman of the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology, and Rep. Mikie Sherrill (D-N.J.), chairwoman of the oversight and investigations subcommittee, sent a letter to Ross requesting information related to the department's dealings with NOAA and Dorian.
The Science Committee, which has jurisdiction over NOAA, is requesting a briefing with Commerce Department staff who may have been involved in issuing instructions to NOAA that led to several directives being sent to Weather Service staff and culminated in the Sept. 6 unsigned statement.
The imbroglio began Sept. 1, when Trump tweeted that a number of states, including Alabama, were at risk from Dorian. Trump falsely asserted that the state would "most likely be hit (much) harder than anticipated" by the powerful hurricane. A short time later, the Weather Service's Birmingham office tweeted: "Alabama will NOT see any impacts from #Dorian. We repeat, no impacts from Hurricane #Dorian will be felt across Alabama. The system will remain too far east."
Jacobs has since said that the forecasters were not aware of the Trump tweet and were responding to a flood of calls from concerned residents.
"We are deeply disturbed by the politicization of NOAA's weather forecast activities for the purpose of supporting incorrect statements by the president," Johnson and Sherrill wrote to Ross. The House members want to know who ordered and helped draft the Sept. 6 statement and whether Commerce Department or White House staff members were involved in threatening NOAA leadership.
"We are committed to supporting the activities of the NWS and its dedicated staff. During your Senate confirmation hearing, you committed to allowing federal scientists to 'be free to communicate data clearly and concisely' and that you would 'not interfere with the release of factual scientific data,' " Johnson and Sherrill wrote.
They noted that based on news reports, it appears that Ross violated the "values of scientific integrity."
The Science Committee is requesting all records of communication among Commerce Department officials, NOAA and the White House between Sept. 1 and Sept. 9 pertaining to the president's tweet and NOAA's Sept. 6 statement.
The committee also wants to hear from three Commerce officials in particular by Sept. 30: NOAA deputy chief of staff Julie Kay Roberts, Commerce chief of staff Michael Walsh Jr. and Commerce policy director Earl Comstock.
At the time Trump sent the Sept. 1 tweet, the only hurricane forecast product that was showing potential impact in Alabama noted the probability of seeing tropical-storm-force winds, and even that showed about a 5 percent chance of such conditions in a small portion of the state. The official track forecast at the time of his tweet showed the storm moving up the southeastern coast, away from Alabama.
But between Sept. 1 and the statement of Sept. 6, Trump issued several more tweets trying to justify his original statement.
Rep. Paul Tonko (D-N.Y.), who serves on the Science Committee and chairs a subcommittee on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, called for Ross to resign and for an investigation into whether Ross and other political appointees violated NOAA's scientific integrity policy.
In addition to the Science Committee's investigation, others are initiating probes into NOAA's decision to back Trump's claim.
These include the Commerce Department's inspector general and NOAA's acting chief scientist.
A spokesman for the Weather Service confirmed Tuesday that the Commerce Department inspector general had launched a probe. The spokesman said two senior leaders had received notice of the investigation.
In addition, NOAA acting chief scientist Craig McLean wrote an email Sunday, saying he would open an investigation into whether the agency's Sept. 6 statement, as well as previous emails to Weather Service staff, violated the agency's scientific integrity policy.
"The content of this news release is very concerning as it compromises the ability of NOAA to convey lifesaving information necessary to avoid substantial and specific danger to public health and safety," he wrote. "If the public cannot trust our information, or we debase our forecaster's warnings and products, that specific danger arises."
As a result, McLean told his staff that "I am pursuing the potential violations of our NOAA Administrative Order on Scientific Integrity."
"I have a responsibility to pursue these truths," he added. "I will."
The scientific integrity policy includes a provision that states, "In no circumstance may any NOAA official ask or direct Federal scientists or other NOAA employees to suppress or alter scientific findings."
These investigations are taking shape as outside groups call for inquiries and circulate letters of support for Weather Service scientists.
Jane Lubchenco, head of NOAA under President Barack Obama; Richard W. Spinrad, NOAA's chief scientist under Obama; and Andrew Rosenberg, director of the Center for Science and Democracy at the Union of Concerned Scientists, filed a joint request for NOAA to initiate an investigation into possible violations of its scientific integrity policy, Lubchenco wrote in an email.

Texto completo: Weather forecasting should never be political. The National Weather Service, an agency within NOAA, issues forecasts and warnings that are based on science and focused squarely on public safety. For more than a century, the agency has played a vital role in protecting the lives and property of Americans across the country.
To be effective, NWS forecasts and warnings need to be accurate, timely and clear. Everyone - citizens, airline officials, farmers, fishermen, city officials and emergency managers - relies on the NWS to provide trustworthy information. Even a hint that a forecast or warning was influenced by politics would undermine the public's trust and the ability to respond quickly and effectively under potentially life-threatening conditions.
If political appointees overrule trained scientists, imposing political concerns on scientific matters, they endanger public safety as well as the credibility and morale of the agency charged with protecting that safety.
That is apparently what happened last week. As the potentially dangerous weather conditions caused by Hurricane Dorian rapidly evolved, NOAA officials in Washington overrode sound science and undercut NWS professionals, apparently to provide cover for the president, who on Sept. 1 had posted inaccurate information on Twitter. Worse, NOAA officials, in an unsigned statement, had the gall on Friday to chastise NWS forecasters in Birmingham, Alabama, for telling the public - correctly - that Alabama was not actually in danger.
The impetus for the reprimand might have come from high in the Trump administration: The New York Times on Monday reported that Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, who heads the department responsible for NOAA, threatened to fire agency officials after the Birmingham office contradicted the president.
It was bad enough that Trump's warning to Alabamians of a serious risk from Hurricane Dorian was woefully outdated. But it would be appalling if NOAA political appointees sought to defend his mistake, while castigating the NWS office for accurately reassuring Alabamians that they were not in danger.
NOAA has a scientific integrity policy for a reason - to prevent politics from interfering with the discovery, use and communication of scientific information, and to deal with violations of its standards. Moreover, manipulating weather information can be a federal offense. To restore public trust in weather forecasts and warnings, every step should be taken to learn from this distortion of truth and breach of trust.
NOAA has been without a permanent leader since the beginning of the Trump administration, instead relying on acting heads to run the agency. The lack of genuine political leadership is all too apparent. The Senate should press the White House to nominate a qualified candidate who can restore public confidence in the non-political nature of this vital agency. McLean's investigation is a good first step in finding out more about the breach of public trust, but scrutiny by Congress and the inspector general may also be merited. It is essential that the federal government does all in its power to reaffirm, and to safeguard, NOAA's scientific integrity policy.
James Baker, Jane Lubchenco and Kathryn Sullivan (2013-2017) are former administrators of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

Texto completo: Today, I decided to try a recipe for "really the best gazpacho ever" shared a while ago by a reader.
My reason for trying it today was that I harvested a basket of ripe tomatoes with spots or cracks and had to do something with them, and quick.
So I cut bad parts off and plugged in my blender. I blended the tomatoes with red onion, cucumber, a Hungarian pepper from my garden, a bit of sherry vinegar, garlic, salt and a decent amount of olive oil. The recipe called for straining afterwards, but you know what? I had a big bowl of it straight from the blender, sans straining. Addictively good.
You could do either, leave as is or strain for an elegant presentation.
Now truth be told, I have a packed file of gazpacho recipes. This one, though, is my newest fave. A smooth Spanish style gazpacho, easy and so fast.
The bonus? It uses those late summer, less than perfect, dead ripe veggies.
Make this gazpacho! Let me know how you like it, OK?
Originally from Julia Moskin, New York Times. Here's my adaptation. As always, go to taste.
Ingredients
A good 2 pounds red or combo of ripe tomatoes, cored and chunked up — I used red, yellow, and grape
1 Cubanelle or sweet banana pepper or about half of a sweet bell, seeded and chunked. I used a sweet Hungarian banana pepper
1 cucumber, about 8" long, peeled and chunked
1/3 to 1/2 cup red or mild onion, chunked (careful, here, you can always add more but you can't take away...).
1 nice teaspoon garlic/1 large clove
1 tablespoon sherry vinegar
Salt — I used 11/2 teaspoons
1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil or to taste, plus extra to drizzle
Instructions
Put everything but vinegar, salt and oil in blender and blend on high until very smooth. With motor running, add vinegar and salt.
Slowly pour in oil and blend until everything is emulsified and again, smooth. It will be the thickness of salad dressing. If a bit watery, add a little more oil until it's creamy the way you like it.
Now you can either strain it all through strainer or food mill, making sure you press hard on solids, or leave as is, or just strain some of it.
For a silky smooth soup, you should strain it all.
Chill about 6 hours or overnight.
To serve:
Adjust seasonings. If too thick, add a bit of ice water.
Serve with drizzle of oil.
Serve as appetizer or first course in shot or small glasses or as an entre in a bowl.
Try my garlic crostini alongside.
Substitute for sherry vinegar
Try red wine vinegar with maybe a tad of sugar, since sherry vinegar has a sweeter flavor profile.
Serve alongside the gazpacho.
Rub a clove of garlic on thick baguette slices. Drizzle with olive oil.
Sprinkle with shredded Manchego, Parmesan, or leave plain.
Run under broiler.

Texto completo: Restaurants come and go. But lately primarily fine-dine restaurants seem to be going more than coming. Here are the restaurants that have recently shuttered in North Jersey.
Chakra, Paramus After 15 years, Chef Thomas Ciszak closed his 7,000-square-foot restaurant housed in a sprawling Paramus landmark on the last day of August. Ciszak said it was because the real estate and liquor license were worth more than what the restaurant could earn serving food and alcohol. He and his wife, Evelyn, are set to open Brasserie Memere, a classic French spot in Closter, sometime next month.
17 Summer, Lodi After serving delicious seasonal food at one of the oldest buildings in Lodi, sister and brother Jenna and Joseph Cuccia decided to close their BYOB restaurant. They made the announcement on social media on Sept. 3. Joseph was a semifinalist for a James Beard Foundation Rising Star Chef of the Year award in 2016. He trained his sister to cook and for the past year or so she joined him in the kitchen. When the restaurant was reviewed for The Record in 2015, it received 31/2 out of 4 stars. It is not clear what the siblings may do next. Neither could be reached for comment.
Pig & Prince, Montclair Pig & Prince, a stunning New American restaurant that was housed in an old station house of Montclair's Lackawana Station, closed its doors in the beginning of June. The restaurant opened seven years ago and had been a critical success. The New York Times, in a 2012 review, deemed the restaurant "Worth It" and noted that extra care that its chef Michael Carrino, a Food Network "Chopped" champion, took with his "intriguing French-accented menu." Carrino is set to open a fresh pasta shop in Nutley, Mike's Pasta and Sandwich Shoppe, with his business partner, Mike Cosenza, who was his sous chef at Pig & Prince.
Talde, Jersey City Celebrity chef Dale Talde, a Fort Lee resident, cookbook author and former "Top Chef" contestant, closed his eponymous Asian-fusion restaurant in Jersey City last month. His first Talde, located in Park Slope, Brooklyn, had closed a while ago. Talde and his business partners recently dissolved their seven-year-old restaurant group Three Kings. Talde and his wife, Agnes, (the two have a little boy) have started their own company, Food Crush Hospitality, in hopes of opening restaurants and look into other opportunities, perhaps a TV show. Currently, they are set to open a modern Cantonese restaurant in Westchester County: Gooseberry in Tarrytown.
Twisted Elm, Elmwood Park In late July, The Twisted Elm in Elmwood Park, which opened in 2011, one of the first gastropubs in North Jersey, shuttered. Last year, its burger was named one of Bergen's best by NorthJersey.com and The Record. Executive Chef David "Davey" Morales said that he believed it was because of problems with the building's landlord. On his Instagram account, Morales thanked his many diners and hinted as to what he would do next: "I will keep cooking and keep creating dishes!," he wrote, "and for my vegan friends stay on the look out for my next journey."

Poll shows strong backing for background checks of gun buyers

Texto completo: Americans across party and demographic lines overwhelmingly support expanded background checks for gun buyers and allowing law enforcement to temporarily seize weapons from troubled individuals, a Washington Post-ABC News poll shows.
Though the poll finds a continued partisan divide on more far-reaching gun control, public opinion is firmly behind the Democrats' push for action. More Americans say they trust congressional Democrats over President Trump to handle gun laws, 51 percent to 36 percent, with independents siding with Democrats by a 17-point margin — a divide that could have political ramifications in the 2020 elections.
Democrats and allied activists had been trying to kick-start a push for new federal gun restrictions since the mass shootings last month in El Paso and Dayton, Ohio; the deadly rampage in West Texas Aug. 31 reignited the issue.
The poll finds 86 percent of Americans support "red-flag" provisions allowing guns to be taken from people judged to be a danger to themselves or others; 89 percent support expanding federal background checks to cover private sales and gun-show transactions.
Both ideas are supported by at least 8 in 10 Republicans, white evangelical Christians, members of gun-owning households, and other traditionally conservative groups.
More far-reaching restrictions also have majority support, by more modest margins. Six in 10 back a federal ban on gun magazines that hold more than 10 rounds of ammunition.
A 56 percent majority supports a new federal ban on sales of military-style assault weapons, and nearly all who support such a ban also back a mandatory federal buyback program for those weapons — a notion decried as "confiscation" by gun-rights supporters.
Trump has wavered on the issues, endorsing tough measures after a mass shooting at a Florida high school in 2018 and then abandoning expanded background checks and other proposals as the National Rifle Association expressed opposition. Late last month, Trump told NRA chief Wayne LaPierre that universal background checks were off the table.
Trump said last week that he expected to present a "package" of proposals, but suggested they'd target the mentally ill.
Washington Post
At rally, bleak picture painted of Democratic control
HAVELOCK, N.C. — Trying to prove his political clout by pushing a Republican to victory in a special election, President Trump used a North Carolina rally on Monday to paint a bleak picture of a nation that he claimed would be overrun with crime, poverty, and immigrants if Democrats seize power in Washington.
Trump, appearing at his first campaign rally in nearly a month, went on the offensive in an effort to change a series of late-summer negative headlines over his slipping poll numbers, warning signs of an economic slowdown, and a running battle over hurricane forecasts. He urged the Fayetteville crowd to vote Tuesday for Republican Dan Bishop, brandishing his usual incendiary rhetoric to declare from the stage that "tomorrow is a chance to send a clear message to the America-hating left."
With an eye to his own reelection next fall, he touted his administration's accomplishments but also urged voters to give him more time.
"That's why we need four more years," Trump said at the nearly 90-minute rally. "It's got to seed — it's a plant. It has to grow. It has to grow those roots. That's why 2020 is just as important. Because they will try to take it away."

Trump insults Teigen and Legend, and they fire back
President Trump called model Chrissy Teigen “filthy mouthed" and musician John Legend “boring" in tweets Sunday that trumpeted his criminal justice reform efforts.
Legend called on the first lady­ to intervene, and Teigen used vulgarities. The couple, who are married, are both frequent critics of the president.
The expletives Teigen used, including one Trump famously used in a recording that surfaced before his 2016 election, were part of a trending hashtag; #filthymouthedwife was also trending.
Trump appeared to be responding to Legend's appearance at a criminal justice forum hosted by “NBC Nightly News" at the Sing Sing prison in Ossining, N.Y. He began by pointing to criminal justice legislation he signed last year.
“Now that it is passed, people that had virtually nothing to do with it are taking the praise," Trump wrote. “Guys like boring musician @johnlegend, and his filthy mouthed wife, are talking now about how great it is — but I didn't see them around when we needed help getting it passed."
He did not name Teigen, which she noted: “Tagged everyone but me. An honor, mister president." She added that she had not been mentioned in the MSNBC special that Trump appeared to have watched.
Legend called on the first ­lady: “Imagine being president of a whole country and spending your Sunday night hate-watching MSNBC hoping somebody — ANYBODY — will praise you. Melania, please praise this man. He needs you."

Democrats probe Trump ties to Ukraine to aid reelection
House Democrats launched an investigation into whether President Trump and his attorney Rudolph Giuliani sought to manipulate the Ukrainian government into helping Trump's reelection campaign.
Top Democrats demanded records related to what they say are Trump and Giuliani's efforts "to coerce the Ukrainian government into pursuing two politically-motivated investigations under the guise of anti-corruption activity" — one to help Trump's former campaign manager Paul Manafort, who is in prison for illegal lobbying and financial fraud, and a second to target former vice president Joe Biden, who is seeking to unseat Trump.
Neither the White House, State Department, nor Giuliani immediately commented.

NOAA chief: No one getting fired over Dorian forecast controversy

Texto completo: No one at the National Weather Service is at risk of losing their jobs in connection to last week's controversy over Hurricane Dorian's chances of hitting Alabama, according to the top official at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
During a speech Tuesday, NOAA acting Director Neil Jacobs disputed a report by the New York Times that said Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross threatened to fire top officials at the NOAA if they did not crack down on forecasters who contradicted President Trump's warning over Labor Day weekend that Dorian could slam Alabama.
“There is no pressure to change the way you communicate forecast risk into the future. No one’s job is under threat: not mine, not yours. The Weather Service team has my full support and the support of the department," Jacobs told a crowd of forecasters at a conference in Huntsville, Alabama.
This followed a spokesperson for Commerce Department, which oversees NOAA, telling the Washington Examiner the Times report was "false."
With Dorian churning toward the Bahamas on Sept. 1, Trump tweeted that Alabama and other southeastern states "will most likely be hit (much) harder than anticipated." Twenty minutes later, the National Weather Service station in Birmingham appeared to issue a corrective tweet that said "Alabama will NOT see any impacts" from Dorian because it was projected by that time to remain too far east. In fact Dorian swung up the East Coast, making landfall over North Carolina, before speeding off to eastern Canada as a hurricane-force post-tropical cyclone.
A week-long controversy ensued, amplified by Trump lashing out at the media for negative coverage and his presentation in the Oval Office of a National Hurricane Center map of Dorian's projected path doctored with a sharpie to show an extension of the forecast cone reaching over the Florida panhandle and over a part of Alabama.
The Times report said Ross phoned Jacobs from Greece on Friday, instructing him to quash the appearance of conflict between NWS and Trump. After Jacobs rejected the demand, Ross warned political staff would be fired if they did not negate the contradiction. NOAA, which is the parent agency of NWS, released an unsigned statement later that day that condemned the Birmingham office for speaking in "absolute terms that were inconsistent with probabilities from the best forecast products available at the time."
The NOAA leader spoke at the National Weather Association conference one day after NWS Director Louis Uccellini praised the station in Birmingham at the same event. "They were correct in clarifying that the threat was very low," he said. Birmingham office staffers were asked to stand up, and they received a standing ovation from hundreds of their forecasting colleagues.
Jacobs also voiced support for the staff at the Birmingham office while explaining the intent of the NOAA statement.
“I have the utmost respect for what you do because I understand how difficult numerical weather prediction is, and how even more complicated conveying risk to the public is. The purpose of the NOAA statement was to clarify the technical aspects of the potential impacts of Dorian," Jacobs said. "What it did not say, however, is that we understand and fully support the good intent of the Birmingham weather office, which was to calm fears and support public safety.”

Earlier forecasts considered Alabama to be in its projected path, but a National Hurricane Center graphic shows the odds of low-end tropical storm-force winds associated with Dorian striking Alabama dropping significantly by Sunday to roughly 5%.
Jacobs stressed that the forecast changed drastically over the span of a couple days.
“At one point Alabama was in the mix, as was the rest of the Southeast," Jacobs said during his speech. “At one point the Gulf states were at greater risk than the Atlantic coast."
The inspector general of the Commerce Department is reportedly investigating NOAA's statement and is asking agency officials to preserve files. With concerns rising about the president's influence over NOAA, an email to staff on Sunday announced the agency's chief scientist is investigating possible policy and ethics violations. In his message, Craig McLean said NOAA's news release was "political" and a “danger to public health and safety."
Jacobs said the controversy has been "hard" for him and the people close to him. "I want to thank everyone who has known me and supported me. I’m the same Neil I was last Thursday,” he said.

'Not going quietly': Internet howls over Trump firing of John Bolton

Texto completo: Voices across social media erupted in a chorus of criticism and praise for President Trump after he announced that national security adviser John Bolton had been terminated from his post at the White House.
Bolton, the fourth individual to hold and be subsequently terminated from that position, was also on the receiving end of encouragement and sharp criticism after news of his departure went public.
"I’m very, very unhappy to hear that he is leaving," said GOP Utah Sen. Mitt Romney. "It’s a huge loss for the andministration [sic] and for the nation."
A tweet from Nicholas Fandos from the New York Times reported that when asked about who could be a good replacement for Bolton, Romney responded, "John Bolton."
"John Bolton is a brilliant man with decades of experience in foreign policy," Romney continued. "His point of view was not always the same everybody else in the room. That’s why you wanted him there. The fact that he was a contrarian from time to time was an asset, not a liability."

Tweet Other Republican members of Congress saw things differently and praised Trump for his choice to remove Bolton. "I commend @realDonaldTrump for this necessary action," said Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul. "The President has great instincts on foreign policy and ending our endless wars. He should be served by those who share those views."
Paul had previously been critical of Bolton, saying in 2016, "I am a no on John Bolton for ANY position in the State Departement [sic] and will work to defeat his nomination to any post."Tweet Others on Twitter had a lighter reaction after hearing Tuesday's news. Many compared Bolton to mustachioed Simpsons character Ned Flanders. "Unreal he fired Bolton just before Movemeber," one user said of Bolton's trademark facial hair. TweetOther media heavyweights lamented the departure of Bolton as a weakening on foreign policy by the Trump administration. "This is terrible for the White House," Ben Shapiro said. "Bolton was correct about the Taliban; State wasn’t. Bolton has been a hawkish voice for a tough national security policy, and his ouster likely signals that Trump’s approach will be significantly softer from this point forward."TweetSome considered the larger overall media reaction to the disagreements between Trump and Bolton that led to his termination. "Press is about to go from 'John Bolton is a radical warmonger who never should be permitted near the Oval Office' to 'This is a story of how a reasonable, respected expert was dismissed by a chaotic, megalomaniacal Administration, and whatever his critique is, we agree!'" one user suggested of a possible change in tone of a media often critical of Trump's inner circle.Tweet
Others noted Bolton's own contradicting account of his termination as an unwillingness to quietly leave Trump's Cabinet without defending his own actions. "Not going quietly," Maggie Haberman of the New York Times said. Tweet

Texto completo: A Times editorial

By now everyone should be sick of hearing about President Donald Trumps false claim that Alabama could be hit hard by Hurricane Dorian and about his doctored weather map. Enough with the one-liners and the Sharpie memes, and lets move on. But there is nothing funny about hurricane forecasting being politicized and government agencies responsible for weather forecasts sniping at each other. Floridians have to trust hurricane forecasts are accurate and nonpolitical  because our lives depend on it.

The situation escalated Monday as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the National Weather Service became further tangled in the political storm over Trumps false claim and sophomoric attempt to defend it. The Washington Post reported NOAAs acting chief scientist told colleagues in an email Sunday that he is investigating the agencys odd defense Friday of Trumps misstatement. Meanwhile, the director of the National Weather Service broke with NOAA by backing the weather services forecasters and their performance. None of this is good for public confidence in hurricane forecasting, or for state and local emergency officials who depend on the forecasts to make critical preparations and issue evacuation orders.

Trump sparked the latest fury as he often does, by casually throwing out a falsehood and then doubling down when confronted with the facts. On Sept. 1, as Hurricane Dorian approached Floridas east coast, Trump tweeted: In addition to Florida  South Carolina, North Carolina, Georgia, and Alabama, will most likely be hit (much) harder than anticipated. Yet forecasts at the time showed Alabama in no danger at all, with the official forecast track headed north, not west. Within minutes of Trumps tweet, the National Weather Service in Birmingham, Ala., sought to correct the record: Alabama will NOT see any impacts from #Dorian. We repeat, no impacts from Hurricane #Dorian will be felt across Alabama. The system will remain too far east.

Of course, that was the only responsible reaction from the weather service. But as usual Trump would not let it go, and on Wednesday he displayed an outdated NOAA forecast in the Oval Office that had been doctored with a black semicircle that extended the path of the hurricane cone into Alabama. The Washington Post reported that Trump used a black Sharpie marker to alter the map. As the political winds continued to blow on Friday, NOAA released a stunning rebuke of the Birmingham weather office, saying that information demonstrated that tropical-storm-force winds from Hurricane Dorian could impact Alabama. The New York Times reported Monday that statement came hours after Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross threatened to fire top NOAA employees because the Birmingham weather office had contradicted the president.

Professional weather forecasters should not be transformed into political pawns. You have science organizations putting out statements against their own offices, Craig Fugate, Floridas emergency management chief under Republican Gov. Jeb Bush and director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency under Democratic President Barack Obama, told the Associated Press. For the life of me, I dont think I would have ever faced this under President Obama or Gov. Bush.

The integrity and objectivity of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the National Weather Service cannot be compromised, regardless of who is president. Hurricane warnings and weather forecasts are not political statements, and public trust in them is essential. Floridians making decisions about buying supplies, closing businesses and evacuating cannot be wondering whether the projected path of the next major hurricane is tainted by politics or a false statement by the president, regardless of political party.

Texto completo: Look the part, be disruptive and keep things simple, say Barbara Corcoran, Bethenny Frankel, Grant Cardone and others.
You have a great idea. Now you need the money to make it happen. In this day and age when it seems like everybody is an entrepreneur, how do you convince investors your idea is worth their financial backing?
We asked “Shark Tank” judges Corcoran and Frankel and other decision-makers what it takes to woo them as investors. Here are their top tips, straight from the Sharks’ mouths.
Prove you can bounce back from failure
After 11 seasons investing in small businesses on ABC’s “Shark Tank,” I have a list of traits that I search for in entrepreneurs.
First, you need to look like whoever you claim to be. When Kim Daisy said she made the best-tasting cakes in America, I instinctively believed her because she looked the part, dressed in a starched apron with a million-dollar smile. When I tasted her cake, I gave her my cash.
Every small business is a brand: Make yours stand out
Ocean pollution: Your small business can right the ship, one plastic bag at a time
I never invest in anyone who throws around fancy terms to describe a simple business. I particularly dislike the fashionable terms “burn rate” and “pivot,” both clever ways to sugarcoat that they’ve lost other investors’ money.
However, I do like to see someone clearly demonstrate their ability to bounce back after failure. Can you overcome obstacles? Are you street smart enough to find solutions? That’s the most important quality shared by every successful entrepreneur I’ve invested in.
When I can see it, I know I’ll make my money back and more.
– Barbara Corcoran, founder of The Corcoran Group, podcast host of “Business Unusual” and Shark on “Shark Tank. "
Show, don’t tell
Investors want to see something that is innovative and unique. You need to be a little bit disruptive and creative to get someone’s attention. At the same time, as an investor, I need to be able to comprehend the business instantly so I can see any flaws in your idea or plan.
Social networking is also big. But most importantly, I look for entrepreneurs who can execute, get things done and get to the finish line. Investors don’t like talk – we like action. So show me; don’t tell me.
– Bethenny Frankel, founder of Skinnygirl, cast member of “The Real Housewives of New York City,” New York Times bestselling author, and Shark on “Shark Tank”; follow Bethenny on Twitter and Instagram.
Keep things simple
I have raised almost $225 million in 18 months. The key to winning over investors is to keep your message concise and simple and include the upside and the downside of your offer. The moment the offer becomes the least bit complicated, you lose the investor. No matter how sophisticated they are, they need certainty as much as anyone.
Surviving a recession as a small business: It may be rocky but it's possible
Include the upside and downside of the investment by proactively addressing the best- and worst-case scenarios. This way, you appear transparent and control the narrative rather than letting the investor’s imagination take over. Finally, be overly fair. Don’t overreach with your expectations of them or start too high with your offer.
– Grant Cardone, sales expert, who has built a $750 million real estate empire, and New York Times bestselling author; follow Grant on Facebook, Instagram, or YouTube.
Mitigate your risks.
The most common mistake entrepreneurs make when pitching investors is thinking that the growth or income opportunity is most important. In fact, it’s the opposite. Investors are most concerned about preserving their capital and mitigating risks.
After all, what good is the promise of growth or high returns if you could lose your initial investment? Show them how you are de-risking the deal and that you have backup plans to mitigate losses if things don’t go as planned.
– Roland Frasier, principal of 30 businesses, including War Room Mastermind and Traffic & Conversion Summit; host of the “Business Lunch” podcast; connect with Roland on Facebook, LinkedIn, and Instagram.
Start with the right business opportunity
I help entrepreneurs buy successful businesses using capital from financial institutions or my investment firm instead of their own money.
This is a much safer investment than an unproven tech startup. When you have an established, profitable business model, it’s easier to win over investors. You can demonstrate market growth, positive cash flow, opportunities to increase profitability and a reasonable business valuation. You don’t even need expertise; just someone with experience who will run the business for you.
No matter what kind of investment you’re looking for, find an investor who specializes in that specific opportunity. Build rapport with a company they have already invested in by inviting the business owner to lunch, then ask for a warm introduction.
Show the investor that the opportunity meets their unique interests, you appreciate their expertise, and you’re committed to returning their investment.
– Moran Pober, founder and CEO of Acquisitions. com, which buys and sells seven-figure businesses and helps others do the same; former partner at Wekix. com and ABD Assets; connect with Moran on LinkedIn, Facebook and Instagram.
Be yourself
Aside from the validation of your idea, product-market fit and margins, your most valuable standout factor is you. Investors want to partner with someone they’ll flow with throughout the investment and mentoring journey.
They’re looking for founders who capitalize on their strengths and learn from their weaknesses. As with any relationship, mutual respect and admiration are also key.
Investors are impressed by founders who have clarity on their personal brand (or at least the potential to develop into a distinguishable one). Can you be a strong brand ambassador? Can you lead a movement? Your ability to tell a story and build a strong community online and offline is vital to gain influence, which you can further leverage for free publicity.
Keep your “why” prominent and avoid becoming someone you’re not, just to impress investors. It’s a lot like dating: your best bet is authenticity, sincerity and, yes, vulnerability. Go all in or go home!
– Marina Mara, international media, brand and reputation adviser; connect with Marina on LinkedIn and Instagram.
Put yourself in their shoes
At the Gerry Spence Trial Lawyers College, we learned about role reversal, a deeper way of putting yourself in someone else’s shoes. Most people focus on themselves and getting what they want from a judge or investor rather than considering how what they’re selling or proposing helps advance the other person’s interests.
Reversing roles is a way to gain a deeper understanding of that. If you’re trying to win over an investor or a judge, put yourself in their shoes and think about how your mutual interests can align. In court, I always consider that the judge and prosecutor need to feel like justice has been served and ensure it aligns with the best outcome for my client.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - The secretary of commerce threatened to fire top employees at the federal scientific agency responsible for weather forecasts last Friday after the agency's Birmingham office contradicted President Donald Trump's claim that Hurricane Dorian might hit Alabama, according to three people familiar with the discussion.
That threat led to an unusual, unsigned statement later that Friday by the agency, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, disavowing the National Weather Service's position that Alabama was not at risk. The reversal caused widespread anger within the agency and drew accusations from the scientific community that the National Weather Service, which is part of the NOAA, had been bent to political purposes.
The NOAA's statement on Friday is now being examined by the Commerce Department's Office of Inspector General, according to documents reviewed by The New York Times, and employees have been asked to preserve their files. The NOAA is a division of the Commerce Department.
The National Weather Service "must maintain standards of scientific integrity," the inspector general, Peggy Gustafson, wrote in a message to NOAA staff members in which she requested documents related to Friday's statement. The circumstances, she wrote, "call into question the NWS's processes, scientific independence, and ability to communicate accurate and timely weather warnings and data to the nation in times of national emergency."
The Commerce Department disputed the account on behalf of the secretary of commerce, Wilbur Ross. "Secretary Ross did not threaten to fire any NOAA staff over forecasting and public statements about Hurricane Dorian," the department said in a statement issued by a spokesman.
The spokesman declined to comment on whether Mr. Ross had spoken with the NOAA administrator or ordered the agency to rebut the statement contradicting the president's assertion about a threat to Alabama.
The Commerce Department's Office of the Inspector General did not respond to requests for comment late Monday.
The accusations against Mr. Ross are the latest developments in a political imbroglio that began more than a week ago, when Dorian was bearing down on the Bahamas and Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter that Alabama would be hit "harder than anticipated." A few minutes later, the National Weather Service in Birmingham, Ala., posted on Twitter that "Alabama will NOT see any impacts from Dorian. We repeat, no impacts from Hurricane Dorian will be felt across Alabama."'
Mr. Trump persisted in saying that Alabama was at risk and a few days later, on Sept. 4, he displayed an NOAA map that appeared to have been altered with a black Sharpie to include Alabama in the area potentially affected by Dorian. (Alabama was not struck by the hurricane.)
Mr. Ross, the commerce secretary, intervened two days later, early last Friday, according to the three people familiar with his actions. Mr. Ross phoned Neil Jacobs, the acting administrator of the NOAA, from Greece where the secretary was traveling for meetings and instructed Mr. Jacobs to fix the agency's perceived contradiction of the president.
Mr. Jacobs objected to the demand and was told that the political staff at the NOAA would be fired if the situation was not fixed, according to the three individuals, who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the episode.

No excuse for the Founders' failure on slavery

Texto completo: Conservative reaction to the New York Times' "1619 Project" - an attempt to tell the story of slavery and its lasting effect on American political, economic and social structures - has been both disappointing and instructive.
I am not referring here to thinkers (the term is employed loosely) who consciously embrace a philosophy of white supremacy. Though resurgent and repellent, they do not constitute the mainstream of conservative thinking on race.
I am thinking instead of conservative writers who argue that the 1619 Project is a prime example of leftist ideological overreach - that its (mainly African American) authors see the country entirely through the prism of its sins and intend to "delegitimize" the American experiment. In making this case, some conservatives have offered excuses - or at least mitigations - for the moral failures of the Founders on matters of race. The institution of slavery, we are assured, was historically ubiquitous. The global slave trade, we are reminded, involved not just Americans but Arabs and black Africans. Other countries, we are told, took more slaves than America, treated them worse and liberated them later.
The attempt here is to defend the honor of the American experiment by denying the uniqueness of its hypocrisy on slavery. In one way or another, all these arguments ask us to consider the inadequacies of the Founders within the context of their times.
But to deny the uniqueness of American guilt on slavery is also to deny the uniqueness of its aspirations. Americans are required to have ambiguous feelings about many of the country's Founders precisely because of the moral ideals the Founders engraved in American life. The height of their ambitions is also the measure of their hypocrisy. It should unsettle us that the author of the Declaration of Independence built a way of life entirely dependent on human bondage.
This leads to an unavoidably complex form of patriotism. We properly venerate not the Founders, but the standards they raised and often failed to meet. This is their primary achievement: They put into place an ideological structure that harshly judged their own practice and drove American democracy to achievements beyond the limits of their vision.
One thing we cannot do is excuse the Founders according to the standards of their time. In the mid to late 18th century, there was plenty of compelling moral thinking on the issue of slavery.
In 1759, Quaker Anthony Benezet wrote "Observations on the Enslaving, Importing and Purchasing of Negroes," which presented eyewitness accounts of the cruelties of the slave trade. Benezet called slavery "inconsistent with the gospel of Christ, contrary to natural justice and the common feelings of humanity, and productive of infinite calamities to many thousand families, nay to many nations, and consequently offensive to God the father of all mankind."
In 1776, the year independence was declared, Presbyterian pastor Samuel Hopkins wrote "A Dialogue Concerning the Slavery of the Africans," which he dedicated to the Continental Congress. Hopkins was alert to the incongruity of the American cause, urging his readers to "behold the sons of liberty oppressing and tyrannizing over many thousands of poor blacks who have as good a claim to liberty as themselves."
In 1778, another minister, Jacob Green, preached a fast-day sermon referring to slavery as a "most cruel, inhuman, unnatural sin." He also pointed out the discrediting inconsistency of a country that was dedicated to liberty and yet tolerant of slavery: "What foreign nation can believe that we who so loudly complain of Britain's attempts to oppress and enslave us, are, at the same time, voluntarily holding multitudes of fellow creatures in abject slavery . . . ?"
America's Founders stand accused by the best, most humane standards of their own time. When Jefferson wrote about natural rights on his mountaintop prison for black people, many of his contemporaries knew he was, on this issue, a total hypocrite.
America's story is not one of initial purity and eventual decay. It is the story of a radical principle - the principle of human equality - introduced into a deeply unjust society. That principle was carried forward by oppressed people who understood it better than many of the nation's Founders. Denied the blessings of liberty, African Americans became the instruments by which the promise of liberty was broadly achieved. The victims of America's moral blindness became carriers of the American ideal.
This story is not simple to tell. But it is miraculous in its own way. And it is good reason to be proud of America.

Texto completo: If you think our president is a "fool" who has "lost his mind" and is in the midst of "one the greatest political meltdowns of all time," I have some terrible news.
You're more confused than Donald Trump has ever been. And if you actually believe that Vice President Mike Pence has any interest in saving anything except his place on the ticket, stop trusting yourself with anything sharper than a giant foam finger.
The bankruptcy-prone birther is not deteriorating or crumbling. Nope. Sorry. He's still the same sad, sadistic con man he has always been. And he's on the verge of luring his opponents into making the mistakes that elected him, all over again.
The WWE's tangerine terror only "won" the presidency because we underestimated him and overestimated the people and institutions that should have stopped him. The need to keep discounting him heading into the 2020 election is his greatest and possibly only asset, and the worst threat to our democracy we've faced.
Trump is actually getting better at the worst things that matter most, like avoiding accountability for high and low crimes, capturing the courts for the far right, and raising hundreds of millions of dollars to "carpet-bomb" Democrats. The institutions that were supposed to rein him in have done more to restrain his critics than him. Meanwhile, what reigns is the belief that this nightmare is bound to end on its own — what writer Sarah Kendzior calls "normalcy bias."
Cognitive scientist George Lakoff warned in 2016, "Trump is a master salesman with a history of selling deals good for him but not so good for most others." But it may be "Dilbert" creator Scott Adams, the author of a book that claims Trump is a "master persuader," who nailed Trump's strategy: "When it comes to unfavorability, you don't need to outrun the bear. You only need to outrun your camping buddy."
Trump's passion for kneecapping anything that might hold him accountable has even become clear to his favorite reporter. "A Trump adviser, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said weeks ago that the president, whose own approval ratings have stayed upside down, needs voters to feel negatively not just about his opponents but about longstanding institutions," The New York Times' Maggie Haberman tweeted.
The current front-runner for the Democratic nomination, with his four decades in the limelight, might provide the perfect bull's-eye for the president's patented psychological projection. What about former Vice President Joe Biden's "gaffes," questionable family business, possible foreign entanglements and history of race baiting? Trump will surely ask. Regardless of who wins their nomination, Democrats are heading into what could be the messiest primary we've ever seen. And any of the front-runners would likely draw a third-party protest candidate into the race.
Meanwhile, almost nothing has been done to secure our elections against the hacked emails, voter database intrusions and social media manipulation that we saw from Russia in 2016. And Trump continues to try to reward Russian President Vladimir Putin for that interference.
We should all be doing what Georgia's Stacey Abrams is doing — everything we can to ensure every voter gets to the polls. For our greatest threat is underestimating the threat we face.

Texto completo: Tom Steyer, the billionaire and former hedge fund investor turned impeachment activist, became the 11th Democratic presidential candidate to qualify for the October debates on Sunday after a new poll showed him with 2 percent support in Nevada.
To make the cut, candidates must procure donations from 130,000 people and earn 2 percent support in four qualifying polls. Steyer fell one poll short of qualifying for the third Democratic debate in Houston this week. But the Democratic National Committee's rules allow polls to carry over and count toward qualification for the fourth set of debates.
With three qualifying polls already under his belt and the fourth published Sunday, Steyer has now secured a spot in the debates next month, scheduled for Oct. 15 and possibly Oct. 16, in a location to be announced in Ohio.
Only 10 candidates earned enough support to appear in this week's debate, and they will all appear on a single stage Thursday night. But with 11 candidates now qualified for the October event, the DNC may split that debate across two nights, as it did for the first two sets of debates in June and July. The committee has not yet indicated whether it will do so.

Pompeo continues ducking questions about Senate race
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo continued to deflect questions Sunday about his political future, declining to swear off a run for the Senate from his home state of Kansas next year.
Pompeo, who represented the southern portion of central Kansas for six years in the House before joining President Trump's Cabinet, has been Senate Republican leaders' top choice to replace Pat Roberts, a retiring Republican senator. They believe he could clear the GOP field and easily win the general election.
Pompeo, who served as Trump's CIA director before getting confirmed as secretary of state in April 2018, reiterated Sunday that he is focused on being America's top diplomat. But he appeared to leave open the possibility that he would run if the president wanted him to.
"I've said this repeatedly, as long as President Trump wants me to be a secretary of state, I will do what I've been doing for the last, goodness, almost year and a half now, focus on trying to deliver security for the American people. It's my mission every day," Pompeo said on ABC's "This Week."
"I'm focused on what I'm doing," Pompeo said on Fox News Sunday, prompting the host, Chris Wallace, to ask what he would do if Trump wanted him to run for Senate.
"Goodness knows, Chris. These are impossible to answer," Pompeo replied.
Pompeo appeared on all five major Sunday political talk shows, in part to speak on the status of peace talks with the Taliban and the Afghan government following Trump's Saturday night announcement that he called off secretive talks slated to happen Sunday at Camp David.
But the Senate race questions continue to follow Pompeo, partly because of his nuanced answers and partly because of his repeated travels back to Kansas.
Washington Post
Trump to visit Baltimore on Thursday
Just weeks after lambasting Baltimore as a "disgusting, rat and rodent infested mess," President Trump will visit the Maryland city to huddle with congressional Republicans, a gathering that could draw local protests and reignite an ugly feud between the White House and the black-majority locality.
The White House confirmed Sunday that Trump would address House Republicans at their biennial retreat this Thursday. Republican lawmakers and aides — who chose the city for their three-day gathering before Trump decried it as "the Worst in the USA" — weren't sure the president would want to attend.
Trump's attendance could elate GOP lawmakers still licking their wounds from last fall's midterm shellacking by the Democrats, who took the House majority. But it could also spark protests from residents and local leaders who are still simmering over Trump's attacks on their city and don't want him there.
Trump's offensive on Baltimore started in late July, when he took to Twitter to accuse Representative Elijah Cummings, a Maryland Democrat, the House Oversight Committee chairman, of being a "brutal bully." Cummings' panel has unearthed deficiencies in the administration, including shortfalls in the security-clearance process at the White House and concerns about Trump's decision to give his son-in-law Jared Kushner access to the nation's top secrets.
Cummings has also been investigating whether Trump has tried to enrich himself while in office by steering business to his hotels.
But Trump didn't limit his attacks to the Baltimore congressman; he decried the entire area Cummings represents — a predominantly black constituency — as being "dangerous & filthy" and a place "no human being would want to live."
City officials pushed back on Trump's comments forcefully. Cummings, a vocal critic of Trump's, invited him to visit to dispel his assumptions about the city.
Now, Trump will do just that, albeit not with Cummings.

Air Force Alaska crew did not favor Trump Scottish hotel
Military officials are disputing a report that claims a joint Air Force and Alaska Air National Guard unit on a routine mission to Kuwait went miles out of their way to spend the night at a resort in Scotland owned by President Trump.
Politico first reported that the military transport that took off from Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Anchorage in March spent the night at the Turnberry resort, about 50 miles outside Glasgow.
The disclosure comes as Trump last week denied he had any role in Vice President Mike Pence's booking a room at a Trump resort in Ireland or Attorney General William Barr's booking at holiday party at a Trump property in Washington, D.C., actions which Democrats and critics claim enrich the president at taxpayers' expense.
The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee has opened an investigation into the matter.
Military flights making stopovers in Scotland are not unusual, and there were no rooms closer to the airport, an Air Force spokesman said Saturday in an e-mailed statement to the Associated Press.
"As our aircrews serve on these international airlift missions, they follow strict guidelines on contracting for hotel accommodations and all expenditures of taxpayer dollars," Brigadier General Edward Thomas wrote.
The routine airlift mission was on a C-17 shared by the Air Force and the Alaska Air National Guard at the Anchorage base. The crew on this flight consisted of seven active-duty Air Force and Alaska Air National Guard members.
The flight took off from Anchorage on March 13, making stops at bases in Nevada and New Hampshire before going to Glasgow Prestwick Airport and eventually Ali Al Salem base in Kuwait. The crew was back in Alaska on March 19.
A local government contractor made the Scotland reservations, and indicated there was not a room closer to the airport than the Trump resort, 54 miles away, Thomas said.
That, Thomas said, was not a remarkable distance to travel to receive the government rate for the rooms.
He said the Trump resort had rooms for $136 a night, cheaper than a Marriott, which charged $161 a night. However, he said both are under the per diem rate of $166.

It’s The Only Hospital In Town, And Critics Say It Has Become As Proficient At Suing For Unpaid Bills As It Has At Healing

Texto completo: CARLSBAD, N.M. - The first time Carlsbad Medical Center sued Misti Price, she was newly divorced and working two jobs to support her three young children.
The hospital demanded payment in 2012 for what Price recalled as an emergency room visit for one of her children who has asthma. She could not afford a lawyer, and she did not have the money to pay the bill.
Price let the summons go unanswered, figuring she would settle the balance - with interest, about $3,600 - when she could. A few months later, she opened her paycheck and discovered the hospital had garnished her wages by $870 a month.
Her car was soon repossessed because she could no longer make the payments. She was on the verge of losing her house, too, when her mortgage company stepped in to help her save it.
“I was going to let it go,” Price said, tearing up recently in an interview at the Carlsbad Public Library. “It was tough.”
And it was only the beginning. Price, 40, a nurse and local 4-H leader, has been sued five times by Carlsbad Medical Center, for bills totaling more than $17,000.
It’s not because she and her children are uninsured; according to the hospital, the charges are what she owed after her insurer had paid. But Price said she had never received an itemized bill outlining exactly what she owed money for. The collection agency wanted the balance in full, and she was not able to work out a payment plan until after she was sued.
In this town, she has a lot of company.
Land of lawsuits
An examination of court records by The New York Times found almost 3,000 lawsuits by Carlsbad Medical Center against patients over medical debt since 2015, more than 500 of them through August of this year alone. Few hospitals sue so many patients so often.
Price’s sister, a police dispatcher, has been sued twice. Her husband has been sued. The county judge who hears many of these cases was once sued, too.
Carlsbad Medical Center is not the only hospital to have filed reams of lawsuits over unpaid bills. In Memphis, Tennessee, Methodist Le Bonheur Healthcare, a nonprofit hospital, has filed 8,300 lawsuits in the past five years, including some against its own employees, according to an investigation by the journalism nonprofit groups ProPublica and MLK50.
In Virginia, hospitals filed more than 20,000 lawsuits over patient debt in 2017 alone, according to a study by researchers at Johns Hopkins University. Just five hospitals accounted for half of the resulting wage garnishments in the state.
People across the country are coping with soaring medical costs, opaque pricing and surprise bills, but these issues are felt acutely in one-hospital towns like Carlsbad, where residents have few options for care - and must pay whatever prices the hospital sets. “Hospitals that have little competition can negotiate higher rates, because the insurer wants that hospital in their network,” said Sara Collins of the nonprofit Commonwealth Fund. Patient deductibles, which must be paid out of pocket, are rising for almost everyone, she added.
Nationally, more than 1 in 4 consumers in 2018 were reported to credit bureaus over unpaid debt, according to the Consumer Credit Protection Bureau. More than half of those reports involved medical bills. One survey of women with breast cancer found that a third of those with health insurance had been referred to bill collectors; among those without insurance, the number rose to 77%.
People confronted with medical debt typically drain their savings, the Commonwealth Fund has found, and 43% said it lowered their credit rating, suggesting that many of these consumers were reported to collection agencies.
Melissa Suggs, a spokeswoman for Carlsbad Medical Center, declined requests for interviews about the hospital’s debt collection practices.
“The majority of accounts from which we seek to collect payment are patients with insurance who have not fulfilled their deductible, copayment, or coinsurance responsibility set by their health insurance plan - and who have chosen not to enter into a payment arrangement for those amounts,” the hospital said in a written statement.
Following inquiries from The New York Times, the hospital said last week that it would no longer sue patients whose incomes are below 150% of the federal poverty level (roughly $19,000 for a single person), whether they have insurance or not, and would release current court judgments against any such patients.
Uninsured patients will now receive “discounts” that will bring down their bills roughly to Medicaid reimbursement rates, the hospital said.
New Mexico expanded Medicaid enrollment under the Affordable Care Act in 2014, and almost all of these patients qualify for coverage. The state is now considering a Medicaid “buy-in” option that would further expand coverage.
A small, sun-baked town once known mostly for its nearby caverns, Carlsbad’s population has ballooned in recent years with an influx of workers drilling and fracking in the oil-rich Permian Basin.
The town’s sole hospital, Carlsbad Medical Center has long faced criticism from community leaders for high prices.
In 2013, officials of Carlsbad, which is self-insured, formed a task force called the Mayor’s Hospital Reform Committee to address the strain on its budget over health care costs for city employees. Administrators considered sending employees to neighboring towns for care before they were able to negotiate lower rates for key services.
In a presentation to the state Legislature in 2015, the mining company Intrepid Potash, a major employer in Carlsbad, calculated that it would be cheaper for one of its workers to travel to Hawaii for a gall bladder operation - including airfare for two, and a seven-day island cruise - than to get the procedure at the local hospital. The company still encourages employees to seek care out of town when possible.
Above the norm
In May, a nationwide survey by the RAND Corp. found that private insurers paid Carlsbad Medical Center five times more than Medicare would have paid for the same services - about twice the figure in the state overall.
Carlsbad Medical Center is owned by Community Health Systems, a chain of hospitals based in Franklin, Tennessee.
(Community Health Systems is the parent of Commonwealth Health, which owns six hospitals in Northeast Pennsylvania: Moses Taylor Hospital in Scranton, Regional Hospital of Scranton, Wilkes-Barre General Hospital, Berwick Hospital Center, First Hospital in Kingston and Tyler Memorial Hospital in Tunkhannock.)
An investigation in 2014 by The Santa Fe New Mexican newspaper found that the three hospitals charging the highest prices in the state were all owned by Community Health Systems.
In 2015, the company paid $98 million to the federal government to settle charges that it had inflated revenue by admitting patients unnecessarily. Community Health Systems admitted no wrongdoing.
In 2018, a unit of the company agreed to pay $260 million to settle charges, brought by the Department of Justice, that it had systematically overbilled for emergency room visits. Company officials noted that the fraud occurred before Community Health Systems bought the subsidiary.
There are alternative hospitals near Carlsbad, but the closest is more than 40 minutes away in Artesia, which residents may find too far to drive to in an emergency. One of Price’s bills followed an emergency room visit after her daughter broke her arm on the soccer field.
“When your kid’s in pain, it’s hard to wait 45 minutes to get them there,” she said.
Artesia General has no debt-collection suits against patients on record since 2015. Neither does Presbyterian Hospital in Albuquerque - which, at 450 licensed beds, is almost four times as large as the hospital in Carlsbad. By contrast, other hospitals in New Mexico owned by Community Health Systems also regularly file suits over unpaid bills: Lea Regional Medical Center in Hobbs has filed almost 2,000 such suits since 2015; Mountain View Regional Medical Center in Las Cruces has filed about 2,000 suits against patients in that time, and almost half of them came just this year.
In Carlsbad, these lawsuits flood the docket. District Judge Lisa Riley, who has been on the bench in Eddy County since 2011, estimated that about one-third of all civil cases that come across her desk involve unpaid medical debt.
The overwhelming majority of lawsuits simply go into default judgment, she said, meaning that the defendants fail to respond - as was the situation in Price’s first case - and the hospital proceeds to garnish wages.
“Out of those people who do respond, which is very few, the responses almost always say, ‘I admit I owe the money and I’d like to make payment arrangements,’ or ‘I can’t afford to pay it right now,’ ” Riley said. Hearings on the hospital cases are rare. Hospital suits over unpaid debt are so frequent in Eddy County, “I had no idea that it wasn’t common practice,” Riley added. “I assumed that all hospitals did that.”
What frustrates patients is the inability to find out prices until the bill comes, even when they ask. “They say, ‘Oh, we can’t tell you until insurance pays,’ ” said Melissa Phillips, Price’s sister. “That’s the answer. Or, ‘Depends what all we have to do.’ ”

Why is a TV critic writing about the rise of Trump?

Texto completo: James Poniewozik, chief television critic for the New York Times, has an answer at the ready if anyone suggests that writing "Audience of One: Donald Trump, Television, and the Fracturing of America" is somehow beyond his purview.
"If somebody says stay in my lane?" Poniewozik says. "The guy from 'The Apprentice' is president. That ship sailed a long time ago, and nobody's going to bring it into the dock."
Not that Poniewozik has anyone to answer to. The book, which comes out Tuesday, Sept. 10, is brilliant, drawing on Poniewozik's considerable skill as a critic. If you still struggle to understand how Trump got elected, boy, is this the book for you.
It's a terrific read. Poniewozik's writing is breezy, funny when it needs to be, serious when it doesn't. In his TV reviews and media essays, Poniewozik always seeks the larger meaning, and if that's difficult to wedge into a single newspaper column, the book gives him more room to breathe.
He examines not just Trump's evolution from media-hungry huckster to president, but also the way television changed along the way, as well, creating a synthesis unique to the time and the person — resulting in President Trump.
Or, as Poniewozik puts it in the book, "TV became president."
"I saw that here were these things that I had been writing about for decades as a critic — reality TV and sort of the idea of authenticity," Poniewozik said, "Fox News and conservative media and the political polarization that came from that. The fragmentation of the larger media into bubbles and niches, which enabled all of those things. They gave us reality TV and they gave us political cable news channels. All these things I had been writing about for so long had converged together in the form of a single person who got elected president."
The book follows the parallel lines of both the man and the medium, and their forever-intertwined relationship. A young Trump was fascinated not only by the televised coronation of Queen Elizabeth II, but his mother's entrancement with it (his father thought it was a waste of time).
Of course, it's the reality show "The Apprentice" and Trump's "you're fired!" mantra that most people cite when talking about Trump and TV, though Poniewozik traces the future president all the way back to a 1980 appearance on the "Today" show — a kinder, gentler but just as boastful Trump.
Both he and TV would change.
In reality, "The Apprentice" was only a big hit for a season. It would morph into "The Celebrity Apprentice" and gradually fade away.
Trump, obviously, wasn't done with TV yet, and vice versa.
"One thing that honestly writing the book made me aware of that I wasn't even enough aware of at the time was the extent to which Donald Trump had become kind of a has-been reality-show host through 'Celebrity Apprentice,' (at the same time) he was really rising as a personality thanks to Fox News and 'Fox & Friends,' which I would argue is as important to his eventually getting elected as 'The Apprentice' was," Poniewozik says.
It was a match made just a few feet below heaven, with Trump making outrageous claims against President Barack Obama on a frequent basis (like, for instance, the birther conspiracy theory), but it worked for both parties.
"That's like the perfect medium to sort of put over into the political world this loud, buffoonish entertainment figure, and kind of gradually transform him into a political figure," Poniewozik says. "And Fox News was a great medium for him to do that in, because it had for decades, thanks to Roger Ailles, been cultivating this audience that felt besieged and the rest of the news is fake news and you can only trust Fox and had sort of taught its audience this sort of resentment of liberal Hollywood.
"With Donald Trump becoming a personality on 'Fox & Friends' it's great, because here's this TV celebrity who's on their side, and is not part of liberal Hollywood, but a celebrity of their own. That ends up being the perfect medium in which to sort of launder that reality TV celebrity and turn it into a genuine political asset."
So was all this a grand plan, or just dumb luck?
"I think it is not a grand plan, but it's not dumb luck," Poniewozik says. "It's sort of this instinctual, kind of savant-like ability to follow the light of the camera and trust that it will lead him to the next thing, which it always has. He kind of learned how to think like a television — what stimulates a TV camera's pleasure centers and nerve endings, and say and do the things that get you attention. There's no such thing as bad attention, because you can leverage that into something else."
Like, for instance, the presidency. You will recall that during the Republican primaries, Trump would fight with his opponents about almost anything. This surprised a lot of political pundits, but not Poniewozik.
"When he ran for president, there were all these things, whether it was attacking John McCain, war hero, or he goes on a debate and he launches on this tirade against Rand Paul, who is like 5,000 points behind him in the poll," he says. "Over and over again, it's like, 'Why is Trump picking this unnecessary fight?'
"Well that's the thing you say if you don't watch a lot of reality TV. If you watch a lot of reality TV, you realized every fight is necessary, because fights get you camera time. Fights show that you're a fighter. It's sort of dominance politics when you apply it to a presidential primary, which is basically a reality-TV elimination event."
Remember the audience Trump was playing to — and continues to play to.
"If you launch this outrageous attack against somebody and they don't have a good response, then it's telling voters this guy can't even protect himself, how do you expect him to protect you? It's sort of virtual combat. That is the thing I think you understand by understanding how reality TV works, that you wouldn't understand if you had just looked at how past political campaigns worked."
Poniewozik is somewhat optimistic about the lessons media learned from the way they covered the 2016 election, though he says its mostly at the margins. CNN won't just put a camera on an empty microphone waiting for Trump to speak (so it says). Unfiltered coverage of rallies is less common. But it remains a difficult balance for all media.
"Nobody's innocent in this," Poniewozik says. "It's not just cable news. It's newspapers. Everybody to some extent, they're ruled by the tyranny of clicks."
True enough. Providing context and a critical eye is essential to covering Trump — to covering anyone, really. And in "Audience of One," Poniewozik does just that, to outstanding effect.

Administración Trump estudia si reduce aún más el ingreso de refugiados, según reportes

Texto completo: Entre las medidas en tema de políticas de inmigración que la administración del presidente, Donald Trump, evalúa actualmente, también está la posible reducción del número de refugiados que pueden entrar en EEUU.
La decisión del Gobierno se acerca, según reporta The New York Times y confirma The Associated Press. Ambos medios aseguran que funcionarios de la Casa Blanca tienen prevista una reunión de alto nivel sobre este tema para el martes de la semana que viene. El objetivo es discutir a qué cifra anual de refugiados se permitirá el ingreso, explican.
Como ya contó también Noticias Telemundo, el 1 de octubre empieza el nuevo año fiscal, una fecha clave para fijar el cupo de refugiados admisibles en los siguiente 12 meses. La administración Trump tiene intención de fijar el nuevo cupo antes de esa fecha, según AP.
Esta agencia asegura que no se ha llegado todavía a una decisión. Algunos funcionarios de la administración que han hablado bajo la condición de anonimato a esta agencia consideran que el número de refugiados se tendría que reducir debido a que EEUU está bajo presión por el aumento de solicitudes de asilo en la frontera sur y de otros países afectados por guerras o graves desastres naturales.
La jurisdicción prevé una diferencia entre las dos categorías: la primera, el estatus de refugiado, se refiere a personas consideradas bajo graves amenazas que se encuentran fuera de EEUU y que no pueden volver a su país de origen.
La segunda se asocia en cambio a migrantes que ya se encuentran en territorio nacional o en el intento de entrar en el país y que aseguran que estarían en peligro si vuelven a sus países de origen.
El Times afirma que el Gobierno baraja distintas opciones. Según las fuentes consultadas por este periódico, una prevé una limitación del número de refugiados que podría reducirlo a cero. Esta idea ha sido propuesta por un alto oficial de la administración. El primer medio que habló de esta posibilidad fue la revista Politico en julio.
Otra idea, confirmada también por AP, es establecer un máximo de 10,000 ó 15,000 ingresos anuales. El cupo establecido para este año fiscal fue de 30,000 refugiados, 15,000 menos que para 2018. El año fiscal anterior, cuando estaba en vigor la meta fijada bajo la administración de Barack Obama, el total de admisibles era de 110,000.
Ambas ideas harían que EEUU renunciara a su posición de país que más refugiados acoge en el mundo, destaca el rotativo neoyorquino.
La decisión tiene que tomarla el presidente Trump, según afirmó una fuente del Departamento de Estado. Pero la Casa Blanca todavía no ha hecho comentarios oficiales al respecto.
Un actual funcionario de la administración y varios exfuncionarios de la misma dijeron al Times que uno de los que más presionan para reducir ulteriormente el número de refugiados es Stephen Miller, el principal asesor de Trump en materia de inmigración.
Miembros de grupos de defensa del programa de refugiados, activo en EEUU desde 1980, indican que para la puesta en marcha de la medida será clave la posición de Mark T. Esper, secretario de Defensa desde el pasado julio.
Su antecesor, Jim Mattis, se opuso a grandes recortes del número de refugiados admisibles, alegando que estos afectarían los intereses militares de EEUU en el mundo. Un alto funcionario afirmó que la posición de Esper al respecto todavía se desconoce. Militares retirados y grupos de ayuda humanitaria están intentando convencerlo a tomar una postura parecida a la de Matis.
Organismos implicados en la ayuda humanitaria y reasentamiento de refugiados consultados por Noticias Telemundo consideraron que sería un desatino y una “catástrofe” continuar reduciendo el ingreso de refugiados, especialmente debido a la crisis global de 26 millones de refugiados que huyen de la violencia y persecución.
Hans Van de Weerd, vicepresidente del programa para refugiados del “Comité Internacional para Rescates” (IRC, por su sigla en inglés), dijo que si eventualmente la Administración baja a cero el número de refugiados, eso sería algo “catastrófico” para personas que dependen del reasentamiento para sobrevivir.
La decisión pondría en entredicho la credibilidad e influencia de EEUU en el mundo y sería otro “golpe bajo” de una Administración que ya implementó una veda a inmigrantes de países con mayoría musulmana, ha impuesto restricciones al proceso de asilo, ha separado familias en la frontera sur, y mantiene una política de detención de niños migrantes, agregó Van de Weerd.
A la fecha del 6 de septiembre, la cifra de refugiados aceptados a partir del pasado 1 de octubre fue de 28,501, según AP . El año fiscal pasado, se admitieron 22,491. Los latinoamericanos admitidos como refugiados en el año fiscal 2019 fueron poco más de 600, según el Centro de Procesamiento de Refugiados del Departamento de Estado.

Texto completo: Tony Perkins must have been the only person available for an interview last weekend on "Fox and Friends."
President Trump was busy playing golf while monster hurricane Dorian bore down on Florida's East Coast, the trade war with China heated up a notch with more tariffs that you and I (not the Chinese) will pay, more of the Brazilian Amazon rain forest went up in flames and another seven Americans died in a mass shooting in Texas.
Neither Trump nor any of his diminishing cadre of minions was available to comment on any of the slow-motion apocalyptic disasters unfolding almost anywhere you cared to look. After all, it was Labor Day weekend, and the president had to add to his 200-plus days in office spent on the golf course.
So who was the loyal "Fox and Friends" cast supposed to interview? That's where Tony Perkins comes in.
Perkins, an evangelical leader, heads up something called the Family Research Council, a right-wing advocacy group. Mostly they promote theories not always supported with anything resembling facts. But, hey, if you don't let facts get in the way of your preconceived theories, life gets a lot less complicated.
For instance, during the course of Perkins' interview, the subject of mass shootings came up. Since America has bled through 38 such shootings so far this year, according to the New York Times, it seemed a topic worth exploring with a follower of Jesus.
Perkins did not disappoint. Mass shootings, he said, are caused by "driving God from the public square." Specifically, teaching children about evolution has become the main culprit.
"We've taught our kids that they come about by chance through primordial slime and then we're surprised that they treat their fellow Americans like dirt," Perkins said.
Personally, I take great umbrage at that statement. My children did not come about through primordial slime. One of them came from Hills and Dales General Hospital in Cass City and the other two arrived through the good offices of McKenzie Memorial Hospital in Sandusky.
Neither of these institutions traffics in slime, primordial or otherwise. I demand a retraction. But I'm not holding my breath. These evangelicals can be terribly stubborn.
The solution, Perkins said, was to teach them the basic truth that "they're created in the image of God, therefore they have inherent value."
No argument there. Every one of us is created in God's image, although sometimes I suspect God might be testing our limits of tolerance when some of those creations try their hand at fashion in the form of hair dye, tattoos or other adornments.
But that's just me being a cranky old guy. If everybody really looked like God, nobody could look at anyone else because the Bible says no one has looked at God and lived. So I'll settle for second- and third-hand descriptions.
But I digress. Kids need to understand their place in creation and the cosmos. They also need to understand that evolution's first two syllables are not spelled "e-v-i-l." The way I see it, that's how creation works – it evolves through hundreds of thousands and millions of years, far beyond our understanding. It is, in fact, God at work.
Science has proven the Earth is far older than 6,000 years and that humans and dinosaurs didn't inhabit the planet at the same time. That's a concept some really true believers can't wrap their minds around, so they call science and the gifted men and women who practice it bogus.
God loves them anyway.

Texto completo: Writer and poet Ilya Kaminsky will make a stop at Washburn University at 4 p.m. Monday to give two presentations.
Kaminsky, who moved to the United States from Ukraine when he was 16, will hold a public conversation at the International House, 1824 S.W. Jewell Ave., and a poetry reading at Henderson Learning Resources Center, according to information provided by Eric McHenry, professor of English at Washburn.
Kaminsky's new book, "Deaf Republic," is a story told through poems about a deaf boy who is shot during a protest. The gunshot that kills the boy is the last thing the citizens ever hear, causing them to learn to communicate through sign language.
Kaminsky, who is deaf, had his book reviewed by the New York Times and NPR.

Support for open borders will be Democrats' undoing in 2020 Voters (and opinion writers for liberal newspapers) oppose free care for illegal immigrants, decriminalizing illegal crossings and other conspicuously bad ideas.

Texto completo: HOLDEN -- Following the debates, opinion writers on liberal editorial pages exploded, imploring the Democrats: Wake up! You're "in a bubble on immigration"! (Full disclosure: I wrote in Bernie Sanders in 2016.)
In The Washington Post, Jeh Johnson, President Barack Obama's director of homeland security, wrote: "We cannot, as some Democratic candidates for president now propose, publicly embrace a policy to not deport those who enter or remain in this country illegally unless they commit a crime. That is tantamount to declaring publicly that our borders are open to all."
New York Times columnist Bret Stephens wrote June 28: "Promising access to health insurance for north of 11 million undocumented immigrants at a time when there's a migration crisis at the southern border? Every candidate at Thursday's debate raises a hand for that one, in what was surely the evening's best moment for the Trump campaign."
New York magazine columnist Andrew Sullivan pointed out that almost all of the candidates in the Democratic debates "said that if illegal immigrants do not commit a crime once they're in the U.S., they should be allowed to become citizens. How, I ask, is that not practically open borders? ... I suspect that the Democrats' new position - everyone in the world can become an American if they walk over the border and never commit a crime - is political suicide."
Similar warnings emanated from New York Times columnists David Brooks, Thomas Friedman, Thomas Edsall, Ross Douthat and Gail Collins. And from The Washington Post, Fareed Zakaria and Karen Tumulty. Even Hispanic leaders say Democrats erred in supporting free health care for illegal migrants - which just 33 percent of voters think is a good idea, NPR/Marist found in July, while only 27 percent believe that decriminalizing illegal border crossings is a good idea.
Democrats used to be immigration hawks. Consider President Bill Clinton's 1995 State of the Union address: "All Americans ... are rightfully disturbed by the large numbers of illegal aliens entering our country. The jobs they hold might otherwise be held by citizens or legal immigrants. The public services they use impose burdens on our taxpayers." Strong words, but he didn't deliver.
Democrats have succeeded in playing it both ways: denying support for open borders, but achieving the same results by consistently rewarding illegal immigration, advocating mass legalization schemes, shielding employers and passing laws to prevent cities from collaborating with federal enforcement.
Triggered by President Trump's racism, and confident in their own moral superiority, Democrats have only become more radical. Congressional leftists are unwavering in their support for abolishing Immigration and Customs Enforcement (an idea supported by 43 percent of Democrats). And the Democratic-controlled California Legislature passed a statute curtailing cooperation with ICE. Yet 80 percent of the public answered "yes" to this 2017 Harvard-Harris Poll question: "Should cities that arrest illegal immigrants for crimes be required to turn them over to immigration authorities?" All 10 candidates at a recent presidential debate supported free health care for undocumented migrants, something we don't even provide for our own citizens. Is this the plan to defeat Trump?
Democrats say, "Go after the employers!" and then unanimously vote against a Republican bill (HR 4760) that called for employer sanctions, universal E-Verify, ending extended family migration, etc. - all of which were part of the highly praised, comprehensive immigration reform bill of 2013, championed by President Obama and supported by Sens. Susan Collins and Angus King.
House Democrats couldn't swallow Trump's wall. Although the wall is controversial, many current problems might have been ameliorated by other features of HR 4760, and Dreamers would have been permanently protected from deportation. Too bad for Dreamers. Continued chaos at the border is great political optics for Democrats' moral outrage. But how much longer will the public buy their pretense at compassion?
I shudder at four more years of Trump. But Democrats are courting disaster in 2020 unless they listen to common sense from the liberal news outlets they respect.

The Trump administration said Wednesday it planned to scrap requirements for energy-efficient light bulbs, but that doesn't mean you can't phase out the old-style bulbs in your home. It's simple and it would very likely lower your power bill. And, it would be good for the environment.
How good? There's been a quiet light bulb revolution in the United States over the last decade or so, with many homes moving to more energy-efficient lighting. That general shift has already decreased electricity demand in the country.
Completing that revolution would bring carbon savings equivalent to taking several million cars off the roads.
LEDs, or light-emitting diodes, are the most efficient light bulbs on the market. They use up to 85 percent less energy than traditional incandescent bulbs, the ones with a thin wire filament inside, and can last up to 25 years. LEDs are also much more efficient than halogen bulbs and slightly more efficient than compact fluorescents, the other common options on the market, according to the Energy Saver office at the Department of Energy. (The office declined to comment for this article.)
There are about six billion screw-in sockets in homes across the United States. Two billion to three billion of those still have an inefficient incandescent or halogen bulb in them, said Noah Horowitz, a senior scientist at the Natural Resources Defense Council. If every home in the country switched those sockets over to LEDs at once, he said, we'd save an estimated 38 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions a year. He based his estimate on a report by the Appliance Standards Awareness Project that used Department of Energy data.
That's equal to the emissions from about seven million cars. And, it would save money because it means the United States would spend about $ 14 billion less on lighting annually. On average, every household would save roughly $ 100 a year on its electrical bill. Precise cost savings would depend on a few variables, like electricity rates where you live, said Eric Hittinger, an energy expert at the Rochester Institute of Technology.
The upfront cost of LEDs tends to be higher than traditional bulbs, but that is rapidly changing as technology improves. And, over their lifetime, LEDs are almost certainly a better value because of the energy savings and because they don't have to be replaced as often.
"In energy, we don't get a lot of free lunches," Dr. Hittinger said. "But LED lighting, switching to LED lighting, is basically a free lunch."

As Dorian has shown over the past 10 days, predicting the path of a hurricane is an inexact science. Forecasters take data about ocean temperatures, air pressure, wind speeds -- the more data the better -- and feed it into computer models, which, after a few hours of number-crunching, can produce a dizzying number of possible tracks. They are spaghetti strands of uncertainty.
The uncertainty diminishes over time, especially as a hurricane grows. "Big hurricanes are easier to forecast," said Joel Cline, a meteorologist with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The path of a small storm is harder to predict.
Dorian is a good example of this -- as a small storm in the tropics off Africa, its initial track forecasts were literally all over the map. But as the storm developed into a large hurricane and approached the Bahamas, the track forecasts became more certain (unfortunately so for Grand Bahama and Abaco Islands, which were devastated when Dorian, then a Category 5 storm, slowed to a crawl over them).
We know that climate change affects hurricanes in some ways. Warmer oceans provide more of the energy that the storms need to grow, for example, which is why climate scientists say that, while there may not be more hurricanes in the future, there may be more severe ones.
But does climate change affect the track that these storms take?
So far, there is not a lot of evidence either way. A study published in June found that hurricanes are more likely to stall near the North American coast than in the past. But the authors said the trend could be linked to natural variability rather than a warming atmosphere.
Some scientists say that, as climate change makes run-of-the-mill weather patterns more intense, this may have an impact on storms, since these external patterns -- high-pressure ridges, low-pressure troughs and other phenomena -- are what steer hurricanes.
But that is just a suggestion at this point. Mr. Cline said that what steered Dorian toward the Bahamas and the United States was what steers most hurricanes in the tropical Atlantic: the prevailing winds that blow from east to west.
What caused it to stall over the Bahamas, he said, was a weakening of those winds as a zone of high-pressure air receded to the south.
Now that Dorian has moved past the Bahamas, a low-pressure trough over the Southeastern United States is steering it to the north-northwest, a very typical pattern, Mr. Cline said. And as it travels farther north, it will be affected by the west-to-east winds that prevail over much of the country, pushing the storm to the northeast and eventually into the North Atlantic.

In 1901, President William McKinley was shot and mortally wounded by anarchist Leon Czolgosz at the Pan-American Expo in Buffalo, N.Y. (McKinley died eight days later; Czolgosz was executed on Oct. 29.)
In 1909, American explorer Robert Peary sent a telegram from Indian Harbor, Labrador, announcing that he had reached the North Pole five months earlier.
In 1943, 79 people were killed when a New York-bound Pennsylvania Railroad train derailed and crashed in Philadelphia.
In 1972, the Summer Olympics resumed in Munich, West Germany, a day after the deadly hostage crisis that claimed the lives of 11 Israelis and five Arab abductors.
In 1985, all 31 people aboard a Midwest Express Airlines DC-9 were killed when the Atlanta-bound jetliner crashed just after takeoff from Milwaukee's Mitchell Field.
In 1995, Baltimore Orioles shortstop Cal Ripken broke Lou Gehrig's record by playing his two-thousand-131st consecutive game.
In 1997, a public funeral was held for Princess Diana at Westminster Abbey in London, six days after her death in a car crash in Paris. In Calcutta, India, weeping masses gathered to pay homage to Mother Teresa, who had died the day before at age 87.
In 2002, meeting outside Washington, D.C. for only the second time since 1800, Congress convened in New York to pay homage to the victims and heroes of Sept. 11, 2001.
In 2004, in Iraq, seven members of the First Marine Division from Camp Pendleton, Calif., and three US-trained Iraqi soldiers were killed by a car bomb near Fallujah.
In 2006, President George W. Bush acknowledged for the first time that the CIA was running secret prisons overseas and said tough interrogation had forced terrorist leaders to reveal plots to attack the United States and its allies.
In 2014, President Barack Obama, in an interview taped for NBC's "Meet the Press," said the surge of immigrant children entering the US illegally had changed the politics surrounding the issue of immigration and led him to put off a pledge to use executive action that could have shielded millions of people from deportation.
In 2017, Hurricane Irma, the most powerful hurricane ever recorded in the Atlantic, pounded Puerto Rico with heavy rain and powerful winds; authorities said more than 900,000 people were without power. (Hurricane Maria, which would destroy the island's power grid, arrived two weeks later.)
Last year, one after another, President Trump's top lieutenants stepped forward to deny being the author of a New York Times opinion piece that purportedly came from a member of an administration "resistance" movement.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - State and local agencies in Pennsylvania will receive $75 million over the next year to combat the opioid epidemic, part of $1.8 billion in funding the Trump administration announced Wednesday.
The new round of funding includes a $5.2 million grant for the Allegheny County Health Department to better collect and track overdose data as close to real time as possible. The initiative, funded by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, has already reduced reporting delays in opioid deaths, administration officials said.
The Pennsylvania Department of Health received $8.5 million, and the Philadelphia Department of Public Health received $5.9 million, for the same purpose.
"We really struggle in collecting reliable and timely data from our coroners," said Jen Smith, secretary of the Pennsylvania Department of Drug and Alcohol Programs. Counties use different reporting systems, which can lead to a lag in overdose trends as long as nine months and prevent the state from effectively targeting resources to places that need it most, Ms. Smith said.
The department plans to use the money to help overwhelmed county offices, she said, and find ways to streamline the data into a standardized statewide system.
A spokesman for the Allegheny County Health Department said the agency could not comment Wednesday.
The new money to improve opioid reporting comes in addition to nearly $56 million Pennsylvania will receive in the next year to carry out its State Opioid Response plan. The state also received $56 million in 2018, plus a supplemental $29 million, which has been allocated to programs that support housing and employment initiatives.
The second and final year of funding under the State Opioid Response grant program, administered by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, will continue to build those programs. "We can really look at addressing gaps in our treatment system," Ms. Smith said.
In a call with reporters, White House officials said the funding was designed for local authorities to have the flexibility to treat addiction using a variety of methods.
"We are truly headed in the right direction for the first time since this crisis arose," said Alex Azar, secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
In part, the grant program aims to increase access to medication-assisted treatment of opioid dependence using the three drugs approved by the Food and Drug Administration: buprenorphine, methadone and naltrexone. Mr. Azar called medication-assisted treatment the "gold standard" of options, and the Trump administration is requiring it as a condition of agencies receiving the money.
Money could also be used for telemedicine programs in rural areas, employment coaching, the distribution of naloxone and other measures to help people recover from addiction, Mr. Azar said.
Additionally, prescriptions of naloxone, which can counter the effects of an overdose, have risen by 378% since President Donald Trump took office, Mr. Azar said. And the Centers for Medicare&Medicaid Services have approved waivers so 21 states can obtain Medicaid funds to pay for substance use disorder treatment services.
"All of this work is making a difference and saving lives," Mr. Azar said.
Mr. Trump, discussing the new funding Wednesday in the Roosevelt Room of the White House, said his administration has been working to "smash the grip of addiction" since he declared a public health emergency in October 2017.
"So many problems are caused by this problem," Mr. Trump said. "It's something I saw firsthand during the campaign, and I couldn't believe when I looked at certain states in particular, how bad it was."
He cited a drop in opioid deaths in Pennsylvania as evidence his policies are making headway. Other measures - such as a nationwide ad campaign to highlight dangers of misusing painkillers - will take more time, he said.
"You won't see the results of this for a couple of years - two, three, four years - but the results are going to be there," Mr. Trump said. "They're really powerful ads."
Mr. Trump said the U.S. is also stepping up efforts to stop Chinese fentanyl shipments into the country and thanked the Mexican government for a seizure last week of almost 24 tons of fentanyl originating in China.
"First time that's ever happened, where Mexico's helped us at the border, and they've helped us in a very big way," Mr. Trump said. "Far bigger than anyone thought even possible."
The new round of funding comes days after a report found Pennsylvania and Ohio have received relatively modest shares of federal opioid funding that don't fully account for the number of opioid-involved deaths in each state.
Pennsylvania should have received about $740 million, rather than the $345 million it actually received, according to the Richard M. Fairbanks Foundation, an Indianapolis-based philanthropic organization that cited 2017 opioid-involved deaths. Ohio should have gotten about $670 million, up from the $344 million that state actually received.
In 2018, Pennsylvania saw an 18% drop in fatal drug overdoses compared with the previous year, led by a plunge of 40% in southwestern Pennsylvania.
The Trump administration has said it distributes State Opioid Response plan money using a formula that considers two factors: the state's proportion of people with abuse or dependence on opioids who need but are not receiving treatment and the state's proportion of overdose deaths.
Ms. Smith, the head of drug and alcohol programs, acknowledged the challenge of sustaining existing state opioid programs beyond the current round of funding. But she said she has a "pretty high degree of certainty there will be another round."

Woodbury high school coach not a ‘public figure,’ can sue parents for defamation, MN Supreme Court says

Texto completo: The Minnesota Supreme Court says a former Woodbury High School coach can sue his players’ parents for defamation because his position is not so important that criticism of his performance is protected by the First Amendment.
The decision reopens a defamation case that girls basketball coach Nathan McGuire brought in 2015 against a player’s mother, Julie Bowlin.
McGuire coached the team from 2012 to 2014, when the school district placed him on administrative leave and then declined to renew his contract after receiving complaints.
Bowlin and other parents had complained that McGuire swore at practice, flirted with players and touched them inappropriately by giving one player a back rub during a game and by moving the girls by their hips and shoulders at practice, according to the court.
Bowlin also filed a maltreatment-of-minors complaint with the Minnesota Department of Education, but the department ruled in the coach’s favor.
At issue in McGuire’s defamation case was whether or not his position made him a “public figure” or “public official.”
If he was, he’d have to prove Bowlin acted with “actual malice” when she complained to McGuire’s boss, filed the maltreatment report and told another parent that she heard the coach had been arrested.
If the coach was not a public official, he can build his defamation case on a lower standard of evidence.
A Washington County District Court judge ruled in the parents’ favor, finding that the coach was a public official and had failed to provide evidence the parents had “knowingly or recklessly” made a false report.
The Court of Appeals agreed but the Supreme Court did not. The case now returns to the district court.
WHO’S A PUBLIC OFFICIAL?
The U.S. Supreme Court established the defamation standard in 1964 in a case involving the New York Times .
Since then, Minnesota justices have held that a county attorney, probation and law enforcement officers and grand jurors all are “public officials” under that standard, which is meant to protect public debate about important issues and the officials’ performance.
The state Court of Appeals held in 1995 that a teacher is a public official, but the state Supreme Court has never considered that question.
This is the first time the Minnesota Supreme Court has considered whether the standard applies to a high school coach. However, the top courts in four of five states have concluded it does not; one of those cases involved a Utah high school basketball coach who was judged not to have been a public official.
The Minnesota Supreme Court uses three criteria when applying the standard. The defamation target must either:
* Perform “governmental duties directly related to the public interest;”
* Hold “a position to influence significantly the resolution of public issues;” or
* Be a government employee “having, or appearing to the public to have, substantial responsibility for or control over the conduct of government affairs.”
Justice Natalie Hudson’s opinion explored at length whether McGuire fit the first criterion.
“Undoubtedly, the public has some ‘interest’ in the duties McGuire carried out, in the sense that members of the public pay attention to school sports, including the results of a team’s games. But in our view this interest is not enough,” she wrote.
“Just as the public has an interest in how McGuire carries out his duties, McGuire — indeed, society as a whole — has an interest in ensuring the ability to protect his reputation.
“… Put simply, basketball is not fundamental to democracy.”

Texto completo: The mass protests in Hong Kong have been the most thrilling news of 2019: a daring, dramatic movement involving people asserting their fervent support for liberty, democracy and the rule of law.
On some weekends, a quarter of the territory's 7.4 million people have thronged the streets to demand reform from the Beijing government, which had tried to force through a new law allowing extradition to the mainland. They persisted, sometimes violently, even as police resorted to tear gas, rubber bullets and arrests of leaders.
On Wednesday, they got a major concession from Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam, who finally agreed to kill the bill. Her hope is that it will douse the discontent. But as is often the case in such crises, it may serve as an accelerant.
Pro-democracy legislator Claudia Mo said Lam's decision was "too little, too late." Adjunct professor Willy Lam of the Chinese University of Hong Kong, told The New York Times it would "not have any impact." But Regina Ip, a pro-Beijing member of the Executive Council warned, "There are no more concessions we can make."
The protesters' demands have long since expanded to include amnesty for the demonstrators, an investigation into police brutality and democratic reforms. Underlying the movement is a desire to preserve Hong Kong's broad freedom from the tight control the Beijing regime exerts over the rest of China.
When the British colony was returned to Chinese rule in 1997, it was assured substantial autonomy until 2047. But when an overreaching central government put a cloud over that special status, Hong Kongers took to the streets.
That spectacle has inspired admiration and awe. But to anyone who has watched events in China and the world in recent years, the central emotion has to be dread.
The protests represent a direct challenge to the sovereignty and power of the ruling Communist Party. It's a challenge the central government is not likely to endure for long. After Oct. 1, when the party commemorates the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic, it may be less reluctant to crack down.
For China's rulers, the movement brings flashbacks of 1989, when students calling for democracy occupied Tiananmen Square in Beijing. That demonstration arose amid a worldwide surge that brought democracy to places ranging from South Korea to the Soviet Union to Chile. It was natural to expect that China would also make the transition.
It didn't. The government instead chose to crush the opposition with armed troops who killed hundreds if not thousands. The Communist Party held on, and international outrage eventually dissipated. China proceeded to become an economic powerhouse.
It's hard to imagine President Xi Jinping tolerating unending turmoil or accepting the other demands. He is bound to see the unrest as a mortal danger to both China's system of government and its territorial sovereignty.
Letting the protesters win would weaken Beijing's control over its people by signaling that determined, mobilized citizens could defeat the government. Xi did not achieve the most powerful position in China in order to dismantle the system that put him there.
Backing down in Hong Kong would violate what the rulers learned from Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, whose liberalization led to the demise of his government. It would also contradict the lesson they took from the Arab Spring: With sufficient brutality, autocratic regimes can put an end to popular uprisings.
A retreat would also embolden advocates of independence in Hong Kong -- and, even more alarming to Beijing, fuel separatist sentiment in Taiwan. Granting demands for autonomy would call into doubt Beijing's professed commitment to prevent Taiwan from declaring its independence at all costs. The Chinese leaders and people are stalwart in their belief that Hong Kong is theirs -- a claim accepted by the rest of the world.
China's rulers obviously hope that withdrawing the extradition measure will soon bring an end to the turbulence. But there is no reason to doubt that if Beijing needs to use overwhelming force, it will do so -- and ignore the condemnations from abroad.
The brave idealism of the people of Hong Kong is enough to stir the heart of anyone who cherishes freedom. But the harsh reality is that they are unlikely to get more of what they demand. The movement could end because they accept this modest victory and go back to their normal lives. Or it could end in tears and blood.

Trump’s attack on the Endangered Species Act

Texto completo: Trump’s attack on the Endangered Species Act
The Trump administration’s recent changes to the Endangered Species Act are another example of this administration’s core value: corporate power and profit at the expense of ordinary Americans, current and future.
The Endangered Species Act was passed with broad bipartisan support in 1973, signed into law by Republican President Richard Nixon, and is credited with saving 99% of the listed species from extinction, including the bald eagle. The act has been successful because it is grounded in the “best available science.”
The new rules, however, allow officials to calculate the economic impacts of protecting a species, thus clearing the way for mining, drilling and other development in critical habitats. These are likely outcomes, since President Donald Trump has already ordered increasing logging in Alaska’s rainforest. This at a time when species diversity is declining faster than any time in human history. The United Nations recently reported that up to 1 million species currently face extinction.
What do the new regulations mean for all of us? Delicate ecosystems will be harmed. The health of species, including the human species, depends on the health of other species.
Extinctions, even the loss of a tiny fish that feeds on mosquito larvae, ripple across our ecosystem. The loss of biodiversity poses a serious risk by reducing nature’s ability to provide goods and services, such as food, clean water and a stable climate.
And it’s clear that the American public strongly supports the Endangered Species Act. A 2015 poll found that 90% of Americans, including 82% of self-described conservatives, support the act. A 2016 poll found that 70% of Americans oppose removing Endangered Species Act protections.
Rather than listening to the overwhelming majority of Americans, the Trump administration is siding with special interest groups that want to remove all regulations that interfere with their greedy pursuit of wealth and power. It’s shameful and must be opposed.
Go to the Natural Resources Defense Council’s website (www.nrdc.org) to see how you can help.

There’s a cognitive dissonance in our political discourse
In his Forum letter of Aug. 30 (“The good economy didn’t start with Trump”), Michael Hillinger seeks to correct the impression voiced by John Nelson in his letter, published on Aug. 21, (“The good times have been rolling since 2016”), pointing out that the current U.S. economic expansion began in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis and dates from June 2009, at which time Barack Obama was president.
In fact, not only did the current “good economy” not start with President Donald Trump, it’s actually not a good economy for most Americans. It is, however, a primary source of the cognitive dissonance that characterizes our current political discourse.
Here’s Nobel Laureate Joseph Stiglitz in an April New York Times op-ed: “Despite the lowest unemployment rates since the late 1960s, the American economy is failing its citizens. Some 90 percent have seen their incomes stagnate or decline in the past 30 years. This is not surprising, given that the United States has the highest level of inequality among the advanced countries and one of the lowest levels of opportunity — with the fortunes of young Americans more dependent on the income and education of their parents than elsewhere.”
In addition to winning the Nobel Prize in Economics, Stiglitz is a former chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers and chief economist at the World Bank — not a cable TV news host. His voluminous research on economics is supported by peer-reviewed data, as opposed to cable TV ratings, which are supported by a cycle of fear-mongering, false claims, distraction and denial.
The current state of economic inequality in the U.S. has deep roots and many causes. One major political party behaves as though it’s trying to deny the truth, and one is trying to communicate about it. Both want to be in power. Neither can significantly improve the situation on its own.

Why not prescribe illegal drugs? It is sad that, despite more 70,000 overdose deaths in the U.S. in 2017, so little is mentioned as to how we will deal with this astonishing number of mostly young people dying.
Given that we cannot keep illegal drugs off the streets, and that making criminals of people with addiction (who are doing what cigarette smokers and alcoholics do legally) does not work, why not prescribe the illegal drugs to those who, like cigarette smokers, cannot quit their addiction?
We provide methadone and Suboxone to help treat opioid addiction. But both these so-called therapeutic drugs are also addictive. Along with methadone and Suboxone, most of Europe, Australia, New Zealand and Canada provide safe injection sites to use heroin or other opioids. In the U.S., we are also entertaining safe injection sites to help prevent overdosing.
Safe injection sites are good, but they do nothing to stave off the criminal activity some engage in to support their addiction.
We should prescribe the needed illicit drug to those who have tried but cannot kick their addiction. This will help reduce crime and protect potential victims.
A person’s mental state — whether the result of nature, nurture or both — is the reason for addiction. And while mental health care is practiced everywhere, drug addiction is hidden most everywhere.
We need to treat addiction as an illness, openly and with whatever works. There is nothing wrong with providing happiness to those who cannot naturally produce it. Musician and composer Ray Charles was addicted to heroin for much of his successful career.
Until we find the means or the will to keep illegal drugs off the streets, give them to those who are addicted. It will save many, many lives, and cost little.

Value of stay-at-home parents more than financial

Texto completo: As the U.S. Department of Labor styles it, Labor Day "constitutes a yearly national tribute to the contributions workers have made to the strength, prosperity, and well-being of our country." But there's one category of labor that tends to get overlooked -- the uncompensated labor of moms and dads whose primary occupation is child-rearing and managing their households.

As any stay-at-home parent will tell you, there's little down time. There's the obvious work of caring for a child, which is particularly intensive in the years before he or she starts school. But the job also typically requires maintaining a household, fulfilling a host of duties such as cleaning, shopping, meal prep and managing the family's finances and schedules. It's not uncommon, either, for stay-at-home parents to take on elder-care duties when relatives become infirm.

So how would an economist calculate the value of a stay-at-home parent? The most straightforward way would be to focus solely on the child-rearing element and use day-care costs as a proxy. After all, the other stuff stay-at-home parents do -- the cooking, cleaning and planning -- has to get done regardless of whether both parents work.

In Washington, D.C., for instance, infant care averages out to about $24,000 per year, according to the Economic Policy Institute, a progressive think tank. The average cost for a year of day care for a 4-year-old is about $19,122. Multiply those figures by the number of kids in the home and you get a pretty good sense of the economic value of stay-at-home parenting.

That kind of labor has been shrinking for years. In 1975, fewer than half of mothers were part of the paid workforce, according to the Department of Labor. By 2018, that number had jumped to 71.5 percent. Because about 80 percent of stay-at-home parents are mothers, their workforce-participation rate is a decent proxy for the decline of stay-at-home parenting. Last year, the Pew Research Center estimated that about 18 percent of American parents did not work outside the home.

Economic considerations apparently affect that tally. In 2018, the gap between the number of children women say they want and the number they actually have was at a 40-year high. When the New York Times subsequently surveyed Americans on their reasons for not having as many children as they wanted, financial concerns topped the list.

There's a fairly large body of research demonstrating the benefits for children who spend more quality time with their parents, especially for children in two-parent, middle-income households.

American moms' decades-long push into the labor force is also a reflection of the gains women have made in the workforce. They have career opportunities now that were previously closed off to them because of a combination of sexist attitudes and traditional notions about how families should be structured. But the gap between the number of children people are having and the number they want - with financial worries wedged in between - suggests another factor is at play: As wages stagnated in the second half of the 20th century, mothers who might have previously stayed home with their children opted to enter the workforce simply to make ends meet.

That's the thesis that undergirds "The Two-Income Trap," the 2003 book by Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. It's also where the traditional labor concerns of fair pay and an adequate safety net intersect with the choices families make around work and child care. Viewed through this lens, stay-at-home parenting has become rarer, in part, because wages haven't kept pace with the rising costs of raising a family.

In this way, the big labor objectives of the current moment, such as the fight for a higher minimum wage and the push for universal health care, can also be seen as a fight to give parents the financial leeway to spend more time with their children.

Texto completo: BEIJING -- The Chinese technology giant Huawei said on Tuesday, without providing evidence, that the United States government had pressured the company's employees to turn against it and had used cyberattacks to infiltrate the firm's computer systems in recent months.
The company, which makes smartphones and equipment for telecommunications networks, has been the focus of an intense legal and political campaign by the Trump administration, which says Huawei products could be used by the Chinese government for spying or sabotage.
But in a news release on Tuesday about an unrelated allegation of patent infringement, Huawei said that the United States had recently expanded its offensive against the company.
In the past several months, the company said, American authorities had masqueraded as Huawei workers to "establish legal pretense for unfounded accusations against the company," although it did not say what the accusations were.
The Huawei statement also said that F.B.I. agents had visited Huawei employees at their homes and had pressed them to collect information about the company, and that the United States had targeted the firm's internal systems with cyberattacks.
A company spokesman declined to elaborate on the accusations, which appeared as bullet points at the end of the news release.
Huawei has long denied that its gear is a security threat, but American officials have pressured allied governments to bar cellular carriers from using the company's equipment to build new networks. The United States arranged for the arrest last year of Huawei's chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, and has filed criminal charges against the company related to technology theft and violations of sanctions against Iran.
This year, the Commerce Department added the company to an export blacklist, restricting its ability to use American-made parts and technology, including Qualcomm microchips and Google smartphone software.
The department said last month, however, that Huawei would be allowed to continue working with American suppliers through November, a move meant to give rural telecom providers in the United States more time to replace the Huawei equipment in their networks.
The F.B.I. declined to comment on the Huawei accusations. But in the past, the United States has used secret cyberoperations to fish out information about the company.
Years before the Trump administration took on Huawei, the National Security Agency began a covert program against the firm, and by 2010, the agency had pried its way into Huawei servers in China, The New York Times reported in 2014.
The N.S.A. monitored top executives' communications and obtained information about the workings of the company's technology, The Times reported, citing agency documents provided by Edward J. Snowden, a former agency contractor.
The main purpose of Huawei's news release on Tuesday was to rebut allegations, reported earlier by The Wall Street Journal, that the company had stolen technology from Rui Oliveira, whom The Journal described as a Portuguese multimedia producer.
Huawei said in its statement that Mr. Oliveira had met with company representatives in 2014 to pitch his design for a smartphone camera. After deciding not to use the design, Huawei released an independently developed camera in 2017, the company said.
Then, last year, Mr. Oliveira accused Huawei of infringing on his patents in the United States, and threatened to air his claims in the news media unless the company paid him, Huawei said in the statement. The company filed a complaint against Mr. Oliveira in March, asking an American court to declare that it had not violated Mr. Oliveira's patents.
The Journal reported last week that American officials were looking into the matter. Mr. Oliveira could not be reached for comment.

Texto completo: Hours after the MTV Video Music Awards wrapped in Newark, New Jersey, an armada of black SUVs rolled into Manhattan to ring in the morning at various after-parties.
Two decades of tabloid fodder collided at the party for Columbia Records at Up & Down on West 14th Street, under a ceiling filled with silver balloons, like a fancy prom.
Miley Cyrus, who performed at the awards show, came with her father, Billy Ray Cyrus (who collaborated with Lil Nas X on the Song of the Year winner, "Old Town Road"), and Kaitlynn Carter. The tabloids have been awash in sightings of Carter and Cyrus, after her split with her husband, Liam Hemsworth.
Across the room was Carter's ex Brody Jenner, the Kardashian-adjacent reality star, who was there with his reported new girlfriend, Josie Canseco, daughter of a baseball great. Lil Nas X danced in the VIP area, wearing a leopard-print cowboy hat, while Diplo DJ-ed serenely from the booth.
Around 2 a.m., the Jenner-Canseco group decamped to Avenue in Chelsea for an after-party hosted by DJ Khaled. Guests were piled high on banquettes along the club's narrow wood-paneled interiors, like modern vignettes from Rembrandt's monumental group portraits.
DJ Khaled's heroic grouping included French Montana and 2 Chainz. Victor Cruz and ASAP Ferg mingled on the floor. Above the crowd, waiters lofted bottles of Dom P�rignon with glow-in-the-dark labels and fiery sparklers, as the DJ called out birthdays.
Outside, tensions mounted within the crowd lapping at the velvet rope. A young blond woman who was denied entry weepily threatened the doormen with "nay dad's lawyer."
Slick Woods, the model, posed for a selfie with a fan, who appeared to grope her. She slapped him hard across the face and said loudly, "It doesn't work like that!"
The doormen eyed etch other warily, then unlatched the rope. Better to have her inside the tent, perhaps.
Fuel for tennis
Plenty of dishes were served at the 20th annual Taste of Tennis event last Thursday, where tennis stars and celebrity chefs raised money for youth tennis programs in New York. But none involved an actual tennis ball.
"I've been hit with a tennis ball in the mouth," said Felix Auger Aliassime, the 19-year-old tennis prodigy from Montreal. "And it doesn't taste that good."
He was among the two dozen tennis players who took a break from their U.S. Open preparations to meet fans and sample food at Cipriani 42nd Street.
"Tennis tastes like lean, mean athletic food," said Richard Blais, the headlining chef, displaying the kind of on-message media training that is as sharply honed as his knives.
A former winner of "Top Chef All Stars," Blais emceed a cook-off between Venus Williams and Serena Williams, who were given 15 minutes to do what they could with zucchini noodles, riced cauliflower and a vegan egg. The contest was judged by their sister, Isha Price, who diplomatically declared it a draw.
The Williams sisters were joined in the packed room by John Isner, Coco Gauff, Ga�l Monfils, Daniil Medvedev, Donna Vekic and Bethanie Mattek Sands. Andy Roddick had a more food-friendly waistline now that he is seven years into retirement.
Seventeen chefs, including Masaharu Morimoto of Morimoto, Anastacia Song of American Cut, and John Stage of Dinosaur Bar-B-Que, served bite-size dishes including pulled pork tacos, macaroni and cheese balls, bacon skewers and caviar on blinis.
Marc Murphy, the restaurateur behind the now-shuttered Landmarc and Ditch Plains, said that what tennis players had in common with chefs was, "they're nice people and we're nice people."
"It's the passion that comes out," he added.
Mike Tyson, the retired boxing champion and father of Milan Tyson, a young tennis fanatic, had a different theory. "They're megalomaniacs," he said.

Texto completo: Raise your hand if you’re interested in hearing more about aging sex workers and ridiculous campaign finance laws.
The Washington Post reported Monday night that Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee “plan to make President Trump’s alleged involvement in a 2016 scheme to silence two women who claimed they had affairs with him a major investigative focus this fall." The paper also said that they’re “preparing to hold hearings and call witnesses involved in hush-money payments to ex-Playboy model Karen McDougal and adult-film star Stormy Daniels as soon as October.”
The news must have given your sagging post-Labor Day spirit just the boost it needed.
This is what Democrats do nowadays. They put all their faith in the chase of some empty wish, and when it turns up empty, they whine that something went wrong.
After special counsel Robert Mueller wrapped up his exhaustive Russia probe without finding any proof of collusion with Russia, Democrats whined that Mueller’s hands were tied.
After extensive reporting on Trump’s personal tax information by both the New York Times and MSNBC's Rachel Maddow revealed old and innocuous returns, Democrats demanded six additional years of Trump’s private tax returns.
And now, more than a month after prosecutors ended their investigation of a weak campaign finance allegation against the Trump campaign — it resulted only in a laughable guilty plea from Trump’s former lawyer Michael Cohen for something that wasn't even illegal — Democrats think holding a bunch of hearings can further fan their impeachment dreams that, to date, have not gone anywhere.
“Democrats,” according to the Washington Post report, “say they believe there is already enough evidence to name Trump as a co-conspirator in the episode that resulted in his former attorney, Michael Cohen, pleading guilty to two campaign finance charges. … The hush-money inquiry will open a new chapter in the House’s months-long consideration of whether to draft articles of impeachment against the president.”
The story is full of quotes by Democrats and lawyers pondering the great mystery of why Cohen, now serving a three-year prison sentence, was hit with the campaign charge but no one else was. The paper quotes one former Federal Election Commission official glibly wondering, “Why aren’t the people who authorized and paid for this culpable?”
The answer lies in the fact that Cohen wasn't really pleading guilty to campaign violations in anything but the most literal sense. He had been charged with evading $1.4 million in taxes, defrauding financial institutions that loaned him money, and lying to the FBI and Congress. The two campaign finance violations seem to have been thrown in by prosecutors who knew Cohen had already been buried under such a mountain of serious charges that he'd have to make a plea deal. The lesser charges gave them more flexibility about how much time he'd get.
The Post’s own story from the time refers to that pile of misdeeds only once and they're dismissed as simply “other crimes."
Trump and his lawyers have maintained no wrongdoing on their part, admitting that Trump paid the settlements to both Daniels and McDougal, while also denying that there were ever any affairs or that the payments had anything to do with the 2016 election.
A person might cover up an alleged affair for any number of reasons, including to avoid national embarrassment or harm to the reputations or even the feelings of family members. (Former North Carolina Democratic Sen. John Edwards successfully used this defense after he was caught using undisclosed donations to conceal his own affair and out-of-wedlock child from his wife.) According to McDougal, Trump had been hiding their supposed affair as far back as 2006, a decade before the settlement money was paid in 2016. “No paper trails for him,” she told Ronan Farrow last year. “In fact, every time I flew to meet him, I booked/paid for flight + hotel + he reimbursed me.”
If Trump was hiding the affair then, where’s the proof that he decided to continue hiding it solely or even mainly for the purpose of the 2016 election?
Democrats probably know that. But they have another ghost to chase.

Super Pac American Bridge states “there is a strong possibility,” that Michael Cohen, Trump, and the president’s campaign committee “violated federal law by conspiring to violate federal campaign finance law and directly violating the contribution limit restrictions and the reporting requirements,” with Cohen's $150,000 payment to Stormy Daniels.

Boris Johnson loses Brexit vote, as lawmakers rebel from Conservative Party

Texto completo: London • British lawmakers on Tuesday rose up against Prime Minister Boris Johnson, moving to prevent him from taking the country out of the European Union without a formal agreement, and precipitating an epic showdown that could provoke a snap general election.
The lawmakers voted to take control of Parliament away from the government, giving themselves the authority to pass legislation that would stop the prime minister from his threat of a no-deal Brexit.
It was a critical moment in Britain’s tortured, three-year effort to extract itself from the European Union. The saga has divided Britons, torn apart the ruling Conservative Party and prompted complaints that Johnson has trampled the conventions of the country’s unwritten constitution.
A majority of lawmakers are determined to block leaving the European Union without a deal, which they believe would be disastrous for the country’s economy. Tuesday’s vote suggested they have the numbers to succeed.
Johnson’s aides had made it clear that, in the event of a defeat on Tuesday, he would seek a general election on Oct. 14. — just a little more than two weeks until the Brexit deadline of Oct. 31 — though Parliament would have to agree to that.
The accelerating pace of events suggests that Britain’s Brexit nightmare may finally be approaching an endgame after years of paralysis.
Tuesday’s vote also marked the moment when Johnson’s hardball tactics, for once, were met with equal resistance.
On a day of high drama, Johnson lost his working majority in Parliament even before the vote took place, when one Conservative rebel, Phillip Lee, quit the party to join the Liberal Democrats, who have managed to stage a resurgence by positioning themselves as an unambiguously anti-Brexit party.
The practical effect of Lee’s defection for Johnson was limited, however, because the government would fall only if it were defeated in a confidence motion.
But in a symbolic moment, Lee walked across the floor of the House of Commons and sat beside Jo Swinson, the leader of the Liberal Democrats, as Johnson was speaking about the recent summit of the Group of 7 leaders. Lee accused Johnson of pursuing a damaging withdrawal from the European Union in unprincipled ways, and of “putting lives and livelihoods at risk.”
Lee’s departure from the Tories may not be the last; Johnson has promised to expel any Conservative lawmaker who voted against him on Tuesday. That could threaten his ability to manage day-to-day business in Parliament, underscoring the need for a new election.
The extent of the Tory civil war was on full display as several of Johnson’s Conservative critics, including the former chancellor of the Exchequer, Philip Hammond, lobbed hostile questions at him, making it plain that they had not been brought back into line by threats of expulsion from the party.
Opponents of a no-deal Brexit argue that Johnson’s promise to leave the bloc without a deal, if necessary, would be catastrophic for the British economy. Many experts say it could lead to shortages of food, fuel and medicine, and wreak havoc on parts of the manufacturing sector that rely on the seamless flow of goods across the English Channel. Leaked government reports paint a bleak picture of what it might look like.
Johnson says he needs to keep the no-deal option on the table to give him leverage in talks in Brussels, because an abrupt exit would also damage continental economies, if not as much as Britain’s. The prime minister appealed to his own lawmakers not to support what he called “Jeremy Corbyn’s surrender bill,” a reference to the leader of the opposition Labour Party.
“It means running up the white flag,” he said.
Johnson also claimed to have made progress in talks with European Union leaders, although his own Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay, on Monday gave a much less rosy assessment of the state of negotiations.
Britain’s main demand is for the European Union to ditch the so-called Irish backstop, a guarantee that the bloc insists it needs to ensure that goods flow smoothly across the Irish border whatever happens in trade negotiations with Britain. Johnson said he planned to visit Dublin next week for talks with his Irish counterpart, Leo Varadkar.
Conservative rebels believe Johnson is more interested in uniting Brexit supporters behind him before a general election than in securing an agreement in Brussels.
One former chancellor of the Exchequer, Kenneth Clarke, accused Johnson of setting impossible conditions for the negotiations, attaching as much blame as possible to the European Union for the failure to get a deal and then seeking to hold a “flag-waving election” before the disadvantages of leaving without an agreement become apparent.
The bitter dispute has taken Britain into new political territory. Last week Johnson provoked outrage by curtailing Parliament’s sessions in September and October, compacting the amount of time lawmakers would have to deal with the most crucial decision the country has faced in decades.
Johnson’s allies argue that it is the rebels who are subverting the principles of Britain’s unwritten constitution by seizing control of the proceedings of Parliament that are normally the preserve of the government.
The European Commission said Tuesday that while the frequency of meetings between its Brexit team and the British negotiator, David Frost, had increased, little headway had been made toward avoiding a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland.
Asked whether the British government was using reports of its talks with the commission for political purposes at home, the commission’s spokeswoman, Mina Andreeva, said that the body was “an honest broker as always.” She said she could not “report any concrete proposals having being made that we have seen.”
Hammond, a senior member of the Cabinet two months ago, told the BBC on Tuesday that Johnson’s claim of progress on the negotiations was “disingenuous.”
To add to the turmoil and confusion, the opposition Labour Party suggested it might thwart Johnson’s attempt to push for a general election, should it come to that. Under a 2011 law, the prime minister needs a two-thirds majority to secure a snap election, although it is possible that the government might try to legislate to set that provision aside, a move that would mean it needs only a simply majority.
There is so little trust in British politics that Johnson’s opponents fear that he might request an election for Oct. 14 but then switch the date until after Oct. 31 as part of a move to lock in a no-deal withdrawal.
Labour has said that its priority is to stop Britain leaving the European Union without a deal because of concerns about what such a departure would mean for the economy.
But Labour’s stance underscores that the backdrop to everything in British politics is a sense that a general election is looming, with key players maneuvering for the most advantageous moment.

End the Media's Campaign Privilege; As journalism blurs into partisan politics, the rules governing the latter are becoming unjustifiable.

Texto completo: The Trump era has seen an erosion of the distinction between journalism and partisan politics, with much of the mainstream media in open opposition to the president. "Balance has been on vacation since Mr. Trump stepped onto his golden Trump Tower escalator . . . to announce his candidacy," New York Times columnist Jim Rutenberg wrote in August 2016.
Three years later, the holiday continues. Slate last month published a leaked transcript of a staff "town hall" at the Times. "We built our newsroom to cover one story," executive editor Dean Baquet told employees, explaining that the paper's narrative "went from being a story about whether the Trump campaign had colluded with Russia and obstruction of justice to being a more head-on story about the president's character." The new story, he said, "requires deep investigation into people who peddle hatred."
Mr. Baquet makes the Times sound like an advocacy organization working against Mr. Trump's re-election. Such organizations are regulated by campaign-finance statutes. So are other corporations, for-profit or nonprofit, that engage in electioneering speech. But those laws exempt media organizations, provided they are not owned by a political party, committee or candidate.
The justification for this favored treatment is the media's "unique" role in public discourse and debate. But that has changed—and not only because the media have become more partisan. "With the advent of the Internet and the decline of print and broadcast media," the Supreme Court observed in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission (2010), "the line between the media and others who wish to comment on political and social issues becomes far more blurred."
Like the prerevolutionary French aristocracy, media institutions enjoy legal privileges whose rationale expired long ago. As a result, their exemption from campaign-finance law is vulnerable to constitutional challenge. "We have consistently rejected the proposition that the institutional press has any constitutional privilege beyond that of other speakers," the Citizens United court declared.
The justices also indicated that a statutory privilege would be difficult to uphold. "The Government may commit a constitutional wrong when by law it identifies certain preferred speakers," they wrote. "The First Amendment protects speech and speaker, and the ideas that flow from each."
The court could resolve the problem by declaring the exemption unconstitutional and applying campaign-finance laws to media organizations. But that would make journalism untenable.
Consider the ban on "coordinated communications." Under current law, corporations and other independent organizations have the right to speak for or against a candidate, but they are forbidden to develop messages "in cooperation, consultation or concert with, or at the request or suggestion of, a candidate, a candidate's authorized committee, or their agents, or a political party committee or its agents."
After the Times town-hall transcript was published last month, lawyer and author James Hasson noted that, in emails stolen from the Democratic National Committee in 2016, "major journalists were revealed to be explicitly coordinating with the [Hillary] Clinton campaign." Among them was a Times writer who "told HRC aide Jennifer Palmieri she could 'veto whatever [she] didn't want,' " then "cut parts she objected to" from a story about Mrs. Clinton. A Politico reporter sent the DNC an entire story before publication.
News executives would argue that it is their role, not the government's, to police such ethical transgressions. They'd be right. But the rule against coordinated communication would prohibit a vast amount of ordinary journalistic behavior, too—from interviewing candidates and campaign staffers to editing and publishing opinion articles under their bylines.
Moreover, any justification for that rule—such as the fear of promoting corruption—is equally applicable to media and nonmedia speakers, and becomes very weak when pure speech, such as news and commentary, is the issue.
The justices could protect everyone's right to speak and gather news by declaring the coordination rule unconstitutional as applied against anyone, as they invalidated the rule against independent corporate campaign expenditures in Citizens United. Most newspapers—The Wall Street Journal is a notable exception—editorialized in bitter opposition to that ruling. They may end up grateful they didn't get what they wished for.

Texto completo: Panicked travelers abandoned carry-on bags and scrambled for the exits at a Newark Liberty International Airport terminal on Monday night, just as the busy three-day Labor Day weekend was drawing to a close.
An Alaska Airlines employee at Gate 30 in Terminal A grew suspicious of two male passengers as they were about to board a flight, according to Steve Coleman, a spokesman for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which runs the airport.
The airline employee tried to confront the men and then pulled a fire alarm, which led to the evacuation around 8:30 p.m., the authorities said. It was not immediately clear what had prompted the flight attendant to be suspicious of the men, who were later questioned by the police and then allowed to board.
A spokeswoman for Alaska Airlines, Oriana Branon, said the carrier was still gathering information about the episode.
"Alaska Airlines is aware of an incident that occurred today at EWR," Ms. Branon said in an email. "We are currently investigating and will provide additional details as we find out more."
The authorities were also questioning the airline employee who had prompted the evacuation.
Police officers with tactical rifles converged on the terminal, with some travelers seeking refuge on the airport tarmac.
The airport returned to normal operations just before 9 p.m., with shaken airline passengers returning to personal items strewn all over the gate area in Terminal A after the latest episode to unnerve people in public settings.
David Lombardi, 30, a sportswriter for The Athletic website, said in an interview that he had been waiting for a flight to San Francisco at Terminal A when he heard an Alaska Airlines flight attendant yell "evacuate."
"I dove on the ground," Mr. Lombardi said. "I thought it was an active shooter. I went under the seats at the airport. There were people sprinting out of the terminal. We live in a world where people think there's an active shooter everywhere."
An hour after the scare, he returned to try to find his luggage.
"There are bags and belongings scattered everywhere," he said.
The scare came in the wake of mass shootings in August in Odessa, Tex.; Dayton, Ohio; and El Paso that have unnerved the public.
And it came on the same day that the annual Labor Day parade in South Plainfield, N.J., which is about 20 miles from the airport, was abruptly canceled after the police found explosive devices at a home near the parade route, the authorities said.
On Aug. 22, both the upper and lower levels of the George Washington Bridge were temporarily closed to traffic after a suspicious package was discovered on the span. It turned out to be an empty cylinder.
David Gelles, a business reporter for The New York Times, was a passenger on an American Airlines flight that had just arrived at Newark's Terminal A from Chicago when the scare happened.
The pilot told passengers there was police activity, according to Mr. Gelles, who said his flight was parked at the gate for about an hour. When passengers were finally allowed to leave the plane, Mr. Gelles said, about two dozen Port Authority officers and New York Police Department counterterrorism officers in tactical gear were waiting at the gate.
In a Twitter direct message, Erin Fors, a public relations executive with Cutline Communications who was at the airport during the scare, said chaos had spread quickly.
"As we were starting to board, a flight attendant on my flight exited the plane, talked to the gate agents, became clearly agitated and started screaming 'evacuate,"' Ms. Fors said. "People ran, hid, screamed. Everything you would do when you hear 'evacuate' in an airport. Many people exited to the tarmac. Police and SWAT arrived. They ushered us in once clear. Nobody said what happened though there was speculation that someone was in custody. It was frankly terrifying."

Racist and Anti-Semitic Graffiti Shocks an Idyllic Private Beach Club in Queens

Texto completo: On the Friday evening before the final big weekend of summer, members of one of New York's last private beach clubs, the Silver Gull in Queens, received an ominous email.
The club's playground would be closed, the manager wrote, "due to the recent and increasing incidence of vandalism from within the club."
Word soon spread that the playground had been covered with racist and anti-Semitic graffiti. "Heil Hitler" was scrawled in large block letters. White walls were smeared with a red swastika and racial slurs targeting black people. The words "gas chamber" were painted on a door, according to photos shared with The New York Times.
The graffiti at the club, which sits on federal seashore, was quickly painted over by the management, according to a club member, and the police were called.
Sgt. Richard Firrito, a spokesman for the United States Park Police in New York, said the incident was being investigated as a bias crime.
Investigators believe a group broke into a shed that the club uses for arts programs on Friday and vandalized the interior. The vandals then proceeded to "trash the room," Sergeant Firrito said. He first said the incident appeared to have happened after the beach club had closed for the day, but later clarified that it apparently had occurred during opening hours.
Harold Bretstein, a son of Holocaust survivors who has been a member of the oceanfront club for about 20 years, said the incident hurt.
"You can gloss it over. You can talk about it being a prank," Mr. Bretstein said. "But it's much more than a prank, especially in terms of the times we're living in when you're seeing a rise in anti-Semitism everywhere."
The graffiti comes as New York continues to struggle with a recent uptick in reported hate crimes, fueled in part by anti-Semitic attacks. Reports of anti-Semitic hate crimes rose to 145, up from 88, through Aug. 25 as compared with the same period last year, police data show.
Families found anti-Semitic graffiti on a playground in Brighton Beach, Brooklyn, earlier this year, and swastikas were discovered in a Brooklyn Heights playground last fall.
The Silver Gull has been an institution since it opened in the 1960s, and has remained proudly unhip and family-friendly even as the surrounding strip has become a magnet for young visitors who snap up the chocolate-dipped Popsicles on offer at neighboring Jacob Riis Park.
The club sits next to Breezy Point, a predominantly white gated community at the western end of the Rockaway Peninsula. The Silver Gull was severely damaged during Hurricane Sandy. But the club rebounded and is seen as an oasis, particularly for middle-class white families from Brooklyn and Queens who proudly decorate cabanas that cost about $ 5,000 for the summer season and pass them down to their children.
Some members of the club said they were frustrated that the manager had not condemned the graffiti, especially given the number of young children at the club. Others took to Facebook to express deep concern about the incident.
Michelle Freedman, who lives in Downtown Brooklyn and has spent eight summers at the Silver Gull, said the fact that the club had only sent a terse email to members about the incident was "inexcusable."
Ms. Freedman, whose mother survived the Holocaust, said she was "hurt, angry and scared."
"We cannot sweep this under the rug, we have to acknowledge when these things happen and all the members of the club need to know the club doesn't tolerate racism or anti-Semitism," she added.
The club's general manager, Jamie Blatman, would not answer questions and instead referred a reporter to the police. "We have no comment because there's an ongoing investigation," Mr. Blatman said on Sunday.
Mike Eichenwald, who has been a member for four years, said he was hoping for a strong statement from the Silver Gull.
"Unfortunately, we know that things like this can happen anywhere," Mr. Eichenwald, who has served on the faculty of a fellowship program on ethics based in part at Auschwitz, wrote in an email.
"The question is, how are you going to respond? Are you going to take a stand, articulate your values and bring people together? Or are you going to cover it up, pretend it's of little consequence and look the other way?"

Texto completo: We’re officially in countdown mode for the 2019 Texas Book Festival! Oct. 26-27 will be here before we know it. To prepare, I’m sharing books by some of last year’s festival authors that are now out in paperback. Part of what I love most about the festival is the opportunity for discovery. New books, new authors: We have both in abundance! This month’s picks are an example of just how much there is to discover at the Texas Book Festival. You never know when you’ll bump into your next favorite author. Two more months, y’all!
“Heartland: A Memoir of Working Hard and Being Broke in the Richest Country on Earth” by Sarah Smarsh
One of the big conversations we had in our C-Span2/”Book TV” Tent last year was with Sarah Smarsh and Alissa Quart (author of “Squeezed”), who talked about the pressures faced by the working and middle class in America. Smarsh’s acclaimed book “Heartland” was a finalist for the National Book Award and the Kirkus Prize last year. In it, she tells her story of being raised a fifth-generation Kansan and her experiences on the frontlines of American families struggling to cover their costs and make it work. Poverty is an issue that affects all of us, and Smarsh’s brilliant, personal examination of its circumstances is a necessary and eye-opening read. “A Place for Us” by Fatima Farheen Mirza
We were thrilled to host Fatima Farheen Mirza in the House Chamber of the Capitol with Celeste Ng (author of “Little Fires Everywhere”) last year. They talked about writing big fiction full of family secrets. Mirza’s debut, “A Place for Us,” was a smashing success last year, hand-selected by Sarah Jessica Parker for her brand-new imprint. If you love sweeping,
multigenerational stories of families with complex relationships and complicated histories, definitely pick up this book. It begins with an Indian wedding, described in lush and lavish detail, and takes readers back to the family’s beginning, through betrayals and assimilations, sibling tensions and merging cultures.
“Heavy: An American Memoir” by Kiese Laymon
“Heavy” is one of the most moving books I’ve ever read. Named a best book of 2018 by several critics and outlets, including The New York Times, Southern Living and Entertainment Weekly, “Heavy” is a lyrical and deeply personal memoir about growing up as a black boy in Mississippi. Laymon’s intense bond with his complicated mother, his relationship with his own body and his world of books and writing all forge the origin of a brilliant, insightful writer. The language in this book is simply beautiful, and Laymon’s telling of his life so tender and honest, you can’t help but come away changed by its telling.
“When Katie Met Cassidy” by Camille Perri
This book is so much fun! Camille Perri writes the best rom-coms. Katie Daniels is nursing a broken heart when she moves from Kentucky to the Big Apple, where she meets Cassidy Price, a confident woman who knows what she wants — and what she wants is Katie. This story moves through fun, panoramic views of New York City and the relationship between these women as Katie discovers herself and they both consider what it is they actually want. It’s full of heart, chemistry and humor, just like the conversation Perri had with Miriam Parker (author of “The Shortest Way Home,” another great pick) about finding the funny in fiction.
“Brass” by Xhenet Aliu
Xhenet Aliu’s debut novel is one of the stories that grabbed me out of nowhere when it landed on my desk last year. Three generations of mother-daughter relationships in a family of Lithuanian immigrants are cast against the backdrop of working-class Waterbury, Conn. Gritty and electric, the novel moves between perspectives as it lays out all of the ways in which we inherit our circumstances, from blood and class to geography and, of course, our mothers.

Texto completo: JUST A SCRATCH
When New York Times columnist Bret Stephens woke up one morning from unsettling dreams, he found himself transformed in his bed to a monstrous vermin. Actually, that might be overstating things. Turns out some professor just made a funny on Twitter calling Stephens a bedbug (context: the Times has bedbugs) and the latter lost his mind over it and tried to get the poor guy fired by tattling to his provost. (I'm guessing he had to look up the definition of “tenure" shortly afterward.). Anyways, I still like Kafka's dystopia better.
TAUPE OFFICE
It was five whole years ago this week that American politics and democracy as we know it took a sharp turn into — the men's dressing room at Sears? Ahh yes, Obama's infamous Tan Suit. Twitter marveled at just how far we've come/plummeted since the days when glaringly and objectively unflattering menswear was not just uncommon in the Oval Office, but qualified as a genuine scandal. It all seems so quaint in the era of the spray tan and 10-foot necktie.
SPILL IT
Musician Jason Isbell is back on the meme charts once again with a follow-up to his 30-50 feral hog-ride to Twitter superstardom, this time asking people to name the worst thing they've ever spilled in their car. (His: “a full pint of baked beans.") Other epic oopses included bleach, squid juice, sauerkraut, worms, and a molten sex toy (hot trunk) that had to be “frantically" scraped out. For me, it'd have to be my crush on our school's offensive lineman during junior year. (I really thought we were vibing!) Then he spilled his Frosty. Huge mess.
BAD TASTE
And lastly this week, welcome to the international meme stage Kombucha Girl, a.k.a. Twitter @Brittany_broski, whose enthralling odyssey of facial expressions upon taking her first sips of some funky kombucha went viral on TikTok, instantly translating to the perfect visual expression of animated ambivalence and launching her to instant icon status (right up there with Baby Trying Soda For The First Time) — and also condemning herself to a foreseeable future of constantly having to pretend to be trying kombucha for the entertainment of strangers begging for selfies. The takeaway? I'm fine with my Snapple, thanks.

Texto completo: What's on TV
HORRIBLE BOSSES (2011) 8 p.m. on TNT. In the spirit of Labor Day, revisit this outrageous black comedy about three friends who, despite working hard, are repeatedly tormented by their bosses. Their simmering grievances reach a boiling point when the buddies -- Nick (Jason Bateman), Dale (Charlie Day) and Kurt (Jason Sudeikis) -- decide to put an end to their misery by killing their higher-ups (played by Jennifer Aniston, Kevin Spacey and Colin Farrell). Their scheme quickly falls off the rails, because, well, they're not experienced killers. And the "murder consultant" (Jamie Foxx) they turn to isn't much help either. Watch with a grain of salt: In his review, the New York Times critic A.O. Scott wrote that while the movie's humor "flirts with racism, goes steady with misogyny and pretty much marries homophobia," it also draws plenty of laughs. The less successful sequel, which brings on Chris Pine, Christoph Waltz and Jonathan Banks, follows at 10 p.m.
What's Streaming
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
JUNO (2007) Stream on Hulu; rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu or YouTube. Few movies have treated teenage pregnancy as delicately, intelligently and humorously as this coming-of-age dramedy. Ellen Page stars as the title character, a snarky 16-year-old from the suburbs who loses her virginity to her soft-spoken friend Paulie (a lovable Michael Cera) and becomes pregnant. After considering abortion, Juno decides to give her baby up for adoption and chooses a seemingly perfect couple (Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner) to raise her newborn. As the months pass, Juno's life only grows more complicated, challenging her to reconsider her thoughts on relationships and family. Page puts on a stellar performance, and the low-key, indie soundtrack (which introduced the singer-songwriter Kimya Dawson to a wider audience) is one for the ages.
CHUGGINGTON Stream on Hulu. Parents: Your little ones may learn some simple life lessons -- say, the importance of cooperation or respect -- with the help of this cartoon about three little "trainees," Brewster, Wilson and Koko, who are trying to navigate the rails of Chuggington. For those who don't have a Hulu subscription, several full episodes are available on YouTube for free.
THE FIFTH ELEMENT (1997) Stream on Amazon or Hulu; Rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes or YouTube. Gary Oldman, who plays the villainous Zorg in this sci-fi romp, purportedly described it as "Star Wars" on acid. Set in the 23rd century, the movie follows a mission to save the Earth from pure evil, which is hurtling toward the planet in the form of a fiery ball. The task is up to Leeloo (Milla Jovovich), a genetically engineered woman with flame-colored hair, and Korben (Bruce Willis), a former soldier turned space cabdriver. The film polarized critics -- the plot is hard to follow and undeniably cheesy -- but some argue it left an indelible mark on the genre. All in all, its inventive scenery and over-the-top visuals make it worth watching.

Texto completo: In the opening minutes of the 1993 movie "The Firm," an in-demand Harvard Law School graduate named Mitch McDeere takes meetings with one legal firm after another, each offering him a different vision for his future. Does he want to be a judge someday? Would he like to have a lighter workload so he can start a family? Does the California lifestyle sound appealing? How about Wall Street?
Mitch (played with no small amount of "Top Gun" swagger by Tom Cruise) ends up choosing the under-the-radar firm Bendini, Lambert & Locke, in Memphis. He's impressed by its down-home charm and likes that it is off the beaten path. New York? D.C.? That's been done. Time to give Tennessee a try.
In a way, Mitch was a lot like America as a whole, circa 1993, when the "New South" was on the rise. I was living in my hometown, Nashville, Tenn., at the time, and I had just graduated from the University of Georgia. I was tracking all the little victories for my region -- just as I was counting all the division titles for my beloved Atlanta Braves.
In 1993, the country had just put the former Arkansas governor Bill Clinton in the White House, with the former Tennessee senator Al Gore as his vice president. The Atlanta hip-hop acts TLC, Kriss Kross and Arrested Development were all over the Billboard charts. The sitcom "Designing Women," set in Georgia, was a staple in the Nielsen Top 10. And masses of readers were buying the legal thrillers written by the Mississippi lawyer John Grisham.
The summer of 1993 was a particularly good time for Grisham. His fourth book, "The Client," was still sitting high on the New York Times best-seller list, three months after reaching No. 1. And on the Wednesday before the Fourth of July, the movie adaptation of Grisham's "The Firm" opened in multiplexes across the country, on its way to becoming the summer's third biggest domestic box-office earner, right behind "Jurassic Park" and "The Fugitive."
These days, it's hard to imagine that a legal thriller -- even one led by a reliable draw like Cruise -- could become a summer blockbuster. "The Firm" wasn't a surprise hit, either. Paramount expected it to be a smash; that's why it had the coveted holiday weekend release. That's what a phenomenon Grisham was at the time.
"The Firm" wasn't Grisham's first novel. But it was the first to break big, and the film remains the best cinematic adaptation of a Grisham novel. Four other adaptations also hit the big screen during Clinton's first term: "The Pelican Brief," also released in 1993; "The Client," from 1994; and "A Time to Kill" and "The Chamber," both from 1996. Three of those -- "The Firm," "The Pelican Brief" and "A Time to Kill" -- opened in the top spot at the domestic box office. Set mostly in Tennessee, Arkansas, Louisiana and Mississippi, all five examine to some degree what had and hadn't changed in the south since the Jim Crow days.
The movie versions of Grisham's stories take their lead from the author's obvious outrage at the South's persistent racial and class divisions. His heroes tend to be young men who grew up poor and had to work multiple jobs to put themselves through law school. Their sympathies lie with the underdogs -- most famously in "A Time to Kill," in which a struggling lawyer defends a black man for killing the racists who raped and beat his 10-year-old daughter. The political and judicial systems depicted in Grisham novels and films were biased against people of color and anyone who struggled to pay the bills.
Judging by his books (and their movie adaptations), Grisham -- like Clinton and Gore -- seemed to believe in a newer, more middle-of-the-road kind of Southern leadership, which balanced progressive attitudes about social justice with more regressive ideas about reducing crime and maintaining order. The most telling moment in any Grisham movie comes in "A Time to Kill," when a scrappy attorney played by Matthew McConaughey sits in a soul food restaurant and explains to a crusading liberal played by Sandra Bullock that while he leans left, he's "not a card-carrying A.C.L.U. radical." Among other things, he believes homicide can be justified.
I've lived my whole life in the South: born in Atlanta, raised in Nashville, moved to Central Arkansas in 1999. I've seen common character in southern politicians and social activists. They're a lot like SEC football coaches: stubbornly self-assured, charmingly folksy and beholden to the demands of their wealthy boosters. The good ol' boy network connects to powerful people on both the left and the right; and sometimes the obligations to donors supersedes ideals.
Grisham himself served in the Mississippi House of Representatives -- as a Democrat -- from 1984 to 1990. He gave up politics shortly before "The Firm" was published in 1991, and the law not long after. Grisham's disillusionment with those professions suffuses both his books and their movie adaptations. It is evident in "The Pelican Brief," in which a presidential administration is complicit in a scheme to stack the Supreme Court with justices who will let a well-heeled donor drill for oil in protected Louisiana marshlands. It's obvious, too, in "The Client," in which the F.B.I. and an ambitious United States attorney callously try to destroy the life of the preteen witness of a capital crime.
"The Firm" is about the temptations of power and the appeal of southern living. Mitch is seduced by the sense of old-fashioned brotherhood he finds at Bendini, Lambert & Locke. His new employers pay him more money than anyone else is offering -- in a city with a relatively low cost of living. He is drawn to a place where folks serve barbecued ribs at formal meetings, and where he gets to show off what a down-to-earth, soulful dude he is by doing back flips down Beale Street alongside a young black street performer.
So, sure ... it takes Mitch a while to realize that he is actually working for crooks who launder money for the mob and have whistle-blowers killed.
As a group, the films form an enlightening snapshot of Clinton-era America, documenting what ordinary citizens were worried about at the time -- including the corporate pillaging of the environment ("The Pelican Brief") and the threat of insurgent armed militias ("A Time to Kill") -- while also asking whether dedicated young professionals from below the Mason-Dixon line could save the day.
"The Firm" is more about the finer points of tax law and the perniciousness of organized crime than it is about the particular ways the wealthy exploited political divisions and stymied the working class in the early 1990s. But "The Firm" does represent the purest expression of the common Grisham character arc, wherein well-meaning men or women with troubled pasts turn to the law for redemption. Invariably, they are disappointed to find they have to rely on truth bending and dirty tricks to make the system work the way it should.
Intentionally or not, "The Firm" today doesn't look only like the story of a frustrated idealist. It's more a cautionary tale, aimed at anyone who strides optimistically into a new era -- with new leaders -- expecting big changes. All too often, the same old favor-trading and compromises prevail."
That's why "The Firm" still resonates: In addition to recalling a bygone era, when a mature mid-budget mystery movie could anchor a Hollywood studio's summer schedule, it remains astute about the way it feels when hope gives way to exhaustion. The movie begins with exuberant back flips down Beale Street. But in the end, the hero can only pore over paperwork, looking desperately for loopholes.

Texto completo: At a Starbucks in Pomona a month ago, the newspaper rack just inside the door had disappeared. Copies of the New York Times were on a bar by the counter, a placement that looked unlikely to last long. The other newspapers weren’t present at all.
The barista didn’t know what it was all about. As I’m in the gloom business, I had a pretty good guess.
This was borne out when I found the rack gone at a second Starbucks in Claremont. That barista said the chain would no longer be selling the New York Times, Los Angeles Times, USA Today and Wall Street Journal. All that location had left was the New York Times, left on the counter.
A stack, not a rack.
“They did sell,” the barista told me of the newspapers. “Customers are, ‘nooooo!’”
The New York Post, it turned out, broke the story in July. Starbucks, which had been selling the N.Y. Times since 2000 and other papers since 2010, would stop selling newspapers at its 8,600 U.S. stores Sept. 1 due to “changing customer behavior.”
I have to be honest: I never bought a newspaper at Starbucks. I also never swiped a newspaper from Starbucks. Many customers did, treating papers as if they were free and leaving them behind on communal tables. Since people think news on the internet should be free, they must think that also applies to newspapers.
What I would do was pause at the rack, peer at the front page of the N.Y. Times and maybe read a few paragraphs. My philosophy was that page one was fair game. Opening the paper would be getting into “Hey, kid, this ain’t a library” territory.
Starbucks was probably the most visible retailer to carry newspapers, so even if I didn’t buy papers there, I hated to see them on the way out. And it’s a maxim that things (and people) can become more desirable if they’re unattainable.
And so, with newspapers leaving Starbucks, suddenly I was pining for a N.Y. Times.
My hope had been to buy a Times at Starbucks on one of the last Sundays and wade into its glory, section after section after section. But I ran out of time for the Times. Last Sunday morning at a Pomona Starbucks, I was only able to read my own two home-delivered dailies before needing to be somewhere, so I didn’t buy one of the two Times copies on the counter.
In Chino Hills that afternoon, a friend and I stopped at a Starbucks. (Breaking: Starbucks is everywhere.) The newspaper rack was empty except for two lonely copies of the Orange County Register at the bottom. I mentioned that Starbucks wouldn’t be selling newspapers anymore.
“That’s a harbinger of the future,” said my friend, who writes for a newspaper, and who had the demeanor of someone who’s just seen the Angel of Death drift past, chuckling.
I hit up two Starbucks later that day. The one in Pomona had sold out (or thrown its copies away). One in Claremont didn’t think it had received any.
“It’s the end of an era,” one barista said. Her co-worker added: “It’s so sad!”
So there went my plan to buy a Sunday N.Y. Times at a Starbucks. My new plan was to buy a weekday N.Y. Times at a Starbucks. But there were none to be had. Newspaper sales apparently stopped a week early.
My final plan was to buy a N.Y. Times somewhere else, take it to Starbucks and read it. Give me this: Once I get an idea into my head, I will stubbornly see it through.
Finding a copy of the N.Y. Times was easier said than done. This despite what a Times spokeswoman had told the Post: “Although disappointed by the decision, we’re confident that given our wide retail distribution, readers will have no trouble finding The New York Times for sale at nearby outlets.”
Claremont, the college town where I live, seemed the likeliest bet for the Gray Lady. Downtown used to have two Times racks, one outside the Post Office, one outside Walter’s, but both are gone.
The Village Market sells only the Daily Bulletin, for which I commend them, and the Claremont Courier. Pomona College has a couple of spots where the NYT is available for free, meant for students, but classes haven’t resumed yet and neither has delivery. The college bookstore doesn’t stock newspapers. The libraries downtown and at the colleges get the Times, thankfully, but my goal was to buy one.
At the Barnes & Noble in neighboring Montclair, I asked if they carry newspapers, like the N.Y. Times. “Like, actual newspapers?” a clerk asked. A second clerk said: “We don’t. We used to, but not anymore.”
A gas station near the colleges had also given up. “No, we stopped selling newspapers last year, I think,” a clerk said. “You could try Starbucks.”
I delivered the bad news. “They stopped selling them too?” he said, eyes wide. He shook his head. “A printed newspaper. That’s a hard find.”
This reminded me of an encounter earlier this year at Creme Bakery in downtown Claremont. I often read my newspapers there, partly for pleasure, partly to model good behavior. A woman noticed me reading and said, a bit wistfully, “I miss newspapers.”
A few seconds went by.
I said, “They print new ones every day.”
Where else might one buy a New York Times locally? Suddenly I remembered the area’s only newsstand, Newsboy Books in downtown Ontario.
Newsboy stocks 10 daily newspapers, including the NYT, although the Starbucks decision seemed to throw a wrench into local distribution. The last copy delivered to Newsboy was last Sunday’s, although co-owner Roberta Gingold told me she expects to have copies again starting Tuesday.
In the meantime, on Friday morning she had one copy of last Sunday’s NYT, and to fulfill my goal, and also to round out this column, I handed over $6.47.
Next stop: an Ontario Starbucks, where the newspaper rack stood empty. I bought a drink, sat down with my fat copy of the NYT, with 10 sections and a magazine, and dug in.

Why Aren’t Older People Using Uber And Lyft?

Texto completo: Martin Gerstell treasures his Thursday morning volunteer stint at the National Gallery of Art, where he fields questions at the main information desk. He patiently responds when visitors ask about the current exhibits, whether the paintings are real, where the bathrooms are.
Usually, fellow volunteers give him a ride from his assisted living residence in northwest Washington to the museum downtown, and home again. But when they can’t, Gerstell, 94, uses the Uber app his granddaughter installed on his iPhone.
“They appear very quickly, and they’re very helpful,” Gerstell said of his Uber drivers, who fold and stash his walker in the trunk. Summoning a taxi, his previous option, usually took 15 to 20 minutes; Uber arrives in three to five minutes and charges less, under $20, to drive him downtown.
It probably helps that Gerstell, a retired electrical engineer, handles new technology with aplomb.
Donna Nettleton has encountered a different reaction at the Oasis Institute in Shiloh, Illinois, where she volunteers to teach older people about digital devices.
Her students take happily to Facebook, but “Uber and Lyft are scarier because they involve money,” she explained. Older adults, warned continually about scams and identity theft, fear that misusing an app could empty their bank accounts.
“It’s challenging to build the confidence they need to actually use these things that could make life easier for them,” Nettleton said. So far, she’s been unable to convert any of her advisees - including her 80-year-old mother - into riders.
Safety and privacy concerns
More than half of adults over 65 own smartphones, the Pew Research Center has reported. Yet among adults 50 and older, only about a quarter used ride-hailing services in 2018 (a leap, however, from 7% in 2015). By comparison, half of those ages 18 to 29 had used them.
In a survey by AARP last year, only 29% of those over 50 had used ride-hailing apps. Two-thirds said they weren’t likely to do so in the coming year, citing in part concerns about safety and privacy. (Given data breaches at Uber, that’s no baseless fear.)
Nevertheless, transportation experts see ride-hailing as a way to improve mobility and preserve independence for older people who can or should no longer drive, or never did.
Ride-hailing - and, one day, autonomous vehicles - are game-changers, said David Lindeman, who directs health programs at the Center for Information Technology Research in the Interest of Society at the University of California, Berkeley. “We have wonderful new opportunities that many people are still not aware of.”
Personalized training
One reason for such optimism: evidence that with personalized instruction, older adults can master the mobile apps and take “networked transportation” to medical appointments, entertainment and leisure activities, social visits and fitness classes.
In a newly published study, researchers at the University of Southern California offered three free months of unlimited Lyft rides to 150 older people in and around Los Angeles (average age: 72) who had chronic illnesses and reported transportation problems.
With training, nearly all used Lyft, most through the mobile app (a few used a call-in service), for an average of 69 trips. On follow-up questionnaires, almost all riders reported improved quality of life.
Contracting
But ride-hailing companies aren’t waiting around for more older adults to grow adept with their phones.
Seniors in need of transportation constitute a potentially lucrative market. So Lyft and Uber and others are contracting with third parties, bypassing the need for older riders to use apps or to have smartphones at all.
They’re joining forces with health care systems, for instance. In the past 18 months, more than 1,000 - including MedStar, in the Washington area, and the Boston Medical Center - have signed on with Uber Health for “nonemergency medical transportation,” the company said.
Case managers and social workers can use Uber or Lyft to ferry patients to or from clinics and offices, reducing missed appointments.
“Hospitals may spend millions on taxi vouchers,” said Dan Trigub, who heads Uber Health. “Uber is cheaper, and we see higher patient satisfaction.”
The companies have targeted senior living facilities, too. Most provide some sort of scheduled transportation, primarily for medical visits, but often “the residents feel limited by the shuttle - it doesn’t really provide the independence they want,” said Gyre Renwick, vice president of Lyft Business.
Now, at Brookdale Senior Living, the nation’s largest chain, as well as several other chains and communities, the front desk staff can call Lyft for residents, either billing the resident or rolling the cost into the monthly fee.
Both major ride-hail companies are also experimenting with programs for older and disabled people whose mobility problems make standard curb-to-curb services difficult to use.
The Lyft and Uber apps can dispatch wheelchair-accessible vans in several cities. In 20 cities, Uber Assist trains drivers to provide extra help for people using canes, walkers and folding wheelchairs, though riders must still be able to enter and leave the car on their own.
In the Bay Area, though, frail older people can get “door-through-door” services from 12-year-old SilverRide. Its trained, vetted drivers escort riders out of their homes, help them transfer into and out of the car, and then accompany them to their specific destinations.
“Door-to-door takes you to the entrance to the hospital,” said Jeff Maltz, a co-founder of the service. “We’ll take you all the way to the doctor’s office.” SilverRide has pilot programs underway in Sacramento, Los Angeles and Kansas City, Missouri, Maltz said, and will expand further next year.
Another smaller player, GoGo Grandparent, piggybacks on Uber and Lyft, hiring operators who can take riders’ requests on standard telephones, via push button menu, or by voice. The operators arrange the trip, charging 27 cents a minute over the ride-hailing fees. (Of course, family members can dispatch Uber and Lyft to pick up their older relatives as well, for no extra cost.)
That raises a key question: Will ride-hailing be too expensive for many seniors? In the USC study, the typical trip cost $22; the cost per month, had users actually paid it, averaged $500. After the study, about a fifth of riders said they wouldn’t continue using ride-hailing, mostly because of cost.
Some Medicare Advantage programs now cover rides to medical appointments and pharmacies; Lyft expects to partner with most Advantage plans by next year, Renwick said. But most older Americans still use traditional Medicare, which doesn’t cover such transportation.
Experts like Alexandre Bayen, director of the Institute of Transportation Studies at the University of California, Berkeley, also worry about ride-hailing outside metropolitan areas. “The rural population might not see this for a long time,” he said. He envisions a combination of new public policies, subsidies and public-private partnerships to make ride-hailing broadly available.
One might wonder, too, about health organizations, local governments and senior communities outsourcing transit to two companies that continue to lose money and, critics warn, may prove financially unsustainable. The companies have been sued by disability advocates and by their own drivers.
Still, “it’s got great potential,” Joseph Coughlin, director of the MIT AgeLab, said of ride-hailing. “There’s been so painfully little innovation in transportation for the aging population that anything we do can only be an improvement.”

Texto completo: Danielle Welch, 52, of Red Bank, grew up in New Mexico butchering her own meat. She came from a family of hunters — skinning, slicing and trimming animals was expected. Imagine her family's fury when, as a teen, she became a vegetarian. She was cutting through the sinew on a hunk of venison one day and suddenly became nauseated by the blood. From that day on, she couldn't stomach meat. "I couldn't get the smell of blood out of my skin for weeks," Welch said. "That was it for me." For the next 13 years not a single bite of spicy sausage, tender sirloin or crispy chicken passed through her lips. Every time she smelled meat, all she could think of was deer blood. Until one day she changed her mind while visiting friends. "They made steaks, and they actually smelled good to me instead of like blood. So, I decided to eat one," she remembered.
Her disgust at meat was gone. In its stead was more focus and energy brought on by the protein her body was benefiting from, she said. She bid vegetarianism farewell and has been a carnivore ever since.
Is vegetarian healthier? Not necessarily In a world of scare-tactic documentaries, dewy-skinned vegan Instagrammers and bogus health blogs, it's no wonder many think veganism and vegetarianism will lead to a trim waist, glowing complexion, laser-sharp focus, perfect health, and the ability to do hundreds of V-sits in a row. But science and experience say otherwise.
"There's still a lot of junk food that's vegan," said Dawn Cascio, director of food and nutrition at Valley Hospital. "There are vegan chocolate chip cookies. A lot of processed foods like potato chips are vegan. If you don't focus on fresh fruits and veggies and unprocessed grains, you could gain a lot of weight."
As a vegetarian, Welch turned to pasta and bread to supplement her diet and wound up packing on pounds. "You're having so many starches and grains," she said. "Our bodies are not meant to break all those down. We're not cows."
Sometimes cutting out meat and dairy can be downright dangerous.
For proof, look no further than the infamous case of YouTuber Yovana Mendoza Ayres, or Rawvana as she's known. Ayres runs a vegan blog and YouTube channel, where she extols the virtues of raw vegan living (eating only plant-based foods that aren't cooked). She also sells raw vegan meal plans on her website.
But her goose was cooked when earlier this year she appeared in a fellow YouTuber's video eating (cue dramatic music)... fish! Ayres took to the Internet to do some "splaining. She said in a video that after beginning her raw vegan diet she stopped getting her period. Doctors told her that her "hormones were out of wack." She needed to eat more fat and cook her food. She was anemic and her thyroid levels were low. Then she got SIBO, a small intestinal bacteria overgrowth that can lead to malnourishment. After some advice from a nutritionist, she reintroduced eggs and fish into her diet to regain her health, all the while maintaining to her fans that she only ate raw vegan food.
'There's no one-size-fits-all diet' Of course, eating less meat and more plants for good health isn't all phooey. According to Cascio, thorough research shows a link between eating processed meats and an increased risk in developing cancer and heart disease. Eating less meat also shrinks one's carbon footprint and can reduce cruel farming practices.
Just ask Beyonce, or rather her personal trainer Marco Borges. Borges, a nutrition author who recently released the plant-based recipe book "The Greenprint," has pioneered a 22-day vegan nutrition challenge, best known for being used and endorsed by Queen B and Jay-Z.
Borges also conducted a clinical study with Holy Name Medical Center in Teaneck. He found that over 22 days, people who ate a whole foods (foods grown out of the ground) vegan diet saw positive results. When compared to people who ate a vegetarian diet, their BMIs (body mass index) went down five times more, their body fat reduced by four times more and their cholesterol decreased 400 percent.
If this study is any proof, cutting out meat and dairy can shed pounds and be good for your heart. But not all vegan diets are made the same.
"It's really important to distinguish between whole food plant-based and being vegan... A whole food plant-based diet is vegan, but vegan isn't always whole-food plant based," Borges said. "Whole foods come from the earth like rice, whole grains and beans Not waffles, Impossible burgers and French fries, which are also vegan"
Doctor Iris Erguder-Saman agrees. She's an MD in family medicine and the director of integrative medicine at Holy Name Medical Center in Teaneck. Erguder-Saman works with people who are looking to make big changes to their diet. Her tips? Avoid processed foods like veggie burgers and talk to a doctor before cutting major food groups out of your diet.
"There's no one-size-fits-all diet. Some diets work for some individuals," she said. "It's all about having a conversation and consulting with a healthcare professional."
Getting back together with meat Kassandra Gutierrez, 28, owner of the meal prep and food delivery service The Malleable Palate which is based out of Paterson, says she felt "lighter" and "better" as a vegan. A trained chef, Gutierrez knew which foods to substitute into her diet to stay healthy.
When she was 20 years old she decided to go pescatarian (eating only fish and plant-based foods), then vegetarian, then vegan, after watching the documentary "Forks Over Knives." The film advocates eating plant-based proteins instead of animal proteins, claiming the switch will reduce diseases like cancer and diabetes. But something was missing.
"I enjoy the umami flavor. I craved steak the most when I was pescatarian, seafood when I was vegetarian, and probably cheese when I was vegan," she said. After six months of being vegan, she went back to eating meat.
Jennifer Levine of Montclair went vegetarian while attending UMass Amherst because the food that came with the plant-base dining plan looked better than the others. When she graduated, Levine decided to stay vegetarian. "It became a habit," she said.
About eight years later she went to a deli with her boyfriend. She was about to order her usual meatless sandwich when her boyfriend suggested something life-changing – "Why don't you try the turkey sub?"
"It was radical. That was kind of a turning point," Levine said. She ordered the turkey sub. Then started eating meat again. Levine noticed she had more energy from that point on.
"As a vegetarian, I was carb-loading. I wasn't getting adequate protein," she said. "Since I've started eating meat again, I have a much more refined awareness of what I'm eating."
Oscar-winning actress (and fellow New Jerseyan) Anne Hathaway scrapped veganism after a fateful dinner with her husband Adam Shulman and Matt Damon. The three were dining at a Michelin-starred restaurant in Iceland. Shulman and Damon asked to eat whatever the chef was making. Hathaway asked if the salmon they were serving was local.
"And they said: 'Do you see that fjord?'" she told the publication Tatler. "So I had a piece of salmon and my brain felt like a computer rebooting."
As a vegan, "I just didn't feel good or healthy ... not strong," she said later to Harper's Bazaar.
Even Jane Brody, personal health columnist and long-time specialist in medicine and biology for the New York Times, weighed in in her 2017 column "Good Vegan, Bad Vegan." Her article was published in The Times in response to the "misstatements" made in the popular Netflix documentary "What The Health."
Eating an egg every day is just as bad as smoking five cigarettes? Eating one serving of processed meat a day raises your risk of getting diabetes 51 percent? All things the documentary claimed. All wrong, said Brody.
In the column she pointed to studies published by the Journal of the American College of Cardiology and Harvard's Department of Nutrition. Both found that eating a primarily plant-based diet would reduce the risk of cancer and heart disease, but left room for "various amounts of animal products" in their subjects' diets, wrote Brody. She also drew the distinction between good vegan food (read: broccoli) and bad vegan food (read: vegan chocolate chip cookies). The former will most likely be a positive for your health. The latter most likely will not.
"Eating is so personal and cultural," said Cascio of Valley Hospital. "Everybody is different and needs to find a diet they personally feel great on... If you feel like crap on it, it might not be for you."

Texto completo: What's Streaming
HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON: THE HIDDEN WORLD (2019) Stream on Hulu; Rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. Why, when there's a heroic warrior involved, does the dragon always need to be the bad guy? That's a question the original installment in this animated series posed when it came out at the beginning of this decade. The movie introduced audiences to Hiccup (the awkward young hero voiced by Jay Baruchel) and Toothless, the dragon that became his companion. The latest and supposedly final installment in the series sees Hiccup and Toothless dealing with a new foe: a vicious dragon hunter voiced by F. Murray Abraham. "If you've spent any time with these characters," Ben Kenigsberg wrote in his review for The New York Times, "it's hard not to get swept up in the saga, and it's easy to be moved by the bond between Hiccup and Toothless, who is, in effect, a very loyal dog who can fly and harness the power of lightning bolts."
CAPOTE (2005) Stream on Showtime platforms; Rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. When Truman Capote died 35 years ago this week, he left behind a legacy defined in part by "In Cold Blood." The writing of that book is the subject of this biographical film, which won Philip Seymour Hoffman an Academy Award for best actor. He stars here as a Capote who becomes deeply enmeshed in the story of a now-famous quadruple murder in Kansas. In his review for The Times, A.O. Scott called the film "a fascinating and fine-grained reconstruction of that period in its subject's life, a time when he pursued literary glory and flirted with moral ruin."
What's on TV
MAGICAL LAND OF OZ 10 p.m. on PBS (check local listings). You'll find no yellow brick road or wicked witch in this new PBS program. What you will see are colorful parrots, mountain peaks blanketed by snow, kangaroos and a shockingly muddy crocodile. Yes, this is a nature program focused on the animals of Australia (the other Oz). The biological richness of that continent comes through in the diversity of the species filmed here. Another element that comes through: How merciless even nature's smaller beasts can be, an angle in this first episode when the narrator observes a fly perched on the back of a crocodile. "The fly then sucks up the blood with its fleshy mouth parts," he says, "filling to bursting point on its victim's rich, cold blood."
ROUGH NIGHT (2017) 7:30 p.m. and 9:25 p.m. on FXM. Scarlett Johansson stars as a soon-to-be-married politician named Jess in this comedy, which is more "The Hangover" than "Frost/Nixon." During a race for State Senate, Jess gathers a group of friends for a bachelorette weekend that goes awry. "It's all blithely formulaic and would be more irritating if the performers -- who include Zoë Kravitz and Ilana Glazer -- weren't generally so appealing," Manohla Dargis wrote in her review for The Times.

Texto completo: Democrats are talking seriously about ending the legislative filibuster once and for all, effectively changing the number of Senate votes required to pass a bill from 60 to 51. The result would be a transformation in the way the U.S. Senate has operated for well over a century and a half.
This may seem like a terrible idea, robbing the Senate of its traditional role as a moderating influence on legislative enthusiasms. Republican Majority Leader Mitch McConnell seems to think so, writing Thursday in the New York Times that Democrats would “regret it a lot sooner than they think.”
But consider that it might be a good idea to make the Senate reflect the will of the public more than it has traditionally done. Entrenching minority veto power can certainly have moderating effects. It also blocks one of the most basic principles of democracy: the idea of majority rule.
Recall that the Senate is designed to thwart majoritarian democracy. Going into the Constitutional Convention in the late spring of 1787, James Madison fully expected that both the House and the Senate would choose their members on a proportional basis. That made sense to a Virginian like Madison, given that Virginia was the most populous state. But to Madison’s surprise and chagrin, the small states balked, demanding that they retain equal representation in the Senate, as was passed in Congress under the Articles of Confederation.
Madison and other delegates from large states repeatedly told the small states that their demands violated the most basic rule of fair representation. But the small states engineered a walkout, refusing to adopt any constitution unless they got what they wanted. The result was a compromise in which citizens of small states received grossly disproportionate representation and power in the Senate — which they retain to this day.
The legislative filibuster makes the already undemocratic structure of the Senate even more undemocratic. When a filibuster system is operating, 41 senators can block legislation. They can be from states of any size, of course. That means that representatives of only a very small percentage of the population can potentially block national legislation.
In recent years, by using the so-called nuclear option, both parties took part in a process that ended the filibuster for judicial appointments, including appointments to the U.S. Supreme Court. This troubles many liberals in that it enabled President Donald Trump to appoint extremely conservative judges and justices. Nevertheless, it also means that a Democratic Congress and presidency could appoint liberal judges and justices, if Democrats held a Senate majority. The result may be greater polarization on the Supreme Court over time. But that result would reflect the polarized preferences of actual voters.
When it comes to legislation, the traditional justification for the filibuster has been that a minority veto encourages centrism. Yet the reality for a long time was otherwise. The legislative filibuster was the tool favored by Southern segregationist Democrats to block national civil-rights legislation. This should remind us that the filibuster will protect any organized minority — including a minority of obstructionists or racists.
Sure, without a filibuster, Democrats won’t be able to block future Republican legislation if the Democrats should lose control of the House. Yet if the Democrats were to gain control of both Congress and the presidency, the filibuster would also block their progressive legislation. The practical question for Democrats therefore is whether the dangers of future conservative legislation outweigh the benefits of potential progressive laws as the Democrats might be able to pass without Republicans blocking them.
In determining the answer, consider that when a slim majority of both houses of Congress passes controversial legislation, it sometimes gets rolled back or reversed regardless of a filibuster. That is what essentially happened to the Affordable Care Act, which managed to pass during Democratic control of Congress in President Barack Obama’s administration but was repealed in part by a Republican Congress in the early part of the Trump administration.
The lesson of this reversal is that the filibuster actually matters less than the inherent difficulty of sustaining controversial progressive legislation when conservatives take over. Presumably, the same lesson would apply in the opposite political direction as well.
No doubt, if the legislative filibuster finally disappears there will be a time when Democrats regret it and mourn its passing. But minority veto power doesn’t need to be enshrined by Senate custom any more than it is already in the Senate’s own structure. All constitutional democracies need to protect minority rights. But they don’t need to enshrine a minority legislative veto in order to work efficiently and fairly.

Collins helped fuel fiscal slump

Texto completo: Sen. Susan Collins' vote was critical to the passage of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which has put our economy on track to run trillion-dollar deficits beginning next year and for years to come, The New York Times reported Aug. 21, citing the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. This should finally extinguish the idea that Collins is a moderate.
Collins argued that the economic growth from the tax cuts would offset a budget gap and "actually lower the debt," the Bangor Daily News reported Aug. 21.
The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act bestowed billions of dollars in tax cuts, most going to corporations and the wealthy, with the promise that the cuts would pay for themselves by stimulating growth in the economy.
The growth spurt was short lived, with most corporations using their windfall to buy back their own stock, artificially raising their stock prices, the Times reported last Dec. 27. The level of capital investments that would actually grow the economy was anemic. Some companies expanded hiring, according to the Times, while others laid off workers, citing automation, outsourcing and restructuring in explaining those layoffs.
Why does any of this matter? With deficits running in the trillions of dollars, historically low interest rates and a president cajoling the Federal Reserve chairman to lower them further, there will be no tools to use when the economy slips into recession, something that seems inevitable given the typical cycles of the economy.
The interest we must pay on this historic level of debt crowds out expenditures on many of our critical needs, from infrastructure to education, housing, health care, employee retraining, etc.
Sen. Collins helped to create the reality we now face and that we're likely to be passing on to our children and grandchildren.
Pleasing her party took precedence over acting prudently and with an eye on the long-term fiscal interests of the country.

Medical pot's cost forces pain patient back on pills
As some of you know, I have been trying to get the state of Maine to pick up the cost of my prescription marijuana since 2007.
Between the state and Medicaid, all my scripts are paid for, except my marijuana.
I've written Gov. Mills and I even talked to my representative in the Legislature, from whom I had to listen to all this rhetoric of someone who has no clue what this miracle drug has to offer to thousands, maybe millions of people who don't want the side effects of harder drugs.
Not being able to purchase this without going underwater with our living expenses has brought me back to a decision I hated to make: I directed my doctor to put me back on my prescriptions so I can get some relief.
So that's it. I'm now back on barbiturates.
So when I get hooked or even OD on these drugs, blood will be on your hands, state of Maine, not mine!
State of Maine: When you read my obituary, remember I tried to stay off these drugs without going financially underwater!

Writer fails to make case for exploiting Greenland
Marc A. Thiessen's Aug. 23 column, "Trump's idea of buying Greenland is far from absurd," is a poor attempt to justify a bad idea, and does not reflect well on conservatives of his ilk or on the American Enterprise Institute, where Thiessen is a fellow.
Yes, American presidents have made such acquisitions in the past, when the notion of imperialism still had credibility, when many people in the United States had few qualms about buying or selling indigenous people who were living on the real estate in question. Sadly, Thiessen and President Trump are ignoring the fact that civilized nations no longer condone these kinds of acquisitions.
He also refers to the natural resources that the United States could "exploit" were we in possession of Greenland, thanks to global warming, which is opening up new sea lanes through the Arctic. But this kind of thinking only adds fuel to the fire. If we don't begin to conserve, rather than exploit, resources, much of our planet will be uninhabitable before the end of this century.
Attempting to bolster his argument for exploitation, Thiessen uses the phrase, "unavoidable receding of Arctic sea ice." "Unavoidable"? We have known about global warming and its impact on Arctic ice for the past 40 years! It is climate change deniers like himself and the president who are undoing efforts to keep that ice intact: by withdrawing from the Paris climate accords, by undoing strict power plant and automobile emission standards, by promoting the leasing of public lands for fracking and through numerous other executive actions.
I understand that this newspaper has an obligation to present a variety of opinions, but I hope readers will see through Thiessen's unscientific and dangerous views with regard to the catastrophic threats posed by climate change.

Consumers can't count on corporate conscience
Pleased to see JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon acknowledging the problem of how corporations treat their employees and customers in your front-page report today ("Top CEOS: Max profits can't continue to be primary goal," Aug. 20).
But we the customers should not expect the corporate world to attend to our needs. We have the power to do so - we just haven't learned how to use it yet. And, by the way, we shouldn't expect government to do it, either. They are more dependent on the corporate world than the rest of us are.

Texto completo: What's on TV
DANCE MOMS 9:00 p.m. on Lifetime. The eighth season of "Dance Moms" has been monumental for Abby Lee Miller, the dance instructor who has starred on the show since its beginning. This season was all about Abby putting her life and dance studio back together following a tumultuous year in which she completed a prison sentence for bankruptcy fraud and learned she had non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. But the competitive spirit of the show is still dominant, with a spot on Abby's Elite Team still on the line as the finale airs.
THE DEVIL YOU KNOW 10:00 p.m. on Viceland. For fans of true crime, the premiere of this five-episode documentary series provides ample opportunity to delve into an unsolved and disturbing murder case. Set in a rural community outside of Winston-Salem, N.C., the show centers on John Lawson, a self-proclaimed Satanist who renamed himself Pazuzu Algarad. When the bodies of two missing men are found in his basement, Algarad's ties to Satanism and continuous run-ins with the law seem to build up a case against him -- but the reality of what happened to the men may not be what it seems. The series follows Chad Nance, a local journalist, as well as the neighbors, authorities and friends -- some of whom are self-styled Satanists themselves -- who have tried to unravel the mysterious case.
What's Streaming
TROLLS: THE BEAT GOES ON! Stream on Netflix. The characters from the "Trolls" films star in their own show, which is premiering its seventh season on Netflix. The series follows the trolls Poppy (Amanda Leighton) and Branch (Skylar Astin) as they and other members of the Troll Village embark on adventures in the magical forest that surrounds them. Executive produced by Matthew Beans, a writer for the quirky animated series "Robot Chicken," and with original songs by Alana Da Fonseca of "Pitch Perfect 3," the show offers an original take on the stories of the misfit cast of trolls who have played a role in kids' culture in the last few years.
THE MULE (2018) Stream on HBO. "The Lincoln pickup truck with Iowa plates was hurtling down Interstate 94, headed for Detroit." So began the 2014 New York Times Magazine article by Sam Dolnick about Leo Sharp, a World War II veteran turned courier for the drug cartel Sinaloa in Mexico who was caught by the authorities at age 87. Four years after the piece published, the story of the drug mule -- whose nickname was Tata (meaning "grandfather" in Spanish) -- became a film directed by and starring Clint Eastwood, now streaming on HBO. In a review for The Times, Manohla Dargis writes, "Eastwood fills in the portrait of his mule with creative license, characteristic dry humor and a looseness that seems almost completely untethered from the world of murderous cartels." While "The Mule" embellishes a few facts surrounding the case, this account is as real as it is unbelievable.

'SNL' announced its fall lineup, and a former cast member is hosting for the first time in 3 decades

Texto completo: “Saturday Night Live" is returning next month, and NBC just dropped the fall lineup — which is chock full of stars like Kristen Stewart, Woody Harrelson, and, most notably, Eddie Murphy.
The show will feature Harrelson with musical guest Billie Eilish on Sept. 28; Phoebe Waller-Bridge and musical guest Taylor Swift on Oct. 5; “Stranger Things" actor David Harbour and musical guest Camila Cabello on Oct. 12; Stewart on Nov. 2; and Murphy on Dec. 21.
Murphy's return is especially notable because the comedian, who was an “SNL" cast member from 1980 to 1984, hasn't performed on the show in more than three decades — he last hosted in December 1984, shortly after leaving the show.
But, according to The New York Times, Murphy got into a feud with “SNL" after a joke about his career was made by David Spade: “Look children, it's a falling star; make a wish," Spade had quipped, as a photo of Murphy appeared on the splitscreen above him.
Spade recounted the verbal lashing he received from Murphy in his 2015 memoir, “Almost Interesting," describing the incident as “so much worse than I had imagined."
“He just got caught in friendly fire and my deep desire to make an impression on my bosses and keep my job. How pathetic," Spade wrote.
However, Murphy appeared on the “SNL" 40th anniversary special in 2015, saying the show was “such a big part of who I am."
Also of note on the 2019 fall schedule: October 5, which will feature both Waller-Bridge (the British writer/actress of “Fleabag" and “Killing Eve" fame) and Rhode Island homeowner Taylor Swift.
In fact, Swift seemed particularly excited for her time slot.
The show, which has seen a resurgence in interest in today's political climate, won an Emmy in 2018 for best variety sketch series.

Walsh to challenge Trump in GOP primary

Texto completo: Joe Walsh, who turned a lone term in Congress representing Chicago's northwest suburbs into a national media platform to further his incendiary political rhetoric, announced Sunday he will challenge President Donald Trump for the 2020 Republican nomination for the White House.
"Today I'm declaring my candidacy for president of the United States because it's time to be brave," Walsh said in a video as he announced his campaign on social media.
"We have someone in the White House who we all know is unfit. Someone who lies virtually every time he opens his mouth and someone who places his own interest above the nation's interest at every single turn. We cannot afford four more years of Donald Trump. No way," he said.
Walsh, a locally based host of a syndicated radio talk show, has been telegraphing his long-shot bid against Trump for weeks.
He has made regular cable news appearances as well as a visit to "This Week with George Stephanopoulos" on ABC on Sunday after first writing an op-ed in The New York Times earlier this month laying out the case for a challenge to Trump from the right, while saying he regretted the personal Trump-style attacks he leveled in the past.
"I wrote that New York Times piece to get someone in our party to step up," he told the Tribune on Sunday morning. "In the last week it became clear that no other Republicans were going to step up to declare the president is unfit, so I'm going to do this."
Walsh, who publicly supported Trump in 2016, rode the wave of the tea party movement in 2010 to win a seat in the House by 290 votes over Democratic incumbent Melissa Bean. With the district redrawn after the 2010 federal census, Walsh was soundly defeated for reelection by now-U.S. Sen. Tammy Duckworth by nearly 10 percentage points in 2012, leading to his talk radio career.
For the 57-year-old Walsh, his candidacy for president becomes the latest act in a public life that is in many ways befitting for a former student at the Lee Strasberg Theatre & Film Institute. Walsh has been a role player looking to fill self-perceived voids in the political scene.
His provocative rhetoric has given him an outsized national platform on cable news outlets despite his cup-of-coffee tenure in the House -- once as a fierce critic of former President Barack Obama, then as a staunch supporter of Trump's election, and now as a political apologist for playing a role in putting Trump in the White House.
But a review of Walsh's career -- his three losing bids for elective office against one win as well as a failed attempt to become Illinois Republican chairman -- shows that even as he now assails Trump, he is not so unlike the president, with a history of flip-flopping on a variety of issues over the years while using inflammatory language to gain attention.
Few Republicans, regardless of their feelings toward Trump, give Walsh a chance to defeat the president or even being able to put together the massive infrastructure needed to raise funds and get on primary and caucus ballots in the 50 states.
Matt Mackowiak, a nationally known Republican consultant who also chairs the GOP in Travis County, Texas, called Walsh "a legend in his own mind."
"He served in Congress for one term. His radio show is failing. He was a Trump-supporting tea party member as recently as two years ago. He's had significant personal, professional and financial problems," Mackowiak said.
"It will be the height of irony to see 'Never Trumpers,' who have talked incessantly about the importance of character, support Joe Walsh over President Trump in a Republican primary. As the Trump campaign said, Walsh's candidacy will meet 'certain failure,'" he said.
But William Kristol, the conservative founder and editor of the now-defunct Weekly Standard and a Never Trumper, has backed a challenge to the president and encouraged Walsh and former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld to make primary runs.
"Yes, the challengers to Donald Trump have flaws. But they also have courage," Kristol tweeted Friday, adding that, "I salute the brave, flawed though they may be."
It was only days before the 2016 presidential election when Walsh displayed his enthusiasm for Trump, saying in a tweet: "On November 8th, I'm voting for Trump. On November 9th, if Trump loses, I'm grabbing my musket. You in?"
But on Friday, in preparation for his announcement, Walsh tweeted: "Trump is not well. Trump is not stable. Trump is not fit. Trump is a danger to the country and he's becoming a big danger to your pocketbook."
Yet the similarities between Walsh and Trump are many.
At first a moderate, Walsh supported abortion rights, a ban on assault weapons and gun buyer background checks in his 1996 and 1998 bids for Congress and the Illinois House.
But in his 2010 bid for Congress, he backed a ban on abortion with no exceptions and wrongly claimed that medical advances eliminated the need for women to have life-saving abortions. He also touted his allegiance to Second Amendment rights.
Trump also previously supported abortion rights, once declaring, "I am very pro-choice." In his 2000 book, "The America We Deserve," Trump supported a ban on assault weapons before declaring to the National Rifle Association in 2015 that the Second Amendment would be "totally protected" if he ran for and won the presidency. More recently, in the wake of mass shootings, Trump has vacillated on the issue of background checks.
During Trump's presidential campaign, he gained notoriety for saying the late U.S. Sen. John McCain of Arizona was "not a war hero" because he had been captured during the Vietnam War.
In his failed 2012 re-election bid, Walsh said his Democratic opponent, Duckworth, was not one of the nation's "true heroes" -- though as a U.S. Army helicopter pilot, she lost both her legs when her aircraft was shot down during the Iraq War in 2004.
Walsh contended at the time that McCain was a hero because he did not speak often about his past military service. But Walsh also had harsh words for the senator, who died in August 2018, saying to a tea party group in 2012 that he understood those who didn't vote for McCain for president against Obama because, "McCain was what, about 132 years old?"
While in Congress, reacting to McCain's comparison of tea party followers to "hobbits," Walsh called the senator an "old troll." When McCain died, Walsh acknowledged in a tweet, "damn, I respected him." By then, Walsh began promoting anti-Trump sentiments.
Trump has come under criticism for repeatedly using racist language, such as when he recently said four new Democratic members of Congress who are of color should "go back" to the "corrupt" countries he said they are from. Three of them were born in the United States. A fourth, Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, left Somalia when she was 8 and settled in the U.S. when she was 12.
In June 2014, Walsh was briefly taken off the air when he used racial epithets, including a racial slur in discussing the controversy over the name of the Washington Redskins NFL team.
A year earlier, on the 50th anniversary of the Rev. Martin Luther King's "I Have a Dream" speech, Walsh recited his own version on his radio show and told listeners that he had a dream that "young black males and females graduate from high school," and that "young black men don't become daddies until after they're married, and until after they have a job."
During a May 2011 interview with online publication Slate, the then-congressman said Obama was elected because of his race.
"He was black, he was historic. ... They were in love with him because they thought he was a good liberal guy and they were in love with him because he pushed that magical button: a black man who was articulate, liberal, the whole white guilt, all of that," he said.
And in July 2016, following the shootings in Dallas in which five police officers were killed, Walsh issued a tweet that said: "This is now war. Watch out Obama. Watch out black lives matter punks. Real America is coming after you."
He later deleted that tweet but in December 2016, Walsh tweeted: "Obama is a Muslim. Happy New Year!"
During his 1996 campaign for Congress, Walsh expressed support for immigration reforms. By 2010, though, he opposed construction of a border fence, calling for the use of technology and potentially U.S. troops to secure the border with Mexico.
Trump in 2012 criticized losing GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney for a "crazy policy of self-deportation, which was maniacal." He credited Democrats, saying that while they "didn't have a policy for dealing with illegal immigrants" they "weren't mean-spirited about it."
But in his campaign and in his presidency, Trump has taken a hardline approach to illegal immigration and has worked to reduce legal immigration.
Aside from the Trump comparisons, Walsh has had several financial problems over the years, including now-resolved liens and a condo foreclosure as well as a controversy over child support.
Shortly after his election to Congress, Walsh's ex-wife filed suit claiming he owed $117,437 in unpaid child support. Walsh denied owing the money. In 2012, he issued a joint statement with his ex-wife announcing an undisclosed settlement, part of which declared, "We now agree that Joe is not and was not a 'deadbeat dad' and does not owe child support."
For Walsh, it has been a constant evolution of political roles.
In his failed challenge to Rep. Sidney Yates in 1996, Walsh said he was "the kind of Republican who can win because I'm open and tolerant. I'm not some right-wing conservative."
By 2010 he was courting the right wing, and in 2012 he said of his desire of a Republican to defeat Obama: "We don't need a savior. I don't want a savior. A lot of this country thought they elected a savior three years ago."
On Friday, readying his challenge to take on Trump, Walsh offered this tweet: "I'd rather be the man who apologizes for the mistakes he's made than the man who's incapable of apologizing for the mistakes he's made."

Radio's golden age recalls an intimate pastime

Texto completo: Before Instagram, Twitter, iPods and even television, there was radio and its many voices and the antics and artfulness of its huge stable of performers formed the soundtrack of American life.
But not for me. The first time I listened to a radio was when I hid a newly purchased transistor under my pillow and listened to "I Want to Hold Your Hand."
Thus, I have no memory, as some of you surely do, of gathering with family members around a living room radio and listening to Jack Benny be funny, or hearing the chilling "Who knows what evil lurks in the hearts of men? The Shadow knows," or "The Lone Ranger's" stirring "A fiery horse with the speed of light, a cloud of dust and a hearty 'Hi-yo, Silver!' "
One can argue that what's past is past, mere nostalgia. But there are those who are intent to revisit the past. They not only cling to memories but are able to satisfy their nostalgic cravings thanks to those who continue to bring the sounds and substance of old radio back to life. The most notable of these people is Chuck Schaden, who spent most of his professional career as a newspaper editor and marketing executive. But he was in love with radio, in part because the apartment in which he was raised here in the Hermosa neighborhood in the 1930s and 1940s "had four rooms and two radios. ... Radio and I were constant companions."
So, nearly 50 years ago he created a radio program that is "Those Were the Days," which can be heard on WDCB-FM 90.9.
Another of the keepers of the radio flame is Carl Amari, who with Lisa Wolf hosts "WGN Radio Theatre" on WGN-AM 720. (His show follows my modest radio efforts on Sunday nights).
These programs are undeniably unusual radio offerings, especially since so much of contemporary radio is loud, conflict-filled and, frankly, instantly forgettable.
Schaden and Amari have recently published books about their old radio passions and in reading them I have been transported, enlightened and entertained.
"Chuck Schaden's Radio Days: Adding Decades to the Golden Age of Radio" (Hall Closet Press) is a charming autobiography with dozens of stories about meeting stars and keeping his show alive and vibrant.
Amari, in collaboration with Martin Grams Jr. (a radio/TV/movie historian), gives us "The Top 100 Classic Radio Shows" (Portable Press), a lavishly illustrated and handsomely designed book of the coffee table sort, which includes three CDs containing old shows and links to more.
One need not be a devoted fan of bygone radio programs to appreciate both.
Schaden's book is written in self-effacing style and is generous in acknowledging the many people he met along the way.
"Classic Radio Shows" is arranged in six sections that cover comedy, drama, mystery and detective, science fiction and kids, variety and western and adventure. It is fascinating to discover how many of the television shows of my youth (and likely yours too) began on radio. A small sampling: "The Ozzie and Harriet Show," "Dragnet," "The Cisco Kid," "Gunsmoke," "Father Knows Best," "The Saint," "Have Gun, Will Travel," and on and on. Also, a galaxy of stars got their first national exposure on radio: Bob Hope, Frank Sinatra, Bing Crosby, Benny and on and on.
I was particularly intrigued by what both books had to say about theater on radio because the new radio realm known as podcasting has been increasingly active in offering that diversion. In a recent feature story in The New York Times, Emma Dibdin writes, "Audio dramas have been around for almost as long as radio, but the podcasting boom has inspired a renaissance." She then offers some suggestions for binge listening.
Schaden devotes a chapter of his book to Those Were the Days Radio Players, which was born in 1991 when, acting on an idea proposed by old-time radio fan Tom Tirpak, he asked his listeners if any of them might like to stage and perform vintage radio shows. Within a week, more than 150 people had signed up. It's still going strong in various local chapters and similarly by an outfit called the SAG-AFTRA Senior Radio Players. Though most members aren't old enough to have heard the original productions of the material they perform, they all seem to share the belief that the good old radio days were broadcast's most creative, imaginative and entertaining ones.
Though the first regularly scheduled radio station came alive in Pittsburgh in 1920, Chicago was an important player ever since Robert R. McCormick, the owner of the Tribune, was smitten early, calling radio "the little box that picks sounds from the air."
He started WGN-AM 720 and in 1925 sent some folks to Dayton, Tennessee, to provide the first live coverage of a courtroom trial. It was the so-called "Scopes Monkey Trial" and when the radio folks arrived in Dayton, the mayor of the town invited them to stay at his house. Announcer Quin Ryan recalled, "We were like moon men here. The radio guys from outer space!"
That captures some of what made radio such a 20th century marvel and influential medium. It is hard for most to imagine what an important part radio played in people's lives. Everybody listened. In 1930, some 12 million U.S. households owned a radio. By 1939 this total had exploded to almost 30 million. It was a cheap form of entertainment, providing the public with far better entertainment than most people were accustomed to or could afford.
Radio is all about memory, your mind filled with images frozen in time and sound.
At the end of Schaden's book, one hears from Steve Darnall, who has been the producer and host of "Those Were the Days" and publisher of its accompanying magazine Nostalgia Digest, since Schaden's retirement in 2009. He writes, "We're living with the past, not in it. ... In doing so, perhaps we can offer some ideas that might proves useful for the future."
He is probably right, but he made me remember a conversation I had long ago with Schaden, who told me, "With radio, you must use your own imagination. You are drawn closer to the experience. There is an intimacy to radio. You must provide the pictures yourself, and each person sees something a little different. With radio you are not a passive spectator. You must use the screen of your mind."

Texto completo: A small detail in the season finale of "Breaking Bad" provided the title for the upcoming follow-up movie.
Jesse Pinkman, played by Aaron Paul, drove off in a Chevy El Camino and the new film will reveal Pinkman's life after the conclusion of the Emmy-winning drama.
Netflix released a one-minute teaser for "El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie" Saturday with the question, "What happened to Jesse Pinkman?"
However, the teaser has no signs of Pinkman. It's all Skinny Pete, played by Charles Baker, in a police interrogation.
video
"I don't know what to tell you, I only said, like, 500 times already," Skinny Pete says at the clip's opening. "I have no idea where he is. Don't know where he's headed either. North, south, east, west, Mexico, the moon -- I don't have a clue. But yo, even if I did, I wouldn't tell you."
Pinkman was a meth cook and former partner of terminally-ill Walter White (Bryan Cranston) in the series that wrapped up six years ago.
Netflix released only one line about the movie's storyline: "In the wake of his dramatic escape from captivity, Jesse must come to terms with his past in order to forge some kind of future."
And Paul didn't reveal much more in an interview with The New York Times.
"It's a chapter of 'Breaking Bad' that I didn't realize that I wanted," Paul told The Times. "And now that I have it, I'm so happy that it's there."
Paul refused to reveal if any of the other "Breaking Bad" cast members will appear in "El Camino."
"All I can say, I think people will be really happy with what they see," he told The Times.
It hits Netflix Oct. 11.

The Significance of the 1619 Project

Texto completo: Jesse L. Jackson, Sr.
On Sunday, the New York Times unveiled “The 1619 Project,” a journalistic series in the Sunday magazine that seeks to tell the “unvarnished truth” about slavery and its impact on America’s history.
In 1619, just 12 years after the founding of the first permanent English settlement in the Americas, the Jamestown colonists bought the first slaves, 20 to 30 enslaved Africans, from English pirates.
The Declaration of Independence, penned by Thomas Jefferson, a slave owner, issued America’s founding creed: “We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal, … endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, … among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.”
As Nikole Hannah-Jones writes in her stunning introduction in the New York Times Magazine, at 43, she is part of the first generation of black Americans in the history of this country to be born into a society in which blacks had equal rights of citizenship.
Blacks suffered under slavery for 250 years, and brutal racial apartheid for a century more.
We have been legally free for just 50.
Americans prefer not to face this reality. Our history classes address it gingerly, if at all.
The Statue of Liberty. ©Usa Pyon/Dreamstime.com.
Even as President Donald Trump and cynical politicians stoke racial divisions for political profit, we too often look away from it. Trump has recently decided to make four young, newly elected congresswomen of color a central target of his already launched campaign for re-election, scorning them as un-American, suggesting that if they don’t like America, they should go back to where they came from.
This though all four are American citizens, and three were born right here. Trump is poisonously invoking the old lie of slavery and segregation that people of color are somehow not real Americans.
Yet, as Roger Wilkins wrote in his book “Jefferson’s Pillow” and Hannah-Jones in her introduction, it is the freedom struggles of black Americans that propelled the cause of equal rights for everyone.
The Constitution excluded women, Native Americans and black people, and did not provide the right to vote to most Americans. It is the laws born out of the civil rights movement that extended the right to vote to everyone and banned discrimination not simply on race, but on gender, nationality, religion and disability.
Without the idealistic and patriotic struggle of black Americans, as Hannah-Jones notes, “our democracy today would most likely look very different — it might not be a democracy at all.”
Recently, Ken Cuccinelli, Trump’s acting director of the Citizenship and Immigration Services, sparked outrage when he brazenly reworded Emma Lazarus’ famous poem found at the foot of the Statute of Liberty that reads “give us your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free…”
What Cuccinelli probably had no clue about is that the Statute of Liberty was a gift to the people of the United States from the people of France and was dedicated in 1886 to celebrate the national abolition of slavery.
It is the figure of Libertas, the Roman goddess of freedom.
A broken shackle and chain lie at her feet as she strides forward, commemorating the abolition of slavery in 1865, an abolition that turned out to be the first step in America becoming in fact, as well as in word, the land of the free.
In telling the “unvarnished truth” of slavery, we will face the horrors of our past, as well as the triumph of our progress. It is a telling that is long overdue.

Texto completo: FOXBOROUGH — Carolina Panthers safety Eric Reid is a man of conviction and action. One of the NFL's most passionate players in the fight for social justice, he doesn't shy away from delivering pointed messages with his pads or his words. His intentions are true, sometimes his aim is not.
That was the case when Reid levied a late hit on Patriots tight end Benjamin Watson in the first quarter of Thursday night's preseason game at Gillette Stadium, ending Watson's night with a concussion. It's also the case when it comes to rapper Jay-Z lining up with the NFL.
Reid, along with Miami wide receiver Kenny Stills, offered pointed criticism of Jay-Z for entering into an entertainment and social justice partnership with the NFL on Aug. 14. Reid called it “a money move" and said the rap mogul “capitalized on this situation" while bemoaning Jay-Z's statement that the movement has “moved past kneeling."
Jay-Z's statement was patronizing to Colin Kaepernick and players who have and continue to protest during the national anthem. But two prominent African-American voices for change on the same side of the systemic racism issue feuding is exactly what detractors want. It's the social change version of a play-action fake and Reid bit on it. It draws the attention and the onus away from the issues of inequality and injustice and puts it on division among those trying to foster that change. It's an intellectual countermeasure designed to detract from the importance of the movement and diminish its effectiveness.
They want us fighting amongst ourselves instead of fighting for equality. No minority group is a monolith. There is always going to be disagreement about the proper and most effective approach to change. It's reasonable to disagree on the methods, but it shouldn't drown out the message in the public conscious. That's counterproductive. The motivation and the goal remain the same, despite disagreements on the approach.
Reid didn't back down or back off any of his statements, but he understands that his critique of Jay-Z can undercut the larger issue.
“It's almost divide and conquer. Get people split on the narrative," said Reid. “I think the conversation needs to shift back to the NFL, not so much Jay-Z. Again, I'm going to call out what I see. I'm going to call it how I see it, which I've done. But the NFL is still blackballing Colin and still pretending that they're addressing social injustice."
It has been three years since Reid's friend and former San Francisco 49ers teammate Kaepernick gave the QB kneel-down a whole new meaning by protesting during the national anthem. Reid was the first player to join him and is one of the few remaining players continuing with the Kaepernick-style peaceable protests.
“I think I just want to be able to sleep at night, and for me to believe what I believe and to see what's happening in this country and to not say something it wouldn't sit right with me," said the safety. “Like we've said from the beginning, we're trying to give a voice to the people who don't have a voice."
It's easy for Kaepernick and Reid to feel like the movement they were at the vanguard of has been co-opted while they've paid the price. Kaepernick is out of the league. Reid had a difficult time finding a job last year before he was signed by the Panthers in Week 4. Both Kaepernick and Reid settled collusion suits against the NFL related to their employment opportunities. This offseason, Carolina re-signed Reid to a three-year, $22 million deal.
That's why comments like this one from Jay-Z in his press conference with NFL commissioner Roger Goodell rankle Reid. It feels like a betrayal and a usurpation.
“Everyone's saying, 'How are you going forward if Kap doesn't have a job?' " said Jay-Z. “This was not about him having a job. That became part of it. We know what it is — now how do we address that injustice? What's the way forward?"
Despite the league's pledge of $89 million over seven years to support social justices initiatives, Reid remains wary that the league really just wants to put an end to the protests that have proven polarizing among NFL fans. He remembers a summit between players and owners in October of 2017.
“The bottom line with that meeting was just to get people to stop protesting. They didn't seem very concerned with actually addressing social injustice," said Reid.
He feels the union with Jay-Z is more of the same. That partnership was brokered in part by Patriots owner Robert Kraft, who is friendly with Jay-Z and was active along with Philadelphia 76ers co-owner Michael Rubin in advocating for the release of rapper Meek Mill from jail and for wider criminal justice reform. (Rubin attended Thursday's preseason game.)
It's complicated because Kraft and other owners are open and active social justice advocates, but also have made political contributions to President Donald Trump, who has demeaned players for demonstrating. Stills called out his team's owner, Stephen Ross, for that contradictory stance.
“I still think there is a narrative out there that we should be happy with any efforts toward social justice, and that's true," said Reid. “But what we can't separate is the fact that the NFL is blackballing the person that brought this to the forefront of their platform. But they say that it's bigger than him. It's PR for y'all. Y'all weren't doing anything social justice-related until Colin protested. Now, y'all are addressing it to calm people down, to say they're addressing what we're concerned about."
One of the speculated, unwritten parts of Jay-Z's team up with the NFL is that he'll have a path to an ownership stake in a team. The onus is on the rap impresario to prove that this deal with his Roc Nation company, which includes advising the NFL on musical acts, will foster meaningful change on the social justice front.
This isn't the first time Reid has feuded with folks aligned philosophically, but not strategically, with him on tackling these issues. Reid has been an outspoken critic of the Players Coalition, which has emerged as the most powerful force among NFL players for social initiatives. Reid got into an on-field confrontation with Players Coalition co-founder Philadelphia Eagles safety Malcolm Jenkins last season and regrettably called Jenkins a “sellout."
Reid derisively called the Jay-Z agreement “Players Coalition 2.0." That sparked a Twitter rebuttal from Watson, who along with Devin McCourty is a member of the coalition's 12-member task force.
Some drew a link between Watson's tweet and Reid's late hit, which is being reviewed by the league.
“I didn't even know that he tweeted that," said Reid, who asked Watson if he was OK and attempted to give him a hand up post-hit. “That's not even something that you process in a game. I'm not analyzing who has the ball in their hands and what they tweeted at me while I'm playing the game."
Agree with his approach or not, Reid is knowledgeable and passionate about the cause. Just read his New York Times op-ed. That can't be disputed.
What can be is whether he is engaging in too much friendly fire.
The lyrics from Jay-Z's song “Family Feud" apply: “We all lose when the family feuds."

NOTHING LIKE A GOOD CAMPING TRIP TO GET READY FOR FOOTBALL

Texto completo: Two hot dogs.
That's what The Fumbler had Tuesday night.
The one in his left hand was topped with ketchup. The one attached to the leash in his right hand was sweating while watching the Pirates game at Pup Night at PNC Park.
Hey, they're called the dog days of summer for a reason, right?
The Fumbler is a dog lover, and not just the furry ones. He's a big fan of underdogs, particularly when it comes to high school football.
The 2019 season kicks off Friday in stadiums throughout Western Pennsylvania. Which underdog stories will step to the forefront this fall?
How great would it be if Southmoreland ends its 40-year playoff drought, the longest in the WPIAL? The Scotties last appeared in the postseason in November of 1979. A month earlier, the Pirates won the World Series.
Carrick is easy to root for. The Raiders forfeited their final two games last season due to having such a thin roster. They're back this season playing an independent schedule. With a new coach trying to build excitement - and depth - might the Raiders become a feel-good story?
At 22 games, Uniontown owns the longest losing streak in the WPIAL. It would be a pretty big deal if the Red Raiders upset Connellsville on Friday.
All this dog talk reminds The Fumbler that he has a question for you.
Why did the Dalmatian always hide from people? Because he didn't want to be spotted.
Here are his thoughts on this weekend's top games:
Penn Hills at Pine-Richland, 7 Friday - On a scale of 1 to 10, this Week 0 game might be a 9 or 10. It's rare for two defending WPIAL champions to square off, so this should be a treat. Penn Hills did one-up Pine-Richland last season, though. The Indians also claimed a PIAA title. But that was the past. Let's talk about the present and near future. Both teams are good again this season. But with more talent returning, including running back Luke Meckler and quarterback Cole Spencer, reigning Class 6A champs will be better Friday. Winner: Pine-Richland.
Mt. Lebanon at Gateway, 7 Friday - "We got Palko'd." That's what Gateway coach Don Holl said about his team's upset loss to Bob Palko-led West Allegheny in last year's WPIAL Class 5A semifinals. Gateway doesn't play West Allegheny to begin this season, but as it turns out, the Gators can't get away from Palko. This is the first game of the Palko era at Mt. Lebanon. It says here that the Blue Devils will be one of the best teams in Class 6A. They're still a work in progress, though. Friday, Gateway star Derrick Davis will work them. Winner: Gateway.
Upper St. Clair at South Fayette, 7 Friday - Jim Render picked up his 399th career win when USC edged South Fayette, 34-33, in last year's opener. He won No. 400 the following week. A year later, Render is now retired, and South Fayette is the reigning WPIAL Class 4A champion. The Lions saw their 57-game regular-season winning streak end with that loss to USC last season. No problem. They started a new win streak the following week. It now stands at nine. How will Mike Junko do in his debut as USC's coach? Winner: South Fayette.
Aliquippa at Clairton, 6 Saturday - Clairton 52, Aliquippa 16. That was the final score when these perennial powers met in a much-anticipated showdown at Clairton's Neil C. Brown Stadium three years ago. Lamont Wade rushed for about 3,972 yards and 39 touchdowns. Aliquippa got some payback the following season, making this the rubber match. Both teams are ranked No. 1 in their respective classes. They have both had lots of great skill players in recent years, but line play will be the difference in this one. The super-sized Quips will prevail. Winner: Aliquippa.

As Epstein Inquiry Grows, Jail Workers Face Scrutiny

Texto completo: The warden and the head of the federal Bureau of Prisons have been reassigned. Two employees accused of sleeping on the job and falsifying records have been placed on administrative leave.
Now, roughly 15 employees at the Metropolitan Correctional Center where Jeffrey Epstein killed himself in his jail cell have been subpoenaed as the criminal investigation into the events around his suicide intensifies, according to a prison official and a person with knowledge of the matter.
The subpoenas, issued in recent days by federal prosecutors in Manhattan, are the latest sign of the heightened scrutiny over the suicide of the high-profile detainee at the chronically understaffed federal jail.
The United States attorney general, William P. Barr, whose Justice Department oversees the Bureau of Prisons, has complained about "serious irregularities at this facility." On Wednesday he went further, telling reporters in Dallas, "unfortunately, there have been some delays because a number of the witnesses were not cooperative."
The suicide of Mr. Epstein, 66, a wealthy financier who had been accused of sexually abusing dozens of girls, has put pressure on Mr. Barr to explain how such a prominent defendant was left unsupervised long enough to hang himself.
[Saying it had tallied $ 800,000 in donations from Jeffrey Epstein, M.I.T. announced an inquiry into its dealings with him.]
It was unclear which employees had received subpoenas, but Mr. Barr said on Wednesday that a number of witnesses at the jail were requiring union representation and lawyers before they would agree to interviews.
Eric Young, the president of the union that represents federal prison workers, disputed Mr. Barr's claim that jail employees had been uncooperative. He said the Justice Department had been unwilling to grant immunity to workers.
"The Justice Department would like employees to waive away their minimum constitutional right to representation," Mr. Young said in an interview on Thursday. "That's what they consider to be a cooperative employee."
The two staff members in the special housing unit where Mr. Epstein was held -- 9 South -- are accused of falsely recording in a log that they had checked on Mr. Epstein every 30 minutes, as was required. But Mr. Epstein, who had been removed from suicide watch after apparently trying to kill himself on July 23, had not been checked on for about three hours, several law enforcement and prison officials with knowledge of the matter have said.
The subpoenas seek testimony from the jail employees and are part of an inquiry being conducted by the F.B.I., prosecutors with the Southern District of New York and investigators from the New York office of the Department of Justice's inspector general, said a person with knowledge of the investigation, who asked to remain anonymous because he was not authorized to speak on the matter. It was unclear whether the subpoenas also sought records or other materials.
The New York City medical examiner determined that Mr. Epstein's Aug. 10 death was a suicide by hanging. Still, that has not quashed unfounded conspiracy theories that claim other people may have played a role in silencing Mr. Epstein, whose social circle included celebrities, academics and powerful politicians.
A decade ago, Mr. Epstein served 13 months in a Florida jail and registered as a sex offender after pleading guilty to state prostitution charges under a highly criticized agreement that, at the time, shielded him from federal prosecution.
He was arrested in July by F.B.I. agents and New York police detectives at Teterboro Airport and charged with federal sex trafficking following renewed interest in his case.
The Justice Department has announced high-level staffing changes since Mr. Epstein's suicide.
The acting director of the Bureau of Prisons, Hugh Hurwitz, was reassigned on Monday, and the warden of the Manhattan jail, Lamine N'Diaye, was transferred to an office in Philadelphia.
The Metropolitan Correctional Center and other federal prisons across the country have been dealing with rising levels of violence and other safety problems as the Trump administration, in its quest to shrink the government, has curtailed prison hiring, according to an investigation by The New York Times last year.
Some prisons, including the Manhattan jail, have been so pressed for guards that they have forced teachers, nurses, cooks and other support staff members to step in. One of the staff members who was guarding Mr. Epstein when he died was not a regular correctional officer, but instead worked in the business office, according to three prison officials.
Staffing shortages existed before Mr. Trump took office, but a governmentwide hiring freeze imposed just days into his administration pushed the Bureau of Prisons's employment into free-fall. The freeze was lifted elsewhere in April 2017, but remained in place at the bureau for several more months.
The Bureau of Prisons employs 15,012 correctional officers nationwide, down from 16,623 in December 2016, according to data provided by the agency.
At the Manhattan jail, there are 111 officers, down from 137 at the end of 2016. There are currently 17 vacant positions for correctional officers at the jail, according to the Bureau of Prisons.
The last suicide at the Manhattan jail before Mr. Epstein's was in 2006, according to the bureau.
Katie Benner and Christina Goldbaum contributed reporting.

New York State bans declawing cats

Texto completo: The New York bill outlaws a variety of declawing surgeries unless medically necessary for the cat, and imposes a fine of up to $1,000 on veterinarians who perform them, the New York Times reported.
Cat declawing involves severing through tendons and nerves and removal of part of the toe/finger bone. The practice is banned in many European countries and Canadian provinces, as well as the U.S. cities of Los Angeles, San Francisco and Denver. However, the New York State Veterinary Medical Society opposed the bill, arguing in a statement that there were circumstances in which declawing would be best for the well-being of cats and owners, and that the ultimate decision should be left up to veterinarians in consultation with their clients.
Other vets supported the bill. Rochester, New York-based veterinarian Michelle Brownstein said she stopped offering the procedure 15 years ago when she became convinced it caused cats to develop chronic pain or long-term behavioral problems.
“The end result is a barbaric procedure that results in the mutilation of the animal,” she told the Associated Press. “Frankly, if you’re worried about your furniture, then you shouldn’t be getting a cat.”
“About bloody time,” as we say in my country of origin, where no British veterinarian would consider declawing cats as a routine service for their clients. For details about the harmful consequences of this radical surgical mutilation, visit my website, drfoxonehealth.com.
Toxic algae threatens dogs in affected waterways
A dog died after playing in the St. John River in Fredericton, New Brunswick, where toxic blue-green algae blooms are frequent. Veterinarian Colleen Bray says the dog’s symptoms are consistent with blue-green algae exposure, and dog owners are urged to avoid the area. (CTV, Canada, 7/14)
In most regions of North America currently experiencing climate change-related increases in heat and precipitation, ideal conditions are being created for the proliferation of toxic algae in fresh-water lakes and streams. This puts dogs who drink contaminated water at risk.
Also: Dog owners and walkers, beware! Also, remember that hot pavement can blister dogs’ feet, and in hot and humid weather, they need extra water to stay cool and to avoid heat stroke.

Texto completo: For the Monitor
The Aug. 3 Sunday New York Times included an article headlined “The Global Machine Behind the Rise of Far-Right Nationalism.” It chronicles the efforts of Russian operatives and neo-Nazi supporters to undermine Sweden's commitment to pluralism and democracy. But in exposing the dirty tricks of the anti-immigrant “Sweden Democratic” party and its Russian conspirators, the article never mentions the word “fascism.”
We associate “fascism” with Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini – the Nazi/fascist menace we defeated in World War II at the cost of millions of lives. During the Cold War, when someone was called a “communist,” the response was often to hit back with “fascist.” We hear echoes of the word from time to time in animated political speech, and most of us pay it little attention.
“Fascism” can seem a relic of the past century. But it is time to re-examine this word in today's terms, to see if it is just a historical anecdote or constitutes a real and present danger to democracy and to values of fairness, decency, caring, justice, equality, diversity, peace and freedom. The danger of using the term loosely – such as to describe as “fascist” people who consider themselves “conservatives” – is matched by the danger of assuming that fascism no longer poses a genuine threat, or applies to only a few strongman dictators.
Let's consider if this word, “fascism,” accurately describes growing conditions in the world and in America.
My dictionary, after recounting its history, says “fascism tends to include a belief in the supremacy of one national or ethnic group, a contempt for democracy, an insistence on obedience to a powerful leader, and a strong demagogic approach.”
But this definition leaves out what is perhaps fascism's major threat: the belief that “might makes right,” that “non-whites endanger our civilization,” that “staying in power by any means is the goal,” that “opposition to a fascist ruler is unpatriotic and justifies beatings, torture and murder,” and that once a nation allows fascists to take power – whether through elections or a coup d'etat – that nation will never again be permitted to freely change its mind. Only a revolution or military defeat by an anti-fascist force will restore the possibility of democracy.
Attraction to fascism arises out of fear of the “other,” disdain for compromise, a desire to overthrow the current political system, hatred of immigrants, and patriotic fervor, and it leads to attacks on the free press and an independent judiciary and condoning violence against those who disagree. Many would claim that these conditions already exist in Russia, Turkey, Poland, and Hungary, and are on the rise as well in France, Italy, England, and, yes, Sweden and Germany. Others point out that these trends menace us here in America as well. Fascism attracts those who have little exposure to discussions on universal human rights, those who feel economically marginalized, who feel that “our country is being taken over by alien cultures,” and who are ready to give their allegiance to a powerful male leader who promises to cure all their problems.
Fascism, if it comes to America, will arrive without swastikas, tanks or “Heil Hitler” salutes. It will call itself “national democracy” and will play upon fears of racial pollution, elitism, LGBT immorality, big government and even corporate greed. It will be heralded as “the revenge of the common man,” “the end to crime and deviant behavior” and a “patriotic defense of American greatness.”
It will sound the trumpet of “time for a change.” Only the change it brings about will be permanent. There will be no more elections, other than the kind of farce Russia's Putin or China's Xi put on. Slowly at first, then with astonishing rapidity, it will subvert our democratic traditions, restrict our basic freedoms, silence its critics through violence and intimidation – all in the interest of keeping us safe, guarding our cultural heritage, and taking long overdue revenge on intellectuals and deviants.
The time to combat the very real threat of fascism is before it begins to pit one group of Americans against others. That time is now, because the preconditions for fascism may have already begun to unfold.

Kennedy vs. Markey? It'd be a real fight

Texto completo: FRAMINGHAM — It would be a fight.
Voters at a Wednesday evening town hall meeting hosted by Senator Edward J. Markey were split on the prospect of congressman Joe Kennedy III running against him for the Democratic nomination, a bid Kennedy is said to be considering.
“The whole idea is craziness," said Mike Hugo, a Democrat from Framingham who gave his age as “senior citizen."
“I think it's a shame," he said. “When somebody is doing a great job in office, and someone else wants to step in, I wonder about ego."
Hugo added that he quite likes Kennedy and “thinks he should stay in Congress for now."
But asked about a potential Kennedy challenge, Danny Rizzo of Woburn responded with two words: “good idea!"
The independent-leaning Democrat was angry Markey isn't taking the fight hard enough to President Trump.
“Markey should be much more involved with the bad situations we're in with Trump," he said, shaking his head.
“Markey has done a good job during his years, but," he said, it's time for “young blood," someone who will push back more vociferously against the president.
Even though the town hall was about the Green New Deal — and held in late August, a typically sleepy political month — many of the hundreds of people walking into a Framingham High School auditorium were up-to-date on the prospect of a Kennedy-Markey primary fight. It's a matchup that has riveted Massachusetts since The New York Times reported last week that Kennedy was mulling a 2020 run against Markey.
That story followed news of a poll Kennedy had commissioned over the summer.
A person who has seen the survey's results said Wednesday that it showed Kennedy with a lead over Markey, outside the margin of error. The person said it found Kennedy doing especially well in his district, which stretches from Brookline to Fall River, as well as in other areas, including Boston, Cape Cod, and west of Worcester. Markey, a former representative, showed strength in his old district, which includes suburbs around Boston that are rich with Democratic votes.
Wherever the hypothetical race stands, several voters in Framingham seemed uneasy about the prospect.
Cynthia Ellis, a Democrat from Concord, said she wants to learn more about a potential Kennedy Senate bid. “I think Ed Markey's just a very strong, experienced candidate," Ellis said of the 73-year-old.
Markey has worked to show strength in recent days, as talk of a challenge by Kennedy, 38, grew.
He released an endorsement video from Senator Elizabeth Warren, something that hadn't gone unnoticed by the people filing into Wednesday's gathering.
Maxine Bellew, a retired high school teacher who lives in Marlborough, said both Kennedy and Markey are strong candidates. Markey “is good. I respect him. And he's endorsed by Elizabeth Warren," the 75-year-old said, approvingly. As if to underscore how much the endorsement meant, she said she has “ tremendous respect" for Warren.
And Markey was poised, an aide said, to earn the endorsement on Thursday of the Sunrise Movement, a group of young people devoted to stopping climate change.
Before taking the stage at the town hall, Markey was fired up. “Donald Trump has brought out a fight in me that is stronger than at any point in my career. I'm more energized because of what he poses as a threat to Massachusetts values," Markey told the Globe.
On stage, he spoke at length about several climate issues — he cosponsored the Green New Deal with Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York — as well as gun control. That drew a standing ovation.
Before the event, some voters said they were trying to learn more about how Markey and Kennedy line up on issues, while others seemed to already have a good sense of where the two liberal politicians land.
“I don't see the Kennedys as any more progressive than Markey," said a registered Democrat from Maynard, a 73-year-old woman who declined to give her name.
Kennedy hasn't publicly addressed the prospect of a Senate bid, but a spokeswoman has said he is running for reelection to his House seat — notably using the present tense.
The town hall meeting drew voter questions that ranged from carbon-sequestration technology to vegetarianism to Section 704 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996. The eventwas cohosted by Representative Katherine Clark of Melrose, a member of the congressional delegation who has not endorsed Markey for reelection.
Earlier Wednesday, in an appearance on the radio, she declined to endorse Markey. “I don't have any endorsements to announce today," Clark said on WBUR-FM.
Clark praised Markey for his “incredible leadership" on environmental issues, saying he “has helped us as a country come to understand what's at stake." But she also had kind words for Kennedy.
“Joe Kennedy is also a great colleague and a friend and someone that I am close to," Clark said. “But it's a hypothetical primary at this point. I value them both as great colleagues and mentors, and we will see how this all plays out."
Clark added that “primaries ultimately are up to the voters, and I think both of them have great records to run on."
Clark, a top member of the House Democratic leadership, was first elected in 2013, filling the seat Markey vacated when he won John F. Kerry's Senate seat after Kerry was appointed US secretary of state.

A national crisis: Surging hate crimes and white supremacists

Texto completo: A Saturday morning shooting rampage in El Paso, Texas on August 3 took the lives of 22 people, and seriously injured more than two dozen others. Reportedly, the alleged shooter wanted to kill as many Mexicans as he could. Armed with safety glasses, ear coverings and an assault-style rifle, the shooter entered a Walmart store during a back-to-school sale.
"Saturday's attack on El Paso was an attack on the Mexican heritage of millions of Americans - and also part of a history of white supremacist and nativist acts in Texas across three centuries," wrote Hector Tobar, in a recent New York Times op-ed. Tobar, an associate professor at the University of California at Irvine is also a published author.
Later that day during evening hours and nearly 1,600 miles away in Dayton, Ohio, another gunman's attack left 9 people dead and 27 injured in that city's Oregon district. Like the Texas shooter, Ohio's shooter was heavily armed but was shot by police before he could enter a nightclub where he could have killed far more. The victims of this shooting reflected the city's diversity and included Blacks, Latinos, and whites.
How in a span of only 24-hours, could two cities in different states and regions suffer mass shootings - one in a city only a few miles from the nation's southern border, and the other, a former Midwestern manufacturing hub?
Despite the shock of two unprovoked attacks, family and community members in both cities must somehow cope through their grief while preparing funeral arrangements. These two communities are also challenging governmental officials at both the state and federal levels to take actions to prevent further fatalities.
Nationally, a profusion of prayers and condolences from the nation together signaled that a tragic moment may yet be transformed into a ground-swell movement that reckons with the American conscience. The profusion of assault weapons combined with easy access is a gripping issue that confronts us all.
In response to these and other tragedies, a rainbow coalition of leaders held a noon rally on August 6 in the nation's capital. In a joint statement, the Leadership Conference for Civil and Human Rights was joined by key partners including but not limited to the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, Voto Latino, the Center for Community Self-Help and the Center for Responsible Lending.
"None of this is acceptable," said the leaders in a written statement. "None of this is normal. Our organizations are united in saying that Members of Congress can no longer look away as communities of color are murdered with impunity. We must all unite and demand accountability."
The NAACP is additionally calling for the passage of the bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2019. Passed on a bipartisan House vote of 240-190 on February 27, the bill has yet to be taken up by the Senate. The bill would address both background check requirements for firearms, and firearm transfers between private individuals.
Beyond congressional actions, however, other spheres of influence can also take an active role in curbing violence. For example, corporate leaders could publicly condemn efforts to demonize immigrants, minorities or other groups targeted for hate crimes and violence. In pulpits across the country, pastors should preach about the moral dilemma the nation faces and call upon congregants to live their faith every day. Community-based organizations can call upon state and local officials to also speak out against senseless acts of violence and white supremacists.
Now is also a time to remember that regardless of race or ethnicity, our history chronicles the range of hate crimes that have taken the lives of Latinos as well as Native Americans, Blacks, Jews, and the LGBTQ community. The terror now facing America's Latinos resurrects these horrors, particularly how Blacks encountered racial hatred for more than a century during Jim Crow era and later during the civil rights struggles of the 1950s and 1960s.
Too many times in recent years, our unique Black American experience we remain at risk as a people. In 1998 the body of James Byrd, a black, 49-year old Jasper, Texas man was ripped to pieces as it was drug over a mile and a half by whites driving a pick-up truck. Other and more recent heinous hate crimes remind us of Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown, Eric Garner, and Tamir Rice -just to name a few.
According to Rutgers University, Black men today are 2.5 times more likely than white men to be victims of violence. From 2013 to 2017, 11,456 fatal encounters with police and members of the public were reported.
At the same time, the emergence of hate groups has been on the rise, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC).
"The total number of hate groups rose to 1,020 in 2018, up about 7 percent from 2017," wrote Heidi Beirich, who leads SPLC's Intelligence Project and its award-winning publication, The Intelligence Report.
Its report released this February found that white nationalist groups grew from 100 in 2017 to 148 the following year, 2018 - a 50% growth. Other hate groups - anti-Semitic, anti-LGBTQ, and anti-Muslim - also grew during these same years from 233 to 264. While the Ku Klux Klan dominated hate groups in the Jim Crow and civil rights eras, its presence across the country now appears to have been eclipsed by the growth of neo-Nazis, white nationalists, and skin head organizations.
SPLC's Hate Map by State shows that the largest number of statewide hate groups are located in California (83), Florida (75), and Texas (73). At the local level, additional hate organizations currently operate in Dallas, Los Angeles, San Diego, and Tallahassee. Beyond these three states, hate groups can also be found in 45 other states and in more metropolitan areas such as Atlanta, Chicago, New York City, Sacramento, Philadelphia and Pittsburgh.
Just as the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. prompted the enactment of major civil rights legislation, now is another time for our nation to stand up to the many forms of domestic terrorism that plague the nation. People of conscience and principle have a duty to stand up, speak out for the fullness of our "inalienable rights".

Texto completo: A year ago last Friday, more than 200 newspapers across the U.S. ran editorials decrying President Donald Trump’s repeated application of the term "enemies of the people" to describe the press and reinforcing the need for a vibrant free press in a healthy democracy. There is still cause for concern.
Since that show of solidarity, the U.S. has fallen three places in Reporters Without Borders’ World Press Freedom Index ranking. We’re now 48th out of 180 countries surveyed.
Data compiled by the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker points to an escalation in violence: By April, there had been 10 reported attacks on journalists this year alone and 46 since 2017, including a reporter in California who was struck in the face and had her phone stolen as she interviewed voters.
It’s not just the U.S. In some places, threats against journalists are now "occupational hazards" — in Brazil, supporters of President Jair Bolsonaro have attacked members of the media both online and physically.
And President Trump continues to attack the media, revisiting the "enemy of the people" slogan in June when he accused The New York Times of a "virtual act of treason."
The press is not perfect, to be sure. But to vilify the entire institution poses a very real danger to America’s freedom.
Why is the assault on the press dangerous?
* It undermines our democracy.
* It allows those in power to say, "Ignore the facts no matter what the facts may be."
* It allows partisans of both parties to say, "Believe in my distortions because you agree with my ideology." Or, "because you agree with my cult personality."
* It allows anyone who screws up to say, "The problem’s not me; the problem’s the messenger."
The "enemy of the people" refrain can provide a useful political rhetorical slogan. But repeating such a slogan, a practice common among history’s strongmen, and infusing it with a tone of legitimacy is not a harmless political device.
Writer Richard Frankel described the impact in a June 9 article for Salon: "After all," he wrote, "enemies are not debated. Enemies are not reasoned with. One doesn’t compromise with an enemy. An enemy is confronted, is combated, is neutralized, and ultimately, an enemy is destroyed. The point at which politics shifts from truth to lies, from opponents to enemies, is the point at which democracy dies."
That distinction, that warning, is as important to remember today as it was a year ago.
Facts matter. Support a Free Press.

President Trump’s deregulatory promise: John Stossel

Texto completo: President Donald Trump promised he’d get rid of bad rules.
“Remove the anchor dragging us down!” he said when campaigning for president. “We’re going to cancel every needless job-killing regulation!”
Trump was a developer, so he knew that the thicket of rules government imposes often makes it impossible to get things done.
But would he keep his deregulation promise? I was skeptical.
Republicans often talk deregulation but then add rules. People called President George W. Bush an “anti-regulator.” But once he was president, he hired 90,000 new regulators!
Trump has been different.
When he took office, he hired regulation skeptics. He told government agencies: Get rid of two regulations for every new one you add.
I think his anti-regulation attitude is why stock prices rose and unemployment dropped. Trump sent a message to business: Government will no longer try to crush you. Businesses then started hiring.
Of course, the media wasn’t happy. Reporters love regulation.
They call Trump’s moves “an attack on the environment” and on “workers’ health.” The New York Times ran the headline “Donald Trump Is Trying to Kill You!”
What the media don’t get is that regulations have unintended side effects that often outweigh the good they’re intended to do.
Cars built smaller to comply with President Obama’s rules that require doubling of gas mileage cause increased deaths because smaller cars provide less protection.
“Should the government tell you what kind of car to buy?” asks Grover Norquist of Americans for Tax Reform in my new video about Trump.
Norquist says that Trump has largely kept his deregulation promise, and that’s been great for America.
For example, Trump repealed the Obama-era plan to classify franchise businesses like McDonald’s as one single business. Why?
“The trial lawyers want to be able to sue all of McDonald’s, not just the local McDonald’s, if they spill coffee on themselves,” says Norquist. “And the labor unions want to unionize all McDonald’s, not just the one store. That would have been a disaster.”
Trump’s FCC repealed Obama’s “net neutrality” rule, which would have limited internet providers’ freedom to charge different prices.
Democrats and other regulation-lovers predicted repeal would mean that rich people would dominate the internet. Bernie Sanders even tweeted that repeal would mean “the end of the internet as we know it.”
Of course, none of those things happened. Or as Norquist puts it: “None of it! None of it!”
But some Obama regulations sounded so important.
Norquist laughs at that. “The names for these regulations are written by regulators. They’re advertisements for themselves.”
Of course, unlike advertisers, regulators don’t list side effects of their rules, which Norquist says should read: “May cause unemployment, may reduce wages, may raise the cost of energy, may make your car not drivable.”
Trump’s deregulation record would be better were he not so eager to add regulations, such as tariffs, at the same time.
“There is a challenge. Trump is a protectionist in many ways,” says Norquist, sadly. “Tariffs are taxes, and regulations on the border are regulations on consumers.”
So are Trump’s “buy American” rules.
“That sounds like a good idea, but it’s a dumb idea, and I wish he hadn’t done it,” says Norquist. “That is not deregulation. The good news is that the vast majority of the acts have been deregulatory and tremendously helpful.”
Recently, Trump announced, “We have cut 22 regulations for every new regulation!”
He exaggerated, as he often does. The real number is about five. But that’s still pretty good. Better than Ronald Reagan did.
I wish Trump would do more.
I wish he’d remove his tariffs and agricultural subsidies and kill the Export-Import Bank, drug prohibition and the onerous rules that encourage illegal immigration by making it almost impossible for foreigners to work here legally.
Keep your promise, President Trump! Repeal 22 regulations for every new one!
Nevertheless, so far, mostly good.
Every excessive rule repealed is a step in the right direction: toward freedom.

Texto completo: This column is not in the business of forecasting recessions, based on inverted yield curves or any other form of augury. But when enough credentialed auguries suddenly think one might be possible, it seems prudent to speculate about the consequences if they turn out to be correct. So let's imagine what might follow if, sometime this winter, our post-2008 economic expansion finally ends.
First, the easy part: Donald Trump loses reelection. It will be ugly and flailing and desperate and - depending on recession-era geopolitics - potentially quite dangerous, but there is no way a president so widely disliked survives the evaporation of his boom. The rules of politics have changed, but they haven't been suspended. Polarization will keep Trump from being defeated in a landslide, but not from being beaten handily, and in a recession, the Democrats can nominate any of their candidates and expect to evict the president with ease.
What comes next? In Washington, the centrists get a surprising opportunity. Blamed and written off by left and right alike, a Trump defeat would give the capital's dwindling band of dealmakers and moderates another chance to govern - because even if it's Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders in the White House, it's still going to be red-state Democrats and blue-state Republicans holding the balance of power in the Senate. The left-wing revolution won't be canceled, exactly, in those circumstances, but it will be postponed till after 2022 or 2024; in the between-time, the people who once pined after comprehensive immigration reform and deficit commissions may get a (last?) chance to prove their critics wrong.
Meanwhile, the right will have to decide whether it wants to be an opposition or an alternative. With a bad economy and a liberal Democrat in the White House, conservatives could well return to the scripts of the Obama era, rediscovering (with whatever absurd hypocrisy) the perils of deficits and big spending, and defining themselves entirely against whatever bargains the center-left attempts to make. But if the GOP is reduced to a white working-class base at a time of increasing economic pain, there will also be incentives for Trump's would-be successors to flesh out his populism rather than abandoning it. This will be the ground on which the next Republican civil war gets fought no matter what, but how long a recession lasts and how it gets interpreted will determine whether a serious post-Trump conservative populism is inevitable or stillborn.
Then outside of D.C., the immigration crisis will diminish, while the social crisis gets worse. Notwithstanding the real horrors of gang violence in their native countries, many of the people trying to cross into the United States are clearly making an economic decision when they migrate - which means, in turn, that fewer jobs here will gradually take some pressure off the southern border. But at the same time, the domestic trends that have already worsened despite a strong economy - drug overdoses, suicide rates, middle-aged mortality, the slumping birthrate - are likely to get even grimmer in a contraction. America's social fabric hasn't recovered from the rendings that followed 2008; a recession now would tear out the weakest stitching quickly.
Then in the commercial sphere, the venture-capital subsidy to American consumers will dry up. The Atlantic's Derek Thompson summed up the peculiarities of this subsidy with a recent tweet: "If you work at WeWork, drive home with Uber, and then order food by DoorDash, you're engaging with three companies that are projected to lose about $13 billion this year." Those losses are supposed to end with an eventual leap into profitability; in a bad economy, they may end a lot more suddenly than that. Presumably a few of the many money-losing, long-game-playing Silicon Valley companies will survive a recession - but how many? Gather your Uber rides while ye may 
Finally, to end close to home, my profession will be shellacked. As with the social trends noted above, the economic foundation for professional journalism has continued to erode amid relative economic plenty; midsize daily newspapers keep shrinking and closing, web startups struggle to find ad revenue, and the business of online subscriptions rewards giants like The New York Times but so far almost nobody else. For many newspapers and webzines struggling to make the economics of the business work, a slump now could be simply fatal. And academia, journalism's comrade in "careers that made more sense in 1960," could face its own reckoning, with midsize and small colleges closing and consolidating, like midsize and small newspapers.
So a recessionary America would find the center-left enjoying some kind of power but probably struggling to govern, a right tearing itself apart in civil war, our downscale social crisis worsening, Silicon Valley delivering substantially less than promised, and the institutions that are supposed to inform and educate struggling or in decline.
Having guaranteed Trump's removal from office, in other words, the recession would also set the stage for Trumpism's eventual return.

Campus namesake a 'success story'; Bay Area site is named for journalist and immigrant activist Jose Antonio Vargas.

Texto completo: When Jose Antonio Vargas first heard that an official wanted to name an elementary school after him, he thought he was being trolled.
"I get trolled a lot on Twitter because of what I do," said the openly gay, Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and immigration rights activist, who revealed he was living in the country illegally in a New York Times essay eight years ago.
But the direct message from Mountain View Whisman School District Supt. Ayinde Rudolph was not a joke.

Vargas -- together with Steve Jobs, former school board trustee Gail Urban Moore, and Michelle and Barack Obama -- was on a shortlist of names under consideration by the Board of Trustees for the district's new school.
"We asked our community what characteristics they were looking for out of a person who a school would be named after," Rudolph said. "Some of the top ones that came up were someone who was local, who would be an inspiration to the kids, and who had an impact on education."
Parent groups ranked the choices. The list got shorter. The board voted.
On Monday, Jose Antonio Vargas Elementary School opened its doors.
Vargas was there, gifting supplies to teachers. At dismissal, he planned to hand out hundreds of lollipops to students.
"I came out as undocumented eight years ago in the New York Times, and ... I prepared for everything, every possible scenario -- that I would be detained, deported, arrested -- all of that I prepared for," he said. "I did not prepare for this. This is the one scenario that never even entered my mind."
Vargas, now 38, was born in the Philippines and moved to Mountain View at age 12, when his mother sent him there to live with his grandparents. He didn't realize he'd entered the United States with false documents until he tried to apply for a driver's license years later.
But in the classroom -- at Crittenden Middle School, then Mountain View High -- he found a sense of security and belonging.
Vargas credits his teachers with instilling a lifelong love of reading and writing that led him to a career in journalism. At the Washington Post, he was part of a team that won the Pulitzer for breaking news reporting for its 2008 coverage of the Virginia Tech shooting.
His first "coming out" was in high school, when he disclosed that he was gay.
His second came in 2011, when he revealed his immigration status in an essay for the New York Times Magazine. That same year, he founded Define American, a nonprofit that aims to use storytelling to promote dialogue around immigration issues.
"Our job, especially in this climate, is to ask people how they define 'American,' " he said. "For some people, that may be a controversial question, so I wasn't sure that the community that I come from would answer that question in this way. But I guess, in many ways, the Mountain View School District decided to answer that question, and they decided I didn't need papers or need to be born in this country to be considered in this way."
The idea to name the school for Vargas originated with district Board of Trustees President Tamara Wilson, who first proposed it at a board meeting in 2017.
"I thought, why name a school -- which is often done -- after a long-gone administrator who people don't often know or remember or connect to," she said. "My thought was, let's name it after a successful student, somebody kids can relate to as a success story, and just show that the foundation of our schools are our children."
When she researched successful students, Vargas' name "bubbled to the top," she said.
In addition to her role on the school board, Wilson is also a parent. Her son, a fourth-grader, began classes at Jose Antonio Vargas on Monday.
She said the new school was sorely needed. After the closure of Moffett Field, which ceased operations as a Navy base in the mid-'90s, Mountain View lost residents. By 2006, both elementary schools in the Whisman Slater neighborhood of the city had closed, citing declining enrollment.
Now, with Google and other tech employers, thousands of new housing units are being constructed and the area has seen a population boom.
In its first year, Jose Antonio Vargas Elementary will serve about 320 students in kindergarten through fourth grade. It has a projected maximum enrollment of 465, Rudolph said.
He said the choice of name is in line with the values of the Mountain View Whisman School District, which was among the first in the state to pass a resolution declaring itself a "sanctuary" school district.
"Our board has been very cognizant of these kinds of issues across the board, especially because we have a very large Latino population within our community that at times can be undocumented," he said. "So I think this decision was just reflective of their beliefs in educating every single student, and the power that education has."
This week, Vargas was still grappling with the implications of receiving such a high-profile honor from a community that, in strict legal terms, he was never supposed to be a part of.
"I'm a product of this community, and to this community, an openly gay, openly undocumented Filipino belongs," he said.
"I think that's a statement in and of itself."

Breathing Masks and WhatsApp: How We Cover Hong Kong's Protests

Texto completo: Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
For more than two months, antigovernment protesters have filled Hong Kong's streets. Demonstrations began as a show of opposition against a bill that would have allowed extraditions from the semiautonomous territory to mainland China; they have evolved to include broader grievances such as the use of force by the police.
Gillian Wong has managed both daily coverage and big-picture articles on the protest movement as assistant Asia editor, among several dozen staff in The New York Times's Hong Kong newsroom. In an interview this week, she talked about the many strands that come together to produce that reporting. This interview has been lightly edited and condensed.
Can you describe, generally, what the day of a big protest looks like?
In general, on a day when we're expecting a big protest, we'll have worked out ahead of time two or three different shifts of reporters. Especially early on in the movement, when these large protests were frequent, we had to assign shifts to people because we didn't want any one person to be stuck outdoors in the sun or the rain for 13 hours or longer.
If it's a huge protest, or if there's the expectation that there will be clashes, we would probably have a live briefing going. That would involve several editors collecting reporting from the reporters and then editing one another's work, and yelling, collegially, across the newsroom as we try to figure out whether this update is ready to be published.
We would also try to make sure that one reporter is responsible for working on an article that kind of pulls it all together into a broader story. I would work with that writer to figure out the themes that emerge from the day's developments. Then we'll start talking about investigative pieces or profiles of people and what sort of analysis we need to explain what's happening and where things are headed.
How many people have been working on this?
Around a dozen reporters and around a dozen editors. We have also had a lot of help from the video team in New York and the graphics team.
I would say almost all of the editors in Hong Kong are involved in the protest coverage. It's in the city where we live -- even those who are not on protest duty, they'll send video clips of marches that are going past their neighborhoods, for instance.
Everyone is on a WhatsApp group, sharing information on when the next protest is, where it's going to be, even down to things like, "What are they chanting?" It's a terrific resource for our reporting because everyone is monitoring what's going on in different ways.
We have reporters who are closely watching the group messages where protesters are discussing their plans. And then a lot of editors are watching Twitter and sending what they see on Twitter to the reporters on the ground.
What tools and protections do reporters in the streets have with them to be prepared for tear gas or whatever else they might encounter?
We had to really build an inventory of equipment. We needed regular supplies of neon yellow press vests; helmets that aren't military grade -- those are too heavy and impractical -- but are still strong enough to withstand some of the rough-and-tumble that you get from being out on the streets; decent masks for dealing with tear gas; and goggles for the same purposes.
Our reporters are really smart about keeping a distance, not getting too close and trying to minimize their exposure to tear gas, although it's not always possible. Sometimes you can't really judge where exactly the police are going to fire. I've called reporters and they'd say, "I can't talk right now," as they were trying to recover from coughing.
When things become more violent, what do you do?
Especially in situations when there's tear gas or if the police are firing rubber bullets, I'll call the reporters on the ground and try to figure out: Are they safe? Do they know where the closest exit is, or how they can get out of the crowd quickly?
We also try to pair people up so that they can tell us if they've lost sight of a colleague. We've been really fortunate that our team has not had any major incidents or injuries.

Trump-Miller, la mancuerna del mal

Texto completo: Durante el fin de semana, dos de los principales diarios de Estados Unidos, The New York Times y The Washington Post, dedicaron artículos de primera plana a la polémica figura del asesor presidencial, Stephen Miller, el principal arquitecto de la política antiinmigrante del gobierno de Donald Trump.
Nada de lo descrito sorprende a quienes abogamos por los derechos de los inmigrantes, pues el siniestro Miller ya había dejado su marca cuando trabajó para legisladores republicanos en el Congreso, particularmente para el exsenador de Alabama y venido a menos exsecretario de Justicia, Jeff Sessions, otra de las figuras más antiinmigrantes del Partido Republicano.
Miller es uno de los funcionarios que ha sobrevivido en el gobierno de Trump, cuando otros no han corrido la misma suerte. Y es muy probable que se deba a que comparte con el presidente el mismo desdén contra las minorías étnicas, particularmente los hispanos aunque sean ciudadanos, contra los inmigrantes, con o sin documentos, y una particular aversión hacia los refugiados.
Porque queda claro que la retórica antiinmigrante de Trump, la política pública resultante y los proyectos impulsados están dirigidos a minorías, inmigrantes y refugiados de color. Nunca hemos oído a Trump o a Miller despotricar contra indocumentados blancos.
Sus intenciones de “blanquear” una nación que ellos ven amenazada por los cambios demográficos, que nos llevan aceleradamente a ser un país donde las minorías serán mayorías, se sustentan en el racismo y en la falsa idea de que esas minorías suponen una amenaza para su existencia y supervivencia.
Y digo falsa, porque en todos los indicadores los anglosajones siguen gozando de una situación privilegiada; sin ignorar, claro está, que, como en todos los grupos étnicos, hay sectores blancos golpeados por el desempleo, los bajos salarios, la falta de seguro médico y problemas sociales. De todos modos, ser blancos les sigue suponiendo una ventaja, ante los obstáculos que enfrentan las minorías menos privilegiadas.
Pero en lugar de tener un debate sincero sobre las causas de las desigualdades —provocadas incluso por las mismas políticas que impulsa Trump, por ejemplo, una reducción tributaria que en realidad solo beneficia a ricos, y ofensivas contra el Obamacare que dejaría sin seguro médico a millones—, lo más sencillo es buscar un chivo expiatorio. Y esos son los inmigrantes y las minorías de color.
Pero es más truculento porque la agenda que impulsan Trump y Miller es la misma de los supremacistas blancos que ven en la inmigración y en el crecimiento de las minorías una amenaza a su supervivencia.
Los mecanismos no importan, así sea separar familias, enjaular niños y bebés, privarlos de sus padres, no proveerle a esos menores los productos más básicos como jabón, pasta de dientes o una cobija para dormir. O extraviar a esos menores en la madeja burocrática. O como se reportó este pasado fin de semana, explorar la idea de negar la educación a niños indocumentados, lo cual iría en contra de un fallo de 1982 de la Corte Suprema que garantiza el acceso de indocumentados al sistema de educación pública.
Miller es también el artífice de la regla sobre “carga pública” y de todas las políticas antiinmigrantes de Trump, comenzando con el veto musulmán.
Es sabido que el Partido Republicano es cómplice de Trump y de Miller por su silencio. Trump no enfrenta ninguna resistencia interna, porque mientras los republicanos coloquen a los jueces conservadores que quieren y mientras la economía los favorezca, poco importa lo que diga o haga el presidente.
La pregunta es si la estrategia antiinmigrante y racista funcionará en la elección general de 2020. No fue el caso de los comicios intermedios de 2018, cuando los demócratas ganaron la mayoría en la Cámara Baja y varias gubernaturas en distritos y estados que en 2016 favorecieron a Trump. Diversos sondeos señalan que la retórica y las políticas prejuiciosas de Trump no gozan del apoyo de la mayoría de los estadounidenses.
Pero los demócratas todavía no cuentan con un abanderado o abanderada, y eso también definirá el curso de las elecciones presidenciales.
Lo que sí es evidente es que el Partido Republicano que conocíamos ya no existe. El último presidente republicano en impulsar una reforma migratoria y en tratar de hacer más incluyente a esa colectividad fue George W. Bush, quien ocupó la Casa Blanca hasta el 20 de enero de 2009, cuando Barack Obama juramentó su primer mandato.
Los sectores republicanos más antiinimigrantes se consideraban marginales en esa época, pero en solo una década se han colocado a la cabeza del partido, al grado que es comandado por Trump, la figura republicana más divisiva y racista en la historia reciente, y su copiloto Miller. Peor aún, Trump tiene el apoyo de 90% del Partido Republicano.
No sé si los conservadores más moderados buscarán refugio temporal con los demócratas o los independientes; si fundarán otra colectividad ahora que la suya ha sido secuestrada por los antiinmigrantes; o si ya el Partido Republicano rebasó el punto donde no hay retorno.
Lo que sí queda claro es que Trump y Miller, la mancuerna del mal, todavía tienen año y medio para seguir haciendo daño, con la posibilidad de cuatro años más, si Trump es reelecto.

Trump's recession strategy: Deny, deny, deny

Texto completo: When Barack Obama was president and the economic statistics were good, then- candidate Donald Trump said they were fake. When Trump became president and inherited the exact same stats, they suddenly became real.
Now that they're turning south, they're apparently fake once more.
Trump, aided by his economic brain trust of cranks and sycophants, believes any indicator showing the U.S. economy could be in trouble must be fabricated. It's all part of an anti-Trump conspiracy, he rants, according to reports in The Post, the Associated Press and the New York Times.
And move over, Illuminati, because this particular conspiracy is massive .
It's led by the Federal Reserve, Democrats and the media, of course, or so say Trump and his Fox News minions. But it also includes the entire U.S. bond market, which flashed a warning sign last week when the Treasury yield curve inverted (meaning long-term bonds had lower interest rates than short-term ones, which usually predates a downturn).
Also colluding are the many farmers, retailers, manufacturers and economists who have been warning for more than a year that the burden of Trump's tariffs is mainly borne by Americans, not China or other trading partners, and also that uncertainty over trade tensions can paralyze hiring, investment and purchasing decisions, which we need to keep the economy expanding.
The cabal even transcends borders. Besides Trump's trade wars, after all, the main risk to the U.S. economy involves contagion from abroad. And right now, nine major economies are either in a recession or on the verge of one. Never fear, though: All nine countries' statisticians are surely cooking their books to hurt Trump, too.
The White House has reportedly declined to develop contingency plans for a downturn because it doesn't want to validate this "negative narrative." This is, in a word, idiotic. As others have analogized, it's like refusing to buy a fire extinguisher because you're afraid of feeding a "negative narrative" that you might someday face a fire.
Administration officials decided the best way to deal with recession risk, which they of course aren't personally worried about, was through a show of force on TV. There, Trump's economic advisers assured Americans they definitely, certainly, cross-their-hearts-and-hope-to-die don't see reason to worry.
White House trade adviser Peter Navarro's strategy was to deny that the data show Americans are paying higher prices on tariffed goods (though we are) and also that the yield curve had recently inverted (though it did). On that latter point, Navarro said the curve was merely "flat" and therefore doesn't signal a possible recession. In virtually identical language across interviews, he told audiences that he had authority in this matter because he "didn't write the book on the yield curve," he wrote "several books on the efficacy of the yield curve as a leading economic indicator."
What Navarro failed to mention, though, is that these books say that both inverted and "flat" yield curves are usually signs of impending recession. One such book, from 2006, explicitly mocked business leaders for failing to prepare for the 2001 recession because they had ignored "the ominous progression of the yield curve" that began with the curve's flattening.
So, yeah, you can add mid-2000s-era Navarro to the list of anti-Trump conspirators, too.
Trump's National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow hit the Sunday shows, too. For his part, he bizarrely pretended other troubling economic data (in this case, on consumer sentiment) didn't exist. He also repeatedly told viewers: "Let's not be afraid of optimism."
And look, yes, it would be unhelpful for public officials to go on TV and tell everybody to panic, pull their money out of the market and stuff it under their mattresses. The White House obviously wants to project confidence instead.
But that confidence is convincing only if it's credible - because, say, the White House has acknowledged how its own trade policies are contributing to recession risk and is committed to reversing them. Or because it has a competent team in place if recession strikes.
Neither is true.
Instead, Kudlow's call for optimism has a whiff of Peter Pan logic about it: If only we believe in fairies hard enough, we can always save Tinker Bell - even when we're sending her out into a hailstorm. If you believe, clap your hands; don't let Tink die!
It's hard to imagine nervous Americans are really this credulous. Then again, perhaps we were never the intended audience for such performances. Sure, maybe White House aides are trying to fool the public into believing recession warning signs don't exist. But maybe they're actually just trying to fool their boss.
A frightening conspiracy theory, indeed.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – As President Donald Trump insists the economy remains strong, White House officials reportedly have begun looking for ways to prevent a recession, including pushing for a temporary payroll tax cut.
The talks are in their early stages and include other possible tax breaks, The Washington Post and The New York Times both reported Monday.
But White House economists reportedly have drafted a white paper looking at a payroll tax deduction to put more money into workers’ paychecks.
Trump reportedly has not been briefed on the idea, and it’s not clear whether he would go along with the idea. Congress also would have to approve such a plan.
A White House official disputed the reports late Monday, saying “more tax cuts for the American people are certainly on the table, but cutting payroll taxes is not something under consideration at this time. ”
Trump has dismissed fears that the economy is heading for a recession.
"I don't think we're having a recession," he told reporters on Sunday before boarding Air Force One for his return to Washington after spending 10 days at his golf course in New Jersey. “We’re doing tremendously well. Our consumers are rich. I gave a tremendous tax cut and they're loaded up with money. "
Trump's top economic advisers also predict — at least publicly — the economy will remain strong through 2020 and beyond.

Gingrich spurns New York Times history project as 'propaganda'

Texto completo: Newt Gingrich said the New York Times project that claims to contextualize the history of slavery in America is "propaganda."
"The NY Times 1619 Project should make its slogan 'All the Propaganda we want to brainwash you with'.it is a repudiation of the original NY Times motto," the former House speaker said Sunday on Twitter.
Tweet
The Times started the 1619 Project last week, which seeks to "reframe" American history 400 years after the first slave ship came to North America.
The paper says the project "aims to reframe the country’s history, understanding 1619 as our true founding, and placing the consequences of slavery and the contributions of black Americans at the very center of the story we tell ourselves about who we are."
The 1619 project has been panned by critics as an attempt to reduce the entirety of American history to a lesson on slavery and race.
The Times said they plan on using the series throughout different parts of the paper's news sections, including sports, business, and travel.
Last week, a leaked transcript from a Times meeting of editors and staff reveal the paper wants to rebuild its coverage over the next two years to focus on writing "more deeply about the country, race, and other divisions."

The Southern Poverty Law Center is a hate-based scam that nearly caused me to be murdered

Texto completo: I’ll never forget the moment I learned we were on lockdown. It was Aug. 15, 2012. My frustration mingled with fear. Trapped on the sixth floor, we knew someone had been shot. We knew we couldn’t leave yet. We knew little else.
While I was missing lunch, a crime scene played out in the office lobby below me. My coworker and friend Leo wasn’t armed, but he had played the quick-thinking and inadvertent hero, disarming a young man on a mission to kill me and as many of my colleagues as possible. The gunman had packed his backpack with ammo and 15 Chick-fil-A sandwiches — later admitting that he had planned to smear them on our lifeless faces as a political statement. Leo took a bullet in the arm but managed to hold the attacker until law enforcement arrived.
I wrote and edited for the Family Research Council, a public advocacy organization that promoted the principles I have cared about since childhood: protecting the family, promoting the dignity of every human life and advocating for religious liberty. It reads like a tagline, but it’s also just what I believed and the way I chose to match my career with my convictions.
Biology is not bigotry: My daughter thinks she's transgender. Her public school undermined my efforts to help her.
I never expected that everyone would celebrate or share my beliefs. But I did expect to be able to discuss and debate these differences without becoming a political target in an act of terrorism, the first conviction under Washington, D. C. ’s 2002 Anti-Terrorism Act.
The Southern Poverty Law Center labeled us a 'hate group'
It was the type of violent incident that one could expect a group that purportedly monitors “hate,” like the Southern Poverty Law Center, to notice, research and decry. In fact, we were on the center’s radar but for all the wrong reasons. The assailant acknowledged later in FBI testimony that he had selected our office precisely because the SPLC had labeled my employer a “hate group. ”
It has always been easier to smear people rather than wrestle with their ideas. It’s a bully who calls names and spreads lies rather than thoroughly reading a brief’s legal arguments or challenging the rationale underlying a policy proposal. The SPLC has chosen to take the easy path — to intimidate and mislead for raw political power and financial benefit.
Hate groups in America: I grew up a white nationalist. We never blamed ourselves for mass shootings like El Paso.
For years, former employees revealed, local journalists reported and commentators have lamented: The Southern Poverty Law Center is not what it claims to be. Not a pure-hearted, clear-headed legal advocate for the vulnerable, but rather an obscenely wealthy marketing scheme. For years, the left-wing interest group has used its “hate group” list to promote the fiction that violent neo-Nazis and Christian nonprofits peacefully promoting orthodox beliefs about marriage and sex are indistinguishable. Sometimes, it has apologized to public figures it has smeared, and it recently paid out millions to settle a threatened defamation lawsuit.
The SPLC has its own troubles
These shameful secrets are no longer hidden in shadows. The New York Times, Politico, NPR and a host of other mainstream publications are reporting on the corruption and widening credibility gap. The SPLC dismissed its co-founder in March, and its president has resigned amidst numerous claims of sexual harassment, gender discrimination and racism within the organization — a parade of disgraces that vividly force the conclusion: The SPLC is hollow, rotten and failing at the very virtues it pretends to celebrate.
The criticism comes from many corners. There’s the Current Affairs editor who seems sympathetic to the center’s progressive mission but decries its “hate group” list as an “outright fraud” and a “willful deception designed to scare older liberals into writing checks to the SPLC. ”
There’s the retired investigative journalist who helped research and write an eight-part series on the center’s “litany of problems and questionable practices” in the mid-1990s. His Washington Post opinion piece reads with a thinly veiled message: We nearly got a Pulitzer Prize for TELLING YOU SO.
But perhaps most damning of all are the indictments leveled by former employee Bob Moser in The New Yorker. He remembers being welcomed to the “Poverty Palace” and recounts the heart-sinking reality of it all — being “pawns” in a “highly profitable scam. ”
Oberlin bakery owner: Gibson's Bakery paid a high cost for an unfairly damaged reputation
Jobs and years have passed, and I work now for Alliance Defending Freedom. ADF ranks among “the top performing firm(s)" litigating First Amendment cases, according to the Empirical SCOTUS blog, and is the “Christian legal powerhouse that keeps winning at the Supreme Court,” according to The Washington Post.
And yes, my new employer has also attracted one of the SPLC’s spurious hate labels. The label easily peels and fades away when one actually does the research and listens to truth before deciding to troll.
I won't be intimidated by the SPLC
If the SPLC thought that its hate would intimidate or silence me and my colleagues, they’re sadly mistaken. I’m lucky — blessed, really — that I didn’t take a bullet for my beliefs back in 2012. But the center’s ugly slander and the gunman’s misguided attack have sharpened my resolve and deepened my faith in my Savior, who commands my destiny and shields me from the schemes of man. The same is true for my colleagues.
Fifty-one years ago, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. fell to an assassin’s bullet. The SPLC pretends to carry his legacy but weaponizes hate labels instead. Unlike SPLC's name-calling, Dr. King’s words and vision stand the test of time. “Injustice anywhere,” he warned, “is a threat to justice everywhere. ”
The SPLC, as an institution, has thoroughly disqualified itself as an arbiter of justice. But this country would be a better place if the center’s donors, lawyers and friends would truly believe and apply Dr. King’s legacy — his peaceful pursuit of justice and his love of neighbor.

Texto completo: Long before the El Paso massacre, President Trump's political opponents accused him of sowing "division" with his "racist language." Mr. Trump "exploits race," "uses race for his gain," is engaged in a "racially divisive reprise" of his 2016 campaign, stokes "racial resentments," and puts "race at the fore," the New York Times has reported over the past several months.
Yet Mr. Trump rarely uses racial categories in his speech or his tweets. It is the media and Democratic leaders who routinely characterize individuals and groups by race and issue race-based denunciations of large parts of the American polity.
Some examples: "As race dominates the political conversation, 10 white Democratic candidates will take the stage" (the Washington Post); Mr. Trump's rally audiences are "overwhelmingly white" (multiple sources); your son's "whiteness is what protects him from not [sic] being shot" by the police (Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand); white candidates need to be conscious of "white privilege" (South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg); "white supremacy manifests itself" in the criminal-justice, immigration and health-care systems (Sen. Cory Booker); "Michael Brown was murdered by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri" (Sen. Elizabeth Warren); whiteness is "the very core" of Mr. Trump's power, whereas his "predecessors made their way to high office through the passive power of whiteness" (Ta-Nehisi Coates in the Atlantic).

Liberal opinion deems such rhetoric fair comment, even obvious truth, not "racially divisive." America's universities deserve credit for this double standard. Identity politics dominate higher education: Administrators, students and faculty obsessively categorize themselves and each other by race. "White privilege," often coupled with "toxic masculinity," is the focus of freshmen orientations and an ever-growing array of courses. Any institutional action that affects a "person of color" is "about race." If a black professor doesn't get tenure, he's a victim of discrimination; a white professor is presumed to be unqualified.
That interpretive framework explains asymmetries in how the political and media elites analyze the Trump phenomenon. Susan Rice, President Obama's national security adviser, recently denounced Mr. Trump's "almost daily attacks on black and brown people." But "almost" and "black and brown" are superfluous. Mr. Trump's attacks on his fellow 2016 candidates—and on more-recent adversaries as homogeneous as Robert Mueller, Rep. Adam Schiff, Joe Biden and Ms. Warren—were as nasty as anything he's directed at Rep. Elijah Cummings or Rep. Ilhan Omar.
But according to the academic template, to criticize a "person of color" is inevitably "about race." Mr. Buttigieg ran afoul of this rule after firing South Bend's black police chief for secretly taping officers' phone calls. The idea that the mayor fired the chief because he was black is absurd, yet Mr. Buttigieg inevitably faced charges of racial insensitivity. Likewise, advocates and the media deemed Mr. Trump's nonracial denunciation of Baltimore's leadership racist. Never mind that the victims of the city's almost daily drive-by shootings are black. Race shields minority politicians from criticism.
Ms. Warren recently provided an unwitting summary of academic identity politics. Mr. Trump's "central message" to the American people, she declared, is: "If there's anything wrong in your life, blame them—and 'them' means people who aren't the same color as you." She has in mind a white "you," but change the race and you encapsulate the reigning assumption on college campuses—that white people are the source of nonwhite people's problems, and any behavioral or cultural explanations for economic disparities are taboo.
The academy's reflexive labeling of nonconforming views as "hate speech" has also infiltrated popular rhetoric against Mr. Trump. The president's views on border control and national sovereignty are at odds with the apparent belief among Democratic elites that people living outside the country are entitled to enter at will and without consequences for illegal entry. To the academic and democratic left, however, a commitment to border enforcement can only arise from "hate." Such a pre-emptive interpretation is a means of foreclosing debate and stigmatizing dissent from liberal orthodoxy.
Identity politics, now a driving force in the Democratic Party, celebrates the racial and ethnic identities of designated victim groups while consigning whites—especially heterosexual white men—to scapegoat status. But its advocates should be careful what they wish for. If "whiteness" is a legitimate topic of academic and political discourse, some individuals are going to embrace "white identity" proudly.
To note the inevitability of white identity politics in no way condones the grotesque violence of men like the El Paso killer. But the dominant culture is creating a group of social pariahs, a very small percentage of whom—already unmoored from traditional sources of meaning and stability, such as family—are taking their revenge through stomach-churning mayhem. Overcoming racial divisiveness will be difficult. But the primary responsibility rests with its main propagators: the academic left and its imitators in politics and mass media.

Texto completo: Dear Dr. Fox: My dog Sami, an 11-year-old rescue (sort of resembles an Australian cattle dog), was chewing on her front leg and there seemed to be a tumor of sorts.
Our vet biopsied the growth, and fortunately it was benign. However, the dog seemed to be miserable, and other sores developed on her legs. A food allergy was suggested as a cause. I read online about chicken being a culprit, and after reading the ingredients on many dog food products, I learned that most contain chicken or chicken parts. The vet said this is probably because chicken is a very inexpensive way for manufacturers to add protein to their products.
I switched to a kibble that is chicken-free, and I make Sami's other food using your recipe. Now, after about a year, Sami's "tumor" has disappeared and her legs are lesion-free. I realize this may not be the cause of many dogs' itching and self-mutilation problems, but this seemed to me, for Sami, to be better than the myriad drugs that were prescribed. And it cost me nothing to change to chicken-free food.
Thank you for your help and concern for our animals. -- M.H., Poughkeepsie, New York
Dear M.H.: I very much appreciate you sharing your dog's saga with a skin condition that was eventually resolved by removing chicken from the diet. Dogs' skin is one of the first indicators of dietary ingredient intolerance or food allergy, which should always be considered, rather than simply treating the symptoms with steroids and immunosuppressant drugs that at best give temporary relief but can have long-term harmful consequences
VA hesitates to pair dogs with veterans
Only 19 military veterans have been paired with shelter dogs through a Department of Veterans Affairs program intended to help veterans who have post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
Scientific evidence that dogs can improve human mental health is thin, according to the VA's chief veterinarian, Dr. Michael Fallon, and department officials are concerned about unintended consequences. (New York Times, 7/17)
Knowing the documented benefits of dogs for people suffering from PTSD, I am surprised at this report. Studies continue to confirm the stress-reducing benefits of animal companionship and even short-term contact.

Lodi terror case shows injustice results when fear rules

Texto completo: SACRAMENTO – There was a saying, which sprung from the French Revolution and was used during the Russian Revolution: “No enemies on the Left.” It was the idea that left-wing revolutionaries should moderate their criticism of anyone on their side of the aisle, no matter what type of extremism they embraced. During the Cold War, conservatives rightly mocked liberals who hedged about the evils of communism. They struggled to condemn anyone to their Left.
Last week, I wrote about the apparent re-emergence of white nationalist thinking. Some mass shooters (El Paso, Pittsburgh, Charleston) seem to subscribe to a white-supremacist ideology, based on their alleged manifestos and police statements. Judging by the reactions to some of the latest shootings, there’s a similar philosophy at work: “No enemies on the Right.” Everyone condemns the killers, of course, but people hem and haw about the far-right danger.
My column simply called for a recognition of the problem – and the use of existing laws to deal with self-radicalizing white supremacists who break the law. It’s the same solution I embraced after the 9-11 terrorist attacks, and after home-grown killers with an alleged Islamic radical viewpoint murdered Americans in a couple of shooting sprees. Facing the issue and using the vast law-enforcement tools already at our government’s disposal beats emotion-driven approaches that curtail our civil liberties.
Unfortunately, there are many pitfalls even with using those existing tools. As analysis of the latest shootings subsided, another news story has grabbed attention here in northern California. It offers warnings about what happens when fear and emotion rule the day – and when our government seems driven more by panic than justice. It’s from the small Central Valley city of Lodi, but has nationwide implications.
In late July, U.S. District Judge Garland E. Burrell Jr. vacated the conviction and 24-year sentence for a suspect in a 2006 terrorism case. Burrell was the judge who oversaw the trial of Lodi cherry picker Hamid Hayat, who was accused of training in a Pakistani terrorism camp. The feds argued that he allegedly gained weapons and explosives training that used President George W. Bush as a target, according to newspaper reports. This had the makings of a sensational case.
In January, a different federal judge, Deborah Barnes, called for the sentence to be overturned based in part on the inexperience of Hayat’s attorney and the government’s failure to consider exonerating evidence. She heard “new testimony from witnesses who said, Hayat, a California native, never had time to receive terror training while visiting relatives and getting married in his ancestral village in Pakistan,” according to a Sacramento Bee report.
In a 2018 hearing that re-examined aspects of that controversial case, Hayat’s attorney alleged that the FBI coerced a confession, “that the training camp he supposedly visited was not even open at the time … and that alibi witnesses who could prove his innocence were not produced at the original trial,” according to the newspaper. Here’s the best spin to put on this injustice: Our system still is willing to examine evidence years after a case is closed.
In hindsight, the whole matter is so unseemly. The New York Times chaptered-and-versed some of the problems. One former FBI agent watched the testimony and said “it’s the sorriest interrogation, the sorriest confession, I’ve ever seen.” (False or coerced confessions are not unusual, but comprise more than a third of the nation’s murder exonerations, according to recent studies.)
Meanwhile, newspaper headlines announced the government’s dismantling of an apparent terror cell is a tranquil city in wine country. The director of national intelligence, it noted, told Congress that, “A network of Islamic extremists in Lodi, California, for example, maintained connections with Pakistani militant groups, recruited United States citizens.”
Except that there was no network. Hayat was the only scalp the FBI could secure, although the agency investigated (but never filed charges) possible immigration violations against local imams. If the Hayat case seemed dubious, it wasn’t an outlier.
As LA Weekly reported at the time of the trial in 2006, “The Bush administration claims that more than 400 people have been charged with terrorism-related crimes in the post-September 11 era, and that 228 have been convicted. But the vast majority of these cases have involved minor crimes not directly related to terrorism, such as immigration violations ….” The feds can appeal Burrell’s decision, but after 14 years in prison, Hayat has a good chance of finally being freed. It’s unclear how many of those other cases were re-examined.
None of us should minimize potential terror threats, from whatever swamp they might emerge. But our government has plenty of power to investigate and prosecute potential miscreants. Yes, we should all recognize that there are enemies on our Left and Right. But before calling for new governmental powers, we should remember the Lodi case and what happens when emotion rules and the government overplays its hand.

Warren Offers Policy Agenda to Aid Native Americans

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts on Friday laid out a collection of policy proposals intended to help Native Americans, pledging to protect tribal lands and to bolster funding for programs that serve Native people.
In releasing the proposals, Ms. Warren is drawing attention to Native American issues after months of largely refraining from doing so in the wake of a controversy over her ancestry. Ms. Warren put out the plans ahead of a scheduled appearance on Monday at a presidential forum in Sioux City, Iowa, that is dedicated to Native American issues.
Among the proposals, Ms. Warren said that if elected president, she would revoke the permits for the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines, two projects that have been opposed by many Native Americans. No energy project significantly affecting tribal lands should go ahead, she said, "without the free, prior and informed consent of the Tribal Nation concerned."
[Make sense of the people, issues and ideas shaping American politics with our newsletter. ]
She also called for expanding the ability of tribes to prosecute non-Indians for crimes committed on tribal land, and she proposed creating a nationwide alert system for missing indigenous women.
"As a nation, we are failing in our legal, political and moral obligations toward tribal governments and indigenous peoples," Ms. Warren wrote in a lengthy Medium post. "That this failure is simply the latest chapter in generations of prior failures is no excuse."
Ms. Warren has been dogged by questions over her claims of Native American ancestry since she first ran for the Senate in 2012. President Trump has relentlessly mocked her by calling her "Pocahontas," and the controversy over her ancestry marred the beginning of her presidential campaign.
Last October, before she entered the presidential race, she released the results of a DNA test providing evidence that she had a Native American ancestor. But the move drew criticism from some Native Americans; the secretary of state of the Cherokee Nation said Ms. Warren was "undermining tribal interests with her continued claims of tribal heritage." Ms. Warren has since apologized for having identified herself as Native American.
In recent months, Ms. Warren has mostly avoided bringing up Native American issues, despite having pledged to be a vocal ally. "I still, I am working on being a good partner," Ms. Warren said in an interview with The New York Times last week. "And the best way to be a good partner is to walk the walk."
Since entering the presidential race, Ms. Warren has rolled out broad policy plans on housing, the opioid crisis and rural America that include funding earmarked for Native American communities. In the Senate, she has introduced bills addressing suicide prevention and child abuse in Native communities.
The newly released collection of policy plans draws on a wide-ranging legislative proposal that Ms. Warren unveiled on Friday with Representative Deb Haaland, Democrat of New Mexico and one of the first Native American women to serve in Congress.
The proposal with Ms. Haaland, who endorsed Ms. Warren's presidential bid last month, is in response to a report released in December by the United States Commission on Civil Rights. The report found that "federal programs designed to support the social and economic well-being of Native Americans remain chronically underfunded."
The proposal from Ms. Warren and Ms. Haaland addresses areas like criminal justice, health care and education.
As a presidential candidate, Ms. Warren has become known for her detailed policy plans on a wide variety of subjects. Her collection of proposals on Native American issues is among the most significant policy platforms released by a 2020 candidate with indigenous communities in mind.
Julián Castro, the former housing secretary and San Antonio mayor, unveiled a plan last month that focuses on indigenous communities, with sections on issues like tribal sovereignty, treaty commitments and voting rights. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont also has a list of priorities to support Native people.

Iowa GOP chairman: Steve King rape and incest comments are 'outrageous'

Texto completo: The chairman of the Iowa Republican Party condemned comments made by Rep. Steve King about the effect that rape and incest has had on the global population.
“The Republican Party is the party of life — we’re very proud of that,” Chairman Jeff Kaufmann told the Hill on Friday. “But in regards to the statements of population and where that population comes from, those comments are outrageous, and they are not reflective of the Republican Party of Iowa.”
During a Wednesday speech in Iowa, King, who believes all instances of abortion should be illegal, suggested that human history is rooted in rape and incest.
“What if we went back through all the family trees and just pulled out anyone who was a product of rape or incest?” the 70-year-old Iowa Republican asked. “Would there be any population of the world left if we did that? Considering all the wars and all the rapes and pillages that happened throughout all these different nations, I know that I can't say that I was not a part of a product of that.”
When Kaufmann was asked whether he would support King if he wins the Republican primary and once more becomes the nominee, he said, “The people of the 4th district are going to have to make a decision on what they think about those comments, the context of those comments.”

The Wednesday remarks faced condemnation in Congress, including from other Republicans. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy denounced the comments and said he has “a great deal of problems” with King's statement.
“This isn't the first time I’ve had concerns with what Steve King has said. Earlier in this Congress, there are things that Steve King said that I do not believe the party of Lincoln would stand for. And as a united conference, we actually removed Steve King from his committees inside Congress, and I think this just continues to show why that action was taken,” the California Republican added.
Earlier this year, King came under fire for wondering why phrases like “white nationalist” and “white supremacist” have become “offensive” in an interview with the New York Times.
Despite King’s insistence that he does not support white supremacy and that he was misquoted, he was stripped of his assignments on the Judiciary and Agriculture committees.

Texto completo: A year ago today, more than 200 newspapers across the U.S. ran editorials decrying President Donald Trump’s repeated application of the term "enemies of the people" to describe the press and reinforcing the need for a vibrant free press in a healthy democracy. There is still cause for concern.
Since that show of solidarity, the U.S. has fallen three places in Reporters Without Borders’ World Press Freedom Index ranking. We’re now 48th out of 180 countries surveyed. Data compiled by the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker points to an escalation in violence: By April, there had been 10 reported attacks on journalists this year alone and 46 since 2017, including a reporter in California who was struck in the face and had her phone stolen as she interviewed voters.
It’s not just the U.S. In some places, threats against journalists are now "occupational hazards" — in Brazil, supporters of President Jair Bolsonaro have attacked members of the media both online and physically.
And President Trump continues to attack the media, revisiting the "enemy of the people" slogan in June when he accused The New York Times of a "virtual act of treason." Such attacks, whether from the president or any person in power, must be resisted.
The press is not perfect, to be sure. But to vilify the entire institution because of its imperfections poses a very real danger to America’s freedom.
In one of our first editorials on the topic in December 2016, we weren’t necessarily thinking of physical harm when we warned that the assault on the press is dangerous. We wrote: "It undermines our democracy.
"It allows those in power to say, ‘Ignore the facts no matter what the facts may be.’ "It allows partisans of both parties to say, ‘Believe in my distortions because you agree with my ideology.’ Or, ‘because you agree with my cult personality.’ "It allows anyone who screws up to say, ‘The problem’s not me; the problem’s the messenger.’ " The "enemy of the people" refrain can provide a useful political rhetorical slogan. But repeating such a slogan, a practice common among history’s strongmen, and infusing it with a tone of legitimacy is not a harmless political device.
Writer Richard Frankel described the impact in a June 9 article for Salon: "After all," he wrote, "enemies are not debated. Enemies are not reasoned with. One doesn’t compromise with an enemy. An enemy is confronted, is combated, is neutralized, and ultimately, an enemy is destroyed. The point at which politics shifts from truth to lies, from opponents to enemies, is the point at which democracy dies."
That distinction, that warning, is as important to remember today as it was a year ago.
Facts matter. Support a Free Press.

Texto completo: Lake County State’s Attorney Mike Nerheim announced a lawsuit Tuesday against e-cigarette manufacturer Juul Labs, contending the company "intentionally created addicted teen customers to continuously come back looking for another fix." The merits of the specific case against Juul will be sorted out in court, but there is a broader reach to the alarm bells that Nerheim is sounding. In short, teen vaping is here, it’s dangerous and it poses the threat of a broad epidemic.
Illinois lawmakers recognized that truth when they included e-cigarettes in a new law that prohibits the sale of tobacco and tobacco-related products to anyone under 21 years old. Juul, it is worth pointing out, has launched major ad campaigns with some of the nation’s largest print and online news organizations declaring its support for such restrictions on the sale of vapor products.
The sincerity of Juul’s appeal may be open to question, but there’s no room for doubt that it and Illinois’ new regulations are running several steps behind the e-cigarette monster that is rampaging through suburban middle and high schools.
At a news conference announcing the lawsuit, Stevenson High School senior Vrushali Thakkar described classrooms in which students use e-cigarettes when teachers leave the room. A New York Times story this week reports the son of an anti-e-cigarette activist describing the flavors he and his friends prefer and the appeal to some kids of products whose higher nicotine content provide "a bigger head rush."
But, evidence isn’t merely anecdotal. The National Institute on Drug Abuse cites studies showing that more than 16% of high school seniors — and nearly 10% of eighth-graders have used e-cigarettes in the past month. Another National Institutes of Health survey found that about 37% of high school seniors reported vaping in 2018. The figure was 28% a year earlier.
While vape companies like to declare that their product is intended only to help people stop smoking, they may be working toward the precise opposite. The NIH report points to studies showing that nearly 31 percent of students who vape graduate to traditional cigarettes and tobacco products within six months.
According to The New York Times, Trump administration health officials recognize the problem and are considering counter measures. The outgoing FDA commissioner proposed isolating e-cigarette products at retailers where they won’t be accessible to teenagers and requiring merchants to demand purchasers show identification.
If adopted, such measures may be a start. But the situation also requires a broader societal response. Nerheim predicted Tuesday that "it will take years" to overcome the impact e-cigarettes have made on the present generation of teenagers. That is not going to happen merely by punishing companies that have made impressionable children think it’s harmless and cool to use their dangerous product. It also requires broad recognition by all of us of the need to make them realize that neither of those things is true.

Ed Harris visits Fort Benton

Texto completo: Hollywood actor and director Ed Harris spent time in Fort Benton recently, scouting the area for a new film he plans to shoot in 2020.
Harris was accompanied by producer Robert Knott and set designer Waldemar Kalinowski. Harris and crew were scouting for the movie, "The Ploughmen," an adaptation of the novel written by Montana author Kim Zupan.
"I liked the story and thought it could work," said Harris, who wrote the screenplay based on the novel. "And the more I spent time with it, the more I liked it because of the characters, and it's a really good story."
"The Ploughmen" is Zupan's debut novel. It is set in northcentral Montana and tells the story of a deputy sheriff officer's odd relationship with an imprisoned killer.
"My wife read a review of it in the New York Times and read it. She then referred it to me," Harris said. "After I read it, I found out the rights were available, and I briefly talked to Kim about it and then optioned it."
Harris wants to stay as true to the book as possible by shooting much of the film in Montana and keeping the script as close to the novel as possible.
"I wrote a script based on the story, and then started altering things that I felt cinematically would help. It's still the same story, but there are a few differences," Harris said.
Harris has a longstanding career in Hollywood, appearing in movies such as "Apollo 13," "The Rock," "The Abyss" and "The Truman Show." He currently appears in the TV show "Westworld." In 2007, Harris directed the movie "Appaloosa," which he co-wrote with producer Robert Knott, but since then other directing opportunities have fallen through.
"The last film I'd directed was 'Appaloosa,' which was back in '07, which was too long ago. I've been looking for something to direct since then," Harris said.
Harris plans to do most of the shooting here in Montana and also in New Mexico, where there are better filming incentives.
"We plan on doing most of the interior shooting in New Mexico and the exterior shooting in Montana," Harris said.
Though New Mexico's incentives might be more appealing, the filming done in Montana will provide opportunities for creating local jobs and supporting the local economy.
"There are a bunch of scenes where we'll need extras. We'll probably have even a little bit of an audition for some certain smaller roles and see what we can come up with out here," Harris said.
This month's Montana trip is planned to be the last outing to Fort Benton before filming of the movie begins, slated for June 9, 2020.
"I'm going to be on Broadway for like six months from November to April, so I wanted to come up here and try to really finalize where we can shoot what, because by the time I get out of that play, we've got seven weeks of pre-production and I didn't want to spend that seven weeks looking for stuff – so I think we're in pretty good shape," Harris said. "I think it's just a question of how much we can actually afford to shoot up here."
While in Fort Benton, Harris and crew worked closely with the Chouteau County Sheriff's Office.
"The people have been really supportive out here," Harris said. "The sheriff's department and the courthouse have been great. Everybody has been great, very welcoming and supportive. That's one of the reasons why I want to shoot here."
About Kim Zupan
Kim Zupan is a Missoula-based author originally from the Great Falls area. Zupan studied creative writing at the University of Montana and then became a carpenter for financial stability. "The Ploughmen" is his debut novel, and it received high praise in the media.
"Well, one is always hopeful about having success," Zupan said. "You kind of work in a vacuum and you like to think it's good, and you never know. It's a mistake to have too much hubris as a writer."
Shortly after the novel was published in 2014, Zupan found out that Harris wanted to make a film about the book.
"My initial reaction was elation at first, of course. Very quickly that was tempered by the many stories I'd heard of books being optioned and films never coming from it," Zupan said. "The fact that it was Ed Harris, whose work I'd always admired, made me feel like it was a great fit."
The storyline of "The Ploughmen" is one that Zupan has some personal familiarity with. It isn't just fictitious.
"One of my best friends growing up became a Cascade County deputy. There was a career criminal loose at that time. The old killer had taken a liking to my friend," Zupan said. "This story percolated in my head for many years, but I wrote many books in the interim."
Zupan taught carpentry for nine years at Missoula College until he quit two years ago to pursue writing full time. He was a full-time carpenter for 25 years and occasionally still works on projects.
"Physically and mentally, it's good for me to pull a carpentry gig once a month. That's what I'll be doing next week," Zupan said in an interview last month.
Upon learning that Harris was in Montana to do some final scouting for the film, Zupan said he is excited to know that things are progressing with the film – but he's not letting his hopes get too high.
"One has to be careful not to take it too much to heart. I remain hopeful, though," Zupan said.

Texto completo: Here's a question for those who claim, in the wake of this month's mass shooting in El Paso, that such spasms of violence are at least partially rooted in gory movies and violent video games:
If Hollywood and the gaming industry are capable, however indirectly, of fomenting such madness, then how about a president?
I put the query on Tuesday to David Trahan, executive director of the Sportsman's Alliance of Maine, who told WVOM radio in Bangor last week that the "real problem" behind mass shootings is "our society's ... very lax way in looking at violence as a whole."
"If you watch a Hollywood movie, with an R-rated movie, it's likely you're going to see mass killings during that movie," Trahan told WVOM morning hosts Ric Tyler and George Hale. "If we're going to address this, we're going to have to do it, I think, from the foundation of what's causing these shootings - not just look at the weapon and say we've got to take them away."
I called Trahan at SAM headquarters, not to get entangled in the thorny issue of gun control but simply to nudge his theory of social influence one step further.
I told him I'm hearing a lot of people on the conservative side of the political spectrum saying that Hollywood and the rest of the entertainment industry are influencing these shooters.
"But what I'm not hearing (from conservatives) is that the president's rhetoric is influencing them," I said.
By rhetoric, I meant President Trump's fixation on the word "invasion" to describe immigration on our southern border. This year alone, according to a New York Times analysis, Trump's re-election campaign has used the word in more than 2,000 Facebook ads.
By rhetoric, I meant the audience member at a Florida rally in May who, upon hearing Trump wonder aloud, "How do you stop these people?", replied "Shoot 'em!" Trump smiled and, to much applause, said, "That's only in the Panhandle can you get away with that statement ... only in the Panhandle!"
By rhetoric, in addition to "invasion," I meant the words "predator," "alien," "killer," "criminal" and "animal." According to a recent analysis by USA Today of transcripts from 64 Trump rallies, the president used those words more than 500 times in reference to immigrants.
And finally, by rhetoric, I also meant the El Paso shooter's 2,300-word manifesto, posted online 27 minutes before he walked into a Walmart Supercenter with his WASR-10 semi-automatic rifle, that began, "This attack is a response to the Hispanic invasion of Texas."
So once again, I asked Trahan, what about the president? If Hollywood and video game producers are social influencers, then how about the man with the biggest bully pulpit on the planet?
"I'm not going to speak to the president because I have my own personal feelings about the president," Trahan said. "And it might surprise you."
"Go ahead," I urged him. "Surprise me."
"No. That's as far as I'm going to go."
Actually, it wasn't. Later in our conversation, after arguing at length that Trump is far from the only political leader to engage in incendiary speech these days, Trahan edged a bit closer to criticism of the man at the top.
"I wish that he would talk in a presidential manner," Trahan conceded. "All the people that have held office, whether you like it or not, you're a leader. And what you say matters. And that includes all the leaders in all political parties."
"He is the ultimate leader, though," I pointed out.
"He is the ultimate leader," Trahan agreed.
Trahan, to be fair, is far from the only Mainer of note whose reaction to the recent shootings steered clear of Trump.
Sen. Susan Collins, in answer to a question last week from nationally syndicated radio host Hugh Hewitt, said she was "very disappointed" with Democrats who refused to appear alongside the president in El Paso.
"We ought to be expressing our grief with (the victims' families) and mourning with them, not staging political events, not engaging in over-the-top rhetoric," Collins said.
Not a peep about fellow Republican Trump, who shone his spotlight upon landing in El Paso not on the shooting victims, but on "the love, the respect for the office of the presidency."
Speaking Tuesday in Portland, Collins at least told Maine Public that Trump's frequent use of the word "invasion" is inappropriate.
Still, she said, "I do not think that that rhetoric is connected with the terrible mass shootings that we've just experienced in this country that are so horrific."
Collins, like anyone, is entitled to her opinion - aligned with Republican talking points as it may be.
So is Sen. Angus King, who in the same Maine Public piece last week said it's impossible to know definitively at this point what caused the El Paso shooter to kill 22 people, most of whom had Latino surnames, and wound 24 others.
But when it comes to the recent rise in white nationalism in this country, King said, Trump clearly has played a role.
"He certainly hasn't caused it. But I think you can argue that he's enabled and empowered it just by his rhetoric. It's just hard to deny that," King said.
Back at the Sportsman's Alliance of Maine, Trahan sees the El Paso shooting, along with the one that claimed 10 lives less than 24 hours later in Dayton, Ohio, as a watershed moment in the national debate over guns.
"Something has changed," he said. "The tone, the rhetoric that I'm hearing from Republicans and Democrats has changed. It feels like there is some sort of logjam that has broken free."
That, we can only hope, is a good thing. Universal background checks, improved mental health services and research, and, yes, the obscene proliferation of weapons of war on our civilian streets all demand our collective attention as the number of mass shootings in the United States this year now stands at 257 - more than one per day.
"Gun control issues are, I believe, always going to be discussed and debated," Trahan said. "But we're losing focus of all the other things that may be weighing into why these people do these things."
Fair enough.
Let's start with our president.

What a Soccer Correspondent Sees

Texto completo: Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
Major League Soccer plans to expand to 30 teams from the current 24, putting it on par with professional baseball, basketball and football in America. The embers are still hot from a dominant performance in this year's Women's World Cup by the United States, and seasons for the top European leagues are underway. And next summer is the European Championship. So the sport, these days, doesn't sleep. Rory Smith is the chief soccer correspondent for The New York Times. In June, on the website Reddit, Mr. Smith fielded questions on a variety of topics. A lightly edited version of that correspondence follows.
How do you maintain both your sources and your journalistic integrity?
That's one of the trickiest things. You have to balance needing contacts to get information, and being prepared to write what you honestly think about them. I've had one fairly high-profile manager accuse me of betraying him -- I suggested maybe his time at a club had come to an end, he disagreed, events later proved me right -- and it was quite upsetting, to be honest. So was the time when a player's dad threatened to shoot me -- I think jokingly, in fairness -- because I criticized his son. I think if you're honest, fair and are willing to defend yourself, you're generally O.K.
Why hasn't Major League Soccer in the United States closed the talent gap between it and the European leagues?
The Champions League, basically. I've always thought that if you offer players the chance of a couple of years in Miami compared to, say, Birmingham, they'll probably go for Miami. But without the Champions League you can't get the best players at their peak. (Sorry, Birmingham.)
Could soccer ever become the most popular sport in the United States?
Maybe not the most watched, but the U.S. landscape is big enough to handle loads of sports. I'd like to think that we're at least nearing the point where we never have to ask whether soccer will catch on in the U.S. ever again.
How do you approach the corners of the sport that have a political or social dark side?
That's a really hard one. I don't think you can ignore it. Soccer is used as a political tool in loads of ways and it's important that this -- and the people who are suffering because of it -- is highlighted. But equally, it can't dominate every story. "Paris St.-Germain, the soccer club bought by the state of Qatar to try to win influence in the West and cleanse its reputation for repressive labor systems, last night beat Marseille 2-0" isn't really going to work. So I guess it's context. In the same way as it's O.K. to admire Ronaldo as a player but express caution on him as a man -- in light of recent allegations -- it's O.K. to treat, say, Manchester City as an amazing soccer team, and report on them as such, but maybe not to pretend that they are a model everyone else should copy.
It's now common for aspiring sportswriters to start out as unpaid contributors. What do you think this means for the future?
It's bad. You shouldn't work for free, and you shouldn't be asked to work for free. What it does is ensure that the only people who can be sports journalists are middle-class kids who can afford not to earn money. (Internships are fine, and work experience while you're at school/college/university, but if you're writing, you're working. You deserve to be paid.)
Will the English Premier League be affected by Brexit? Maybe by visa issues with the European Union?
They're confident it won't be a factor, but everything I've been told is that soccer can't be an exception. They will have to have some sort of restrictions.
What do you think is the reason for the abuse sports journalists face online?
I think the abuse is tribal, essentially. There is an assumption that all criticism is because of an agenda. That applies outside soccer, too. I think we've all gotten worse at confronting opposing views, and we've lost the idea of disagreements in good faith. It does impact what I write, sometimes, because you're conscious that certain ideas or thoughts will only get you a load of stick. I try not to let it, but there's a limit to what you can do.
Is there a player you most enjoy covering?
Watching Messi is pretty special. You do kind of sit there, vaguely aware you have some work to do, and think how lucky you are -- we all are -- to see him.

How to Torture Trump

Texto completo: Let's be trivial for a minute. Forget our endless supply of critical problems and just try to think of a good way to torture Donald Trump.
Psychologically.
Reasoned criticism never works. We have to go down to his level if we want to get his attention. Not by making fun of his hair or his girth or the orangish glow of his face. Deriding people for their looks is beneath us. Besides, he seems so confident he's a charmer nothing is going to shake him.
If we want to really make him crazy, we ought to start a rumor that he can't draw a crowd.
You know how obsessed Trump is with this subject. Whenever he holds a rally -- which seems to be pretty much every other day -- he brags about the enormous number of people thronging in to see him:
"There have never been crowds like this, just so you understand, in the history of politics."
"This is some record crowd."
"I've broken more Elton John [attendance] records, and I don't have a musical instrument."
There are two important points about that last comment. One is that the president went on to say that his only musical instrument was his mouth, "and hopefully the brain is attached to the mouth." There are so many ways, really, we could have finished that thought.
The other is that Elton John is a way bigger draw.
Trump can't bear suggestions that he's not a crowd megamagnet. Every time he gets on a stage, he seems compelled to claim the audience is of epic proportions. The place is packed! Not to mention the masses waiting outside!
Back in February, he did an event in El Paso on the same day Beto O'Rourke was holding his own rally. The one-sided fight over who had the biggest crowd became sort of insane -- not to mention sort of phallic. "We have, let's say, 35,000 people tonight and he has 200 people, 300 people. Not too good!" the president of the United States crowed.
The beat-Beto obsession went on and on. O'Rourke, in one of the better moments of his political career, said that analysis "just shows you how sick this guy is." It also showed how bad Trump is at math -- local fire officials said that the capacity of his auditorium was around 6,500, and there were, at the most, 10,000 more people standing outside. O'Rourke had crowd estimates of up to 15,000.
If only there were headlines all around Texas announcing, "Trump Audience Size Disappointing." Or better yet: "Did Beto Draw Better?" Can you imagine how miserable that would make the commander in chief?
Maybe that's going too far -- despite the president's complaints to the contrary, the mainstream-media reporters covering him try very hard to be fair. However, we're in the Opinion section right now. So let's be catty.
The El Paso crowd became a national issue last week when Trump went to visit the victims of the Walmart shooting while the whole nation wondered if the tragedy was set off by the president's rants about Mexicans at the border.
None of the patients wanted to see him, so Trump hung out with the staff. Almost instantly, he veered off into a reminiscence about that El Paso rally. "That place was packed. ... We had twice the number outside. And then you had this crazy Beto -- Beto had like 400 people in a parking lot," he burbled.
Nobody was going to challenge Trump's numbers while standing, perhaps awe-struck, listening to the president of the United States brag about his crowd size in the wake of a terrible mass murder. And nobody was going to ask about it at his next press conference, since there hasn't been one for more than 900 days.
Even Trump must have discovered that this was going way, way over the deep end. He refrained from saying a whole lot about attendance when he spoke in Pennsylvania on Tuesday. He did peer toward the media section and note that there were "a lot of people" for an 11 a.m. event. It was a point only slightly dulled by the fact that it was 2:42 in the afternoon.
The rally took place on the construction site of a big chemical plant. "It was the Trump administration that made it possible," the president said of a project that was first announced in 2012. The trip was supposed to be an official White House speech about energy policy. That means you the taxpayer were underwriting his opportunity to brag about his victory margin in 2016 in West Virginia, make fun of Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren, and announce the new numbers from Florida showed his re-election campaign was "looking fantastically good."
He spoke to a crowd of about 5,000. Analyzing his effort, the reasonable thing to do would be to point out the deep, deep fault lines in his arguments about energy and economics. But you know he'd be oblivious. What if the headlines read "Disappointing Crowd for a Presidential Visit" and the stories focused on the fact that earlier this year in nearby Pittsburgh, Trevor Noah drew a healthy turnout at an arena that seats 12,500?
Not responsible journalism. But maybe it'd shock him into reality. Or at least leave him curled up in bed, sucking his thumb while somebody else ran the government.

Not in the Running, but Open To 'Other Political Opportunities'

Texto completo: Stacey Abrams made it official this week that she would not seek the presidency after months of speculation among Democrats, becoming one of the most prominent party leaders to pass on the 2020 race. But in an interview Tuesday night, she said she was open to being considered for the No. 2 spot by "any nominee."
Ms. Abrams, who drew national attention during her unsuccessful run for governor of Georgia last year, said that she would focus her next year on identifying and stemming voter suppression efforts throughout the country, a major priority for her for years, instead of running for president or the Senate.
But she has remained close to the presidential race, meeting privately with several candidates and topping lists of potential vice presidents.
On Tuesday, Ms. Abrams spoke to The New York Times about why she decided not to run for president, how she feels about the possibility of being on a 2020 ticket, and why Democrats should not shy away from the politics of identity.
This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.
When did you come to the decision not to run for president?
I've been thinking about this for the last few weeks, and I've just come to the decision that my best value add, the strongest contribution I can give to this primary, would be to make sure our nominee is coming into an environment where there's strong voter protections in place.
Was it always trending this way? Or were you close to getting into the race?
Of course, I would not have publicly raised the possibility if it was not a legitimate thought. But I don't believe standing for office is something that you do simply because the office is available. I need to know that it's the best choice and it's the best role for me to play. And I've been pleased with the direction of the field.
I asked two things with all the presidential nominees I've met with. One is that they make voter suppression their number one issue. And two, that they make Georgia a top priority because it is a battleground state.
You also turned down the opportunity to run for Senate in Georgia. Is it just that you had your heart set on governor? Or is it that you are looking at being vice president?
I'm certainly open to other political opportunities.
My decision not to run for the Senate was because I do not want to serve in the Senate. I think that there are people who are running who are the right people for that job. And I'm going to do my best to ensure that they can become the senator from Georgia. And that means fighting voter suppression. That means making sure that we are learning things from our 2018 campaign.
But as I think about my next step, my first responsibility is to ensure that when the primary is done -- when the nominee decides to choose their running mate -- that they are choosing based on knowing that we are in a country where we have built the infrastructure in those battleground states. And that I've done my part.
So in saying you're open to other opportunities, that includes any potential selection for vice president?
I would be honored to be considered by any nominee.
But my responsibility is to focus on the primary. And that means using the primary as an opportunity to build the apparatus to fight voter suppression. Because in the end, no matter where I fit, no matter which ones of our nominees win, if we haven't fought this scourge, if we haven't pushed back against Moscow Mitch and his determination to block any legislation that would cure our voting machines, then we are all in a world of trouble.
Wouldn't the best way to fight Mitch McConnell be to run for Senate?
I appreciate the importance of that role. But I am not so arrogant as to believe I'm the only one who can win that.
So does this decision mean that there won't be a Stacey Abrams endorsement during the primaries?
I do not foresee making any decisions about the candidates in the primaries right now.
One of the conversations dominating the primary is about electability, and obviously that has had connotations with race and gender. As you've seen that play out, what goes through your mind?
Different is always uncomfortable, but it's always necessary. And what I've seen happen is, as the top 10 nominees shake out, we have a remarkable diversity among those who are viable standard-bearers for the Democratic Party.
But the guy at the top is still an older white guy, the establishment. Does that disprove your point?
The phenotype of our candidates is going to continue to expand. Who we have to stand for office, those people are going to look more and more like America. That's one of the reasons we're not only focusing on the battleground places for the presidency, but the battleground states for the Senate.
We want to change the overarching conversation about who is electable. And we do that by electing people who look like America.
One of the things I think is really interesting is the way you talk about identity politics. How have you seen that conversation develop in 2020?
We must understand the challenges that we face -- whether it's a white suburban mom, who has to deal with not having access to public transit to get to your child's school and then get to their job, or an African-American farmer who's isolated from the internet and can't figure out how to get his produce to market.
Our responsibility is to know that those identities are real, and the barriers to their success are real. And that we should see those identities and embrace the politics of fixing the barriers, of removing the structural obstacles.
I do push back against any politician, Democrat or Republican, who would offer this notion that talking about identity is somehow dangerous. It is the only way we are successful. This is how people see themselves in our politics.
Last question: How often do you think about how close you were to winning the governorship, and are there any regrets from your run of last year?
What I regret every day is that we could not stop [Brian Kemp] from bastardizing this whole process, from denying the franchise to those who had earned it by being Americans and tried to use their right to vote to set the course of their futures.
And I will always be deeply, deeply hurt that we live in a nation that permitted that to happen.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Texto completo: When critics of the Trump administration warn that it is transforming America into something dark and ugly, they are often accused of exaggerating. But in a pair of interviews on Tuesday, Ken Cuccinelli, the acting director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, admitted as much.
When asked on NPR whether the words inscribed on the pedestal of the Statue of Liberty ("Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, the wretched refuse of your teeming shore") are "part of the American ethos," Cuccinelli replied, "They certainly are - give me your tired and your poor who can stand on their own two feet and who will not become a public charge." Later that day, on CNN, he said, "Of course, that poem was referring back to people coming from Europe where they had class-based societies, where people were considered wretched if they weren't in the right class."
That's two rewrites in one day of a poem that for more than a century has defined the United States as a nation of immigrants, open to all. Not just European immigrants. Not just wealthy immigrants. All immigrants.
Granted, actions have not always matched words. The Immigration Act of 1924 closed our doors to virtually all non-European immigrants - a great wrong that was not rectified for decades. The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 made it easier for Asians, Latin Americans and Africans to come here, changing the demographics of the United States in ways that President Trump and his nativist minions intensely dislike. So many people from "s---hole countries" - not enough from nice, white places such as Norway. Trump is opposed to all non-European immigrants - except, of course, the ones who work for him. So he feels compelled to do something about this "invasion of our Country."
The administration has separated immigrant children from their parents and held both in squalid cages. It has staged massive roundups of undocumented but otherwise law-abiding immigrants. It has slashed refugee admissions - to a level possibly as low as zero by next year.
The human toll of its inhumane conduct is steep - and growing. Witness the story of Jimmy Aldaoud, an Iraqi refugee born in a camp in Greece, and who was brought the United States legally in 1979 when he was just 6 months old. Suffering from bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, Aldaoud never became a citizen and compiled a long record of petty crimes. In June, Immigration and Customs Enforcement finally caught up with him. Over his anguished protests, agents deported Aldaoud to Iraq - a country he had never visited and whose language he did not speak. A diabetic, he could not get insulin in Iraq. He died in Baghdad, the New York Times noted, "after vomiting blood and begging to return to the United States."
While much of the president's fire and fury is focused on undocumented immigrants, his administration is also targeting legal arrivals. Cuccinelli just unveiled new rules for getting a green card or U.S. citizenship, which penalize those who have taken advantage of the social welfare benefits to which they are entitled. Other disadvantaged categories include those who have a medical condition that interferes with work or school, "financial liabilities," a lack of English-language skills and even a low credit score. One wonders what kind of credit score Friedrich Trump - the president's grandfather - had when he arrived from Germany in 1885, a failed barber who did not speak a word of English.
I am certain that my family - my grandmother, mother and myself - had a credit score of zero when we arrived in 1976. There were no credit cards in the Soviet Union, and we didn't have any money. We survived initially on handouts from the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society (HIAS), whose help to more recent arrivals triggered the ire of the alleged Pittsburgh synagogue gunman. Luckily, my mother already spoke English, so she soon found a job. But my grandmother spoke only Russian and she was already retired. She got by with help from my family and her Supplemental Security Income and Medicare benefits. My family is far from rich, but we have been productive and repaid in taxes many times over the benefits my grandmother received - just as we repaid the aid from HIAS.
But if Trump had been in office then, I wonder whether my grandmother would have been barred entry or deported back to the U.S.S.R., where she had no one to take care of her? For that matter, I wonder whether any of us would have been allowed to come here given our unconscionable lack of a credit rating? Why, we didn't even own a single hotel or casino; still don't.
I am immensely grateful to be a U.S. citizen, because I am acutely conscious that if I were not, I could suffer Jimmy Aldaoud's fate - deported to a country (in my case, Russia) that I do not know and where I am not welcome. But while I am proud to be an American, I am ashamed of what the Trump administration is doing in our name. It is literally rewriting the meaning of America.

Texto completo: Heads are rolling at the Manhattan federal jail where Jeffrey Epstein apparently killed himself, as sleeping guards are reportedly suspected of falsifying log entries to show they were checking on inmates in the unit every half hour when those checks never took place.
The warden of the Metropolitan Correctional Center in lower Manhattan was pulled from his post and two staffers were put on leave Tuesday amid a probe into the death of the high-profile inmate (inset).
Epstein, 66, is believed to have killed himself early Saturday as he awaiting trial in a sex-trafficking case.
The Associated Press, citing an unnamed source, reported Tuesday night that surveillance video reviewed after the death showed guards never made some of the every-30-minute checks that were entered into a log. The New York Times, citing two unnamed prison and law enforcement officials, reported two guards in the jail unit fell asleep and didn't check on Epstein for about three hours, then falsified records to cover it up.
The federal Bureau of Prisons also has sent a suicide reconstruction team to the jail, the AP reported.
The Department of Justice announced current MCC Warden Lamine N'Diaye would be replaced by James Petrucci, who ran the medium security prison at Otisville, N.Y. That federal prison is perhaps most famous for its minimum-security camp - referred to as "America's cushiest prison" - that currently houses President Trump's former fixer Michael Cohen.
"Today, the attorney general directed the Bureau of Prisons to temporarily assign the warden at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York to the Bureau's Northeast Regional Office pending the outcome of the FBI and OIG investigations into the apparent suicide of Jeffrey Epstein, a former MCC inmate," Justice spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said.
The two MCC staffers pulled from their posts had been assigned to the unit where Epstein died, Kupec said.

Texto completo: The guards at the prison where Jeffrey Epstein apparently killed himself fell asleep and failed to check on the convicted sex offender for three hours.
Three law enforcement and prison officials told the New York Times that two staff members in the unit where Epstein was being held after his arrest were sleeping for some or all of the three hours they failed to check on the financier.
They then falsified reports to cover up the lapse. Falsifying the records could be a federal crime.
Epstein, 66, was awaiting trial on charges he sexually abused underage girls when he apparently hanged himself with a bedsheet in his cell at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Manhattan. His body was found Saturday morning.
Two employees have been placed on administrative leave and the warden of the prison has been temporarily reassigned during an investigation into Epstein’s death.
Attorney General William Barr ordered the Justice Department’s inspector general to look into how Epstein was able to kill himself while in custody and why he was taken off suicide watch nearly two weeks earlier.
Epstein apparently tried to kill himself on July 23 after he was denied bail. Days later, he was removed from suicide watch and put back in his cell with another inmate. His cellmate was later transferred out the cell and Epstein was alone Friday night.

Texto completo: Say hello to some new friends.
Or, if you’ve been reading The Salt Lake Tribune for more than a few years, to some returning old friends. Who are bringing along some of their new friends.
After five years as a client of The Washington Post News Service, The Tribune is returning to The New York Times News Service. The NYT package of breaking and in-depth news, arts coverage and features includes The Times’ top-drawer commentary, from both their staff op-ed writers and contributors who write often, occasionally or once.
Among the names that will be returning to The Tribune’s print pages and website are Nobel economics laureate and liberal’s liberal Paul Krugman, globe-trotting writers Thomas Friedman and Nicholas Kristof, conservative deep-thinkers David Brooks and Ross Douthat, author and social justice advocate Charles Blow, the sardonic I’ve-seen-it-all Maureen Dowd, former reporter and restaurant critic Frank Bruni and the it’s-better-to-laugh-than-cry Gail Collins.
(Collins is the one who can’t mention Utah Sen. Mitt Romney without recounting the story of how he put the family dog in a crate on top of the family car for a family drive to Canada. And it is hard for anyone to mention Collins without mentioning that.)
Other writers have been added to the NYT commentary roster since The Tribune was last a partner. They include conservative writer Bret Stephens, former business reporter David Leonhardt, along with Michelle Goldberg and Timothy Egan, the latter a writer who focuses on the environment and other issues important to the American West. (That is, he has the job I wanted.)
Among them, that crowd has eight Pulitzer Prizes.
It is on The Tribune’s commentary pages that this change will be the most obvious. The Associated Press remains the heavy lifter for our national and world news and sports coverage. Now, our news and arts pages will have the option of supplementing that report with work from The Times. Our sports pages are mostly locally oriented, with AP’s national report filling things out.
Yes, we know. The Times has come under some heavy criticism of late for its coverage of the last presidential campaign and of the current administration. I would argue, though, that the problems are generally not with the content, depth or fairness of the articles, but with matters of play and display. Headlines and front-page, or not, placement. The kind of things that may happen when a news organization’s best brains focus increasingly on the online service and not so much on print.
And those woes, if they continue, won’t necessarily carry over to how The Tribune uses the work of The Times.
With the switch of syndicates, some of The Washington Post’s writers, along with those who write for Bloomberg News, will no longer be found on our pages — print or online. Those we are saying good-bye to include Jennifer Rubin, Margaret Sullivan, Anne Applebaum, Ramesh Ponnuru, Hugh Hewitt, Monica Hesse, Helaine Olen, Paul Waldman, Jonathan Capehart, Leonid Bershidsky, Ishaan Tharoor, Greg Sargent and Fred Hiatt. Those first three, particularly, I will miss. Rubin because she is an amazingly prolific commentator on the national political scene, Sullivan because of her comments on how the media works (and because I used to work for her at The Buffalo News) and Applebaum as a foremost expert on Russia and Europe.
But, because that organization sells its writers in more than one kind of package, The Washington Post brand won’t be totally absent from The Tribune’s pages. We are hanging on to columnists Dana Milbank, George F. Will, Catherine Rampell, Alexandra Petri, Eugene Robinson and E.J. Dionne.
We are also continuing our relationship with syndicated columnists Leonard Pitts, Pulitzer-winning writer anchored at The Miami Herald, and Rich Lowry, the editor of the William F. Buckley-founded National Review.
Our decision to switch news services, rather than abandon both or keep both, was based partly on cost, but also on quality and on figuring out what makes sense in deals between organizations that, on the World Wide Web, are in competition with one another. As Utah Gov. Gary Herbert says about education, “It’s not all about the money, but it’s some about the money.”
I’m happy to have The Times columnists back on our pages. They are a good mix of old and young, liberal, conservative and independent, shoe-leather reporting and high-minded thought. (Though it does skew a bit male.)
Of course, even having said all of this, the true heart of The Salt Lake Tribune Opinion pages is made up of contributions from real people, writing from and/or about Utah. Letters to The Public Forum and submissions to our commentary pages.
Keep 'em coming.
George Pyle , editorial page editor of The Salt Lake Tribune, has published commentary in both The New York Times and The Washington Post. Not that anyone who works there now would remember.

The disgraceful legitimization of Stacey Abrams’ election conspiracy theories

Texto completo: Failed gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams is the media’s favorite loser.
She lost in 2018 by tens of thousands of votes and she refuses to accept her defeat. It's as simple as that.
Abrams alleges, without evidence, that Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp stole the election from her. Unsurprisingly, many major newsrooms have been more than happy to indulge and spread her conspiratorial delusions. It's disgraceful.
On Aug. 12, for example, the New Yorker published a bit of pro-Abrams fan mail titled, “Stacey Abrams’s Fight for a Fair Vote.” The subhead adds, “As the 2020 elections approach, Abrams is leading the battle against voter suppression.” As you would expect from an article bearing that sort of headline, the New Yorker article gives a more-than-sympathetic ear to Abrams’ claim that she was robbed in the 2018 Georgia gubernatorial election.
“Georgians, though, still use the terms ‘won’ and ‘lost’ advisedly, not only because the Democrat never technically conceded but also because of the highly irregular nature of the contest,” it reads.
It adds elsewhere, “Abrams … is focused on addressing the irregularities that her campaign identified,” and “Many people in and outside Georgia believe that, without the irregularities, Abrams would have won.”
Abrams is even quoted as saying, “I’m gonna tell you what I’ve told folks across this state, and this is not a partisan statement, it’s a true statement: We won.”
There is not even an attempt by the New Yorker to question the failed candidate’s ludicrous claim.
Similarly, on Aug. 12, Vogue published a profile with the none-too-subtle headline, “Can Stacey Abrams Save American Democracy?”
You can guess where the article itself stands on Abrams’ unfounded allegations of election rigging. One passage in particular reads:
There is more cheering, and an air of reverence in the room. Abrams’s run for governor in 2018 ended in a loss of just 54,723 votes—a stunning, public blow. And yet she emerged from it as a kind of bellwether Democrat, a vision of her party’s future. She tripled Latino, Asian-American, and Pacific Islander voter turnout and doubled youth participation in her state. She inspired 1.2 million black Democrats in Georgia to vote for her (more than the total number of Democratic gubernatorial voters in 2014). And she gained the highest percentage of the state’s white Democratic voters in a generation. All of this despite widespread reports of voter suppression and a Republican opponent, Brian Kemp—Georgia’s then secretary of state—who oversaw the purging of about 670,000 registered voters in 2017 alone. Some 53,000 voter registrations were still pending a month ahead of the election.
As with the New Yorker, there is no effort from Vogue to question whether Abrams’ post-election narrative is even true.
Speaking of Abrams, she appeared in person on MSNBC this weekend and was asked by host Katy Tur: "Do you think the vote was stolen from you, the election was stolen from you?"
"I think the election was stolen from the people of Georgia," Abrams responded.
Again, the MSNBC hosts did little to challenge this claim.
Later, on Tuesday, the New York Times published an op-ed claiming Gov. Kemp “played referee, scorekeeper and contestant so he could tip the scales in his favor in the 2018 election for governor against Stacey Abrams, whose voter protection efforts had begun years earlier.” This is not true, as most of the roles listed there were played by county elections boards.
The Washington Post also published a news report Tuesday claiming “widespread irregularities” characterized “the Georgia gubernatorial race, including inaccurate voter rolls, shortages of voting machines and provisional ballots, and lack of uniform rules for counting absentee ballots.” There were no such irregularities, and all election day reports hinting at problems were later accounted for.
Abrams must have an incredible publicist. Two glowing media profiles, cable news appearances, a friendly New York Times op-ed and a Washington Post report published all in the same week? Someone deserves a raise. As for the facts of the Georgia race, those are quite different.
Kemp won with 50.2% of the vote, compared to Abrams’ 48.8%. There is no evidence to support her assertion that her supporters' votes were suppressed. In fact, as I have written before, the data points in the other direction. Voter turnout in 2018 was 3.9 million votes, massive compared to the 2.5 million votes cast in the previous midterm election of 2014, and almost as many as the estimated 4.1 million votes cast in Georgia during the 2016 presidential election. Turnout was up to presidential levels, very high for a midterm.
Why, then, are newsrooms doing so much to allow Abrams’ unfounded conspiracy to go unchallenged?
Or to put it another way, why was Alex Jones banned from social media if mainstream commentators can get away with saying things just as batty?

Texto completo: It's still summer, but the coffee chain Dunkin' is looking ahead to fall, getting a jump on Starbucks with pumpkin doughnuts, a signature latte and pumpkin-scented lip balm.
As a heat wave bears down on parts of the country, what could be better than wrapping your sweaty palms around a steaming pumpkin-flavored latte?
If that is not your idea of summer fun, take it up with the coffee and doughnut chain that now goes by the name Dunkin', which announced on Monday that it was "stepping up the seasonal celebration" by offering its fall spread almost a week earlier than last year.
Eight Dunkin' stores will be temporarily rebranded as "Pumpkin" on Wednesday. They will serve free pumpkin-flavored beverages and "Munchkins lip balm" with a pumpkin scent. Yes, you read that right.
Two new products will also be on offer: apple cider doughnuts and a signature pumpkin-flavored latte with cinnamon and sugar, clearly intended as a rival to Starbucks's popular Pumpkin Spice Latte, which may also be arriving earlier than in the past. A latte war is brewing.
Don't blame climate change for the early arrival of the gourds.
"Every year during the peak of summer our guests begin to tell us they are ready for their pumpkin fix," Dunkin' said in a statement, adding that annual sales of pumpkin-flavored products hit an all-time high in 2018.
But is it too soon? Local television and radio stations posed the question to Twitter users, with mixed results.
Some were in favor, like Allison Hopkins of Jacksonville, Fla., where temperatures were in the 90s on Tuesday. "I woke up with a distinct craving for a pumpkin spice latte and scarf season," she wrote.
But for others, it was too soon to be thinking about orange foliage, autumn walks and Halloween. Like holiday creep, pumpkin creep is real.
In recent years, pumpkin-flavored Cheerios, cookies and candies have appeared on store shelves long before Halloween. Whether real pumpkin is actually used by manufacturers in all of these products is subject for debate. One thing is sure: Pumpkins and pumpkin spice are not the same.
A Dunkin' spokeswoman confirmed that the beverages contained no actual fruit: "Our pumpkin coffee and lattes are made with pumpkin spice flavoring similar to that used in pumpkin pie. We use real pumpkin in our seasonal baked goods, including pumpkin doughnuts and muffins."
All the marketing experts we called were on vacation, so we will remind readers what Liz Dunn, founder of Talmage Advisors, a brand strategy consulting firm, once told The New York Times: The makers of pumpkin spice products were trying to capitalize on consumers' urge to engage with and discuss limited-time offerings via social media. So it's only natural companies would try to introduce the flavor earlier each year.
"If companies can get people to do it for a longer period of time, it can only increase relevance," she said. "That's brand magic right there -- unless, of course, it backfires." She said that in 2017, so we guess that it hasn't.
Indeed, Starbucks has introduced its Pumpkin Spice Latte earlier and earlier each year since the debut in 2003.
The PSL, as it is known in pumpkin lover circles, remains the company's most popular seasonal beverage, Starbucks says. It is sold in 50 countries and has even inspired people to bathe in it.
Business Insider has been reading the tea leaves, so to speak, and spotted Starbucks employees spilling the beans on social media that pumpkin spice lattes would return on Aug. 27, the earliest date ever. The reporter even tweeted out a chart of start dates going back to 2011.
A spokesman for Starbucks declined to confirm the date.
"We're not quite ready to reveal our plans for this year," the spokesman said in an email to The Times, adding, "But if you're looking for a reason to celebrate the season, stop by your nearest grocery store and pick up one of our fall products." Pumpkin spice creamer! Pumpkin spice cookie straws!
He also suggested visiting a Facebook group hosted by the company called the Leaf Rakers Society, which is described as "a forum where we constructively work together with Mother Nature to help autumn arrive earlier in the calendar year."
Over at Dunkin', the company is wasting no time. By Aug. 21, more than a month before the autumn equinox, stores nationwide will carry the complete fall menu. The doughnut company did not name the places where the rebranded outlets would be, but the initial letters of each city and town will spell out the word P-U-M-P-K-I-N-'.
On Tuesday around lunchtime, customers at a Dunkin' store in Midtown Manhattan were oblivious that pumpkin season was imminent. None of the nearly two dozen patrons polled had stopped in looking for pumpkin products.
"In August?" asked a man named Andrew, who lives on the Upper West Side. He ordered a cafe au lait and said he preferred his drinks without any flavoring.
Behind the counter, Christopher De Leon, who has been working at the location for about a year, confirmed that customers had indeed been known to request the pumpkin-flavored drinks in July.
Mr. De Leon said the store should offer pumpkin syrup year-round. "Just keep it," he said.

Agente de la Patrulla Fronteriza que llamó a los inmigrantes “infrahumanos” admite que hirió a uno de ellos

Texto completo: Antolín López Aguilar , un ciudadano guatemalteco de 23 años, intentó el 3 de diciembre de 2017 cruzar la frontera de Nogales, Arizona, para entrar en territorio de EEUU. Pero Matthew Bowen , un agente de la Patrulla Fronteriza que dos semanas antes había definido a los inmigrantes como él “infrahumanos”, y “salvajes asesinos”, interceptó el intento.
El agente fue acusado posteriormente de golpear y herir al migrante con un vehículo del servicio de Aduanas y Protección Fronteriza (CBP, por sus siglas en inglés) cuando este trató de escapar de él y de otros compañeros que trataban de detenerlo. El joven fue hospitalizado tras el accidente.
Ahora, Bowen reconoce que trató de atropellarlo. “Lo golpeé de manera intencional con fuerza desmesurada” , aseguró en una declaración recogida en documentos de una corte federal y citada por The New York Times y otros medios. El abogado del agente, Sean Chapman, confirmó a EFE que su cliente admitió ser culpable de esos hechos.
Bowen agregó en su declaración que sus actos “no estaba justificados” y violaron los derechos de López-Aguilar “protegidos por la Constitución de EEUU”.
Tras el accidente, el migrante fue sentenciado a 30 días de prisión por tratar de entrar ilegalmente al país, según el diario The Arizona Republic. The New York Times dice que se desconoce lo que pasó después con él.
Este y otros medios aseguran que el agente se enfrentaría a hasta un año de prisión y podría ser multado con 100.000 dólares cuando una corte determine en octubre la sentencia por el caso. El abogado dijo a EFE que a cambio de la admisión de culpabilidad y de renunciar a su posición en la Patrulla Fronteriza, Bowen evitará el juicio en su contra y quedará en libertad provisional.
El agente, que estuvo trabajando de patrullero desde 2008, fue suspendido de empleo y sueldo a partir de su procesamiento judicial en junio de 2018, según algunos medios.
El caso de Matthew Bowen cobró relevancia nacional en mayo de este año, cuando se supo que, dentro del proceso por el intento de atropello del migrante guatemalteco en la corte de distrito de Tucson, Arizona, salieron a la luz mensajes de corte racista y agresivo contra los inmigrantes enviados por Bowen a otros agentes fronterizos anteriormente a ese hecho.
En estos mensajes, el agente se refería a los inmigrantes con expresiones como “escoria”, “repugnante basura infrahumana” que “no merece ni ser astillas para prender un fuego”. Según su abogado, lo que se dice en ellos no es extraordinario, y responde a sentimientos “habituales entre los patrulleros de Tucson”.
Posteriormente, sin embargo, el abogado aclaró que sus explicaciones concernían sólo a la palabra “tonc”, usada en los mensajes para referirse a los inmigrantes, y que se sospecha que puede ser una onomatopeya del sonido de un agente golpeándoles con una linterna en la cabeza. Otra interpretación podría ser el acrónimo “temporalmente fuera de su país nativo” (escrito en inglés).
The New York Times asegura que la corte determinó que los mensajes enviados antes del accidente no se podían considerar relevantes para el caso. Pero una juez estableció que a partir de la fecha del intento de atropello, los mensajes de Bowen que pudieran referirse a este asunto o con contenidos racista sí lo serían.
El día después del accidente, Bowen confesó en un mensaje a un compañero que sí había usado una camioneta Ford F-150 para intentar detener a un migrante, pero que solo había sido “un pequeño empujón”.
El agente fue acusado también de falsificar un documento enviado al jefe del Sector de Tucson de la Patrulla Fronteriza y en el que “declaró falsamente que no estaba seguro si su vehículo contactó a López-Aguilar, y que nunca tuvo la intención de golpear, asustar o entrar en contacto con el hombre que huía del agente”. Tras su admisión de responsabilidad, los fiscales acordaron desestimar esta acusación, dice The Arizona Republic.
En el pasado, Bowen ya había sido acusado de usar fuerza excesiva sin motivo para realizar arrestos en al menos cinco ocasiones.

Texto completo: "Language alone protects us from the scariness of things with no names."
Of course, that language from Toni Morrison perfectly suits this time, when the names we give the things that scare us hardly seem enough.
It is fitting that in a month when America has been exposed to the words of a white nationalist screed shared before a man filled with hate murdered 22 human beings in El Paso, Texas, we can find some comfort in Morrison's life and legacy, and in the power of words used masterfully by the first African American woman to win the Nobel Prize in literature.
Morrison gave hope and encouragement to so many writers who saw her center black life and history -- the pain and love and everything in between -- in literature, and forced everyone to pay attention.
Her words were, and are, an inspiration, especially to those, like me, who saw the possibilities of a life of writing that validated experiences many Americans viewed as an afterthought or beside the point. We try to match her example of expression without compromise, though we might never come close to her genius. With her death at 88 on Aug. 5, the world lost a giant when so many of our leaders are so small.
It came during a week spent pushing back at the reluctance to name a president's racism -- revealed in words, spoken on Twitter and at rallies, which so closely resemble the "manifesto" of the man who announced his intentions to slaughter Mexican Americans before he traveled to El Paso with the intention of causing havoc in an American city known for its peacefulness and tolerance.
It's been a time of a grudging realization by some of the importance of speaking precisely and strongly, naming domestic terrorism for what it is, for what our country's intelligence services have been saying it has been for years. White supremacists have not been timid about excreting their twisted ideology as they bond over conspiracy theories on the internet and, increasingly, in the open. They pose a dangerous threat to what America is supposed to be, more serious in our time than the foreign intruders Americans have been taught to fear.
In her words, Morrison asked those who cling to these myths of superiority to look to themselves: "What are you without racism? Are you any good? Are you still strong? Still smart? Do you still like yourself? ... If you can only be tall because someone's on their knees, then you have a serious problem."
The woman who said she has always refused to be a victim called out racism for what it is: "The very serious function of racism ... is distraction. It keeps you from doing your work. It keeps you explaining, over and over again, your reason for being. Somebody says you have no language and so you spend 20 years proving that you do. Somebody says your head isn't shaped properly so you have scientists working on the fact that it is. Somebody says that you have no art so you dredge that up. Somebody says that you have no kingdoms and so you dredge that up. None of that is necessary."
"There will always be one more thing."
When I was asked years ago to introduce Morrison when she gave a speech in Charlotte, North Carolina, no amount of preparation and practice could keep my knees from knocking when the evening came, when I quoted lines from "Beloved," the novel I return to. She was gracious, lovely, thoughtful -- and generous, not only to me but to the throng of students who sat at her feet during a reception at the home of the president of the university that sponsored her visit.
Morrison's death was a shock, not just because it was so sudden but also because it felt as if she would live forever. Her words and wisdom will, as will her example of speaking the truth out loud and without apology.
I'm not surprised that the current president has yet to weigh in on Morrison's passing. After Donald Trump was elected, she wrote in The New Yorker: "So scary are the consequences of a collapse of white privilege that many Americans have flocked to a political platform that supports and translates violence against the defenseless as strength. These people are not so much angry as terrified, with the kind of terror that makes knees tremble."
Trump has chosen instead to again return to criticizing his White House predecessor, as well as those who would question the sincerity of his reaction to a week of carnage.
That predecessor, President Barack Obama, awarded Morrison the Presidential Medal of Freedom.
At the 2012 ceremony, Obama said: "Toni Morrison's prose brings us that kind of moral and emotional intensity that few writers ever attempt. From 'Song of Solomon' to 'Beloved,' Toni reaches us deeply, using a tone that is lyrical, precise, distinct and inclusive. She believes that language 'arcs toward the place where meaning might lie.' The rest of us are lucky to be following along for the ride."
Last week, Obama mourned her as a "national treasure." He said in a statement: "Her writing was not just beautiful but meaningful -- a challenge to our conscience and a call to greater empathy."
Empathy is an emotion Trump must try to conjure as he struggles to provide moral leadership to a nation that is hurting.
But even though he is at this moment missing what America needs, there is Toni Morrison lighting a path forward: "This is precisely the time when artists go to work. There is no time for despair, no place for self-pity, no need for silence, no room for fear. We speak, we write, we do language. That is how civilizations heal."

Texto completo: "Raised in Captivity"
Chuck Klosterman
Penguin Press, 320 pp., $26
“He wasn’t trying to be a jackass,” begins one story in Chuck Kloster- man’s “Raised in Captivity,” which marks the first short fiction collection by the pop culture critic. “He was trying to make conversation.”
There may be no tidier way to summarize the often contrarian, pop culture-obsessed and awe-inspiringly granular writing of this longtime essayist – and Klosterman admits as much in the brief piece “Just Asking Questions.”
In it, one Klosterman-esque character (known only as “jackass”) interrogates the other about describ- ing an ex’s infidelity with “his best friend” and questions whether the phrase is true or a trick of managing a painful memory given the scenario is something of a cliche. In building a case for his argument, jackass annoys his friend and perhaps the reader as well.
Klosterman’s curiosities aren’t for everyone. But this is the kind of strange, sharply detailed and often slyly funny examination of cultural behavior and norms he does unlike anyone else.
Whether through books delving into his Midwestern youth and love for ’80s hair metal (“Fargo Rock City”), personal relationships (“Killing Yourself To Live: 85% of a True Story”) or conventional wisdom (“But What If We’re Wrong? Thinking About the Present As If It Were the Past”), there is no subject too ephemeral or superficial to pull at from all angles. Little wonder Klosterman briefly wrote the New York Times Magazine advice column “The Ethicist,” where he examined moral quandaries with a jeweler’s eye and an eagerness to explore contradictions.
Also writing for outlets such as Spin, GQ and ESPN’s short-lived sports-centric spinoff Grantland, Klosterman has tried his hand at fiction but with mixed results. The 2008 novel “Downtown Owl” was an affectionately drawn if at times downcast trip back to the ’80s North Dakota of Klosterman’s past, while 2011’s “The Visible Man” felt more superficial, like an overwrought distillation of his fascination with ethical questions constructed around a character’s ability to become invisible.
“Raised in Captivity” can display both of those qualities, though to be fair it’s hard to feel like a conventional fiction experience is really what Klosterman is after. With most stories rising out of an unexpected situation or the consideration of a single question or idea over the span of just a few pages, the book’s scattershot style earns its front cover label as “fictional nonfiction.”
For instance, what would happen if a high school football coach pursued victory by running only one play, one designed to exploit the game’s rules and probabilities? “Execute Again” views such a monomaniacal pursuit through the eyes of one of the coach’s players, and Klosterman revels in imagining both the sort of person who commits to that idea and the subsequent fallout with a sports obsessive’s eye and dark humor.
Or what if a medical implant allowed fathers-to-be to experience the pain of labor? “Pain Is a Concept by Which We Measure Our God” explores the idea to its logical conclusion.
With that kind of playful self-awareness, it’s hard to begrudge the bite-size ideas explored here, especially peppered with Klosterman’s sharp wit and deep-cut descriptions that will be exceptionally vivid to some but useless to those not already in his tribe. “He was unshaven and a bit slovenly, but not to the level of Aqualung,” Klosterman writes in “Never Look at Your Phone,” and while knowledge of Jethro Tull isn’t required for “Raised in Captivity,” it will round parts into higher definition.
Klosterman’s interrogative nature sometimes means these stories yield little more than premises for wry jokes while others unfortunately feel cut off too soon.
Consider these stories the products of the kind of conversations that come up between old friends as the hours grow late. Some are rich enough to reward further exploration, while others trail off, but all are pleasant enough to have around. This friend just enjoys the push and pull of arguments, whether based in reality or not. And he doesn’t care if he sounds like a jackass.

Texto completo: Modern military hardware need not be “new” in order to be extremely effective—and to be an ongoing source of anxiety among your rivals for world power.
The B-52 bomber—which is slated to be in use for almost a century with the United States Air Force, albeit with significant improvements in engines and avionics over the models you remember from Dr. Strangelove, by the time it is retired—is one example.
SEE ALSO: Ray Dalio Wants to Remind People How Exciting Oceans Are
Another example is the Kilo-class submarine, which entered service with the Soviet Navy in 1980, and—following significant upgrades—is today under the Russian flag harassing British warships and tapping into internet cables on the ocean floor virtually undetected, according to very rattled sources within the UK military.
The Telegraph was the first to report the worries, which include the belief that new and improved diesel-powered Kilo-class boats—more accurately referred to as the Varshavyanka class—equipped with stealth technology are stalking British warships undetected, in British territorial waters.
And at least one Russian submarine has already successfully demonstrated its potential by cruising nearly undetected along a NATO member-state’s coastline, the newspaper reported. (We say almost, because if it were truly undetected , it couldn’t become a threat in the press.)
The new Kilos, first delivered to the Russian Navy in 2013, have been on Western military observers’ minds for several years (in no small part because the Russians have chosen to sink most of their Navy-related investments, post-USSR, into submarines).
They are relatively small—238 feet long and 32 feet wide—and have a small crew of 53 sailors. As The National Interest reported, they aren’t fast, they can’t cruise particularly long, and they aren’t very good in the deep ocean.
Despite this, with their advanced stealth technology and quiet-running diesel engines, they cost about $2 billion per boat, according to Global Security. A major source of hard currency for the flagging Russian economy, at least six improved Kilo boats have been sold to Vietnam to further that country’s hopes of counterbalancing Chinese influence in the South China Sea.
The Russian Baltic Fleet is said to have six Varshavyanka/improved Kilo-class subs. Construction on another six, to be delivered to the Pacific Fleet, began in 2016, with the first delivered this past March.
Their main function is to serve as “sub-hunters,” seeking out and destroying larger and louder ballistic-missile boats before they can hit land-based targets—such as the nuclear warhead-equipped submarines that are one-third of the nuclear deterrent in both the UK and the United States—and to interdict other shipping in “shallow waters,” which is why they might be on the minds of British war hawks seeking imperative (and funding) to upgrade their own complement of ships.
But what makes them so quiet? The design of the hull is said to look like a drop of water, for one, and thus creates very little resistance. The propellers are also semi-separated from the hull—mounted on a rubber base—which further cuts down on the vibrations that would otherwise reveal the submarine’s position. And they can stay submerged, moving very slowly, for up to two weeks.
The success of the new “super-Kilos” represents a remarkable turnout for Russian President Vladimir Putin, whose first term was marred by the high-profile loss of the Kursk , an Antey-class nuclear-powered submarine, during a 2000 exercise. The Kursk was only six years old at the time of its loss, and both Putin and the Russian Navy were criticized for bungling and then covering up the attempted and ultimately failed recovery of the boat. All 118 sailors aboard perished, including the at least 23 who survived the initial explosion and sinking.
And not that the Russian submarine forces are somehow invincible. Over the summer, Russian state-run media admitted that a fire had broken out on a “deep-sea vessel,” believed to be a nuclear-powered submarine, according to The New York Times .
Whatever threat the improved Kilo subs pose isn’t new—but if they are operating close to British waters AND tapping into internet cables, that would represent a relatively new and newly aggressive use. But as the Russian news agency TASS reported, the Russians believe any recent noise over the Kilos is just a scare tactic meant to shake loose more defense funding.
And as luck would have it, British military sources are whispering in The Telegraph ’s ear just as the British Navy is adjusting to a new commander. Admiral Tony Radakin is already on record saying that he wants more investment and a “less stifling process” in order to upgrade the British presence in the North Atlantic.
In other words, on the open ocean, much is the same as it’s always been among the great powers. The only thing changing is the gear.

Morning Exercise May Offer Most Weight Loss Benefits

Texto completo: People who exercise in the morning seem to lose more weight than people completing the same workouts later in the day, according to a new study of workouts and waistlines. The findings help shed light on the vexing issue of why some people shed considerable weight with exercise and others almost none, and the study adds to the growing body of science suggesting that the timing of various activities, including exercise, could affect how those activities affect us.
The relationship between exercise and body weight is somewhat befuddling. Multiple past studies show that a majority of people who take up exercise to lose less weight drop fewer pounds than would be expected, given how many calories they are burning during their workouts. Some gain weight.
But a few respond quite well, shedding pound after pound with the same exercise regimen that prompts others to add inches.
This variability interests and puzzles Erik Willis, a data analyst with the Center for Health Promotion and Disease Prevention at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. For almost a decade, he and colleagues at the University of Kansas, the University of Colorado Denver and other institutions have overseen the Midwest Exercise Trial 2, an extensive examination of how regular, supervised exercise influences body weight.
In that study, about 100 overweight, previously inactive young men and women worked out five times a week at a physiology lab, jogging or otherwise sweating until they had burned up to 600 calories per session.
After 10 months of this regimen, almost everyone had dropped pounds. But the extent of their losses fluctuated wildly, even though everyone was doing the same, supervised workouts.
When, for a 2015 study, the researchers tried to tease out what had distinguished the biggest losers from those who had lost less, they turned up surprisingly few differences.
Flummoxed, Willis and one of his collaborators, Seth Creasy, a professor of exercise physiology at the University of Colorado Denver’s Anschutz campus, started brainstorming other possible, perhaps unexpected contributors to the enormous variability to weight loss.
They hit upon activity timing.
The science of chronobiology, which studies the ways in which when we do something alters how our bodies respond, is of great interest now. Many recent studies have looked at how meal timing, for instance, affects weight control, including whether exercising before or after breakfast matters. But far less has been known about whether the timing of exercise, by itself, influences whether people lose weight with workouts.
So, for the new study, which was published in July in The International Journal of Obesity, Willis and his colleagues sifted through their data again, this time looking at when people in the Midwest trial had shown up at the university lab.
In that study, participants could visit the gym whenever they wished between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m., signing in each time, so researchers had plenty of precise information about their schedules. The scientists also had tracked everyone’s calorie intakes and daily movement habits throughout the 10 months, using activity trackers and liquid energy tracers. They knew, too, whether and by how much people’s weights had changed.
Now, they checked weight change against exercise schedules and quickly noticed a consistent pattern.
Those people who usually worked out before noon had lost more weight, on average, than the men and women who typically exercised after 3 p.m.
The researchers uncovered a few other, possibly relevant differences between the morning and late-day exercisers. The early-exercise group tended to be slightly more active throughout the day, taking more steps in total than those who worked out later. They also ate a bit less, although the difference amounted to barely 100 calories per day on average. Overall, such differences were barely discernible.
Yet, they may cumulatively have contributed to the striking differences in how many pounds people lost, Willis says.
Of course, this study was not large or designed from the start to delve into the chronobiology of exercise and weight. The researchers had not randomly assigned people to work out at particular times, so the links between exercise timing and weight loss they saw now in their reanalysis could be odd accidents related to individual participants’ preferences and schedules with little relevance for the rest of us.
Still, the statistical associations were strong, Willis says. “Based on this data, I would say that the timing of exercise might - just might - play a role” in whether and to what extent people drop pounds with exercise, he says.
But he also points out that most of those who worked out later in the day did lose weight, even if not as much as the larkish exercisers, and almost certainly became healthier.
“I would not want anyone to think that it’s not worth exercising if you can’t do it first thing in the morning,” he says. “Any exercise, at any time of day, is going to be better than none.”

Saracho of 'Vida' pushes for diversity

Texto completo: When Variety's Marc Malkin sat down for a conversation with "Vida" showrunner Tanya Saracho as part of the 2019 National Association of Latino Independent Producers (NALIP) Media Summit, she admitted that her Mexican heritage wasn't always a point of pride.
In fact, she once attempted to erase the evidence: "When I came to this country, I was trying to get rid of my accent," she said, explaining that her motivation was a desire to join the speech and debate team as a student in Texas.
But Saracho has since emerged as an outspoken voice for Latinx representation in Hollywood, which is why she was honored with the Media Advocacy Award at the organization's Latino Media Awards gala.
Last year, Saracho signed a three-year production deal with Starz, and she's currently working on Season 3 of the series in addition to a new show titled "Bruja."
During her conversation with Malkin, Saracho recounted her journey from aspiring actress to playwright to TV writer (writing for mainstream hits like "Girls" and "How to Get Away with Murder"), which ultimately culminated in the opportunity to create "Vida."
"Me being here is an accident," she said.
As it turns out, instead of perfecting the art of American enunciation, competitive public speaking awakened something in Saracho. "I was always a ham," she said, and soon she fell in love with performing in front of an audience. More importantly, she learned about the lack of diversity in American theater, which inspired her to pursue playwriting, and since Saracho tends to think big, she also founded Teatro Luna - the first all-Latina theater company in the country.
Standing out as a fresh voice in the contemporary theater scene, her plays soon attracted the attention of The New York Times, which helped Saracho get an agent.
Her gift for storytelling also led to her first job as a staff writer for Marc Cherry's "Devious Maids."
Saracho became determined to prove her value as a TV writer with her next job on HBO's LGBTQ series, "Looking." "I was there because of my queerness," she said, and this experience informed her inclusive vision for "Vida," where she writes sex scenes for nonbinary people too. Saracho is the first to admit that she didn't have to fight to get her passion project made - Starz pitched it to her, and its offer included the creative control to hire Latinx talent behind and in front of the camera.
But one victory does not constitute a movement in her eyes. "I can count the Latinx-themed shows with my hand," she said. "We're definitely having a moment, but it's dangerous to congratulate ourselves too much - we're not there yet."

Texto completo: "In the long country cut with rain, somehow there was nowhere to begin."
So reflects the nameless character, known only as "the Kid," as he wanders an apocalyptic America in Samuel R. Delany's science-fiction novel "Dhalgren." A description of the book's physical setting as well as the Kid's fugue state, this sentence exemplifies what Delany has described as the task of fiction: achieving "resonance between an idea and a landscape." It also happens to describe the vertiginous task of writing about Delany.
For there is, indeed, nowhere to begin with Delany. Born in Harlem in 1942, Delany published his first novel at the age of 19, inaugurating a broad, genre-spanning career that now includes over 40 published works and several major literary awards. His writing combines space opera with neo-slave narrative, memoir, sword-and-sorcery fantasy and an elegy for the sexual freedoms of pre-Giuliani Times Square. Delany's prismatic output is among the most significant, immense and innovative in American letters. And because there is no way to summarize his work, about Delany we can never be experts. We can only be enthusiasts. We cannot hope to describe his oeuvre, only our encounter with his oeuvre, and how this encounter has transformed us.
"It is not that I have no past. Rather, it fragments on the terrible and vivid ephemera of now."
Maybe it was that the Kid's experience of loss resonated with my own. In 1992, when I was 21, my relationship with my family had been shattered by my queerness, and I had absconded to San Francisco for a girlfriend who dumped me upon arrival. In the aftermath, I found a job waiting tables on the overnight shift at Sparky's Diner on Church Street in the Castro, and I found Delany.
Around 4:30 a.m., with the neon SPARKYS sign casting a pool of foggy pink onto the sidewalk -- when the ravers had finished their French fries and tumbled off into the wet blue pre-dawn -- I would crouch in the kitchen, reading "Dhalgren," and later, the book that made me a Delany enthusiast for life, "Stars in My Pocket Like Grains of Sand."
"Have you ever arrived on a world at dawn?" asks that novel's "industrial diplomat" and technology ambassador, Marq Dyeth. "You can see the world, this one orange and green with hydrocarbon soups, that one blue and white with oxidized hydrogen broths, another grit gray, still another dust brown, but all, whatever their dominant color, scythed away, as one circles, with night."
This rhapsody on dawn as seen from space is delivered by Marq shortly after he is forcibly separated from his lover Rat Korga, a former slave and the sole survivor of a war-torn planet. At the hands of the General Intelligence -- an agency that functions like a combination of OKCupid and the C.I.A., with even more invasive reams of personal information on the universe's inhabitants -- Korga is calculated to be Marq's perfect erotic match and sent to him. They spend several glorious days together, but the G.I. deems their connection too dangerous, and Korga is deported.
"Stars" manages to connect the ethereal appeal of orbit with Marq's yearning for Korga. "Desire isn't appeased by its object, only irritated into something more than desire that can join with the stars to inform the chaotic heavens with sense," he opines. "Fingers can't point to anything anymore. And without such indications -- oh, I still walk where I walked, look where I looked, but where I saw what once seemed wonderful, I see so little now -- I feel so little."
Delany's books interweave science fiction with histories of race, sexuality and control. In so doing, he gives readers fiction that reflects and explores the social truths of our world. In fact, he traces the lineage of contemporary speculative fiction to Martin Delany's "Blake; or the Huts of America," a 19th-century novel about the escape from slavery and insurrectionary desires in Cuba and the Southern United States that is, as Samuel Delany argues in his seminal 1998 essay "Racism and Science Fiction," "about as close to an sf-style alternate history novel as you can get."
The lesson of "Stars" -- one as intimidating and exciting to me now as when I first read it -- is that desire, language and history are bound together, and that literature has the capacity to realize these connections, and, from them, to spin singular webs.
In Delany's novels, desire and language are luminous silks, intensifying and refracting reality. His work thus becomes a paean to the experience of reading itself, which "Stars" makes palpable through ecstasies specific to sci-fi.
Before they are separated, Korga and Marq participate in a dragon hunt on the planet Vyalou. As they soar over a landscape "more mica than sand," they learn that when dragon-hunting on Vyalou, one momentarily fuses consciousness with the creature in flight. "Fly! I flew," Marq thinks. "Chills detonated my spine, my gills erupted rings of excitation, and I arched away, borne through the beat of other urges, to drop through the world built in my mouth, while Rat, at my shoulder, rose."
The emotional dynamism of Delany's sentences has been perhaps less acknowledged than his world-building, or the sweep of his vision. But when asked to speak about writing as a practice, Delany himself often turns to the art of sentences, and of how to imbue words with such "ekphrastic force" that they summon the material presence of an imagined world. When Korga and Marq return to themselves they are awe-struck, struggling to narrate the intensity of their own transformative experience. It is impossible not to hear in that a metatextual echo of the obsession of Delany's practice: that of creating the most immersive possible aesthetic experience for us, his readers and devoted enthusiasts.
"I was a dragon," Korga wonders aloud. And then, struck with the impossibility of communicating the exquisiteness of having been a dragon in flight, Korga reaches for the most apt simile he can imagine. "I was a dragon? I was a dragon!" he cries. "It's like reading."
Samuel Delany: A Starter Kit
The Motion of Light in Water
Although one can begin anywhere with Delany, most readers will want to start with this memoir, chronicling his marriage to the poet Marilyn Hacker, his early career as a writer, and the bubbling sexual expansiveness of gay male culture in midcentury Manhattan.
Return to Nevèrÿon
Delany's four-volume, very queer fantasy series repays the reader's attention. The world he builds begins with a slave uprising and tracks the self-emancipated Gorgik the Liberator as he travels the countryside fomenting further rebellions. The third book, "Flight From Nevèrÿon," contains the now-canonical story "The Tale of Plagues and Carnivals," which tracks the outbreak of a plague closely paralleling the onset of the AIDS crisis in New York.
Dhalgren
The travels of an amnesiac drifter through a burnt-out, alternate-reality America. There may be no other novel of the 1970s, or since, that so profoundly captures the dire atmosphere of a nation in economic and political free fall, and the persistence of love and the survival of eros amid such total brutality.
Times Square Red, Times Square Blue
Two extended essays on the social space of Times Square as it has been transformed by waves of gentrification that routed the thriving gay male cultures congregating in its porn theaters. Taking inspiration from Pound's "Cantos," Delany poses the essays as "periploi": contemporary versions of classical and medieval descriptions of coastlines, used as aids to early navigators. The "temporal coastline" of the midcentury 42nd Street/8th Avenue zone comes to life in Delany's classic of queer history.
About Writing
Even if you aren't a writer, you will be fascinated by Delany's generous, indispensable collection of essays on the practice and theory of writing. He has pointed his erudition and imagination toward concrete advice on building sentences, using adjectives and structuring fictional works. The thoughtfulness of this effort makes clear how seriously Delany takes the reader's experience of his texts, and how devoted he has been to confecting dreamworlds for us. "The fiction writer," he says in a bit of advice that might describe his own oeuvre, "is trying to create a false memory with the force of history."

Texto completo: Antonio Brown, the longtime superstar receiver for the Pittsburgh Steelers, is not practicing with his new team, the Oakland Raiders, because of a foot injury. The team hasn't revealed the injury or given a timetable for his return, according to ESPN.
Last week, he posted a picture of his feet on Instagram. His skin was badly blistered and peeling, though Brown did have a big smile.
How did it happen?
Officially we don't know. But reports, especially on NFL.com, say that Brown entered a cryogenic therapy chamber without proper footwear and got frostbite.
A cryogenic what?
A cryogenic therapy chamber subjects people to very cold temperatures, somewhere between minus 200 and minus 300 degrees Fahrenheit, for a short period of time. Elite athletes, including LeBron James, have been early adopters of the technology, although its use is spreading.
What is it supposed to do?
It is not known specifically why Brown went into the chamber, but adherents of the therapy have said it can help muscle soreness and even help people lose weight and look younger.
Does it really work?
Scientists are skeptical. Studies have found very little solid evidence that it helps any conditions. The Food and Drug Administration has not certified its use, and insurance will not pay for the sessions, which can cost $ 75 for three minutes. A New York Times reporter tried it out in 2017 and said it made her feel "hyper and euphoric." (She wore proper footwear.)
What are the Raiders saying?
Not much specifically. Coach Jon Gruden said of Brown's absence: "I think he's disappointed. We think he's disappointed. We'd like to get the party started. We'd like to get him out here." There is no official timetable, and off-the-record reports vary widely over how long Brown will be out.
Has anything like this happened before?
The sprinter Justin Gatlin told TMZ that he had also gotten frostbite from cryotherapy, and it took him months to heal. "It was a disaster. I had, like, boils and blisters all over my ankles," he said. "Every day I had to get those blisters popped by hand by a therapist. It just got really, really bad."
Is this the weirdest sports injury ever?
You be the judge.
Glenallen Hill of the Toronto Blue Jays in 1990 suffered cuts and carpet burns after waking up in a fright. "I have a phobia about spiders," Hill said. "In the nightmare, I was trying to get away from spiders." The previous year, another Blue Jay, David Wells, suffered injuries related to sleepwalking.
Steve Sparks of the Milwaukee Brewers dislocated his shoulder in 1994 trying to tear a phone book in half.
Bruce Walker of the New England Patriots suffered a chest injury in 1996 playing catch ... with a knife.
Michael Jordan severed a tendon in his finger in 1999 while cutting a cigar.
Sammy Sosa strained back ligaments in 2004 by sneezing.
Clint Barmes of the Colorado Rockies broke his collarbone in 2005 falling while carrying a heavy package of deer meat down stairs.
Lindsey Vonn hurt her thumb in 2015 breaking up a fight between her dogs.

I quit the 'Complacent State'

Texto completo: Chuck Park's resignation from the Foreign Service is effective Thursday.
I was 26, newly married and more than a little idealistic when I set off for my first diplomatic assignment almost a decade ago as a member of the 157th class of commissioned U.S. Foreign Service officers.
According to a certain type of right-leaning conspiracy theorist, that would make me part of "The Deep State" - a shadowy government within the government that puts its own interests above the expressed wishes of the electorate. Adherents to this theory believe that thousands of federal workers like me are plotting furiously to subvert the Trump administration at every turn. Many on the left, too, hope that such a resistance is secretly working to save the nation from the worst impulses of President Trump.
They have it all wrong. Your federal bureaucracy under this president? Call it "The Complacent State" instead.
Like many in my cohort, I came into the government inspired by a president who convinced me there was still some truth to the gospel of American exceptionalism. A child of immigrants from South Korea, I also felt a duty to the society that welcomed my parents and allowed me and my siblings to thrive.
Over three tours abroad, I worked to spread what I believed were American values: freedom, fairness and tolerance. But more and more I found myself in a defensive stance, struggling to explain to foreign peoples the blatant contradictions at home.
In Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, I spoke of American openness and friendship at consulate events as my country carried out mass deportations and failed thousands of "dreamers." I attended celebrations of Black History Month at our embassy in Lisbon as black communities in the United States demanded justice for Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown, Freddie Gray and the victims of the mass shooting at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, S.C. And in Vancouver, I touted the strength of the United States' democracy at the consulate's 2016 election-night party as a man who campaigned on racism, misogyny and wild conspiracy theories became president-elect.
Since then, I have seen Trump assert the moral equivalence of violent white nationalists and those who oppose them, denigrate immigrants from "shithole countries" and separate children from their parents at the border, only to place them in squalid detention centers.
But almost three years since his election, what I have not seen is organized resistance from within. To the contrary, two senior Foreign Service officers admonished me for risking my career when I signed an internal dissent cable against the ban on travelers from several majority-Muslim countries in January 2017. Among my colleagues at the State Department, I have met neither the unsung hero nor the cunning villain of Deep State lore. If the resistance does exist, it should be clear by this point that it has failed.
Instead, I am part of the Complacent State.
The Complacent State sighs when the president blocks travel by Muslim immigrants; shakes its head when he defends Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman; averts its gaze from images of children in detention camps. Then it complies with orders.
Every day, we refuse visas based on administration priorities. We recite administration talking points on border security, immigration and trade. We plan travel itineraries, book meetings and literally hold doors open for the appointees who push Trump's toxic agenda around the world.
So when I read a recent New York Times op-ed calling for the public shaming of the "midlevel functionaries who make the system run," I squirmed in my seat. We rank-and-file, like the Justice Department lawyer who recently endured public scrutiny for defending the administration's terrible treatment of detained children, don't like to be called out. And when we are, we shrink behind a standard argument - that we are career officials serving nonpartisan institutions.
We should be named and shamed. But how should we respond? One thing I agree with the conspiracy theorists about: The Deep State, if it did exist, would be wrong. Ask to read the commission of any Foreign Service officer, and you'll see that we are hired to serve "during the pleasure of the President of the United States." That means we must serve this very partisan president.
Or else we should quit.
I'm ashamed of how long it took me to make this decision. My excuse might be disappointing, if familiar to many of my colleagues: I let career perks silence my conscience. I let free housing, the countdown to a pension and the prestige of representing a powerful nation overseas distract me from ideals that once seemed so clear to me. I can't do that anymore.
My son, born in El Paso on the American side of that same Rio Grande where the bodies of Óscar Alberto Martínez Ramírez and his daughter were discovered, in the same city where 22 people were just killed by a gunman whose purported "manifesto" echoed the inflammatory language of our president, turned 7 this month. I can no longer justify to him, or to myself, my complicity in the actions of this administration. That's why I choose to resign.
The writer's resignation from the Foreign Service is effective Thursday.

Restrictionist groups seek distance from Texas shooting

Texto completo: Hours after the mass shooting in El Paso last weekend, Dan Stein, president of the Federation for American Immigration Reform, issued a tweet in the organization's name denouncing the "tragic" carnage and urging Americans to "stand together against senseless rage and destructive impulses."
FAIR, a leading proponent of restricting immigration, typically provides its 300,000 followers on Twitter and 2.1 million on Facebook with links to studies, news stories and podcasts warning of the economic, public safety and environmental costs of high immigration levels.
But Stein made no mention in his tweet of the online document police believe was written by the alleged killer, Patrick Wood Crusius, which cited many of the same arguments against immigration as a rationale and motivation for the attack that killed 22 people in a predominantly Hispanic city near the U.S.- Mexico border.
Stein's decision to rapidly issue a statement condemning the El Paso massacre - the group did not comment on the weekend's other mass shooting, in Dayton, Ohio - reflects a sense of alarm among FAIR and the small cohort of other restrictionist groups about potential political fallout from the massacres.
Long relegated to the fringes of the debate, these organizations have moved center stage under President Trump - helping to provide the intellectual and ideological framework for the administration's hard-line immigration agenda, one that immigrant rights advocates have decried as xenophobic and racist.
In an interview, Stein repeatedly brushed aside connections between FAIR's ideology and the suspect's, casting doubt on whether Crusius wrote the document and saying it was unfair to attribute those views as the reason for a deadly rampage.
"Any lunatic could can take paragraphs strung together from many different places and try to rationalize irrational behavior," Stein said. He suggested that the suspect was mentally ill and criticized Democrats for trying to exploit the mass shooting for political gain.
"The fact that this alleged manifesto was picked up by people desperate for attention in the crowded Democratic [presidential] field before the blood was even cleaned off the floor tells you everything about the 2020 election," he said.
Since the El Paso shooting, Democrats have intensified their condemnation of Trump, alleging, in the words of former vice president Joe Biden, that he had "fanned the flames of white supremacy." In the weeks before the attack, Trump issued racist tweets suggesting that four minority Democratic congresswomen "go back" to foreign countries, even though they are Americans, and he disparaged Rep. Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.), who is black, and criticized his district in Baltimore as a "disgusting, rat and rodent infested mess."
Other mass shooters over the past two years have echoed some of Trump's language about immigrants, including a gunman at a Pittsburgh synagogue last fall who decried immigrant "invaders" at a time when Trump was warning of an "invasion" of Central Americans at the border. But the online document linked to Crusius represents perhaps the most pointed connection between anti-immigration sentiment and white nationalism.
The statement attributed to Crusius mentioned a "Hispanic invasion" of Texas and expressed worries that the United States was in the process of a "cultural and ethnic replacement." It cited fears that immigrants would swamp taxpayers with free health care and other benefits, take over jobs and intensify the strain on environmental resources.
The higher birthrate of migrants, the statement argued, would speed up the cultural change, and it emphasized that the writer's beliefs predated Trump's election.
FAIR, along with two other Washington-based restrictionist groups, the Center for Immigration Studies (CIS) and Numbers USA, have avoided linking their positions to race or ethnicity, but they have pushed similar arguments about the burden that immigrants place on the native-born, and the purported difficulties they pose to assimilation in American culture and society.
"If you have a guy who is going to be angry about immigration, have a killer offering reasons for shooting up immigrants, how could he not use reasons that have already been articulated by legitimate sources?" said Mark Krikorian, executive director of CIS, who called the online document "remarkably well-written for a 21-year-old loner."
After the shooting, Krikorian wrote on Twitter that "it takes a special kind of evil to shoot children," and said the case appeared to be politically motivated violence that was meant as a terrorist act.
"There's only so many concerns about immigration," he said. "Of course he's going to articulate reasons that already have been spelled out in great detail by immigration skeptics. I don't know how you avoid that."
All three restrictionist groups were founded by John Tanton, a Michigan doctor who professed support for eugenics, a widely debunked belief that certain beneficial human traits can be made more prominent in a population through selective breeding.
Tanton, who died last month at 85, rejected criticism that his interest in immigration was based on race and ethnicity. But according to a 2011 profile in the New York Times, he wrote to a donor that he was concerned about "the decline of folks who look like you and me," and he warned a friend that "for European-American society and culture to persist requires a European-American majority, and a clear one at that."
The document attributed to Crusius referred to "The Great Replacement," a 2011 book by Renaud Camus, a French writer who promoted white-nationalist conspiracy theories that global elites were working to replace white Europeans with Muslims from Africa and the Middle East.
The Southern Poverty Law Center has included FAIR and CIS on its list of hate groups. In January, CIS filed a federal lawsuit, saying the designation had damaged the think tank's reputation.
"There are some extreme ideologies out there, whether on the left or right, and none of them should be acceptable, and we ought to have a civil discourse," said Ira Mehlman, a FAIR spokesman. "Our position is that everybody needs to moderate their tone."
Asked about Trump's tone, Mehlman struggled to find the right words before stating: "Look, he needs to recognize that his words and his tweets carry a lot of consequences and, like everybody else, should be used judiciously."
Stein was less circumspect, saying that "people can argue that Trump's style can be tamped down and he could be more eloquent. But nothing Trump has ever said, ever articulated, in a million years could possibly justify or be used to rationalize the behavior in El Paso."
The three groups have small staffs but outsize influence, with top officials appearing on Fox News Channel and writing opinion pieces for conservative news outlets, including Fox News and National Review.
Top Trump administration aides, including White House adviser Stephen Miller, the man behind some of the administration's most restrictive policies, have met with the groups and asked them to pass along studies and data.
Jon Feere, a former policy analyst at CIS, now serves as a senior adviser at Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Julie Kirchner, who worked at FAIR for a decade, is the ombudsman at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), while two other FAIR alums, Elizabeth Jacobs, a former lobbyist, and Robert Law, who was the group's government relations director, serve as senior advisers at USCIS.
Their presence illustrates an important distinction. While the president rails most often in public about illegal immigration, the groups are focused more intently on the broader ideological project of slashing legal immigration levels, which the Trump administration has sought to do by limiting asylum seekers, refugee admissions and guest workers.
Feere led a study at CIS about the merits of birthright citizenship, a constitutional right that Trump has threatened to try to end through executive power. Jacobs, according to Mother Jones, advocated for ending temporary protected status for Salvadorans, reducing refugee numbers and defunding sanctuary cities, which are also steps Trump has pursued.
The document attributed to Crusius did not appear to distinguish between legal and illegal immigration, blaming corporations for importing low-wage and high-skilled workers and lawmakers in both parties for allowing it.
"He did not cite our work," Krikorian said. "It had nothing to do with us."

The worry over immigration rhetoric and 'incitement' isn't genuine, it's political

Texto completo: Remember when President Trump said during the 2016 campaign said that Hispanics “didn’t build this country” and that they’re “getting away with murder”?
Me neither. Because he never said that about Hispanics, or even about illegal immigrants. He said it about hedge fund managers. And yet I don’t recall any Democrat or anyone in the national media fretting that he was “inciting hatred” against wealthy financiers.
Remember when he called the four minority congresswomen “weak, ineffective & stupid?"
Me neither, because that was actually former House Speaker Paul Ryan about whom Trump said that. I don’t recall any Democrat or anyone in the national media suffering in great worry that Ryan might start receiving death threats.
What about when Trump said of ABC News anchor Lester Holt, who is black, that if you “take away the glasses, he looks like a dumb guy?”
Me neither, because he said that about Washington Post writer George Will. I don’t recall any Democrat or anyone in the national media shocked that Trump was "dog whistling," as they do every time Trump calls a liberal minority dumb.
Noticing a pattern? Democrats only care to rage over Trump’s “rhetoric” when they think there's a political advantage to be gained. Otherwise, it’s all a fun show to them.
New York Times columnist Bret Stephens on Thursday advanced the frustratingly stupid narrative that Trump’s opposition to the endless stream of illegal immigration is what caused the mass shooting in El Paso last weekend. Stephens wrote that the shooting “directly implicates the immigrant-bashing xenophobic right led by Donald Trump.” He said that Trump “is guilty, in a broad sense, of a form of incitement.”
Stephens’ premier example of that “incitement” is a tweet from June in which Trump said Democrats “want” more illegal immigrants to “pour into and infest our Country, like MS-13” because the party views them “as potential voters.”
Yet every single word of that tweet is demonstrably true. Somebody tell me one proposal by any of the 2020 Democratic presidential candidates that would limit the inflow of illegal immigrants. There isn’t one. And why is it that Democrats turn their fingers raw clawing against any attempt to deport the millions of illegal immigrants currently living in the U.S.? Ask any Democrat in the 2020 field if illegal immigrants should be granted citizenship and the answer will invariably be yes. That’s because they know what party all of them will vote for.
Apparently under the impression that Trump is a dedicated student of African civil wars, Stephens said that his use of the word “infest” stirred echoes of Rwanda. I’m sorry to wake Stephens up from his sweet fantasy where every illegal immigrant is an aspiring doctor and teacher, or simply a young mother who wants to work as his nanny, but it’s not true. There really is an infestation of America by immigrant gang members, particularly on the East Coast. If he read the Washington Post, he would know that.
In June 2018, the Post reported on MS-13’s stronghold of an entire Maryland middle school. “Gang-related fights are now a near-daily occurrence at Wirt, where a small group of suspected MS-13 members at the overwhelmingly Hispanic school in Prince George’s County throw gang signs, sell drugs, draw gang graffiti and aggressively recruit students recently arrived from Central America,” the report said. “Teachers feel threatened but aren’t backed up. Students feel threatened but aren’t protected,” one of the school’s teachers said. “The school is a ticking time bomb.”
And from a report by the paper in December 2017: “As the gang has grown in strength in recent years, so has its sway over communities across the country. From Boston to Northern Virginia to Houston, a string of grisly MS-13 murders has highlighted its resurgence … ” Innocent people who find themselves in the grips of MS-13-controlled neighborhoods complain of gang violence, frequent robberies, drug dealing, and extortion. One woman who unknowingly moved into an MS-13-ravaged neighborhood of Maryland told the Post that one MS-13 leader threatened her, lest she pay $60 “rent” each week.
Stephens has been and always will be someone who isn’t bothered by mass illegal immigration. He’s free to live that way. But there are a lot of people who are bothered by it and they don’t have to shut up or speak in the way he wants them to because he thinks it sounds mean or because someone somewhere might use the same language before they shoot up a Walmart.
Democrats and their allies in the media don’t care about Trump’s “rhetoric” or any possible “incitement.” They care that he’s pushed them on an issue where they know they’ve been exposed.

Texto completo: It is hard for me to read some of the reaction to a derided New York Times headline without a smirk, a sigh and a forlorn shake of the head.
The controversy begins with the paper’s original headline Tuesday over a Page 1 story describing President Donald Trump’s statement on the weekend mass murders in Dayton and El Paso. "TRUMP URGES UNITY VS. RACISM," the headline declares. It was changed for later editions to "ASSAILING HATE BUT NOT GUNS."
Critics on the left, led by New York Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez retweeting a veiled criticism from statistics guru Nate Silver, declared the original headline as evidence of the Times’ — and by extension, all mainstream media’s — caving to the right. Critics on the right, led by the usual crowd on Fox News and the president himself, declared the change to be evidence of the Times’ — and by extension, all mainstream media’s — caving to the left.
Advocates of both sides declared it evidence that the newspaper could not be trusted. A Twitter campaign was mounted, presumably uniting the opposing forces against a common enemy, to encourage people to cancel their subscriptions to the Times. This all struck me as ridiculous and shortsighted.
Neither side made reference to the story the headline described, which, it is probably relevant to note, had way more than 280 characters and which, while no objective reader could find it particularly balanced, conveyed a thorough description of the issues it addressed with substantial and substantive commentary from many points of view.
Why, I wonder, are we so eager, so quick, so hungry to bend any opportunity into a sweeping political generality?
It’s not that headlines aren’t important or that editors don’t approach them with care. They are and we do. Even before the Daily Herald’s designers had begun framing out Tuesday’s front page, editor John Lampinen emphasized that we must take care not to ignore the president’s emphatic and clear condemnation of racism in whatever headline we came up with. (Ours, by the way, was "Trump condemns racism, focuses on mental illness.") But headlines are just one component in the telling of a story. They are a summary, produced — as a Times deputy managing editor wrote in describing the evolution of the headline in question — under the twin pressures of time and space, and they are not especially conducive to expressing nuance.
The truth is that both New York Times headlines are correct. It’s equally true that the second more completely describes the story. It’s also true that neither summarizes the whole story. What’s troubling is that both were so easily transformed into irrelevant talking points for the right and left.
And what’s most true — what’s really behind my smirk and my sighs — is that it is such utter nonsense to decry The New York Times as untrustworthy because of a headline. Those who want to define the paper as liberal can find plenty of evidence. Those who want to claim that the Times cost Hillary Clinton the election by focusing on her emails will not be deterred by disputation. But it is utterly ludicrous to suggest that you will not be well-informed and thoroughly engaged if you actually read The New York Times. Or The Washington Post, for that matter, or The Wall Street Journal or many other newspapers, large, medium and small, that qualify as whatever mainstream means.
Will you come across phrases, descriptions, opinions, news judgments and, yes, headlines that bother you? Yes, you will. Unless you rely on a single news source that shares your views and your thinking entirely, you will sometimes be angered and disappointed by things you see or read. But, you will not be better informed by abandoning some reliable news source. To the contrary, if you want to be better informed, you will add to your sphere of information.
So smirk sometimes. Roll your eyes occasionally. But be bigger than the rare annoyances and shortcomings you encounter. You’ll be better for it and more knowledgeable regarding the events and issues you care about.

How to Protect Your Lungs, and Look Chic Doing It

Texto completo: When tens of thousands of people descend on Nevada's Black Rock Desert in August for Burning Man, they should expect dust. A windstorm could sweep through the site at any moment, swirling the highly alkaline playa sand into clouds, and shrouding the festival's temporary city and its attendants under its cloak. It's best to come prepared.
Vogmask, a reusable face mask with an air filter, was designed with Burners in mind, but is intended to address environmental concerns broadly. When Marc Brown attended Burning Man in 2011, he was disappointed that there were "no cool-looking, highly efficient filtering face masks" to be found on the playa, despite the risk of what Burners have termed "playa lung," an infection caused by the inhalation of alkaline silica dust from the desert.
So he and his mother, Wendover Brown, decided to make their own, working with medical design engineers to ensure its efficacy. Since founding Vogmask in 2012, they have seen demand rise, not just in the United States but around the world.
Vogmask is just one in a small but growing category of products designed to help people navigate an increasingly polluted planet.
Ali Aubuchon, a performance artist and speech language pathologist from New York City, experienced playa lung twice during her first three years at Burning Man. She now makes sure to have a mask on at all times in Black Rock City. "It's a place that is not very easy to survive in without the proper supplies," said Ms. Aubuchon, 38, who performs under the name Ali Luminescent.
Protective face masks are a common accessory in countries such as Japan, where they are meant to prevent the spread of illness, and China, where they are often used as protection against the country's alarmingly high air pollution levels.
Mitsutoshi Horii, a sociology professor at Shumei University in Japan, has studied the use of face masks in Japanese culture. In a Skype call, he said that wearing the masks, a practice imported from the United States in 1919 after the Spanish influenza outbreak the year prior, evolved over the course of the 20th century into an accessory people use to deal with a variety of problems, such as airborne disease, air pollution and allergies.
Mr. Horii also sees the masks as a form of control over contemporary anxieties, like some religious rituals and superstitions. "When people feel uncertainty, masks are very easily accessible," he said. "By wearing them people just feel safe, like they are doing something."
Now, back in the United States, stylized surgical masks have appeared in celebrity paparazzi photos, pop stars' tour wardrobes and fashion collections. Billie Eilish, Ariana Grande, Pharrell Williams and Pete Davidson have been spotted wearing them. Virgil Abloh's Off-White label has its own line of face masks. And on Etsy, there are thousands of listings for handmade cloth surgical masks that are cute, but probably won't keep you from getting sick.
Hannah and Anthony Martinez of Logan, Utah, decided to start their own line of masks after attending Lucidity, a festival in Santa Barbara, Calif. "Afterwards our allergies were so bad, and there was so much dust and gunk," Ms. Martinez said.
The couple, who began selling rave and festival clothing on Etsy last year, made their first dust masks out of leftover fabric. Now their line includes a vibrant array of masks decorated with sequins, constellation drawings and abstract patterns.
For many people, however, the draw of these masks is purely practical. As wildfires, measles outbreaks and air quality alerts become more frequent, customers are turning to face mask manufacturers for protection against germs, allergens and other air particles. In California, air-filtering masks having become a common sight during wildfire season; in Utah, people frequently don them in the winter, when a phenomenon known as temperature inversion causes pollution to be trapped near the ground by a layer of warm air.
[Wirecutter, a product review company owned by The New York Times, recently published a guide to the most effective masks for coping with poor air quality .]
"Everybody on Earth at one point or another has said, 'I shouldn't be breathing this,"' Ms. Brown, of Vogmask, said.
As opposed to simple cloth masks, air-filtering masks such as Vogmask are designated by the F.D.A. as N95 respirators. The designation certifies the mask's ability to block at least 95 percent of 0.3-micron air particles under strict lab testing conditions.
N95 respirators are much more effective than simple cloth masks in protecting those who wear them from particles in the air, said Richard Peltier, a professor of environmental health sciences at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst.
"Any time that you are filtering air through a pleated face mask, you are removing some particles. But it's probably not really effective in reducing your exposure significantly," he said. Even N95 masks only work against solid particles and larger liquid droplets containing pathogens; they do not prevent exposure to polluting gases such as carbon monoxide.
Other companies making these masks include O2Today, in Salt Lake City; Airinum, a Swedish company; MetaMask, in Auckland, New Zealand; and Cambridge Mask and Respro, both British ventures. Many of these companies are marketing their masks as both preventive care products and lifestyle accessories.
"A young person who needs to wear a mask to protect their own health, like for going to school or going out in public, is much more willing and happy to wear a beautiful mask than a medical looking mask," Ms. Brown said.
That is especially the case for people with a compromised immune system, who often have to wear masks out of necessity. Emily Adams, 30, a spa manager from Beachwood, N.J., was diagnosed with cystic fibrosis at age 2. She welcomes the increasing popularity of air-filtering masks, which she wears to protect herself from infections.
"Now people can kind of look at me and be, like, 'All right, maybe they are sick, but like that mask is actually pretty cool,"' she said.

Texto completo: Wonderland Cookie Dough might just be every kid's dream come true.
It might be every adult's too.
Jeff Smith launched his cookie-dough food trailer last month, bringing the stuff of confectionery dreams to locations around Southwest Florida. The response? Local sweet-tooths are going nuts.
Because, cookie dough!
"Last Friday we had over 300 orders," Smith said. "It was crazy, but we handled it pretty well."
Wonderland offers a variety of cookie-dough centered options, plus four flavors of ice cream (chocolate, vanilla, strawberry and Superman) from Scoops on First in downtown Fort Myers.
"We're definitely not for a diet," Smith said, laughing.
Customers can buy scoops of cookie dough in 3, 5 and 7-ounce cups. There are eight flavors to choose from — chocolate chip, cake batter with sprinkles, brownie batter, crownie (a mix of chocolate chip and brownie), s'mores, peanut butter cup, cookies and cream, and a plain base which works well with Wonderland's toppings.
Those toppings include M&Ms, chocolate chips, white chocolate chips, sprinkles, chocolate syrup, caramel syrup and peanut butter.
For those who want to go even deeper into the delightful sugar coma offered at Wonderland, Smith also has cookie-dough themed desserts.
There's the cookie-dough sandwich, made from two fresh-baked cookies with a gooey layer of cookie dough loaded in the middle.
Wonderland's cookie-dough nachos feature two scoops of cookie dough heaped atop two shattered waffle cones, plus toppings. The cookie-dough sundae starts with cookie dough on the bottom and a big scoop of ice cream on top, plus toppings. The cookie-dough cupcakes place balls of cookie dough at the center of a hollowed-out cupcake.
And then there's deep-fried cookie dough that gets crisp and caramelized on the outside while the inside goes soft and melty.
It's a cookie-dough extravaganza.
But wait a minute. Anybody who's ever tried to eat raw cookie batter as a kid (guilty) remembers the stern warning that came with in: Raw eggs aren't safe.
How does Wonderland get around that? By not using eggs in its batter. There is no butter, either.
"You can eat this stuff raw. There's nothing in there that can get you sick," Smith said.
When it came to launching the cookie dough trailer, Smith said he got lucky.
"My daughter is a competitive cheerleader, and we were in Nashville a few months back for a competition and went to this no-bake cookie place. We loved it, and there was nothing like it in Fort Myers," he said.
"We would have loved to open a franchise. Two weeks later, our other daughter — also a competitive cheerleader — is in Daytona and we found Wonderland Cookie Dough in Celebration, Florida."
The owner of Wonderland happened to be in the shop that day — his whole crew had gone to prom the night before, and he was filling in — so Smith was able to sit down and talk to him about a licensing deal.
"The rest is history," he said.
Before it even launched, Wonderland Cookie Dough of SWFL already had 30 events booked.
"We were the first to jump on board with the cookie dough trend," Smith said, "and people are definitely loving it."

The media and Democrats are driving moderates into Trump's arms

Texto completo: Both the establishment media and most prominent Democratic politicians have gone so far off the deep end,against President Trump and in favor of ever-more leftist policies, that they are creating sympathy for the president they hate.
Even before the feeding frenzy in response to last weekend’s tragic shootings, I was reporting data on this phenomenon and also giving examples of the sorts of media behavior that causes it. But the data is also supported by anecdotal experience that really brings it home.
For instance, in just one particularly pointed example of many I could give, a decadeslong friend pulled me aside two weeks ago in a tone of lamentation. A moderate Republican who has repeatedly expressed emphatic distaste for Trump, this guy said (I’m quoting from memory, rather than exactly) this: “Quin, I can't believe I'm saying this, but I increasingly find myself sympathizing with Trump, just because the media and Democrats are so outrageously unfair to him and because the Dems have gone so hard left.”
It was the combination, he said, of the unhinged criticisms of Trump and of the presidential Democrats’ embrace of loony leftism, that left him and a number of like-minded friends thinking they might even need to vote for Trump next year, though they avoided doing so in 2016.
I am not willing to go that far. I wholeheartedly believe the president is a bigot and that his rhetoric has contributed to a toxic and dangerous atmosphere in what is supposed to be “civil society.” Yet as an original and continuing Never Trumper, I nonetheless feel obligated to write a third consecutive piece largely defending Trump from what amount to intellectually dishonest assaults.
Trump's contribution to toxicity is a far different thing from his somehow deserving the blame for a mass shooting. And proposing further moves to keep guns out of dangerous hands is the exact opposite of “being a prisoner to the gun lobby,” as Speaker Nancy Pelosi accused Trump of being.
Meanwhile, most of the media world and grassroots leftists just went into conniption fits over an absolutely accurate, neutral, objective headline in the New York Times, on the grounds that the headline fails to criticize Trump. The Times then actually bowed to pressure and changed its front-page news headline to subtly editorialize against the president. That shows how both professional standards and common sense have eroded.
As conservative columnist Deroy Murdock noted on Fox News on Tuesday (at the 3:34 mark, here), when Trump doesn’t rush to the site of a tragedy, or fails to quickly enough offer sympathetic comment thereon, the media mavens criticize him for failing as “consoler-in-chief.” Yet when Trump announces plans to go to El Paso to offer condolences for the victims, the same mob blasts him for daring to show his face and thus supposedly interfering with or tainting the community’s grief.
One can believe, as I do, that Americans today give the presidency a far too central role in everyday life and that the expectation he will be a national hand-holder and grief counselor is absurd and yet recognize that a president who fails to perform such a ceremonial duty will be lambasted unmercifully. How dare a local congresswoman say the president of the United States is “not welcome” in her city?
Put all this together with the widely believed notion that Trump is the only thing standing in the way of free healthcare for illegal immigrants and other absurdly leftist policies such as taxpayer-funded abortions right up through birth, even for men. Suddenly, even hardened Trump critics find themselves, by default, "on his side.”
If the media and the Democrats want to know who to blame for Trump’s position of power, they need only look in the mirror.

Texto completo: President Donald Trump began the week with an early morning lie via Twitter: "The Media has a big responsibility to life and safety in our Country. Fake News has contributed greatly to the anger and rage that has built up over many years. News coverage has got to start being fair, balanced and unbiased, or these terrible problems will only get worse!"
Mr. Trump sent that tweet at 7:32 a.m. Monday. He was addressing weekend massacres in El Paso and Dayton through the lens of media criticism, a go-to tactic for a president who, lacking any moral authority, believes his bully pulpit should be used for bullying.
Early in the day he was scheduled to make a speech to the nation about the carnage of the previous days, Mr. Trump was still not prepared to indict guns or utter the words "white supremacy" and "domestic terrorism" in the same breath.
Something happened to Mr. Trump between 7:32 a.m. and shortly after 10 a.m. on Monday when he addressed the nation with prepared remarks. Sounding less confident than usual, Mr. Trump delivered the speech with the ponderous, wheezy cadence he uses whenever he's forced to "act presidential" during a crisis. He sounded like a man with a gun to his head.
Because moral reflection isn't part of Mr. Trump's repertoire of talents, the cracks in his facade as a leader during a national crisis showed quickly. After all, he spent much of the previous two weeks stirring up racial resentment so that his perpetually angry base would be motivated to turn out for him next year. He lacks moral authority and knows it.
"We have asked the FBI to identify all further resources they need to investigate and disrupt hate crimes and domestic terrorism," Mr. Trump, who had proposed cutting resources in recent months for this mission, said with a straight face.
"Whatever they need. We must recognize that the internet has provided a dangerous avenue to radicalize disturbed minds and perform demented acts," he said. "We must shine light on the dark recesses of the internet and stop mass murders before they start."
Meanwhile, the alienated white men with guns he was denouncing as domestic terrorists are pragmatic enough to continue loving him. They know that he occasionally has to say mean things at their expense, but they know he would rather talk about Mexicans "invading the United States" than denounce white supremacy by equating it with domestic terrorism.
So even though he forcefully denounced both white supremacy and the internet during Monday's speech, we all know that the president himself is the King of Twitter Hate and one of the most noxious personalities on social media today. His presence in the Oval Office has helped the white supremacy movement grow because it perceives him as an ally.
Listening to Mr. Trump stumbling over the internal contradictions of the speech even as he read it was a stark reminder of how important it is for a leader to have some capacity for moral reflection. His inability to address his own contribution to the toxic mix of hate and violence on social media only shows his lack of self-awareness.
While calling for the death penalty for domestic terrorists, Mr. Trump refused to call for tougher background checks for gun buyers or a ban on military-style weapons. He blamed the finger pulling the trigger, not the gun. He blamed mental health as more of a factor for massacres than easy access to guns. Once again, guns were exonerated.
On Saturday morning, I wrote the following on Facebook as El Paso was happening. It represents the clearest distillation of my thoughts on the situation:
"The fact that most Americans can walk into any gun shop in the country and buy a weapon of mass destruction (as long as the buyer isn't flagged by a background check) tells you everything you need to know about the suicidal impulses of American capitalism, the obscene power of the gun lobby, the brokenness of our (unresponsive) political system and the insanity of a civilian population of potential victims that would tolerate such a state of affairs for one more day.
"Even though the NRA is close to insolvency, the gun industry as a whole continues to exert enormous power over the Republican caucus and a handful of conservative/moderate Democrats. Will the graphic awfulness of the Saturday morning massacre at an El Paso Walmart change any of this? Did an elementary school massacre by another lunatic with a gun weeks before Christmas change anything? No! Worship of the Second Amendment and belief in the right to take another person's life at the first sign of a threat trumps everything. Our national motto: Stand your ground, America, even if it means everyone else has to die."
Upon waking the next morning and finding out about Dayton, I wrote the following:
"And so every day we wake up to news of some fresh horror. Before we have processed the shock of the previous day's massacre, another man exercising his "right to bear arms" (and the implied right to deprive random people of their lives) makes his mark and extends the legacy of death guaranteed by the community of gun fetishists. It doesn't have to be this way. We don't have to let a vaguely worded amendment from the 18th century, when people were allowed to own other people, dictate the fearful quality of our lives. Every politician who would sanction a constitutional abstraction that results in so much routine death to ordinary citizens living their lives has to be repudiated at the polls and in public life. Gun manufacturers should be made to understand that their lack of morality comes at a massive financial cost and that the bill has finally come due."
When the president lacks moral authority, it's up to the rest of us to step into the breach.

Resumen: Lawmakers and the gun lobby all know the familiar pattern after shootings like El Paso and Dayton: Voters will move on so politicians do nothing.

Texto completo: Over a weekend that claimed the lives of at least 31 people in mass shootings in El Paso and Dayton, we hear the familiar refrain: “Why won’t Washington do something?” I spent 16 years in the House of Representatives trying to get something done on gun violence. Nothing happened. I became so frustrated that I wrote a political novel on the issue, "Big Guns," to try to answer the question truthfully.
Yesterday, President Trump provided yet another unsatisfactory answer. Reading from a teleprompter in the White House Diplomatic Reception Room, he condemned white supremacy but stopped short of supporting any meaningful gun safety initiatives.
In my 16 years in Congress, there were 52 mass shootings in America, according to an analysis by Mother Jones. This included Pulse nightclub in Orlando; Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston; the Century Aurora 16 movie theater in Aurora, Colorado; and Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut.
After each one, I confronted the question “Why won’t Washington do something?” in my suburban Long Island district. It came from both Democrats and Republicans, gun safety advocates and NRA members. They may have disagreed on exactly what should be done, but there were three solutions which attracted broad consensus: strengthening background checks, banning "cop-killing" bullets, and “no fly, no buy” — prohibiting people who are deemed too dangerous to fly in airplanes from acquiring guns.
Inaction is motivated by selfish fear
Despite very favorable polling on these common-sense and common-ground issues, nothing happened on Capitol Hill.
Why?
The tragic, maddening fact is that too many members of Congress fear the wrath of the gun lobby more than they fear a crazed gunman in a Walmart. They tweet condolences and lower flags and call for moments of silence. Then they wait for the anguish to die down so that you’ll forget their fecklessness and vote for them in the next election.
Bipartisan progress is possible: Republican strategist to his party: Consider some gun laws and condemn white nationalism
I remember trying to pass variations of these measures in the House Appropriations Committee. It was an annual ritual. My colleagues and I would offer amendments to strengthen background checks and we offered “no fly, no buy” amendments to appropriation bills. They failed. We offered amendments and attempted to repeal the so-called Dickey Amendment, which curtails the ability of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from compiling and analyzing the public health consequences of gun violence. We lost.
You may know all of this, but what you probably don’t know is what often happened after these votes. Many of my colleagues would admit that they personally agreed with these measures, they just couldn’t vote for them without risking political repercussions back home. The tally on their minds wasn’t just the more than 30,000 names of Americans who die by gun deaths annually, it was their gun lobby legislative scorecard, where anything less than 100% was considered “anti-gun. ”
Republicans feared a Republican primary, and nothing motivates primary voters more than a “weak” record on guns. In the case of Democrats who opposed these measures (only a handful), they worried that antagonizing pro-gun voters was the one fatal Republican political attack they couldn’t survive.
And so it continues.
The gun lobby will wait us out
As I wrote in The New York Times after the Oct. 1, 2017 shooting in Las Vegas that left 58 people murdered, it’s a numbing cycle with all the predictability of an old television rerun.
First, we are shocked by the shooting. The media shows the same images: survivors embracing, crime scene tape drooping, grainy photos of the perpetrator, the politicians ringing a podium. Next, the flags lower, there’s the obligatory tweeting of thoughts and prayers, the outraged calls for action, the rising sense that this time — this time— something will be done.
Trump gave him an outlet: El Paso shooting suspect happened to attend my high school. Don't blame mental health.
Finally, the news fades, the distractions take hold, you turn the page or click a different link or news channel. Congress is gripped by a budget deal or a fiscal cliff or a repugnant tweet or something else. Within a week, maybe longer, hardly anyone remembers Las Vegas or Aurora or Orlando or San Bernardino or Gilroy or Virginia Beach or Thousand Oaks or Pittsburgh or Santa Fe or Parkland or Sutherland Springs or Newtown, or the many, many others.
The only people who can’t escape the memory are the ones who buried a child or parent or teacher or student or co-worker or friend.
And finally, within days, months — or maybe even within 24 hours — it happens again. We hear eyewitnesses express shock that it happened to them; in their hometown. And hear, again, the anguished questions about why Washington won’t act on the things we mostly agree on.
Until the next shooting. The one after that. The one again, and again, and again.
It’s exactly what the gun industry and its lobby expect and count on. They will wait you out.
Think about that when you read past this article. Think about it next week when the words “Dayton” and “El Paso” are supplanted by cable news hosts frothing at another presidential tweet.
The problem isn’t really lawmakers with a narrow and self-serving view. It’s voters with short memories.

Why Hate Speech on the Internet Is a Never-Ending Problem

Texto completo: When the most consequential law governing speech on the internet was created in 1996, Google.com didn't exist and Mark Zuckerberg was 11 years old.
The federal law, Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, has helped Facebook, YouTube, Twitter and countless other internet companies flourish.
But Section 230's liability protection also extends to fringe sites known for hosting hate speech, anti-Semitic content and racist tropes like 8chan, the internet message board where the suspect in the El Paso shooting massacre posted his manifesto.
The First Amendment protects free speech, including hate speech, but Section 230 shields websites from liability for content created by their users. It permits internet companies to moderate their sites without being on the hook legally for everything they host. It does not provide blanket protection from legal responsibility for some criminal acts, like posting child pornography or violations of intellectual property.
Now, as scrutiny of big technology companies has intensified in Washington over a wide variety of issues, including how they handle the spread of disinformation or police hate speech, lawmakers are questioning whether Section 230 should be changed.
Last month, Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, said in a hearing about Google and censorship that the law was "a subsidy, a perk" for big tech that may need to be reconsidered. In an April interview, Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California called Section 230 a "gift" to tech companies "that could be removed."
"There is definitely more attention being paid to Section 230 than at any time in its history," said Jeff Kosseff, a cybersecurity law professor at the United States Naval Academy and the author of a book about the law, "The Twenty-Six Words That Created the Internet."
"There is an inclination to look at Section 230 as one lever to influence the tech companies," he said.
Here is an explanation of the law's history, why it has been so consequential and whether it is really in jeopardy.
So why was the law created?
We can thank "The Wolf of Wall Street."
Stratton Oakmont, a brokerage firm, sued Prodigy Services, an internet service provider, for defamation in the 1990s. Stratton was founded by Jordan Belfort, who was convicted of securities fraud and was portrayed by Leonardo DiCaprio in the Martin Scorsese film about financial excess. An anonymous user wrote on Prodigy's online message board that the brokerage had engaged in criminal and fraudulent acts.
The New York Supreme Court ruled that Prodigy was "a publisher" and therefore liable because it had exercised editorial control by moderating some posts and establishing guidelines for impermissible content. If Prodigy had not done any moderation, it might have been granted free speech protections afforded to some distributors of content, like bookstores and newsstands.
The ruling caught the attention of a pair of congressmen, Ron Wyden, a Democrat from Oregon, and Christopher Cox, a Republican from California. They were worried the decision would act as a disincentive for websites to take steps to block pornography and other obscene content.
The Section 230 amendment was folded into the Communications Decency Act, an attempt to regulate indecent material on the internet, without much opposition or debate. A year after it was passed, the Supreme Court declared that the indecency provisions were a violation of First Amendment rights. But it left Section 230 in place.
Since it became law, the courts have repeatedly sided with internet companies, invoking a broad interpretation of immunity.
On Wednesday, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed a lower court's ruling that Facebook was not liable for violent attacks coordinated and encouraged by Facebook accounts linked to Hamas, the militant Islamist group. In the majority opinion, the court said Section 230 "should be construed broadly in favor of immunity."
Why is the law so consequential?
Section 230 has allowed the modern internet to flourish. Sites can moderate content -- set their own rules for what is and what is not allowed -- without being liable for everything posted by visitors.
Whenever there is discussion of repealing or modifying the statute, its defenders, including many technology companies, argue that any alteration could cripple online discussion.
The internet industry has a financial incentive to keep Section 230 intact. The law has helped build companies worth hundreds of billions of dollars with a lucrative business model of placing ads next to largely free content from visitors.
That applies to more than social networks like Facebook, Twitter and Snapchat. Wikipedia and Reddit depend on its visitors to sustain the sites, while Yelp and Amazon count on reviews for businesses and products.
More recently, Section 230 has also provided legal cover for the complicated decisions regarding content moderation. Facebook and Twitter have recently cited it to defend themselves in court when users have sued after being barred from the platforms.
Many cases are quickly dismissed because companies assert they have the right to make decisions on content moderation as they see fit under the law.
What are the problems with the law?
The criticisms of Section 230 vary. While both Republicans and Democrats are threatening to make changes, they disagree on why.
Some Republicans have argued that tech companies should no longer enjoy the protections because they have censored conservatives and thereby violated the spirit of the law, which states that the internet should be "a forum for a true diversity of political discourse."
Facebook, Twitter and Google, which runs YouTube, which are the main targets for bias claims, have said they are baseless.
On the flip side, some Democrats have argued that small and large internet sites aren't serious about taking down problematic content or tackling harassment because they are shielded by Section 230.
Mr. Wyden, now a senator, said the law had been written to provide "a sword and a shield" for internet companies. The shield is the liability protection for user content, but the sword was meant to allow companies to keep out "offensive materials."
However, he said firms had not done enough to keep "slime" off their sites. In an interview with The New York Times, Mr. Wyden said he had recently told tech workers at a conference on content moderation that if "you don't use the sword, there are going to be people coming for your shield."
There is also a concern that the law's immunity is too sweeping. Websites trading in revenge pornography, hate speech or personal information to harass people online receive the same immunity as sites like Wikipedia.
"It gives immunity to people who do not earn it and are not worthy of it," said Danielle Keats Citron, a law professor at Boston University who has written extensively about the statute.
Is Section 230 in jeopardy?
The first blow came last year with the signing of a law that creates an exception in Section 230 for websites that knowingly assist, facilitate or support sex trafficking. Critics of the new law said it opened the door to create other exceptions and would ultimately render Section 230 meaningless.
Ms. Citron, who is also vice president of the Cyber Civil Rights Initiative, a nonprofit devoted to combating online abuse, said this was "a moment of re-examination." After years of pressing for changes, she said there was more political will to modify Section 230.
Senator Josh Hawley, a Republican from Missouri and a frequent critic of technology companies, introduced a bill in June that would eliminate the immunity under the law unless tech companies submitted to an external audit that their content moderation practices were politically neutral.
While there is growing political will to do something about Section 230, finding a middle ground on potential changes is a challenge.
"When I got here just a few months ago, everybody said 230 was totally off the table, but now there are folks coming forward saying this isn't working the way it was supposed to work," said Mr. Hawley, who took office in January. "The world in 2019 is very different from the world of the 1990s, especially in this space, and we need to keep pace."

Every so often a candidate runs for president and ends up on the debate stage who so alters the thinking about not only the issues but also what it means to be a political thinker. This year that person is the entrepreneur Andrew Yang.
I first met Mr. Yang a couple months ago on the set of "Real Time with Bill Maher." We guests stood in a gaggle just before showtime and made nervous conversation. He struck me as completely relaxed, comfortable and sure of himself, not full of himself or trying desperately to impress.
I have been in journalism all my adult life, 26 years, and from the experience of meeting countless politicians I can tell you that this is rare. There is something overbearing about them. Greasy is the way I describe them: too slick and too slippery. They are also too forward - too in your face and in your space. What they consider connecting with people I consider glowering over people. What they consider their winning smile looks to me like a scary clown.
So yes, just the way he carried himself signaled that there was something different about this man. And during his opening interview on the show, while I was watching from the wings, I remember thinking to myself: This guy is impressive.
That was the same feeling I got during Wednesday night's debate.
Mr. Yang seems to always approach his questions and answers from a different perspective, from a higher intellectual and logical plane. His answers were short, pithy and clear as a bell. He is a futurist among conventionalists and Bolsheviks.
Mr. Yang is talking about a rise of the machines and valuations of uncompensated labor in a way that doesn't sound fanciful and outlandish but prudent and necessary. (I do think some of it is fanciful, by the way.)
I believe that this is his gift: His ability to explain things, to educate without sounding elitist, to tell you something you don't know without making you feel guilty for not knowing it.
Sure, I'm not certain America is ready for this $1,000-a-month scheme and his attempts to flip the Asian-guy-who-likes-math racial trope into a positive that works for him makes me uneasy every time I hear it.
But, when I see this guy - honest and unassuming - surrounded on a debate stage by these tacticians and poll watchers, the ones who shade the truth and blow with the wind, the ones consumed by ambition who think too much of themselves, he just stands out.
The fact that he doesn't wear a tie is just a visual reminder that he is a nonconformist - in the best way - to our political pageantry.
As Mr. Yang said in one of his last exchanges of the night:
You know what the talking heads couldn't stop talking about after the last debate? It's not the fact that I'm somehow number four on the stage in national polling. It was the fact that I wasn't wearing a tie. Instead of talking about automation and our future, including the fact that we automated away 4 million manufacturing jobs, hundreds of thousands right here in Michigan, we're up here with makeup on our faces and our rehearsed attack lines, playing roles in this reality TV show. It's one reason why we elected a reality TV star as our president.
And that is the thing: Campaigns in general and debates in particular are reality TV. He is right. It's all a show. Candidates release a raft of detailed policy plans, but few voters actually read them. We overwhelmingly select our candidate because of the way they make us feel.
I don't think Mr. Yang has a shot at the nomination - I hate to have to say that because I don't want to dampen his prospects, but I genuinely believe it - but I certainly hope that he finds a way to stay in the race for a while.
This debate about the direction of the Democratic Party - what it believes and is willing to fight for - would benefit from the continued infusion of his fresh perspectives. And if he doesn't become the nominee, I certainly hope that he is included in any winning Democrat's cabinet.
Mr. Yang knows how to explain. In 2012, President Barack Obama dubbed former President Bill Clinton the "Secretary of Explaining Stuff." I think the next Democratic president should make that a real job and give it to Andrew Yang. America needs this guy.

Texto completo: After completing 12 books for "The Land of Stories" fantasy series, Chris Colfer is back with a brand new adventure – and this one, he reveals, was the "toughest book" he's ever had to write.
The author, known for his role as Kurt Hummel in the Fox musical show "Glee," has captured a huge fan following from his best-selling middle-grade series. "A Tale of Magic" will be a sequel to that series.
"A Tale of Magic" (Little, Brown and Co.), out Oct. 1, is special for a variety of reasons.
The tale follows 14-year-old Brystal Evergreen, as she tries to survive the oppressive Southern Kingdom where it is illegal for women to read books. While working as a maid at her local library and having to sneak out titles, she discovers a secret section with a book about magic, which is also outlawed throughout the world, leading her down a complicated path.
The book, which tackles powerful issues, was more difficult to write than Colfer imagined.
"At its core, 'Tale of Magic' is a story about overcoming prejudice and oppression and more than anything I hope it inspires and encourages anyone out there who is fighting their own battles of injustice or inequality," he told USA TODAY.
"When I first started, I was not expecting it to be as difficult as it was, but the world changed so significantly since I agreed to do it, to when I started writing it... I knew I had to tell a story that I thought would help kids and families out there who are having a difficult time with the times we live in," he continued.
Colfer is embarking on a tour for the book, he shared exclusively with USA TODAY. But unlike Colfer's previous book tours for "Stories," which transformed into auditorium-sized events with costume contests, readings and games, the format for his new tale will be much more traditional, beginning with the tour's first stop in New York City on the day of the book's release.
"Since this is a brand-new series I'm going to be doing a traditional book signing this time around," Colfer revealed .
"As soon as the readers are familiar with the new story, the new characters, we'll go back to the town hall-style because it was a big hit with the kids – and their parents because they didn't have to wait in a line with their kids," he laughed.
What the New York Times bestselling author is most looking forward to, however, is the fan reaction to the meaningful story line behind the book.
"One of the biggest motivations for this book was actually for parents and teachers, and for all the parents and teachers out there who are having a difficult time talking to their children about the troubling things they see on the news every day," he said. "I really hope that 'A Tale of Magic' acts as a point of reference to make those conversations a lot easier."
Colfer explained that writing has always been a therapeutic activity for him, and helped him get through some of his own toughest times.

Whitmer: Immigrants need a path to a license

Texto completo: LANSING — Gov. Gretchen Whitmer appeared to support a change in state law to issue driver's licenses to undocumented immigrants, when she gave an impromptu interview to an immigrants rights organization during the Democratic presidential debates in Detroit.
"We need to ensure that everyone's got a path to getting a license, so they've got identification," Whitmer, a Democrat, said in a video released by the group Movimiento Cosecha after an organizer for the group asked her if she favored issuing driver's licenses to undocumented immigrants.
"That's something that's important to me, it's important to our economy, and it's important to the people of Michigan."
Michigan passed legislation to ban the practice in 2008 after Attorney General Mike Cox, a Republican, issued a formal opinion in 2007 saying undocumented immigrants could not obtain driver's licenses. Cox's opinion reversed a 1995 opinion from former Attorney General Frank Kelley, a Democrat.
Tiffany Brown, a spokeswoman for Whitmer, would not answer directly Friday morning when asked whether Whitmer favors changing state law to allow undocumented immigrants to hold Michigan driver's licenses. But she did not deny the accuracy of the video and transcript released by Movimiento Cosecha.
"Not sure I'll have much more to add outside of what the governor said in the video about ensuring that undocumented immigrants have a path to getting an ID," Brown said in an email.
She did not specify what that path would look like or whether she was talking about a state identification other than a driver's license. In the video, Whitmer specifically referenced driver's licenses for undocumented immigrants.
A dozen states, including Illinois and California, plus the District of Columbia issue driver's licenses to undocumented immigrants.
Proponents say allowing undocumented immigrants to hold driver's licenses would help Michigan's economy by making it easier for them work and pay taxes. They say it also would enable them to avoid being detained and deported in many cases, since a major reason for being detained is failing to produce a valid driver's license.
Opponents say the practice raises national security concerns and rewards those who do not observe all immigration requirements at the expense of those who do.
Republicans generally oppose licenses for undocumented immigrants, while Democrats are split on the issue.
In a statement on Twitter Friday, Michigan Senate Republicans said the entire chamber, including then Sen. Whitmer, voted unanimously in 2008 to withhold driver's licenses from "anyone in our state illegally."
"Gov. Whitmer should listen to Sen. Whitmer," the statement said.
Whitmer stepped into the contentious debate at the same time she has counseled Democratic presidential candidates to avoid veering too far to the left and to focus on "dinner table" issues such as wages and education. For example, in an interview with the New York Times, she was critical of instances in the first Democratic debate in Miami when candidates raised their hands to questions such as whether free health care should be provided to undocumented immigrants.
Brown, the governor's spokeswoman, said there is no inconsistency.
"This was simply the governor responding to a question from a constituent," she said.
Whitmer said in the interview with Movimiento Cosecha that Michigan fortunately has a secretary of state and an attorney general who "feel the same way" about the issue that she does.
Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson "has met with community leaders and legislators and stands with the governor in support of changing the law so that all individuals working and residing in our state may obtain a state ID or a driver's license for use in Michigan," said spokesman Michael Doyle.
Attorney General Dana Nessel, a Democrat, supports issuing driver's licenses to undocumented immigrants, spokeswoman Kelly Rossman-McKinney said Friday.
Members of Movimiento Cosecha were arrested this week when they blocked the entrance to the Detroit-Windsor tunnel in an effort to raise awareness of immigration issues during the Democratic debates.
Dominique Leon Becerra, the group organizer who spoke to and recorded Whitmer, said they plan to make sure the governor follows through.
"No empty promises," she said in a news release. "We need to see real results and a plan to make driver's licenses accessible to our community now!"
The Michigan Catholic Conference has long supported issuing driver's licenses to undocumented immigrants "as a matter of human dignity and the reality that transportation is necessary to get people to the places they need to be," said spokesman David Maluchnik.

Two trans women win privacy arguments

Texto completo: Two transgender women told judges they could be harmed or possibly killed if their name and gender changes were made public.
One of the women said that if her intentions were widely known, it would put a "huge target" on her back. The other said she'd been refused service in her town, and she'd seen a resident post on Facebook that he would shoot a transgender person.
"It's dangerous," said one of the women told IndyStar. "You never know how someone is going to react. There is a fear that the likelihood of a problem occurring kind of goes up."
The women explained that they have legitimate reasons to be afraid and that they deserve privacy.
The judges, however, didn't agree.
The courts in Hamilton County and Orange County, respectively, found the evidence presented by the women lacking. The judges' denials would have made the name change proceedings public.
But a recent decision from the Indiana Court of Appeals stopped that from happening.
The appeals court reversed the denials in June and allows the women to keep their proceedings private. Bloomington attorney Megan Stuart said the court gave clear guidance that should remove uncertainty about how the trial courts should handled these types of cases. Stuart, who's with Indiana Legal Services, represents the women.
"We are hopeful that these decision(s) will make it easier for transgender Hoosiers throughout the state to access the courts without having to jeopardize their safety," she told IndyStar.
Why the women want privacy Court documents identify the women as M.B. and K.H., respectively. IndyStar will be using those names in the story.
Last September, M.B. filed a petition in Orange County to change her name and gender marker and filed a written request to prohibit public access under Administrative Rule 9. She also asked the trial court to waive the publication requirement — which requires the publication of the petition in a local newspaper — and seal the record.
Administrative Rule 9 governs public access to court records. The state law dictates that in "extraordinary circumstances," a court record that would otherwise be publicly accessible may be excluded from the public if certain requirements are met. Among those requirements is that a public hearing be held on the request.
During M.B's hearing in November, she testified that she believed it would be dangerous if people found out what she was doing. "There's lots of people, both within the (U.S.) and within Indiana that would like to harm transgender people and there are some in Orange County," she said, per the COA opinion.
"Unfortunately, where I had been living, it wouldn't have been safe," M.B. told IndyStar. "I know I would have lost my housing and would have lost my job. It was a real (concern) for me."
In K.H's case, a hearing was set in Hamilton County after she made her request in August. But before the hearing could happen, the trial court required her to publish a notice of her desire for a name change and give notice of the hearing to the Indiana Attorney General, according to the COA opinion.
K.H. was required to state on the notice that she wanted to change her name from a "name commonly used by males to a name more commonly used by females" and to include the case number and date and time of the hearing so that "objectors" could be present, the opinion said.
Although she wouldn't have had to include her full name, the move would still expose her to potential harm, she later told the court.
"All I am trying to do is overcome obstacles and the challenges of being accepted as my real self," she said, per the COA opinion. "Please let me live my life like everyone else without having to risk death."
Why the courts weren't convinced A judge denied M.B.'s request in December. Among other things, the court found that M.B. failed to provide evidence of any violence that she's faced because of her transgender identity. It also countered M.B.'s claim that public proceedings would effectively be "outing" her by remarking on her appearance.
"(M.B.'s) actions, dress, and demeanor profess to all that (she) is transgender. It is readily apparent and obvious to the public," per the opinion.
M.B. wasn't surprised. "It wouldn't have made a difference what I would have said," she told IndyStar. "It would have been denied because of ignorance."
On the other hand, K.H. told IndyStar she was "blindsided" by how difficult it was for her to keep everything private. K.H.'s motions were denied in November because she didn't publish the notice and notify the Attorney General.
Opening up about her fears wasn't easy. "I felt very vulnerable. It took a lot out of me," she said.
Amid the proceedings, both women pointed to violence against transgender individuals. K.H said she's aware of the "high rate of violence, discrimination, and invasion of privacy against transgender people." M.B. cited a New York Times analysis of federal data showing that transgender individuals are disproportionately impacted by violence and homicide, per the COA opinion.
Kit Malone, of the American Civil Liberties Union of Indiana, told IndyStar she spends a lot of time convincing people that transgender people are confronted with danger.
"This idea that the violence we face isn't real — it's ridiculous on its face," Malone said. "I think if you asked the average person what it would be like to spend a night wandering around Downtown in clothes that don't match the expectations of their assigned gender, you would suddenly have a lot of people who understand exactly how dangerous that choice is."
Malone said that the requirement to make name-change proceedings public is often called the "target on your back" law in the LGBTQ community.
"Because in our community, we face a lot of discrimination. So that's something that really scares us. We also worry that co-workers (who) are not supportive are us might find that information if it's in a public forum. So we face really dire consequences."
COA: Court exceeded its authority In its June opinion, the Court of Appeals said the fact that M.B. didn't provide evidence that she had been a target of violence is irrelevant.
"The goal of Rule 9 is proactive; it seeks to prevent harm. To force petitioners to wait until they have already experienced that harm would vitiate the purpose of the rule," the COA said.
In K.H.'s case, it noted that under the law, a person doesn't need to notify the public or anyone else if the person clearly shows in an affidavit that immediate and irreparable injury, loss or damage will be a result of going public.
"In this case, K.H. met those requirements," the opinion said.
In a footnote, the COA deemed "astonishing" the requirement that K.H. publicly say she wants to change her name from a commonly used male name to a more commonly used female name.
"There is no statute or rule requiring that an individual seeking a gender marker change publish notice of that intent. It is apparent that the trial court intended to force K.H. to signal implicitly to the world that she seeks to change her gender. In so doing, it exceeded its authority," the opinion said.
'A normal life' Stuart, who's worked on several other cases that have ended in denials, said the Court of Appeal's decisions "made clear that the disproportionate rates of violence and discrimination faced by transgender people is sufficient to meet the legal standard of Administrative Rule 9 and warrants sealing of the record."
Malone suggested that the law itself might be a bit antiquated.
"It's not 1872 anymore. People don't need public documents to prove what their name is without this embarrassing outing that is dangerous. And it's something we shouldn't allow for trans people," she said.
M.B. and K.H. had already started transitioning when they began pursuing a name and gender change. They told IndyStar that for them, the change meant moving forward with their gender identity.
"Job opportunities have gone and left just because I didn't have the correct credentials," K.H. said. "(The name and gender change) would make me live a normal live. Help me achieve what everyone else has. Instead of everyone else questioning, 'Is this really you?'"

Robert Mueller, Metaphysical Detective?

Texto completo: When the Mueller report was released, commentators reviewed it not only as a political and legal work but also as another genre: literature. In The Washington Post, Carlos Lozada described the report as "the best book by far on the workings of the Trump presidency." Michiko Kakutani wrote in The Columbia Journalism Review that it held "the visceral drama of a detective novel, spy thriller, or legal procedural." Laura Miller of Slate found it to be a work of "palace intrigues."
Robert Mueller's testimony on Capitol Hill was subjected to theater reviews, too: Political reporters speculated on the "optics" of his appearance, while President Trump declared, "This was one of the worst performances in the history of our country."
The theatrical focus is a little much. But the literary critics are onto something. The report tells what is probably one of the biggest stories of our lifetimes -- and understanding that narrative as a narrative can help make sense of the confused political moment.
Exploring the assassination of John F. Kennedy, the writer Don DeLillo described in his novel "Libra" the endless work of sleuthing new information on the president's death as an effort to draft the "book of America" -- the novel "in which nothing is left out." The same might be said of the Mueller report.
The first half of the report -- on efforts by the Russian government to interfere in the 2016 election -- is a spy thriller, a high-stakes caper with greed, dirty deals and intrigue straight out of a Cold War potboiler. The second half -- on President Trump's efforts to obstruct Mr. Mueller's investigation -- is a Shakespearean drama about deception and power. But at its core, the 448-page volume is a detective story.
Like most good detective stories, the report actually tells two stories at once. First, there is the tale of what happened: The Russian government worked to reach out to Mr. Trump's circle and, once he began running for president, his campaign; then, when the F.B.I. and later Mr. Mueller began investigating, Mr. Trump repeatedly sought to undercut the probe.
But nestled in the citations and prosecution or declination decisions for each section, there is the second story, which is closer to what most people think of when they think of a detective novel -- the drama of how Mr. Mueller and his team came to uncover that first narrative and what they made of it. Examining footnotes, the reader can trace which information came from which witness -- and discover, for example, that Don McGahn, then the White House counsel, provided Mr. Mueller's office with hours of interviews about the conduct of the president.
Detective stories are usually about order and the collapse of order: The world is shattered by an act of violence, and the detective sets about making things right by turning the crime into something that can be explained. As Ms. Kakutani writes, "At the end of detective stories, order is usually restored with the solving of a crime, and with the identification and prosecution of the perpetrators."
The Mueller report does provide a framework for understanding just what has happened to America in 2016 and the years since.
More than a tale about the restoration of order, though, the Mueller investigation is also about the limits of what can be known. Consider, for example, what the report says about Paul Manafort, Mr. Trump's erstwhile campaign chairman. Mr. Manafort, writes Mr. Mueller, shared polling data produced by the campaign with a man known very likely to be connected to Russian military intelligence. The subplot is full of possibility, but it ends up leading nowhere. Mr. Mueller writes that his office "could not reliably determine Manafort's purpose" in sharing the information, in part because Mr. Manafort and his colleagues used encrypted messaging to communicate with one another.
Or there's the question of what Mr. Trump knew or didn't know about his campaign's communications with individuals linked to the Russian government, and whether he was truthful in his written answers.
In this, the Mueller report fits neatly into a subgenre known as the "metaphysical detective story" -- stories that take Sherlock Holmes's triumphant cracking of the case and turn it upside down, so the detective's efforts end in the same disorder with which they began. These are mysteries about the impossibility of ever really solving a mystery, or perhaps of knowing anything at all.
The uncertainties that hover around the Mueller report evoke similar themes. How much can be known about what Donald Trump had in mind when he fired James Comey? Was Mr. Trump intent on stopping the Russia investigation, or was his goal to remove an F.B.I. director who irritated him for other reasons? Will the question of what Paul Manafort was up to remain forever unanswered, the information crucial to solving the puzzle lost? And if the full story of the Russia affair remains beyond the reach of explanation, to what extent does this cast doubt on the whole project of restoring order in the first place?
As in the metaphysical detective story, these factual gaps raise broader questions about the detective's inability to reconstruct the story of the crime. Put crudely, this is the question of what it means that Robert Mueller can't save the country. It's how to understand the effect on the stability of American democracy of both the president's relative impunity at the end of an investigation that strongly implied he may have committed serious crimes and the nation's inability to come to grips with the fact of interference by a foreign power in an election.
Or to put it another way: Does anything matter?
Mr. Mueller clearly thinks it does. Testifying before the House Intelligence Committee, he became most animated when he spoke about election interference: "I hope this is not the new normal," he said, "but I fear it is."
In this way, the Mueller report may turn out to be more of a film noir than anything else. The detective successfully uncovers the plot, only to discover that the society around him is too rotten to do anything about it. For all the missing pieces in this story, the issue is less whether it can be told and more whether anyone cares to listen.

Texto completo: The D.C. Memo is a weekly recap of Washington political news, journalism, and opinion, delivered with an eye toward what matters for Minnesota. Sign up to get it in your inbox every Thursday.
Welcome to this week’s edition of the D.C. Memo. This week in Washington, Minneapolis teleported to the East Coast, House Republicans turn in their congressional pagers, and Amy Klobuchar pitched policy in 15 seconds.
C’mon (Redux)
On Twitter, there was a bad tweet. Which often happens. But this one had to do with Minnesota:
“Saying @RashidaTlaib (D-Detroit) and @IlhanMN (D-Minneapolis) are from the Midwest is like saying Lloyd Doggett (D-Austin) is from Texas or @repjohnlewis (D-Atlanta) is from the Deep South. C’mon,” said Jonathan Weisman, the Deputy Washington Editor at the New York Times.
Other journalists were quick to point out that this sort of language excludes people of color from the conversation about the Midwest and the South. Weisman apologized for the Tweet and deleted it, but did not seem to back down from the point he was making.
The statement, whatever its intention, gets at a highly problematic presumption ascribed to a lot of journalism: “real America” is rural. Everything else… isn’t. It’s tropey and overly simplistic language that doesn’t do a service to readers.
Or as the Star Tribune’s Jennifer Brooks put it: “Your race, your creed, your orientation, your politics, and your Norwegian grandma don’t make you a Minnesotan. … Living in Minnesota makes you a Minnesotan.”
Retirement
Republicans in the House are retiring left and right. Rep. Will Hurd of Texas became the ninth Republican this year to announce retirement plans, with six announcements happening just as members were heading into a long recess away from Washington.
While several reporters have argued that these retirements signal a problem for Minnesota Sixth District’s Rep. Tom Emmer , who chairs the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) , there are potential benefits. Longtime Republicans who don’t feel like bouncing around their state, and the country, to do extensive fundraising, social media pushes, and television appearances, could be replaced with candidates up to the task. And that may inject a fresh energy into some of the toss-up House races.
When Rep. Pete Olson of Texas announced his retirement last week, Emmer had this to say in a statement:
Whoever the socialist Democrats nominate will be forced to defend their party’s radical agenda of socialized medicine and killing oil and gas jobs with the Green New Deal in a solid Republican district. This will remain a Republican district for the foreseeable future.
That said, the NRCC’s counterpart, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, has signaled that they intend to spend heavily in places like Texas. And the non-partisan Cook Political Report currently places the race as a toss up.
The president next door
Wednesday’s debate gave Sen. Amy Klobuchar a chance to try and break out of her low numbers in the polls and make her pitch for the presidency. Unfortunately, a lot of Klobuchar’s points (everyone’s points, for that matter) were interrupted by the moderators.
“Thank you, Senator Klobuchar,” CNN’s Jake Tapper said in one instance, interspersed with Klobuchar trying to get another word in. “Thank you, Senator Klobuchar,” he said again. “Thank you, Senator.”
I had the chance to talk to a few folks hosting watch parties for their preferred candidate, or just for civic involvement. Popcorn. Drinks. What else? Read more at MinnPost.
Outside of the debates, do you want to know who — besides Amy Klobuchar — Minnesotans are supporting in the Democratic primary? Greta Kaul has the info for you. Read more MinnPost.
In other news
* House Speaker Nancy Pelosi led a delegation to Ghana to observe the 400th anniversary of the first enslaved Africans shipped to the Americas. Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minneapolis was in attendance.
* Parents in the Chicago area are transferring guardianship of their children in order for them to get financial aid. While the education department is looking into the practice, it seems to be legal.

Quote of the week

“Did I miss something? Minneapolis and Detroit are both in the Midwest,” said the Star Tribune’s Matt DeLong.
What I’m reading
Michael Calderone for Politico: Black journalists push media to cover ‘hyper-racial’ moment in politics
“Race and politics,” said AP reporter Errin Haines Whack, “is really the story of our time.” What it means for outlets to cover race honestly in 2020 and avoid repeat mistakes of 2016.
Chloé Cooper Jones in the Verge: Fearing for His Life
Eric Garner was killed by police in 2014. His words (“I can’t breathe”) became a rallying cry against police brutality around the world. Garner’s death, which was filmed on camera, was referenced at the Democratic debate on Wednesday. Audience members heckled New York Bill de Blasio to fire Daniel Pantaleo, the office that placed Garner in chokehold and killed him.
This feature is a deep dive on Ramsey Orta, who filmed his friend’s killing, and by several accounts, was punished for it.
Alex Samuels in the Texas Tribune: Julián Castro’s unconventional campaign manager wants “to run a campaign that will make him proud”
Maya Rupert is the third Black woman to run a presidential campaign. The campaign manager for Julián Castro, Rupert explains why she wanted to run the campaign: “I’m so proud every time I get to talk to young black women and I get to tell tell them what I’m doing. I love that moment. But I also want this to be a campaign the Latino community feels a lot of pride around.
“I want to make sure there’s a group of people,” she said, “who are looking at this and thinking — finally — ‘I got next.’”

Al Gore, Gov. Tim Walz call green economy ‘job creator of the future’ at Minneapolis climate conference

Texto completo: Al Gore opened a three-day training on environmental advocacy Friday by introducing Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as a key example of an elected official who has stepped in “when the federal government fails to lead” on climate action.
“He’s a smart guy, he’s a savvy guy,” said the former vice president, taking the stage at the Climate Reality Leadership Corps training at the Minneapolis Convention Center. “What’s happening here in Minnesota represents some of the best of what’s happening all across the country. … If Washington is not going to lead, Minnesota will.”
Walz, a former member of Congress from a rural district that runs along Minnesota’s southern border with Iowa, told the audience of some 1,200 environmental advocates that he won election in a conservative district over a decade ago in part by focusing on the economic benefits of “green” jobs.
The Democratic-Farmer-Labor governor warned against merely spouting data about global warming, or questioning the commitment of farmers to nature.
“It is not good enough just to be right,” said Walz. “It is not good enough to have the facts on your side. … (A green economy) is the job creator of the future.”
The governor also noted that farmers have embraced voluntary reductions in nitrogen and phosphorous runoff into the Mississippi River when they make economic sense. That takes careful education, he said, on crop rotation and other cost-effective approaches to reduce pesticides and fertilizers.
“Don’t dismiss their commitment to the land,” Walz said. “What happens here impacts the Gulf of Mexico. … The amount of cities that depend on that river has increased exponentially.”
PROTESTERS WANT MORE ACTION ON LINE 3
The governor’s speech was repeatedly interrupted by chanting from a group of teens from Minnesota Climate Strike, an environmental coalition that has called for stronger action to block construction of the proposed Enbridge Line 3 crude oil pipeline in northern Minnesota.

While not stopping the project outright, the governor has continued legal actions filed by his predecessor, Gov. Mark Dayton, calling for more environmental review of the Minnesota portion of the 1,000-mile pipeline from Edmonton, Canada.
The teens also chanted “Incinerators aren’t renewable!” a reference to ongoing debate over whether burning garbage to generate power should be legally classified as a source of renewable energy, given the potential impacts to human health and air quality.
Walz said even a head of state has to work in concert with lawmakers — and Minnesota is the only state in the nation where control of the legislature is divided.
“We want to move to a totally carbon-free Minnesota,” said Walz, noting that the Republican-controlled state Senate has refused to hear a DFL-led climate bill modeled after aggressive plans in California and Hawaii. “We don’t have the Senate.”
The three-day Climate Reality Project training will feature some 30 speakers, including New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman, geophysicist Henry Pollack, youth activist Lia Harrel and Paul Huttner, chief meteorologist with Minnesota Public Radio.
St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Fry are scheduled to deliver remarks Sunday morning.
Gore, who won the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize for “An Inconvenient Truth” and other writings on climate issues, was scheduled to meet with reporters late Friday afternoon for a roundtable discussion.
Gore’s against Enbridge Line 3 because oil companies are trying to lower production costs out of fear of alternative energy getting cheaper+commonplace to produce.

Rockland twins' death makes activist 'mad as hell' over safety issues

Texto completo: Kristie Reeves-Cavaliero lives in Austin, Texas. But for the past week, she couldn't stop thinking about a family across the country in Rockland County that she never met — Juan and Marissa Rodriguez and their children.
Nearly 1-year-old twins Luna and Phoenix Rodriguez died last Friday after they were left in their father's hot car for eight hours while he was at work at the James J. Peters VA Medical Center in the Bronx. Juan Rodriguez, a 39-year-old Iraq War vet, told police he "blanked out" and thought he had dropped them at day care.
"We are having a lot of PTSD triggers from this case," said Reeves-Cavaliero.
The Texas pharmacist is a mother of twins now. But the case has haunted her and her husband, Brett Cavaliero, for a deeper reason.
Their daughter, Sophia Rayne Cavaliero, or Ray Ray, died in 2011 at age 1 after being left in a hot car. Brett Cavaliero thought he dropped her off at day care on his way to work. But he hadn't. She was found in the back of his truck three hours later. But it was too late.
Reeves-Cavaliero can't believe such senseless and awful loss is still happening.
"Our child died eight years ago, when she died she was about about the 498th case since 1998," said Reeves-Cavaliero, who has become an advocate for any and all methods that could prevent more heat stroke deaths of babies left in cars. "Since her death we're up to almost 800 kids — there have been more than 300 kids who have died since my child died.
"As a parent who's worked tirelessly with the child safety advocates and the politicians, it just makes me mad as hell," Reeves-Cavaliero said.
Preventing hot-car deaths The Cavalieros established Ray Ray's Pledge, which encourages day care providers to call a parent if a child has not been dropped off. Forgotten day care dropoff is the No. 1 source of child hot car deaths.
Social media comments have questioned if the twins' day care, located in Yonkers, had called about the their absence. Family and friends have said they didn't, and have not named the provider.
Reeves-Calaviero said that in most states, there is no mandate for child care providers to call about absences, which is done in K-12 schools.
No such mandate could be found in New York State Office of Children and Family Services regulations.
Child Care Resources of Rockland, which provides support and training for childcare providers and referrals for families, strongly recommends providers have a policy addressing absences, CCRR Executive Director Vicki Caramante said. "Reach out to a family if a child is absent without the program being notified," Caramante said. "Our staff is available to help programs write these policies and procedures."
Other measures can be taken to keep kids safe.
On the federal level, the HOT CARS Act — for Helping Overcome Trauma for Children Alone in Rear Seats — would mandate that new vehicles come with alert systems to remind drivers if a child is left in the backseat.
A state bill mandating backseat detection devices for vehicles sold in New York will be introduced this week by Sen. David Carlucci, D-New City. "The technology is available. Automotive manufacturers are already putting them in certain models," Carlucci said. "Everyone thinks it will never happen to them, but it does. That's why we need to ... make this technology standard in all new cars."
There are also several apps and other devices that remind drivers to check the back seat.
Alfredo Angueira, a friend of Juan Rodriguez since their days at SUNY Albany, said he's been surprised by how much technology exists to prevent this kind of tragedy.
"You can turn on your air conditioner from your cellphone," Angueira said. "In this day and age, this is not necessary anymore."
Fifty-two children died after being left in hot cars in 2018, the highest number of vehicular heatstroke deaths in the last 21 years, according to noheatstroke.org. So far this year, 24 children have died; Phoenix and Luna Rodriguez were the 22nd and 23rd fatalities.
Accident or crime It was Angueira who first mentioned to Juan Rodriguez the concept of Forgotten Baby Syndrome – a neurobiological state in which a person's brain believes a child is no longer in the backseat of a vehicle. "He hadn't heard of it."
Rodriguez, the New York Times reported, called David Diamond, a University of South Florida professor who is an expert of Forgotten Baby Syndrome, to find out more.
Angueira was not surprised that Rodriguez, who has a master's degree in social work, went to a primary source to research what had happened. "Finding out information behind a condition is basically what he's done his entire career," Angueira said. "I think any one of us, your mind is going to search for answers. This isn't you, you love your children, what happened?"
Rodriguez was arrested Friday and jailed, Now out on bail, he was in court Thursday morning in the Bronx. Rodriguez has been charged with two counts of second-degree manslaughter and two counts of criminally negligent homicide, both felonies, as well as two misdemeanor counts of endangering the welfare of a child. While the Bronx District Attorney is still weighing whether to send the case to a grand jury, Rodriguez' lawyer has said the DA should not charge him because it was an accident. The case was adjourned until Aug. 27.
Parents are charged with a crime about 50% of the time when a child dies in a hot car, according to Amber Rollins, director of Kids and Cars, a Kansas-based organization that is dedicated to saving the lives of children in and around cars.
"Juan being charged brings back so much how they treat the parents," said Reeves-Cavaliero, whose husband was investigated in Ray Ray's death but not charged. "The last thing that this family needed was for this guy to be arrested at a time like that."
Angueira said that Juan and his family had not been focused on the criminal case. "He's dealing with his mental state, his wife's mental state," Angueira said. Everything else, he said, is "tertiary."

Texto completo: Michigan is part of the U.S. Midwest, most authorities agree, possibly laying to rest one major disagreement that emerged from Tuesday's Democratic presidential debate in Detroit.
Amid a discussion on Twitter about what sort of political promises "play well" in the Midwest, New York Times Deputy Washington Editor Jonathan Weisman sent a tweet many interpreted as an assertion that neither Detroit nor Minneapolis are part of the Midwest.
He later deleted the tweet after a war of words erupted on Twitter.
Both the U.S. Census Bureau and National Geographic include Michigan in the Midwest in their maps showing the various geographic regions of the U.S. They also vouch for Minnesota.
"There is no confusion over that," Joe Darden, a professor of geography at Michigan State University in East Lansing, said Wednesday. "I don't know why there is any discussion about it."
But in fact there has been a quiet debate for decades over whether not only Michigan, but other states such as Ohio, should be counted as Midwest states. Some note that much earlier in America's history, Michigan was considered part of the Northwest. Others insist it is much more Northeast than Midwest.
Exactly how the geographic debate began within Tuesday's political debate is not precisely clear.
But at least two Democratic candidates — Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts — referenced Michigan as a Midwest state at various points.
"I win in the Midwest," Klobuchar said at one point. "I can win in states like Wisconsin and Michigan and Iowa."
In his tweet, Weisman said that to say U.S. Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Detroit, or U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., are from the Midwest is like saying U.S. Rep. Lloyd Doggett, D-Austin, is from Texas, or U.S. Rep. John Lewis, D-Atlanta, is from the Deep South.
What appeared to get lost by many was that Austin is in fact the capital of Texas and Georgia is generally agreed to be part of the Deep South.
Weisman later deleted the tweet, saying he was trying "to make a point about regional differences in politics between urban and rural areas" that was misunderstood.
But by then, a fight was raging on Twitter, with FiveThirtyEight Editor-in-Chief (and Michigan native) Nate Silver accusing Weisman of saying "people from major cities in the Midwest are not really from the Midwest."
Since both Tlaib and Omar are part of the "squad" of congresswomen of color that President Donald Trump has said should go back where they came from, some saw the singling out of Tlaib and Omar in the context of the debate over where the Midwest is located as racist.
But even earlier in the evening, among those arguing that Michigan is not part of the Midwest was Michigan Republican political consultant and travel writer Dennis Lennox.
"Note to Klobuchar," Lennox tweeted less than 25 minutes into the debate at the Fox Theatre. "#Detroit (and #Michigan) is not Midwest."
Lennox pointed to a 2008 article in Hour Detroit that questioned whether Michigan should be considered part of the Midwest, said the U.S. Census Bureau did not adopt the term until 1984, and quoted a professor at Miami University in Ohio as saying the term is a "cultural construct" that can mean different things to different people.
A Google search also turned up an article titled, "Why are Ohio and Michigan considered part of the Midwest ..." among others questioning the classification.
Lennox said he thinks Michigan historically and culturally has much more in common with northern Ohio, the northeast, and upper New York State than it does with the Midwest states of Kansas or Nebraska.
"By definition it's in the Eastern Time Zone," Lennox said. "It's very difficult to say that any state in the Eastern Time Zone is Midwest."
"We basically are like New York, politically," Lennox said.
But many appeared as flummoxed by the debate as Darden.
"Apparently a hot debate about whether Michigan is actually 'Midwestern' or not erupted on Twitter during the debates last night," tweeted Jordyn Hermani, a writer for the Lansing-based political newsletter Gongwer.
"I really gotta ask: If we're not Midwestern, what are we? South Canadians?"

Texto completo: [Sign up here to receive Marc Stein's newsletter]
When Marc Stein asked me to write this week's newsletter, my first thought was "how fun!" My second thought was "there is absolutely nothing going on in the N.B.A. right now." But if there is a discernible theme to this recent break in the action -- after all, it's been two entire weeks since one of last season's All-Stars changed teams -- it's that players have been letting fans in on their emotions.
There was Anthony Davis, a new Laker, revealing on Sarah Spain's terrific "That's What She Said" podcast that he's afraid of the dark -- an affliction he blamed on too many scary movies as a kid.
There was Russell Westbrook, who feuded with some reporters in Oklahoma City, introducing himself to reporters in Houston by saying the thing fans should know about him is "that I'm a nice guy."
And there was LeBron James, so excited to celebrate a big play in his son's high school game that he lost a shoe running onto the court. Because it was LeBron, his enthusiasm managed to cause fierce debates among the internet's great gatekeepers of decorum, but if you watch the video, it will be hard to see anything but a joyful father.
But by far the biggest emotional reveal of recent days came from Jeremy Lin, a newly minted N.B.A. champion, who gave a speech in Taiwan in which he discussed his difficult time finding a new team, his conflicting emotions about his role with the Toronto Raptors last season, and the potential end of his career.
"In English there's a saying and it says once you hit rock bottom, the only way is up," he said. "But rock bottom just seems to keep getting more and more rock bottom for me. So, free agency has been tough. Because I feel like in some ways the N.B.A.'s kind of given up on me."
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Some corners of the internet mocked Lin for thinking his is a sad story despite being a Harvard-educated N.B.A. champion with more than $ 65 million in career earnings. But the speech, which probably resonated deeply for many players who felt pushed out before they considered themselves done, brought up two fairly significant questions. Is Lin really done? And if he's done, what is the takeaway of his unusual career?
The answer to the first question should be no. Lin is about to turn 31, and various injuries have added up to take away a great deal of his burst and his lateral quickness. But even in a reduced state, he's still a capable backup point guard who was putting in solid veteran minutes for Atlanta last season before being waived, at his request, so he could sign with Toronto.
The Raptors did not find much use for him in the regular season or the playoffs -- a topic he discussed in his speech in Taiwan, saying he'd dreaded the speaking tour because "I would have to talk about a championship that I don't feel like I really earned." But in a landscape in which a 42-year-old Vince Carter is expected to find a job and Big3 stars like Joe Johnson and Amar'e Stoudemire are options for N.B.A. teams, it's hard to believe that Lin, who is far younger than any of those three, would not find a job if he was willing to accept a small role.
But if he did walk away, summing up his career in a way that future generations will understand will be nearly impossible. He was an undrafted player, released unceremoniously by multiple teams, who ended up on the cover of Sports Illustrated in consecutive weeks. His time as a star may have been brief, but it burned with an intensity few of us have ever seen.
To those of us covering basketball for The New York Times, Linsanity involved seeing Jay Schreiber, the now-retired deputy editor of the section, at his absolute peak of frenetic energy. There was no story, positive or negative, that Jay did not want written if it involved Lin.
A search of The Times archive shows that between the day Lin signed with the Knicks (Dec. 27, 2011) and the day he left for Houston (July 17, 2012), the company's various departments produced 399 articles that mentioned him in some way shape or form over the course of 202 days -- an average of just under two a day.
My personal role involved trying to find angles beyond the day-to-day stuff with the Knicks. Some of the articles have been lost to the inconsistent archives of the Off the Dribble blog, but I interviewed the FedEx driver that had predicted Lin's success when the guard was coming out of college. I compared Lin to another player (Isaiah Thomas) who was getting an unexpected shot, and I took a look at another former Warrior (Brandan Wright) who was finding success elsewhere.
I wrote about Lin's handshake with Landry Fields, and I expressed concern about the long-term viability of a slight guard whose transformation into a star had come not by shooting but by getting to the basket -- a dangerous proposition when you are giving up 40 or more pounds to those guarding you.
After leaving the Knicks, Lin, who has often struggled with durability, succeeded in a few stops but never found the same level of basketball stardom. His career isn't one you'd expect to be described in a Hall of Fame speech, but it was one that dramatically exceeded any reasonable expectations. And that's before you talk about his role off the court.
Much has been written about the cultural impact of Lin being the league's first Asian-American star. In the warm afterglow of the Raptors' championship, Alex Wong provided one of the finest examples by digging in on representation and why Lin was able to resonate for so many people.
If Lin's recent speech is any indication, his off-court role may only grow. To articulate the emotions of a professional athlete in decline with so much vulnerability, and to ultimately turn it into a positive message, was no less impressive than the crossover he used to blast by Deron Williams and put himself on the N.B.A. map back in 2012. The only thing that would slow him down on this path is the very real possibility that his N.B.A. career isn't quite over.

Texto completo: CAIRO -- At least four protesters were shot dead in Sudan on Thursday, according to members of the country's main protest movement. The killings took place during another round of large-scale demonstrations, potentially escalating a tense, monthslong standoff between protesters and military leaders.
The shootings came just three days after paramilitary forces fired on demonstrators, killing five teenagers and an adult.
Thousands had taken to the streets in the capital, Khartoum, and in cities across Sudan on Thursday to demand justice for the killings earlier this week, in the south-central city of El-Obeid.
"The protests today were a message on El-Obeid -- that we are one and that each life matters," said Nadreen Rugheem, a physician who protested in Khartoum.
Months of protests had toppled Sudan's longtime president, Omar al-Bashir, in April, leaving the country in the hands of a transitional military council. But negotiations to form a new civilian government, held against a backdrop of violence against protesters, have been troubled.
The violence on Thursday took place as negotiators from the protest movement and the military council began talks on a power-sharing deal that aims to steer the country to civilian rule within three years.
The killings will "surely have a negative effect on the talks and on the relationship between the two negotiating sides," Khalid Omar, a spokesman for the Forces of Freedom and Change, a coalition representing pro-democracy groups, told The New York Times.
On Thursday, men in plain clothes shot at protesters from buildings surrounding a protest site in Omdurman, a city next to Khartoum, according to the main protest group, the Sudanese Professionals Association, which cited eyewitnesses.
The protesters, all in their 20s, were shot with live ammunition, three of them in the head and one in the chest, the group said. A video appearing to show a bleeding protester was widely shared online.
The Sudanese Professionals Association said the shootings came shortly after the police had fired tear gas and rubber bullets at protesters. At least two protesters were injured by rubber bullets, the group said.
Responding to the El-Obeid killings earlier this week, the military council said Thursday that members of the Rapid Support Forces paramilitary had fired on the predominantly student rally without being ordered.
The council said seven paramilitary members had been expelled and detained after the killings, though at the same time it accused the protest movement of coercing students to join its demonstrations. The paramilitary group is led by Lt. Gen. Mohamed Hamdan, the deputy chief of the military council.
The military council did not immediately comment on Thursday's killings.
"We do not know who killed the protesters in Omdurman," said Mr. Omar, the spokesman for the pro-democracy group. "But in any case, the military council as the governing body shares part of the responsibility."

Texto completo: For centuries, the wives of England's King Henry VIII have been remembered largely for the ways their marriages came to an end.
Divorced. Beheaded. Died. Divorced. Beheaded. Survived.
Now comes a pair of young British theater-makers, Toby Marlow and Lucy Moss, with a revisionist take on those sorry stories: "Six," a pop musical in which each woman gets, at least for a few minutes, to reframe her fame.
The show, long on wordplay ("Live in consort!") and short on running time (80 minutes), is coming to Broadway next year. "Six" will begin performances Feb. 13 and open March 12 at the Brooks Atkinson Theater, produced by Kenny Wax, Wendy and Andy Barnes, George Stiles and Kevin McCollum.
"This is obviously the craziest thing that's ever happened to us," Ms. Moss, who is 25, said in an interview. She had never even seen a Broadway show until she visited New York earlier this year; Mr. Marlow, who is 24, had seen a few productions, starting with Cirque du Soleil's "Paramour," and came up with the idea for "Six" while daydreaming during a poetry class at Cambridge University.
"Six" is the first new musical with an original score announced for the current Broadway season -- the other scheduled musicals include four employing previously published pop songs and one revival. But it is likely that a few other shows with new scores will join the season next spring.
Featuring an all-female cast and an all-female band, "Six" is structured as a singing competition with the women's miserable marriages as the theme. The show is directed by Ms. Moss and Jamie Armitage.
The songs, which have attracted a youthful fan base via online streaming, are styled after contemporary female artists (Adele, Rihanna, Ariana Grande and others) and the show's structure was influenced, the writers said, by Beyoncé's 2011 video album "Live at Roseland: Elements of 4." The catchy lyrics are packed with allusions to popular culture, from Poison ("Every Tudor Rose has its thorn") to Beyoncé ("O.K. ladies, let's get in Reformation") to "Little Shop of Horrors" ("Stick around and you'll suddenly see more," sings the third wife, Jane Seymour).
"Six" is already a hit in London's West End, and a pre-Broadway North American production is now concluding a sold-out 12-week run at the Chicago Shakespeare Theater, where it broke box-office records and was so popular that the theater had to add seating capacity. "'Six' blows out the amps with its pop-historical hysteria," the critic Jesse Green wrote in a New York Times review in which he called the Chicago production "great" and said the show "seems destined to occupy a top spot in the confetti canon."
That production will move to the American Repertory Theater in Cambridge, Mass.; the Citadel Theater in Edmonton, Alberta; and the Ordway in St. Paul before arriving in New York. A third production, touring Britain, will begin this October.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Mr. Marlow and Ms. Moss wrote the show, their first collaboration, while they were still undergraduates at Cambridge. They needed a student project to bring to the Edinburgh Festival Fringe and decided it should have a famous subject (to get attention) and meaty parts for women (because so many of their female friends were struggling to find meaningful roles in musicals). Cambridge's musical theater society brought the show to the festival in 2017, where it was discovered by commercial producers.
The writers said they have made only minor adjustments to the show for American audiences. "The pop concert format is such an American format," Ms. Moss said. "We've found that American audiences are more responsive and ready to scream and get on board right away."

Texto completo: Our guide to cultural events in New York City for children and teenagers happening this weekend and in the week ahead.
FAMILY DAY AT LINCOLN CENTER OUT OF DOORS at Hearst Plaza (Aug. 3, 11 a.m.-2:15 p.m.). You would be hard pressed to find a band more multicultural -- or multifarious -- than Brown Rice Family. With members who hail from Japan, Jamaica, Haiti, Nigeria, South Africa and the United States, this world-music group will enliven the children's portion of this free annual Lincoln Center summer festival. In addition to their reggae, Afrobeat, jazz, rock and Latin rhythms, the day will offer a rousing spoken-word performance by the poet and arts educator Najee Omar, who appeared on a list of visionaries selected by The New York Times in 2018. SOLE Defined, a troupe whose dancers turn their entire bodies into percussion instruments, will also take the stage, and the muralist Lola Lovenotes (not to be confused with Luna Lovegood of the Harry Potter tales) will create on-site visual art.

KIDS CREATE LIKE BURLE MARX! at the New York Botanical Garden (Aug. 2 and 5-8, 1:30-5:30 p.m.; Aug. 3-4, 10 a.m.-5:30 p.m.; through Sept. 20). Vibrant colors, bold shapes, a jungle of riotous pattern -- the work of the Brazilian landscape designer Roberto Burle Marx (1909-94) seems guaranteed to delight children. In this program at the botanical garden in the Bedford Park section of the Bronx, they can explore his approach with the help of their own imaginations. Inspired by the current show "Brazilian Modern: The Living Art of Roberto Burle Marx," young visitors can go to the Everett Children's Adventure Garden to create a whimsical geometric sculpture that reflects his designs. They can also pot up and take home a philodendron -- one of Burle Marx's signature plants -- and learn how the vegetation of the Bronx compares with that of Brazil.

'LABYRINTH' at the Museum of the Moving Image (through Aug. 4, noon). Imagine a film that has George Lucas as an executive producer, Jim Henson as director, Terry Jones (of Monty Python fame) as screenwriter and David Bowie as a star. That's the package you get in "Labyrinth," a 1986 project that is also notable for the nonhumans involved: elaborate puppets that portray the bizarre creatures populating the movie's titular space. The teenage heroine, Sarah, played by a young Jennifer Connelly, must venture into that realm to rescue her baby brother, whom she had previously longed to see kidnapped by goblins. (Be careful what you wish for.) Screening as part of the museum's series Summer Matinees: Fantastic Worlds and recommended for cinema fans 8 and older, the picture follows Sarah's quest to persuade the beguiling and quite musical goblin king -- played by Bowie -- to release her little sibling.

'OCEANS: OUR BLUE PLANET' at the American Museum of Natural History (through Jan. 5). Fish and mollusks are smarter than you think. That's one impression you'll glean from this fascinating family documentary, which the museum is screening in 2-D and 3-D versions. "Oceans" shows a tuskfish repeatedly tossing a clam from its mouth onto a lump of coral until the prey cracks open. Another scene features an octopus methodically covering its body with shells -- not for adornment but as a camouflage to deceive sharks. Directed by Mark Brownlow and Rachel Butler, the film captured these moments by following the travels of Alucia, a research vessel operated by the exploration company OceanX. A fitting complement to the museum's exhibition "Unseen Oceans," which closes on Aug. 18, the movie emphasizes how mysterious the seas are -- we know more about Mars's surface than their most remote depths -- and how vital. The warming of these "life support systems," as the script calls the oceans, threatens not only the intriguing creatures seen here, but us as well.

RETRO DETECTIVES at the Brooklyn Public Library (through Aug. 30). The library is inviting children to become gumshoes, but for these cases, they'll hit the books instead of the streets. Directed toward middle schoolers -- the recommended ages are 11 to 14 -- this program uses games, scavenger hunts, riddles and clues to engage young sleuths in unraveling mysteries about Brooklyn's past. Six library branches -- Arlington, Canarsie, Eastern Parkway, Red Hook, Stone Avenue and New Utrecht -- will host the free weekday events, which will involve research into archival sources. Over the course of the series, participants can pursue four investigations: Medical Mysteries of the Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel, which looks into the decompression sickness affecting laborers who were building it; The Missing Good Luck Charm of Emily Roebling, about the woman who was instrumental in the engineering of the Brooklyn Bridge; Brooklyn Born: Equality for All, which finds some roots of the borough's culture in the civil rights movement; and The Strange, the Forgotten and the Sublime: A Coney Island Tour.

REVOLUTIONARY SUMMER: DEBORAH SAMPSON, FIGHTING WOMAN at the New-York Historical Society (Aug. 3-4, 11 a.m.-3 p.m.). Some of the participants in the American war for independence were revolutionary in more than their cause. Consider Deborah Sampson (1760-1827), who disguised herself as a man to enlist in the Fourth Massachusetts Regiment. A soldier who fought and was wounded before her ruse was discovered, Sampson was the first American woman to receive a full military pension. Judith Kalaora, who portrays this real-life heroine regularly in her one-woman show "A Revolution of Her Own," will visit the society. Costumed as Sampson, she'll answer questions about this female patriot's life and invite children to join her in period-style military drills with other re-enactors. Part of the museum's series Revolutionary Summer, the event will be held in the courtyard (weather permitting), where young visitors can also learn about muskets, tents, knapsacks and other aspects of a Continental Army encampment.

TWILIGHT IN THE GARDEN: BATS OF THE BRONX TALK AND WALK at Wave Hill (Aug. 8, 7:30-9:30 p.m.). What sensible New Yorker would complain about neighbors that are always quiet and unobtrusive and even help lower the local population of mosquitoes? But despite those characteristics, bats often inspire fear. At this program, recommended for children 10 and older, the ecologist Kaitlyn L. Parkins and the New York City Bat Group will give an indoor presentation on the diversity of these urban animals and their value. (Bats are also pollinators.) Afterward, the educators will lead a walk around this public garden in Riverdale, during which they'll use a bat detector -- a device that translates the creatures' calls into sounds audible to humans -- to look for Bronx species like the big brown bat and the eastern red bat. Participants should register and bring flashlights. (The rain date is Aug. 29.)

Texto completo: Colleagues celebrated former 32BJ SEIU President Héctor Figueroa's legacy at Riverside Church last week.
Friends, family, colleagues and elected officials showed up on a late July afternoon to mourn Figueroa's loss and simultaneously celebrate his work in shaping the union into the force it is today. Newly-elected 32BJ President Kyle Bragg praised Figueroa's disposition not only as a labor activist, but as a man.
"We also learned that at his core, Héctor was a family man, a loving father and caring husband who brought that love and care to our union because he knew that if we were going to build a union worth fighting for, it would have to be rooted in what makes life worth living: so we built a union centered around the idea that to succeed we would love and protect each other, we would encourage each other, we would respect each other, we would give everyone the opportunity to lead," stated Bragg.
"We'll continue fighting for what's good and decent and right in this world with the same love, kindness and compassion that you showed everyone," continued Bragg.
Figueroa's passing was felt in many corners of the tri-state area. The New York Times released a posthumous op-ed from Figueroa titled "The Labor Movement Can Rise Again" where he detailed what he saw as the future of the labor movement.
"It's not too late to rebuild our movement," wrote Figueroa. "If labor wants to have a real impact, our movement needs a big and ambitious plan to organize. It is heartbreaking to witness our movement risk near-irrelevance when workers are ready to take action."
SEIU President Mary Kay Henry touted her famous debates with Figueroa and how even when they disagreed, they did so from a place of respect. She said that he had a moral compass that didn't budge.
"Héctor believed that we had to be bold and ambitious, and he called on us to take big risks," stated Henry. "He knew real power came from when we joined together and treated the discarded stones of this economy to become the cornerstones of a just society."
While Figueroa was president, 32BJ grew by over 50,000 members and helped get dozens of local and state policies protecting and lifting working families passed in various states. Most recently, he appealed to the state government in favor of the farmworkers' rights bill, automatic voter registration and prevailing wage bills for building service workers.
New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said Figueroa's legacy is New York City's legacy.
"He touched every corner of this city," stated de Blasio. "His impact was felt all over this nation. I offer my personal condolences but I also offer my condolences to 8.6 million New Yorkers because the city became a better place the moment Héctor became a leader here, the moment we felt his passion, his belief."
Workers on the ground have felt Figueroa's death in a unique way. Shantel Walker, who works at a Papa John's in Brooklyn, worked with Figueroa since 32BJ joined and supported the Fight for $15 movement. Walker found out about Figueroa's death from her mother. She said she was just thinking about calling him when she got the news.
Walker said she lost a friend and a leader.
"I feel like I just lost someone in my own family," Walker stated. "This hurts. Héctor is a great man but he made you feel like you are on the same level as him. I will miss him."

Bending It Like Bamboo

Texto completo: SAO PAULO, Brazil - On a Tuesday afternoon in early July, Alison Grace Martin, a British artist and weaver, joined a steady stream of Paulistanos along the elevated freeway that curves through downtown Sao Paulo. The 2-mile Minhocao (named after a mythic “gigantic earthworm”) was closed to cars that day. The only traffic was on foot and bikes, skateboards and scooters. Picnickers lounged on the median sipping wine. Children ran after soccer balls. A retriever chased a coconut; a pit bull peed on a pile of bamboo.
The bamboo - freshly cut and split into strips about 20 feet long - had arrived with Martin and engineer James Solly, who were leading an urban design workshop, “High Line Paulista,” inspired loosely by Manhattan’s elevated greenway. Their students for the week had carried the strips, which would be put to use in an experimental dome construction, like a barn-raising, but with bamboo.
Plans have long been in the works to turn the Minhocao into a park. Since its opening in 1971, the freeway has been the subject of controversy: a concrete scar that bifurcated neighborhoods, smothering residents with noise and pollution.
Ripping the ‘urban fabric’
“It ripped apart the urban fabric,” said Franklin Lee, from Sao Paulo, and director of the workshop with his partner Anne Save de Beaurecueil. In January, after years of discourse and debate, the mayor, Bruno Covas, announced that the freeway would eventually be deactivated, finally making way for “Parque Minhocao.”
The goal of the workshop was to envisage structures - woven from bamboo, a sustainable and local resource - to provide shade for the park, or structures that would filter sunlight through roadway apertures and onto the dark streetscape below. Martin typically weaves small-scale paper objects - a torus, a basket, a bikini - or medium-size bamboo structures. Lately, her work is attracting the attention of architects and engineers, and she has begun to pursue collaborations.
“She’s miles ahead, exploring shapes we’ve never thought were possible,” said Pedro Reis, who runs the Flexible Structures Laboratory at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne; Martin had visited his lab two weeks earlier. “We’re heading toward her with more mathematical and scientific methods.”
Solly, Martin’s partner for the workshop, is a director at Format Engineers in Bath, England. The firm is perhaps best known for its work with French architect Arthur Mamou-Mani and his design for the 2018 Burning Man temple, “Galaxia.”
What Solly and Martin both appreciate about woven structures is that there are no nuts and bolts, and few fixings. For the most part, woven bamboo holds itself in place through the friction of the over-under-over-under intersections. And it’s a “form-finding” process. As Martin explained to her students, “It’s about letting the bamboo do what it wants to.”
“What’s fun about Alison’s work is how beautiful it is, and it just comes from her head,” Solly said. “I could spend ages trying to work out on a computer what she does quickly in a tactile fashion.”
The two first met in person last fall at a conference on Advances in Architectural Geometry, and with the Sao Paulo workshop they found an opportunity to collaborate. As an engineer, Solly envisioned translating Martin’s impressive vocabulary of shapes onto bigger structures.
The plan for that Tuesday on the Minhocao was to build a dome from 30 strips of bamboo, harvested the weekend before from the hillside garden of James Elkis, a pioneer of the medium, who lives southwest of Sao Paulo.
The group - 27 aspiring young architects and urban and landscape designers - had done a practice run with their tutors on the weekend, with limited success. Their dome, woven upright, was skewed and pointy at the top, rather than round.
Blending art and science
A crucial part of the workshop curriculum was “digital parameterization” - simulating structures on the computer and tweaking design parameters from one iteration to the next. For example, a key software tool, K2Engineering, designed by Cecilie Brandt-Olsen, predicts a material’s internal “bending stress” based on the applied force.
Solly, having crunched the bamboo’s numbers and consulted the paper model, proposed a solution for the skewing: the dome could instead be woven flat on the ground and then “popped up.”
Martin thought bending the strips all at once might cause breakage. But they were keen to get a proof of concept, one way or another. Solly said, “We’ll carry a pile of bamboo up there and see if we get arrested!”
Setting out from the workshop’s base at Escola Da Cidade, a private college for architecture and urbanism, the bamboo caravan wound its way toward the freeway, occasionally breaking into song - “Believe,” by Cher, and “Evidencias,” by Brazilian duo Chitaozinho & Xororo. The group walked up an exit ramp, found a favorable site and began marking the dome’s 50-foot circumference in chalk on the roadway.
Visible on the skyline was Oscar Niemeyer’s sinuous residential high rise, the Edificio Copan. “It’s not the right angle that attracts me, nor the straight line, hard, inflexible,” Niemeyer once said. “What attracts me is the free and sensual curve - the curve that I find in the mountains of my country.”
Once all the strips were woven on the roadway - combining weaving principles with a fivefold symmetry pattern typical of Islamic geometry - the students moved swiftly, lifting the spray of bamboo and bending down the verticals. The dome popped into shape nicely, as Solly had predicted. “James deserves all the credit,” Martin said. Still, she told the students, “the computer is not your only tool. There’s a lot of information in the paper model.”
For the remainder of the week, the students assembled in design teams and envisaged their own structures for the park. One team went for a decorative, 50-foot Mobius loop. Another produced a rolling swoosh that became an irresistible tunnel for skateboarders when installed on the Minhocao during the workshop’s final day.
“It was wild fun,” said Camila Calegari Marques, an architect and a Martin groupie of sorts, having participated in a 2017 workshop in Barcelona, Spain, that involved weaving with wooden strips.
And the dome, it turned out, not only assembled well but also disassembled and reassembled efficiently - it went up again during the finale. Martin said, “We had even more useful structural properties than I had envisaged: deployability, nice structural stability and highly portable.”

Texto completo: Last year during a local gathering, some of Silver City's long time denizens noted that there hadn't been any theatre productions in town for some time. Past community projects to create musicals such as Old Plumbottom, with direction from local professionals Will and Sheree Rose, were enormously popular.
Now that Silver City has a permanent outdoor stage, the Silver Pavilion, locals suggested that the town should make theater a regular part of its public programming. In a timely coincidence, not long afterward I received an application to the Resident Artist Program in Silver City from Manhattan playwright, opera librettist and theatre critic David Cote.
Cote's play Otherland was a finalist in the Eugene O'Neill Theater Center's National Playwrights Conference. His opera libretti include Blind Injustice, which is on stage now at the Cincinnati Opera; Three Way (Nashville Opera and BAM); The Scarlet Ibis (Chicago Opera Theater and Prototype); and the one-act Fade which had a world premiere in London.
He's written companion books for several hit Broadway musicals, including Wicked. His reporting and criticism have appeared in The New York Times, The Village Voice, The Guardian, the Observer, Theater News Online, American Theatre, and Opera News. Cote was previously the longest serving theater editor and chief drama critic of Time Out New York.
After learning more about his work, and giving him background material on the community of Silver City, I asked what he'd think of working with the community on a one-act play about the town's current struggle to survive the ongoing onslaught by Comstock Mining Inc. He'll bring the idea to the community when he arrives in August, and denizens can decide then if they'd like to work on that group project, or something else, such as a libretto that they could add music to later.
You can learn more about Cote's creative process during a talk from 5-6:30 p.m. Aug. 22 at the Brick in Carson City that also includes Chicago-based artist Nicole Beck. The artists talks are part of a summer series funded and sponsored by Carson City's Department of Arts and Culture.
You can also hear more about David's librettos and the operas they're in at a talk at Sierra Arts in Reno on Aug. 24. His Sierra Arts talk is part of a rural/urban exchange funded by the Nevada Arts Council's Basin to Range Exchange initiative.

Texto completo: Apple has long performed like clockwork, growing steadily and producing an ever-growing stream of profit. Not anymore.
On Tuesday, the Silicon Valley behemoth said that its net income had fallen 13 percent and that its revenue rose 1 percent in the latest quarter, with iPhone sales continuing to decline and gains in the company's services and wearables business failing to make up the difference.
The results showed persistent signs of weakness for one of the world's financial standouts. Apple built its enormous business on the iPhone, but sales of the device have slipped for three straight quarters in a saturated market for smartphones.
Yet the results also suggested that the company could be starting to halt declines in those sales and other key areas, including revenue from the Chinese market. Over the previous two quarters, Apple's profits and revenue had fallen over all.
"Obviously on the iPhone, we've gone through a period where we've seen some revenue declines," Luca Maestri, Apple's finance chief, said in an interview. "But we are very excited about our product road maps, and we're very optimistic about the future."
Apple said net income had dropped to $ 10.04 billion for its fiscal third quarter, from $ 11.5 billion a year earlier, with profit of $ 2.18 a share exceeding Wall Street estimates. Revenue rose to $ 53.8 billion from $ 53.3 billion a year earlier. Mr. Maestri said profits had fallen while sales had risen because of narrower margins that he attributed to foreign-exchange rates.
Apple shares rose more than 4 percent in after-hours trading. "They essentially beat fairly low expectations," said Angelo Zino, an analyst at CFRA Research.
Mr. Maestri said Apple had slowed the bleeding in its iPhone business by offering financing, cutting prices in some countries and starting a trade-in program for owners of older models after finding that people were keeping their iPhones longer. In the latest quarter, revenue from iPhone sales fell nearly 12 percent, to $ 25.97 billion, from a year earlier. In the company's previous quarter, iPhone sales fell 17 percent.
For the first time since 2013, iPhone sales did not account for at least half of Apple's revenue, said Yoram Wurmser, an analyst at the market-research firm eMarketer.
Consumers are finding fewer reasons to upgrade their iPhones, analysts said, with newer models offering only incremental improvements. The trend could continue this year, when Apple is likely to unveil a new slate of iPhones. The latest models, expected in September, are unlikely to work with the new fifth-generation, or 5G, wireless technology that offers far faster download speeds than current service. Apple is expected to have 5G iPhones for 2020, analysts said.
The other shrinking part of Apple's business has been China. Sales in the region that includes China fell nearly 25 percent over the previous two quarters, sparking a sell-off of Apple shares in January. Apple blamed the drop in part on economic weakness in China.
In the latest quarter, Apple's sales in the region fell 4.1 percent, while revenue specifically in mainland China grew. Timothy D. Cook, Apple's chief executive, said on an earnings call that business had been lifted in part by Apple's move to cut iPhone prices there and an economic stimulus program from the government.
"There were a lot of questions and uncertainty around China, so the fact that the year-over-year growth rate has improved is likely a relief for investors," said Toni Sacconaghi, an analyst at Bernstein.

The Chinese market, Apple's third largest for sales, has emerged as one of the company's greatest vulnerabilities. This month, Chinese officials disclosed that the country's growth had fallen to its slowest pace in three decades. Apple also assembles most of its products in China, which has drawn the ire of President Trump, who has publicly pressured Apple to build more products in the United States.
Since 2013, Apple has made its top-of-the-line Mac Pro desktop computer in Texas. Doing so led to headaches that delayed the computer's launch. In June, The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times reported that Apple would shift assembly of its new Mac Pro to China.
Last week, Apple filed requests with the United States trade representative's office asking that components used in the Mac Pro, like power cables and circuit boards, be excluded from tariffs. Apple said in the requests that it could not find the products outside China.
Mr. Trump responded on Twitter that Apple "will not be given Tariff waiver, or relief, for Mac Pro parts that are made in China" and that the company should "Make them in the USA, no Tariffs!"
On Tuesday, Mr. Cook said Apple still wanted to make the Mac Pro in the United States and suggested that exclusions from the tariffs could help make that happen.
"We've been making the Mac Pro in the U.S.," he said. "We want to continue to do that."
Mr. Trump has placed tariffs on $ 250 billion worth of Chinese goods, but so far, Apple products have largely escaped the tariffs' effect. Mr. Cook has encouraged officials in the United States and China to resolve the trade dispute, but while the countries resumed trade talks this week, hopes for a transformative deal are dwindling.
Apple faces other issues in Washington, including antitrust concerns. Last week, the Department of Justice said it was opening an antitrust review of the Big Tech companies. Apple has come under particular scrutiny for how it wields power in its App Store, where it distributes games, ride-hailing programs and more.
As Apple's iPhone sales fall, the company has sought to make up the gap in revenue with an expanding business selling apps and services to its existing customers. Apple now offers subscriptions for news, music and TV services and is preparing to start a gaming service soon. Its services revenue rose more than 12 percent to $ 11.5 billion.
Apple also showed strength in its wearables business, which includes Airpods and the Apple Watch. That business grew nearly 64 percent to $ 5.5 billion, surpassing the iPad in sales.

Texto completo: Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats is leaving his job next month, ending a two-year tenure marked by President Trump's clashes with intelligence officials.
Trump announced Coats's departure on Aug. 15 in a tweet Sunday that thanked Coats for his service. He said that he will nominate Representative John Ratcliffe, Republican of Texas, to the post and that he will name an acting official in the coming days. Ratcliffe is a frequent Trump defender who fiercely questioned former special counsel Robert Mueller last week during a House Judiciary Committee hearing.
Coats often appeared out of step with Trump and disclosed to prosecutors how he was urged by the president to publicly deny any link between Russia and the Trump campaign. The relationship reflected broader divisions between the president and the government's intelligence agencies.
Coats's public, and sometimes personal, disagreements with Trump over policy and intelligence included Russian election interference and North Korean nuclear capabilities. Trump had long been skeptical of the nation's intelligence community, which provoked his ire by concluding that Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election with the goal of getting him elected.
A former Republican senator from Indiana, Coats was appointed director of National Intelligence in March 2017.

Scott says he wasn't told about '16 Russian hacking
US Senator Rick Scott said Sunday he was never told by Homeland Security officials in 2016 when he was Florida's governor that Russian hackers had gained access to voter databases in two Florida counties before the presidential election.
Scott said on NBC's "Meet the Press" that he was never contacted by the Department of Homeland Security in 2016 about the infiltration. The Republican said he learned about most of the details this year.
Current Governor Ron DeSantis said in May that the hackers didn't manipulate any data and the election results weren't compromised. DeSantis and other officials briefed on the matter wouldn't say which counties. Scott made his comments when asked about a Senate report released last week that said all states were targeted to varying degrees by Russian hackers. Scott said he hasn't yet read the report, though he was briefed on it.
Last August, then-Democratic US Senator Bill Nelson, who Scott was running against, said that Russians had penetrated the systems of certain Florida counties and had "free rein to move about" before last year's midterm election. Scott, who defeated Nelson in the November election, criticized Nelson's allegations, saying they were sensational.
Associated Press
US inquiry of Trump friend focused on foreign lobbying
As Donald Trump was preparing to deliver an address on energy policy in May 2016, Paul Manafort, his campaign chairman, had a question about the speech's contents for Thomas J. Barrack Jr., a top campaign fund-raiser and close friend of Trump.
“Are you running this by our friends?" Manafort asked in a previously undisclosed e-mail to Barrack, whose real estate and investment firm does extensive business in the Middle East.
Barrack was, in fact, coordinating the language in a draft of the speech with Persian Gulf contacts including Rashid al-Malik, an Emirati businessman who is close to the rulers of the United Arab Emirates.
The exchanges about Trump's energy speech are among a series of interactions that have come under scrutiny by federal prosecutors looking at foreign influence over his campaign, his transition, and the early stages of his administration, according to documents and interviews with people familiar with the case.
Investigators have looked in particular at whether Barrack or others violated the law requiring people who try to influence US policy or opinion at the direction of foreign governments or entities to disclose their activities to the Justice Department, people familiar with the case said.
The inquiry had proceeded far enough last month that Barrack, who played an influential role in the campaign and acts as an outside adviser to the White House, was interviewed, at his request, by prosecutors in the public integrity unit of the US attorney's office in Brooklyn.
Barrack's spokesman, Owen Blicksilver, said that in expectation of this article, Barrack's lawyer had again contacted the prosecutors' office and “confirmed they have no further questions for Mr. Barrack."
Barrack has not been accused of wrongdoing, and his aides said he never worked on behalf of foreign states or entities. Asked about the status of the inquiry, a representative for the US attorney's office in Brooklyn declined to comment.

Top Judiciary Democrat says Trump 'deserves impeachment'
The chairman of the House Judiciary Committee said Sunday that he believes President Trump "richly deserves impeachment," an explosive statement from the lawmaker whose committee has the power to launch proceedings to remove the president from office.
Representative Jerrold Nadler, Democrat of New York, appearing on CNN's "State of the Union," said Trump "has done many impeachable offenses, he's violated the law six ways from Sunday."
"But that's not the question," Nadler continued. "The question is, can we develop enough evidence to put before the American people?"
The distinction illustrates a growing tension within the Democratic Party: Many members are convinced Trump ought to be impeached, but the consensus among party leaders is that they should try to secure more records and witness interviews through the courts before embarking on such a politically incendiary move, especially as the GOP-controlled Senate is likely to defeat such an effort.

Police traffic searches dropped 70 percent in Burlington, Vt., after marijuana legalization

Texto completo: Marijuana Moment is a wire service assembled by Tom Angell, a marijuana legalization activist and journalist covering marijuana reform nationwide. The views expressed by Angell or Marijuana Moment are neither endorsed by the Globe nor do they reflect the Globe's views on any subject area.
The largest local police force in Vermont is reporting that traffic searches are down 70 percent since the state legalized marijuana.
A report from the Burlington Police Department details the declining searches, which law enforcement officials are attributing to the fact that possession of up to one ounce of cannabis became legal for adults last summer. According to a report from WCAX, the data shows that traffic searches plummeted for individuals of all races.
On Tuesday, the Burlington Board of Police Commissioners will meet to discuss the report and its implications.
Dave Silberman, an attorney and pro bono drug policy reform advocate from Middlebury, said that Vermont's reputation as a progressive state hasn't squared with racial disparities in policing, noting a 2017 study that showed black and Hispanic drivers were “more likely to be pulled over than white drivers" and “four times as likely to have their cars searched as white drivers who've been pulled over."
“Thus, it's immensely gratifying to see that, one year after possession and personal cultivation of cannabis were legalized, Vermont's largest police force searched 70 percent fewer drivers than in the year before legalization," Silberman said. “We've taken away the pretextual excuse that cannabis possession gave police officers to harass drivers of color, and as a direct result, fewer drivers of color are being harassed."
“This new data shows how important it is for us to keep pushing for drug policy and broader criminal justice reform statewide, and to proactively take away the tools of oppression, rather than waiting for police departments — no matter how well-intentioned — to reform themselves," he added.
The Vermont city's experience is consistent with those of other states that have legalized cannabis. In Colorado and Washington state, traffic stops dropped by about 50 percent in the years after the states implemented commercial marijuana markets for adults in 2012, according to a 2017 analysis.
And while fewer traffic stops for simple cannabis possession — and importantly, an accompanying reduction in racially disparate enforcement practices — is viewed as a positive development from a civil liberties perspective, it could also be helping law enforcement prioritize more serious crimes.
A study released last year found that as marijuana possession arrests declined in legal states, police started making more arrests for violent and property crime.

LOOKING GOOD! STORES UPGRADE FITTING ROOMS WITH UPLIFTING MESSAGES

Texto completo: A store's fitting room is a small space that can have a big impact on how shoppers feel not only about the clothes they try on, but also about themselves.
"Some women would make self-deprecating comments while trying on items," says KC Kaluhiokalani, owner of urbanfitco boutique in Sewickley, which specializes in stylish activewear. "Due to societal pressure there is sometimes a lot of stress and anxiety when trying clothing on."
So she decided to try to do something about it. With the help of local artist Erin Liposky of Erin Art Design, she changed her shop's two fitting rooms to make them more welcoming, uplifting spaces - something that several retailers have been working on these days.
"When women shop, we want them to celebrate the skin they are in and feel beautiful," Ms. Kaluhiokalani says.
She enlisted Ms. Liposky to add murals to the walls of her store's fitting rooms. Colorful, hand-painted flowers now bloom on the walls, while body-positive quotes encircle the mirrors. Customers also are invited to pen their own encouraging words on small adhesive slips of paper and stick them to the walls.
The murals were completed in late June, and shoppers started adding their messages to the walls in mid-July. Most shoppers have commented about these additions, Ms. Kaluhiokalani says.
"It seems that the fitting room makeover has created a positive environment that is encouraging shoppers to take their time rather than making them want to hurry up and run," she adds. "I think it also created some mindfulness of the self talk we all have in our head when trying on clothes."
Ms. Kaluhiokalani got the idea while scrolling through Instagram and spotting a photo of a fitting room inside an Aerie store. She noticed sticky notes with positive affirmations on them decorating the walls.
The #AerieREAL Girls Stick Together! campaign launched in August 2017. When shoppers enter the fitting room, there's also a curtain in front of the mirror that reads, "Before you love what you see on the outside, you have to love who you are on the inside." Aerie is American Eagle Outfitters' intimates brand that's headquartered on the South Side.
"We learned through our internal research that more than 60% of women were feeling negative thoughts in the fitting room when trying on bras, and we wanted to help combat that," Stacey McCormick, Aerie senior vice president of marketing, said in an email. "We receive a lot of great content from this that we share on our social channels."
Fitting rooms can be a "psychological land mine," says Marge Laney, CEO of Houston-based Alert Tech. The company works with retailers to improve their fitting room experiences through adding technology to them and other strategies. They're also a gold mine for retailers to learn more about their customers and to boost sales.
"The fitting room, in my opinion, is the most valuable square footage in every store. It's the place where the highest conversion occurs," she says, noting that shoppers who try something on are at least 70% more likely to buy it. Those who just browse merchandise on the floor are only 10% likely to make a purchase. At Aerie stores, customers are 75% more likely to commit to something if they try it on, according to Ms. McCormick, and the company has seen "an increase overall" as a result of its body-positive fitting room initiatives.
Some stores - particularly higher-end retailers - strive to elevate their fitting rooms with fancy upgrades. Nordstrom, Macy's and Zara are among those that have experimented with or installed tablets, smartphones or interactive mirrors so shoppers can review products or request assistance. Interactive kiosks also have been added to fitting rooms in select American Eagle stores, allowing customers to request another size from a clerk on the floor, view product recommendations, email information to themselves and calculate what they plan to spend.
But there's a lot a store can do without those bells and whistles, Ms. Laney says. Good lighting, clean floors, working locks and perhaps a bench or a chair in a fitting room can make a big difference.
No. 14 Boutique in Lawrenceville, for instance, is known for its sleek fitting rooms. Both are bright and roomy, and each has a message spelled out in the white floor in black penny tile. One reads "Flawless, Darling," and the other reads "Ooh La La."
"We wanted something that would lift people up," owner Brianne Conley says. "People love it. It's definitely a social media moment."
What customers expect from a fitting room should be in line with the prices they plan to pay in a particular store. Nevertheless, there are things they can do to make trying on clothes more pleasant and empowering, says Susan Albers, a clinical psychologist at Cleveland Clinic and a New York Times' best-selling author. In 2017, she launched the #DressingRoomChallenge, asking women to give themselves, or even a stranger, a compliment in the fitting room. Her social media post attracted a slew of media attention, including from People magazine.
Beyond eliminating negative language, she suggests not staring at yourself in the mirror while putting on an outfit in the fitting room.
"Turn toward the door, and then turn around with a 'ta-da' toward the mirror. That way as you're getting dressed you're not picking apart your body in the mirror."
Ultimately, no matter where a person shops or the state of the fitting room, it's about changing the question from "Is my body right for this outfit?" to "Are these clothes right for me?"
"People are listening when you're in the dressing room," Dr. Albers says. "You can see people perk up and glow when they get those compliments. When you can make it a fun experience, it can be helpful."

Texto completo: Russiagate had, of course, two components: Trump-Russia collusion and Russian meddling in the 2016 election.
By now, the Trump-Russia collusion theory has proved to be (no matter what the Democrats say) a nothing-burger.
But the left still had the consolation prize of Russian meddling as explanation for their humiliating election loss.
Even some establishment Republican leaders have talked about extensive Russian interference in the election.
But even Russian meddling, with increased scrutiny, has come up short and is revealing itself to be, at best, a nothing-much burger.
But to begin at the beginning: There were four planks that supported the meddling theory.
One, the hyped January 2017 Intelligence Community Assessment stating that President Vladimir Putin directly interfered in the 2016 election to help Trump win the presidency.
Two, the reports of the Russian hacking of the Democratic National Committee computer server, and the release of embarrassing Democratic Party emails to WikiLeaks.
Three, the Mueller report stating that "the Russian government interfered in the 2016 presidential election in sweeping and systematic fashion."
Four, the Russian social media campaign that supposedly influenced voters.
Thanks to the relentless sleuthing by some investigative journalists on the right, each of these planks have been found wanting.
A recent RealClear Investigations report lays out all the ways in which the Russian meddling theory doesn't stand up to serious scrutiny, and rigorously explains how the Mueller Report itself undercuts the Russian meddling theory.
There isn't space here to go through all the points, but here are a few.
One, the ICA report appeared a mere few weeks after President Barack Obama convened a meeting in December 2016 and tasked the intelligence agencies with looking into Russian involvement in the election. Experts say such a report would take several months, if not a year, to produce, but that it was submitted within weeks suggests political motivations and partisan conclusions.
Then there was the infamous, supposed Russian hacking of the DNC server. Here, Mueller in his report uses "qualified and vague language to describe key events, indicating that he (Mueller) and his investigators do not actually know for certain whether Russian intelligence officers stole Democratic Party emails, or how those emails were transferred to WikiLeaks."
Further, strikingly (and damningly) it is revealed that intelligence officials never examined the hacked DNC server themselves, but relied on a private contractor (with its own conflict-of-interest issues) hired by the DNC to examine and provide the central argument of Russian hacking.
Also, Mueller never interviewed a key player in this: Julian Assange of WikiLeaks, who released the emails but who has asserted that Russia wasn't his source.
Further, according to the RealClear investigation, Mueller "falls far short" of proving that the Russian social media campaign was sophisticated and far-reaching.
In reality, it amounted to Amateur City — $100,000 worth of Facebook ads purchased between 2015 and 2017 and a Russian-funded organization IRA (Internet Research Agency LLC) that organized rallies in the U.S. posing as grassroots activists. The latter was crucially not found to have direct links to the Russian government, and further, according to The Daily Beast, the rallies were too thinly attended to be really effective.
Also, as we now know from the book "Shattered" by journalists Jonathan Allen and Amie Parnes, the blame-shifting and scapegoating began the day after Election Day in 2016.
"Within 24 hours of her (Hillary Clinton's) concession speech, campaign manager Robby Mook and campaign chair John Podesta assembled ... to engineer the case that the election wasn't entirely on the up-and-up. ... They went over the script they would pitch to the press and the public. Already, Russian hacking was the centerpiece of the argument."
It was then blown to crazy proportions by the left and the national left-leaning media outlets (CNN, MSNBC, The Washington Post, The New York Times) to fit their agendas and narratives.
Unfortunately, legacy media outlets abandoned their investigative duties because they'd become part of the Resistance.
It looks increasingly like the whole Russia affair — collusion, Russian meddling — was a face-saver, a scapegoat, and a giant pacifier for the hysterical left, who couldn't deal with the most stunning election loss in recent history.
But sadly it ended up hurting and diminishing many institutions: the FBI, the intelligence agencies, prestigious national media outlets.
Most importantly, it prevented the Democratic Party, after its election loss, from some serious soul-searching and self-correction.

Planned Parenthood cares little about women's health

Texto completo: There are public relations problems and there are public relations crises. Then there is what Planned Parenthood is experiencing with the departure of its former president, Dr. Leana Wen.
Wen, the first doctor to run the abortion chain in nearly five decades, is not going quietly into the night. Rather, she is essentially blowing the whistle on the organization on her way out the door, making her the most senior staff member ever to publicly duke it out with the billion dollar behemoth.
Wen smartly got ahead of the narrative, laying down rhetorical stakes in a tweet immediately after news broke of her firing. She and Planned Parenthood had "philosophical differences." She wanted Planned Parenthood to prioritize women's health. The board did not.
In a piece for the Sunday pages of The New York Times, Wen expanded on what she meant by women's health. Planned Parenthood has a duty, she argued, "to increase care for women before, during and after pregnancies," care such as mental health care for women suffering from postpartum depression or treatment for pregnant women struggling with addiction. Though I am an ardent anti-abortion activist, I found myself admiring Wen for what is clearly a genuine commitment to providing care and treatment to women as a whole.
Here's why I also admire Wen. As she makes clear, the board that hired her tasked her with refashioning the organization – beleaguered by things like prior President Cecile Richards' highly publicized admission that Planned Parenthood doesn't offer mammograms, or campaigns catching them offering ultrasounds only to confirm fetal gestational age for an abortion – as one that is about women's health, not just abortion advocacy.
With a wink and nod of course.
No doubt what the board really meant was Wen should pretend Planned Parenthood cares about the full spectrum of women's health, not actually start implementing programs that amounted to "mission creep," as anonymous staff called it in The Times. Board members wanted to use Wen's medical credentials and passion for women's health care to prop up the sagging myth that Planned Parenthood is more than just the most well-oiled abortion lobbying machine in the world. No doubt Wen figured it out, and refused to play along.
Then came the biggest legal and financial blow dealt to Planned Parenthood perhaps ever. Undoubtedly, it was expecting the new regulation from the Department of Health and Human Services requiring family planning clinics that receive taxpayer dollars not to promote abortion as a method of family planning to be struck down in court. Shockingly, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the rule, meaning that tens of millions of Planned Parenthood dollars, in addition to its entire business model, are now on the line.
The day after the Trump administration announced it would begin enforcing the rule immediately, Wen was out.
Coincidence? Hardly.
Wen's departure has left Planned Parenthood perhaps more exposed than ever. She didn't just ding the organization for failing to prioritize women's health. She irreversibly exploded the myth that comprehensive women's health is something it cares about. The proof is Planned Parenthood's willingness to take the extreme public heat for firing a passionate young doctor, and a minority immigrant at that, eight months into the job because the board so badly wants to protect access to abortion and little else. That board members were OK with being exposed as a pure political advocacy group despite the public relations toll it would bear belies just how extreme they have become.

Britain's New Commons Leader Issues Very Strict Rules. Oops.

Texto completo: LONDON -- In one of his first acts as the leader of Britain's House of Commons, Jacob Rees-Mogg this past week laid down a few rules for written communication by civil servants who work in his office.
"Non-titled males" must be addressed as "Esq." All measurements should be imperial, not metric. Two spaces should follow a period. And 18 words or phrases, including "very," "got," "ongoing," "equal," "unacceptable" and "I am pleased to learn" were now banned.
His memo made its way to the broadcaster ITV, which published excerpts on Friday, prompting a wave of grammatical discussion and political mockery that had yet to subside a day later.
Leader of the House is Mr. Rees-Mogg's first cabinet-level position, as part of the team of hard-line Brexit enthusiasts appointed this past week by Britain's new prime minister, Boris Johnson. But this latest controversy is far from Mr. Rees-Mogg's first time as a social-media sensation.
[Read The Times's profile of Mr. Rees-Mogg.]
His side-parted hair, his languid speaking style and his baggy double-breasted suits give Mr. Rees-Mogg, a longtime lawmaker, an incongruously prewar air, observers say. His studied eccentricities have inspired memes, online quizzes and T-shirts. For many on the left, however, his highly conservative views on topics including welfare, climate change and abortion are beyond a joke.
And in the years since Britain voted to withdraw from the European Union, Mr. Rees-Mogg, the chairman of a caucus of euroskeptic legislators, has become a force to be reckoned with. His name even came up among possible successors to Theresa May, when the previous prime minister's Brexit plan began to unravel in Parliament.
In November, after Mr. Rees-Mogg called for Mrs. May to resign, the prospect of his moving closer to power prompted Twitter users to shower him with very British insults. This spring, he capitalized on his growing fame by publishing a volume of history, "The Victorians," to savage reviews.
Mr. Rees-Mogg has told The New York Times that journalists typically write about him when they have nothing else to report. That may soon change: Mr. Johnson has promised to achieve Brexit by Oct. 31, with or without an agreement, and his House leader will have to pilot the required legislation through a Parliament that has repeatedly voted to oppose no-deal Brexit.
For now, Mr. Rees-Mogg's style rules made at least one front page, that of The Daily Telegraph, and the top of the most-read list on The Guardian's website.
He was not the only new minister to issue stringent rules. The new transport secretary, Grant Shapps, who once declared on Twitter that he had read the entire 585-page Brexit withdrawal document in one sitting, sent an email to staff limiting submissions to two pages, The Yorkshire Post reported.
New ministers in previous administrations have issued eyebrow-raising demands, too. Liam Byrne, a Treasury official under a previous Labour government, found himself a subject of mockery after a memo specifying a font size for briefing documents and a schedule for bringing him soup and coffee.
Britain standardized a set of imperial measurements in the 19th century, and some remain in use in a few countries, mostly its former colonies, alongside the related set of customary measurements codified in the United States. But Britain has moved toward the metric system for most purposes in recent decades.
Since 1995, British stores have been legally required to use the metric system for most weights and volumes, a decision that remains a sore point for some euroskeptics like Mr. Rees-Mogg.
Shopkeepers who were fined for refusing to use the new system became known as "metric martyrs," and euroskeptics have campaigned for them to receive a royal pardon.

Texto completo: I remain gobsmacked by the cognitive dissonance of Trump supporters. They say they don't like his disgusting behavior (though they seem to agree with his racism), but do like his accomplishments. What exactly has he accomplished?
Draining the swamp -- "only the best people"?
He appoints lobbyists from industries who are now supposed to regulate those same industries, hastening economic and environmental collapse, not to mention corruption on a grand scale.
Foreign policy? He makes love to dictators, distancing us from our real allies and inches toward new wars.
The economy? If you like working for $40 an hour or own lots of stocks, you like it, otherwise, meh.
His brutal immigration actions are international disgraces.
Therefore, his overall accomplishments are a "bigly" less than zero.
His rallies look more and more like those of Nuremberg in the 1930s (after Hitler came to power), with hateful chanting designed to incite his adoring base by justifying their anger, envy, ignorance and plain nastiness. Read "Donald Trump Hates America" by David Brooks (July 18, New York Times), or remember Lindsey Graham accurately saying "Donald Trump is a race-baiting, xenophobic religious bigot."
Thoughtful voters will recognize that the Republican Party cares nothing about governing, as it more resembles a terrorist group pushing the country toward a fascistic autocracy.
Since they so clearly hate America, Trump supporters should be sent back to countries with ideologies similar to their own. Let Trump develop North Korean beaches, for example, so his followers have nice new golf courses and houses.

Rich Lowry: ‘Cosmopolitan’ is a perfectly fine word for cosmopolitans

Texto completo: Missouri Republican senator Josh Hawley used a perfectly good word in its appropriate context, and stands accused of dog-whistle bigotry.
<img class="size-medium wp-image-2599038" src="https://i0.wp.com/multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2019/02/Rich-Lowry-Color.jpg?resize=300%2C293&ssl=1" alt="" width="300" height="293" data-recalc-dims="1" />
At the National Conservatism conference in Washington, D.C., last week, Hawley gave a keynote address that attacked the coastal elite for being out of touch and out of sympathy with the heartland. He called it “the cosmopolitan elite,” described its beliefs as the “cosmopolitan consensus,” and accused it of building a “cosmopolitan economy.”
Even though there is not a remotely plausible argument that Hawley was in any way targeting Jews, his use of the C-word alone was enough for critics to say he was making an anti-Semitic appeal.
“If you’re Jewish and the use of ‘cosmopolitan’ doesn’t scare you, read some history,” warned New York Times op-ed writer Paul Krugman. A columnist for the St. Louis Post-Dispatch opined, darkly, that Hawley “chose the word purposefully” (he had, just not in a sinister way). James Fallows of The Atlantic agreed that Hawley knew “*exactly* the implications of ‘cosmopolitan.'”
There’s no doubt that the word has been abused for hideous ends. In 1946, Joseph Stalin gave a speech heralding the repression of Jews in the arts and literature that lamented, “The positive Soviet hero is derided and inferior before all things foreign and cosmopolitanism that we all fought against from the time of Lenin, characteristic of the political leftovers, is many times applauded.”
Yet, the connection between Hawley, the overachieving 39-year-old former Supreme Court law clerk and attorney general of the state of Missouri, and the cruel, power-hungry Marxist-Leninist dictator who is one of history’s great monsters … is not obvious.
The word has also been used to target Jews by other anti-Semitic lowlifes and haters, although it is a smear to mention Hawley, who gladly and forthrightly denounces anti-Semitism, in the same breath as these cretins.
Why resort to the word at all? The axis of the culture war in this country has shifted to national identity, immigration policy, and citizenship, and requires a new vocabulary. The welcome effort to rehabilitate the word “nationalism,” one goal of the National Conservatism Conference, is part of this re-orientation. But there also has to be a term for what the nationalists oppose, since Big Government and social liberalism aren’t apt.
Cosmopolitanism is the natural choice. Per the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, the word “has been used to describe a wide variety of important views in moral and socio-political philosophy. The nebulous core shared by all cosmopolitan views is the idea that all human beings, regardless of their political affiliation, are (or can and should be) citizens in a single community.”
If the word is inherently a hateful term of opprobrium, it’s strange that it is embraced by people who hold the worldview it describes.
According to the NYU professor Kwame Anthony Appiah, our challenge “is to take minds and hearts formed over the long millennia of living in local troops and equip them with ideas and institutions that will allow us to live together as the global tribe we have become.”
What should we call this project? He considers the possibility of “globalization” and “multiculturalism” as terms, but settles on “cosmopolitanism.” Indeed, the title of his book is “Cosmopolitanism: Ethics in a World of Strangers.”
All sorts of academics routinely use the term, including in the titles and subtitles of books, since it is so useful in describing a mindset and philosophy.
Hawley’s speech isn’t immune from criticism. It is overly reductive to suggest all — or even most — of our problems stem from the disconnect between the coasts and the middle of the country. And filling out a plausible policy agenda to give expression to Hawley’s worldview is very much a work in progress. But his speech should be considered a conversation starter. By focusing on one allegedly forbidden word, his critics hope, as always, to be conversation stoppers.

Texto completo: "Knowing the need and demand, we're expecting Kentucky will be one of those states where we see a pretty large influx of patients,"
Allison Berry, Nurx company spokeswoman
LEXINGTON, Ky. – A growing number of companies that sell birth control online and deliver it to doorsteps are operating in Kentucky, a trend that advocates say is enhancing the availability of reproductive health care in underserved areas of the country.
Nurx, a San Francisco-based health technology company founded in 2016, is the latest company to provide an array of prescription contraceptive options and sexually-transmitted infection testing kits for purchase on its website or using a mobile app, including birth control pills, patches and rings, the emergency contraceptive Plan B, Human Papillomavirus testing kits, and PrEP, a pre-exposure prophylaxis to prevent HIV infection.
Other companies include HeyDoctor, Lemonaid, and The Pill Club.
In the last three years, Nurx has prescribed birth control to more than 400,000 women, 40% of whom live in the southern states including Alabama, Texas, Tennessee and Virginia, a company spokeswoman said. On July 23, Kentucky became the 26th state where Nurx services are offered.
Close to 20 million women nationwide, and nearly 265,000 women in Kentucky live in contraceptive deserts, which means they don't have reasonable access to the full range of reproductive health options, according to Power to Decide, a reproductive health care rights advocacy group. Typically what's considered reasonable is one health care provider for every 1,000 women.
Almost 100,000 Kentucky women live in a county with no reproductive health care clinics. That's why Nurx CEO Varsha Rao thinks her company's services are "well-suited to reach people in Kentucky whose needs aren't currently being met by the health care system."
"Knowing the need and demand, we're expecting Kentucky will be one of those states where we see a pretty large influx of patients," company spokeswoman Allison Berry said.
In recent years, Kentucky has been home to some of the country's highest teen birth rates, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and swelling numbers of people infected with sexually-transmitted diseases, including HPV and chlamydia. In rural Kentucky, where reproductive health care clinics and providers are more sparse, distance and stigma can play factors in general prescription accessibility, said Marcie Crim, executive director for the Kentucky Health Justice Network.
"If you feel as if you have no privacy in your own community when it comes to making decisions about your body, then having a way to be able to do that can empower people in ways most people don't understand," said Crim, whose organization also helps operate All Access EKY, which connects women with local contraceptive and abortion services in 10 Eastern Kentucky counties.
Through a remote telemedicine messaging consultation with a licensed health care provider – if using a smartphone, that could mean texting with a physician and answering a series of health-related questions – and by uploading a copy of one's ID, eligible patients can pay out of pocket or use insurance to get reproductive products mailed to their home. That includes children as young as 13 years old, according to Nurx's Terms and Conditions.
If a Nurx patient needs medical attention or is interested in something it doesn't offer such as an IUD, because the contraceptive devices have to be implanted, the company tries to coordinate with local providers for a "soft patient handoff," said Berry.
The fledgling prescription-by-mail company, referred to by some as the "Uber for birth control," because its pills can be ordered using a smartphone app, came under fire earlier this year after a New York Times article detailed questionable company practices, including allowing non-licensed employees to handle and mail birth control pills. New company leadership later apologized for the incident.
The use of telemedicine – often a face-to-face consultation via computer with a licensed physician or nurse practitioner – isn't new, but companies that provide doorstep prescriptions are. Circumventing the traditional steps of setting up a doctor's visit and filling a prescription at a nearby pharmacy can save time and money, but the accelerated approach of companies like Nurx can increase the potential for cutting corners, some critics have said.
"Anything that makes it easier for people to decide their own future in terms of health care, their family, whether or not to have a child or a family now or later, anything that gives people the power to make that decision and see it through is fantastic," she said.
"Knowing the need and demand, we're expecting Kentucky will be one of those states where we see a pretty large influx of patients,"

Texto completo: What's on TV
SHARE 10 p.m. on HBO. This feature debut from the writer-director Pippa Bianco is an unflinching look at sexual assault in the digital age. The film opens with a 16-year-old, Mandy (Rhianne Barreto), waking up on her front lawn after a night of partying, not sure how she got there. In the morning, she receives a barrage of text massages from friends alerting her to a grainy video that's been circulating. It shows Mandy lying on the floor unconscious, while her crush (Nicholas Galitzine) removes her clothes. But it's what the video doesn't show that propels the film, as Mandy works to uncover the truth, growing more isolated in the process. "Bianco uses a depressingly familiar story of high-school partying gone wrong to explore sometimes uncomfortable questions about gender, agency and collective guilt," Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times. The film joins "The Tale" and the gritty teen drama "Euphoria" in HBO's catalog of female-led stories about sexual assault, anxiety and the unreliability of memory.
WILD CITY: SINGAPORE 9 p.m. on BBC America. David Attenborough narrates this exploration into Singapore's diverse animal and plant life, which coexist in the city's urban sprawl.
What's Streaming
WIDOWS (2018) Stream on HBO platforms. This star-packed crime drama follows Veronica (Viola Davis) after her husband, Harry (Liam Neeson), dies in the process of stealing $ 2 million from a local crime boss, losing the money in the process. After the mobsters Harry stole from (Brian Tyree Henry and Daniel Kaluuya) come to collect, Veronica recruits the widows of some of Harry's former accomplices to help her pull a $ 5 million heist, one outlined in notes Harry left behind. Veronica's co-conspirators, played by Michelle Rodriguez, Elizabeth Debicki and Cynthia Erivo, "join up, not out of any sense of outlaw glamour but out of raw need -- for money, for security, for revenge," A.O. Scott wrote in his review in The Times. The film's director, Steve McQueen, teamed up with Gillian Flynn to write the script, and although it may not be as fun as other female-led crime capers like "Ocean's 8" or "The Hustle," there's "plenty of mayhem and a plot that twists, buckles and swerves," Scott writes.
A VIGILANTE (2019) Stream on Amazon; Rent on Amazon, Google Play, Vudu and YouTube. Olivia Wilde may be best known for her work in mumblecore comedies like "Drinking Buddies" or "Book Smart," her directorial debut and a New York Times Critic's Pick. But in this film, written and directed by Sarah Daggar-Nickson, she plays a much more serious role as Sadie, a woman who, after fleeing her own husband, aids other abuse victims by seeking revenge on their abusers. While most of the film focuses on other women, Sadie's back story and motive becomes clearer by the end. "Whether Sadie's embrace of vengeance is a radical form of therapy, an act of extreme political activism or just a dangerous way to exorcise personal demons remains open to interpretation," Manohla Dargis wrote in her review for The Times.

Ba-dum dumb, sheesh!

Texto completo: "In order to meet my bills, I had to make my wife my secretary," President Harry S. Truman told a press gaggle at the White House in 1945. "She had to work all the time in the public interest, instead of keeping house. I didn't like it!"
Laughter ensued, per the transcript. The husband of Bess Truman was a popular guy at the time.
Former congressman Beto O'Rourke, who aspires to the same office as Truman, attempted a wife joke of his own on the campaign trail. He ended up demonstrating how low the genre has fallen in public esteem.
"I just had a call from my wife, Amy, who's back in El Paso, Texas," O'Rourke said at a coffee shop in Keokuk, Iowa, in March. "She is raising, sometimes with my help [rimshot here], Ulysses, who's 12 years old, Molly, who is 10, and her little brother Henry, who is 8 years old."
The joke went over fine in the coffee shop but tanked with the country at large. What is funny about the unfair division of parenting labor? What female politician could poke fun at her absentee parenting? Critiques of the joke spread virally online, inspired analyses in this newspaper, the New York Times and CNN about O'Rourke's gender assumptions and finally forced him to apologize. His bid for the Democratic presidential nomination now appears to be collapsing.
That is not necessarily the fault of a bad wife joke, but the backlash didn't help. And it goes to show how thoroughly the national conversation about gender bias has upended the political landscape. For decades, male politicians have lightened up their speeches and humanized themselves by making cracks about their wives. This may be the election cycle that kills the routine.
"I'd give the same advice to any husband about to make a joke about his wife, whether president or not: Proceed with caution," said Mark Katz, who wrote speeches and the occasional wife joke for President Bill Clinton. "It's tricky now, when people are reconsidering our shared assumptions about sex roles."
Even a cursory look at presidential transcripts archived by the University of California at Santa Barbara's American Presidency Project reveals a lot of assumptions to reconsider.
"I do not think it altogether inappropriate to introduce myself to this audience," President John F. Kennedy told reporters on an overseas trip with his wife in 1961. "I am the man who accompanied Jacqueline Kennedy to Paris, and I have enjoyed it."
This seemed like a cute line then. Or is it more like patronizing? Jacqueline may have been the talk of Paris that day, but everyone knew who the trip was really about.
Kennedy's 58-year-old joke still echoes in the humor of two men running this cycle: President Trump and former vice president Joe Biden, who is leading the Democratic field to challenge him.
"We have our own Jackie O. today," Trump told Fox News in June. "It's called Melania. Melania. We'll call it Melania T., okay?"
Biden is less literal. "I'm known as Jill Biden's husband, and I'm proud of that," he said in Chicago last month. Just the man who accompanies. At another point in the speech, Biden expanded his humor to the whole family: "We always have an expression: a son is a son until he gets a wife, a daughter is a daughter the rest of your life."
That's exactly the sort of thing Peter Glick, a social sciences professor at Lawrence University in Wisconsin who researches sexism, would put on what he calls the "BS scale."
In the 1990s, Glick and his colleague Susan Fiske of Princeton defined "benevolent sexism" to be a form that is not premised on tearing women down ("Take my wife, please!"), but on idealizing them - chaining them to pedestals to serve as moral examples for the men, who run around doing all the fun stuff.
"It's about men trying to humanize themselves and come off as humble and deficient. Like, 'boys are boys, and we need women to keep us in line, especially in a domestic realm," Glick said.
He finds this trope all over political speechmaking, and American culture generally, and he traces it back as far to the old Greek epics, full of adventurous men and doting maidens, like Odysseus and his famously faithful and patient wife Penelope.
You might detect a whiff of Odysseus in Mike Huckabee, for example, who was asked at a Republican presidential debate last cycle which woman he would like to see on a $10 bill.
"That's an easy one. I'd put my wife on there," Huckabee said, to laughter. "I've been married to her 41 years. She's fought cancer and lived through it. She's raised three kids, five great grandkids, and she's put up with me. I mean, who else could possibly be on that money other than my wife? And that way, she could spend her own money with her face."
This kind of thinking isn't just in jokes: When the New York Times asked the 2020 candidates to name their personal hero, a quarter of the men running for president this year chose their wives.
Certain presidents told more wife jokes than others. "As I often say," Richard Nixon told an audience in St. Joseph, Mo., when he was vice president, "I know you don't want to see me but you do want to see Pat, my wife." He told many more in that vein, for years, until the latter days of his doomed presidency, when he sometimes complained Pat Nixon got better press then he did.
Bill Clinton told a few. One was actually a video skit that Katz, the speechwriter, co-wrote during the Clintons' final weeks in office in 2000, playing on the idea of a lame-duck president with nothing to do. It features the home-alone president chasing after Hillary Clinton's car, holding a brown paper bag, yelling, "Wait, wait, wait! You forgot your lunch!"
"It's a complete role reversal," said Katz. "It worked, and no one said anything. It's a good question to ask how it would be received today."
Barack Obama made wife jokes all the time, often employing the naggy wife trope, which is popular in the genre.
"During the course of this campaign, we've all learned what my wife reminds me of all the time - that I am not a perfect man," he said at a rally in 2008.
"In my house if I said, you know, Michelle, honey, we got to cut back, so we're going to have you stop shopping completely - you can't buy shoes, you can't buy dresses - but I'm keeping my golf clubs [laughter], you know, that wouldn't go over so well," he told a Minnesota town hall in 2011.
That same afternoon, after a short plane ride to Decorah, Iowa, he cracked: "I basically let Michelle have 90 percent of what she wants. But at a certain point, I have to draw the line and say, give me my little 10 percent."
Where Kennedy and Biden pretend to wilt in the shadow of their wives, Obama sounds like he needs a crisis hotline. (As of press time, reps for Trump and Obama did not respond to requests for comment. A spokesman for Biden declined to comment.)
David Litt, who wrote speeches for Obama's reelection campaign and in his second term, described the joke-writing process as about a dozen people in a room throwing ideas at the wall.
"There's no deep process to it," Litt said. "Every president has tried to balance being funny with being appropriate with their job - and you hope you get that right, and sometimes you don't."
"I think it is unquestionably good Democrats are recognizing sexism," he added. "What's generally useful to think about in comedy writing: Is there a kernel of truth in the joke, does it feel like a real relationship between two people?"
Meanwhile, out on the trail, comedy evolves. One of six women running for president in 2020, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, has been campaigning with a joke about her two marriages.
She told a town hall in June: "Never good when you have to number them."

Is a billionaire populist the right choice for Democrats?

Texto completo: These are strange times, as Democratic voters consider whether the best way to take on a billionaire populist is to nominate their own inexperienced billionaire populist.
The Democratic presidential primary now has its 25th candidate, with the late entry of Bay Area billionaire Tom Steyer, a climate-change and impeachment activist.
Steyer hasn’t made a dent in the polls, but his money could shake up the race given his intent to spend $100 million.
So far, Steyer’s entry has gone over like a lead balloon. “Interviews with Democratic senators and representatives revealed significant resentment toward Steyer for his practice of using his wealth to pressure lawmakers that have not advocated for impeaching President Trump,” reported the Free Beacon.
His ads targeting anti-impeachment Democrats, and slams against House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, haven’t made him many friends on the Left.
His personal wealth is an obstacle in a party that views billionaire financiers as a scourge. And his big-spending plans would find resistance with the broader electorate.
Steyer’s “Justice-Centered Climate Plan” might not go as far as the “Green New Deal,” but it’s estimated to boost government spending by $2.3 trillion — at a time when federal debt has soared to $22 trillion and both parties have agreed to obliterate spending caps.
Most observers view Steyer’s long-time environmental advocacy as sincere, but he has to deal with allegations of hypocrisy. The New York Times reported in 2014 that Steyer’s fund had “pumped hundreds of millions of dollars into companies that operate coal mines and coal-fired power plants from Indonesia to China, records and interviews show.” He has expressed regret for fossil-fuel investments, but it makes for bad optics among Democrats.
Other Democratic candidates are peeved at a billionaire buying his way into the presidential fray. “All campaigns should be grassroots funded in a primary,” said U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Massachusetts, who is polling in the top tier.
U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vermont, has likewise criticized the role of billionaires in the election process. Several left-leaning commentators have rolled their eyes at Steyer’s entry and have asked him to just go away.
On the good side, Steyer has taken shots at the socialistic ethic that is emerging on the Democratic left.
“Should we put a limit on what Beyoncé makes?” he asked the Guardian. “I don’t see why. I don’t think in the United States of America we should put a ceiling on how far people can go.”
He even took aim at Karl Marx. We’re dismayed that it’s even necessary to point out the flaws of Marxism in 2019, but we’ll take small victories when we get them.
In our view, the Democrats have their best chance of unseating Donald Trump by running mainstream moderate-to-liberal candidates who campaign on national unity rather than progressives who are intent on remaking the economy and ratcheting up federal spending. But that’s ultimately for their voters to decide.
Based on Democratic Party rules, however, Steyer needs a large base of small donors or decent poll numbers to make it onto the stage.
Despite our misgivings about Steyer’s candidacy, there’s nothing wrong with having a freewheeling election where the largest number of candidates pitch their ideas.
We wish Steyer and the other candidates were discussing better ideas, but that’s a discussion for another day.

Texto completo: Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes is reportedly helping regulators as they investigate whether the social media behemoth should be broken up for violating antitrust rules.
According to reports from The New York Times and The Washington Post, Hughes has met with the Department of Justice, the Federal Trade Commission and other agencies which are all interested in examining Facebook's market power. He is said to be working with antitrust academics Scott Hemphill from New York University and Tim Wu of Columbia University.
During the meetings with regulators, which Hughes attends alone, the former Facebook exec presented a 39-page slide deck outlining reasons why the social network should be broken up, reports the Times, including the fact that the company made "serial defensive acquisitions" to stomp out competition.
$5 billion FTC fine! Facebook must update and adopt new privacy, security measures
Co-living spaces: How millennials, Gen Z create affordable rent situations in big cities
This comes just months after the entrepreneur called the power of Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg "unprecedented and un-American" in an opinion piece published by the Times.
Hughes left the company more than a decade ago, but his insight could still be valuable for those who say Facebook is a competition-crushing monopoly.
The 35-year-old entrepreneur, who has publicly advocated for breaking up Facebook for a while, previously called out the company for becoming "too powerful" after acquiring Instagram and WhatsApp.
Wu called the acquisitions a “plain-vanilla violation of antitrust law, just low-hanging fruit," according to the Washington Post.
Gene Kimmelman, a senior adviser at the consumer group Public Knowledge, told the Times that a successful case against Facebook would have to demonstrate that economic harm was done as well as prove that the company intentionally bought competitors.
Facebook didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.
On Wednesday, Facebook separately announced that it was settling a record-breaking $5 billion fine with the FTC for violating consumer' privacy rights.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez met face-to-face Friday after weeks of public friction between the two high-profile Democrats.
"It went very well," Pelsoi said after the meeting.
When asked if she and Ocasio-Cortez resolved any of their differences, Pelosi replied, "we don't have that many differences. " The speaker wrote in a tweet later that the two met "to discuss working together to meet the needs of our districts and our country, fairness in our economy and diversity in our country. "
Speaking later Friday at her weekly press conference, Pelsoi expressed "some level of confidence, and actually joy" at the diversity of the House Democratic caucus and its ability to unify around issues.
"Ever since I came here, we have engaged in differences of opinion in our caucus, and that is a good thing," Pelosi said. "In our caucus, we have our differences. Respect that, instead of making a big issue of it. Respect that. "
The collegial tone after the meeting appears to be the latest iteration of the sometimes-contentious relationship between the speaker from California and the freshman lawmaker from New York, who has come to represent the progressive wing of the party. The two have have quibbled over both policies and tactics during their six months together in the House but recently appeared to unify after President Donald Trump made racist attacks against four minority members of Congress.
Budget deal: Donald Trump's budget deal with Democrats passes House but conservatives pan it as reckless
The pair condemned Trump’s tweets in which he told the four House Democrats, which included Ocasio-Cortez, to “go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came. ”
Pelosi said the tweets were “disgraceful and disgusting” and introduced a resolution to condemn the comments as racist.
But before Trump's attacks, signs of tensions between the two had been visible from the time of Ocasio-Cortez's congressional orientation, when she joined a climate protest outside Pelosi's office. And they continued as Ocasio-Cortez disagreed with the speaker's cautious approach to pursuing impeachment proceedings against Trump, while Pelosi offered lukewarm support for Ocasio-Cortez's Green New Deal.
Tensions appeared to boil over after Ocasio-Cortez and three other first-year congresswomen from the party's progressive wing were the only Democrats to vote against a version of a border funding bill that Pelosi promoted.
'45 is a puppet': Trump appears in front of altered presidential seal saying '45 is a puppet'
During an interview with New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd, Pelosi criticized Ocasio-Cortez, along with Reps. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan for voting against the bill.
"They didn’t have any following. They’re four people and that’s how many votes they got," Pelosi said.
That article prompted Ocasio-Cortez and her chief of staff to criticize Pelosi and centrist Democrats on social media. Pelosi then called out Ocasio-Cortez and the other three freshman congresswoman in a caucus meeting.
"You got a complaint? You come and talk to me about it," Pelosi said, according to a source in the room. "But do not tweet about our members and expect us to think that that is just OK. "
From impeachment to indictment: 5 repercussions from Robert Mueller's testimony
Ocasio-Cortez responded by saying it was “outright disrespectful” for Pelosi to repeatedly single out newly elected women of color, though she later tried to downplay any ill-will between herself and the speaker.
On Thursday, Pelosi minimized reports of strain in her relationship with Ocasio-Cortez, saying, “We’re good, we’re good. "
“I don’t think there are tensions," she said.
When asked about the meeting Wednesday, Ocasio-Cortez said, "I don’t think I have a strong message for her. "
Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif, views the meeting between Pelosi and Ocasio-Cortez as a further sign of de-escalation.
"The speaker is our coach and leader, and (Ocasio-Cortez) is a star recruit freshman who’s capable of big plays," he said, "so they should see that they both have a particular role to play on the team and ultimately the goal is for the team to win. "
Executions: Justice Department resumes capital punishment after nearly two decades, orders executions of five inmates
Norman Ornstein, a resident scholar for the American Enterprise Institute, said Trump's comments "actually brought Democrats together. "
"They felt under siege in a completely vile way and that created a commonality," he said. "It created an opening for a different kind of dialogue between the speaker and AOC. ”
Ornstein said the meeting is significant because "the speaker doesn’t meet individually with a lot of members on a regular basis because she has so many other things going on. "
When Pelosi was asked at her weekly press conference if she and Ocasio-Cortez had buried the hatchet, Pelsoi replied, "I don't think there ever was any hatchet. "

How Charter Schools Lost Their Shine

Texto completo: Charter schools were once hailed by supporters as a way to save public education in big urban districts. Founders presented them as a way to offer low-income minority families safe, orderly schools with rigorous academics, and they were embraced across the country as a hopeful alternative.
But charter school executives have recently started to acknowledge shortcomings, as questions about whether they are fulfilling their mission have mounted. Democratic presidential candidates have turned away from the charter movement. Last month, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said the New York State Legislature would not raise a cap on the number of charters in New York City, halting the growth of the model in the country's largest school system.
Eliza Shapiro, a New York City education reporter, and Dodai Stewart, deputy editor of the Metro desk, dialed into a conference call with New York Times subscribers on Thursday morning to discuss the backlash against charters. Ms. Shapiro discussed her recent article on the changing attitudes toward charter schools and what she discovered in her reporting. Read a lightly edited excerpt from their conversation, led by Ms. Stewart, here.
DODAI STEWART: How did this story come about and what was the reporting process like?

ELIZA SHAPIRO: I have been writing about charter schools in New York for the last six years. I had been hearing from some of my sources who run charter schools, work in charter schools, think about charter schools, that there had been sort of this sea change in how willing leaders of charters were to acknowledge shortcomings in their schools.
I decided to pick three charter networks: KIPP, which is a national network; Achievement First, which is a regional network; and Ascend, which is only in Brooklyn; and look at how those schools had been making changes in response to criticism from teachers, from parents, from students, and actually from elected officials all across New York.
When charters first came on the scene in New York, there was a lot of fanfare.
There was this pretty consistent narrative, at least in New York, that charter schools were saving public education; they were rescuing vulnerable kids. Then there was this tone shift to, "We're doing the best we can."
This had been stuff that had really been whispered about for years, but I felt only in the last few months was it really tumbling out into the open.
Discipline has always been central to the charter model, and maybe one of the biggest differences between a charter school and a regular public school. Why has that become such a big controversy?
Charters, at least in big cities, were created as alternatives to traditional district schools that parents often felt were unsafe. There was a real demand for schools, and there continues to be a huge demand for schools, that are more structured and are more rigid in their discipline. Schools in New York have gotten a lot safer since charters were opened in the late '90s.
But the question in the 20 years since has become: Has the focus on discipline gone too far? Is there a way that a school can be orderly without discipline that some stakeholders in the schools feel is punitive?
I was spending some time at a KIPP school in Harlem called KIPP Star. The principal of the middle school there is a black woman. We were talking about discipline. At this school, you have to wear your uniform shirt every single day. If you don't wear your specific uniform shirt, you get an infraction. There's a consequence. Basically, you get in trouble.
A kid came to her one day and said, "Listen, I know I've gotten in trouble for not wearing my uniform shirt every day, but my mom just started a new job. We don't have time to wash my one uniform shirt. That's the only shirt my mom can afford. Can you give me a break on this? We are struggling." This principal said, "Oh, my God. I realized we were punishing poverty." And very quickly, that specific rule was modified.

ABBAS KIAROSTAMI: A RETROSPECTIVE at IFC Center (July 26-Aug. 15). New York has been overdue for a posthumous Kiarostami retrospective: The great Iranian director died in 2016, and the last significant local showcase of his work was in 2013. This traveling series has all his major films and many of the rarities. His Koker trilogy, named for the Iranian village around which the three films from 1980s and '90s are set, will screen in new restorations (beginning with "Where Is the Friend's House," showing Friday through Monday and four times in August). Among the harder-to-find titles is "The Report" (on Sunday and Aug. 5, 8 and 10), which, according to the critic Jonathan Rosenbaum, Kiarostami essentially remade in his late-career masterpiece "Certified Copy" (which has seven screenings beginning on Monday).

MACHIKO KYO at the Metrograph (July 26-Aug. 1). This Lower East Side movie theater says it had planned to hold a series on Kyo -- a star of classics by Akira Kurosawa, Kenji Mizoguchi and Yasujiro Ozu -- even before her death in May. She can be seen here as a spectral, seductive noblewoman in Mizoguchi's "Ugetsu" (on Friday and Saturday); as an unmarried woman who scandalizes her village by returning home pregnant in "Older Brother, Younger Sister" (on Saturday and Sunday), one of many Mikio Naruse films that is unavailable on DVD or streaming platforms in the United States; and as the only woman to tell a version of the ever-shifting story in Kurosawa's "Rashomon" (on Sunday and Monday).

[Read about the events that our other critics have chosen for the week ahead.]
VERNEUIL POPULAIRE: VINTAGE THRILLERS FROM FRANCE'S GENRE MAESTRO at the Museum of the Moving Image (July 26-28). The museum makes the case for Henri Verneuil, a director whose genre work in France in the 1960s and '70s earned him dismissals from highbrow critics. For instance, of "The Burglars," showing on Sunday, Roger Greenspun wrote in The New York Times that "before a quarter of an hour has passed 'The Burglars' reveals itself as yet another international caper film -- this time, set in Greece -- that does nothing very well and almost everything in excess." But excess with Jean-Paul Belmondo, Dyan Cannon and Omar Sharif sounds pretty good today.

WE CAN'T EVEN: MILLENNIALS ON FILM at BAM Rose Cinemas (through Aug. 6). If baby boomers got "The Big Chill" and Generation X got "Reality Bites," millennials get ... the execrable Lindsay Lohan thriller "I Know Who Killed Me" (on Friday)? Some of us are not ready to reclaim that one yet. Fortunately, there are much better films in this showcase of the generation that op-ed pages love to harangue -- movies as different as Richard Linklater's decade-spanning "Boyhood" (on Saturday) and Céline Sciamma's French youth portrait "Girlhood" (on Saturday and Monday); Kenneth Lonergan's "Margaret" (on Sunday), a "teen epic" (his description) infused with post-Sept. 11 anxiety; and, from Greta Gerwig, comic portraits of high school and postgraduate uncertainty, "Lady Bird" and "Frances Ha" (both on Aug. 3).

Megan Rapinoe talks Trump, World Cup at Sonoma Valley summit

Texto completo: Megan Rapinoe scored big in Sonoma Valley earlier this week.
The fleet and outspoken soccer superstar spoke and posed with fans during and outside an invitation-only conference on mobile marketing that was headquartered at the Fairmont Sonoma Mission Inn & Spa.
Rapinoe, co-captain of the U.S. national team that on July 7 won the Women’s World Cup in France, was the “Inspirational Speaker” at the elite summit of the Mobile Marketing Association. Appearing in a post-dinner talk Sunday at Hanson of Sonoma Distillery, she engaged in conversation with interviewer Kara Swisher, the New York Times contributor and co-founder of Recode, the tech news website that earlier this year joined with Vox Media.
“It was phenomenal,” the Carneros distillery’s Scott Hanson said of the Rapinoe-Swisher talk before about 250 guests of the marketing group’s summit for chief executives and chief marketing officers. “They talked about a little of everything.”
The stage conversation followed a dinner held at Ceja Vineyards.
Hanson said Rapinoe did address her widely publicized spat with the Trump White House, which she famously declared her soccer team would not visit were it invited upon winning the World Cup.
The vodka-from-grapes distiller said Rapinoe told the crowd Sunday the conflict was old news when it broke, as she’d made the remark about the unlikelihood of a White House visit in January, months before the tournament.
After her remarks went viral, but still before the U.S. team’s triumph, Trump tweeted in response, “Megan should WIN first before she TALKS!”
On Sunday night at the Burndale Road distillery, Rapinoe also said something to the assembled tech company executives that she repeated to ESPN FC on Monday.
Recalled event host Hanson, “She said the publicity around it (the White House controversy) was a little bit disruptive but it also inspired them and it charged her up.”
In the interview with ESPN on Monday, the chameleon-haired soccer forward said, “If anything, it kind of united everyone around us and united the team sort of around itself.
“And it was kind of emboldening in a way.”
In the distillery talk to invitees, Rapinoe also touched on the quest to resolve the inequity between what professional male soccer players are paid — including those for the men’s national team — and what she and her teammates are paid.
Hanson said it impressed him that Rapinoe spoke without anger or bitterness.
“We were taken by her groundedness, and candor, and honesty,” he said. He added that he and his wife, Judy, spent some time with Rapinoe and found her delightfully personable.
“I enjoyed talking to her,” he said.
The soccer star made a big splash also when she dropped in hours before the talk at El Molino Central, the acclaimed Mexican restaurant in Boyes Hot Springs.

Texto completo: Months before Nancy Pelosi first became speaker of the House, she reflected on the battles she had to fight to achieve her position at the head of the Democratic House caucus. She had risen as something of an outsider in what she saw as a boys club, and it wasn’t always a pleasant experience. But she developed a reputation for toughness. As she said, “Anybody who’s ever dealt with me knows not to mess with me. ”
That was a dozen years ago. Today, in her dealings with the progressive collective dubbed “the Squad,” it is fair to ask where this pugnacious spirit has gone. Because Democratic Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts, Rashida Tlaib of Michigan and Ilhan Omar of Minnesota are definitely messing with her, as well as the Democratic Party. And Pelosi has yet to put them in their place.
Never have so few congressional newcomers been so influential. The four freshmen receive an unprecedented level of news media attention. Their comments are sought out on any number of major policy issues, far out of proportion to their experience, expertise or legislative record, which is basically nonexistent. And while most Americans probably have no idea who the House Democratic Whip is (it’s 26-year veteran James Clyburn of South Carolina), they have certainly heard of the Squad.
Opposing view: Ocasio-Cortez is right, Speaker Pelosi has a women of color problem
The Squad swept into Congress to promote a bold progressive agenda and make themselves President Donald Trump’s personal nightmare. But House newbies are not supposed to raise a ruckus. Their job, if they want to remain in what can be a lifetime perch, is to learn the folkways of the institution, build support networks with other members and the professional staff, and support the leadership agenda. The institutional ethos of Congress and American politics in general is one of dealmaking and compromise, not grand futile gestures.
Daughter of Congressman 'Big Tommy'
Nancy Pelosi understood this from a young age. Her father, Thomas “Big Tommy” D'Alesandro Jr. , served in Congress and later, as mayor of Baltimore in the 1950s, kept power through patronage, maintaining a “favor file” of people he had helped out, and from whom he expected loyalty. You don’t get in the favor file by being a constant source of embarrassment and disruption.
Pelosi has generally been dismissive of the Squad and their antics. She mocked the "Green New Deal" — a ridiculous initiative to ban the internal combustion engine and socialize the American economy — as “the green dream or whatever they call it. ” After the Squad loudly opposed a bipartisan, compromise border bill that the House leadership promoted, according to The New York Times, Pelosi said that "all these people have their public whatever and their Twitter world" but they don’t have votes.
And in Pelosi’s practical world, votes are how things get done. But the Squad is seemingly not interested in legislating and projects an image of a Democratic Party defined by sullen, brooding anger with no realistic programs and no sense of reasonable national priorities.
Members of Congress are also supposed to represent the interests of their constituents, something the members of the Squad have been slow to appreciate. They seem more interested in bending the arc of history (or some such nonsense) than taking care of the dinner table needs of the voters. Omar and Tlaib’s grandstanding push for boycotting Israel, which Rep. Brad Sherman, D-Calif. , called “dead on arrival,” does nothing to improve the lives of the people in Minnesota and Michigan. Their upcoming trip to the Jewish state will only exacerbate tensions between Jewish-American voters and the Democratic Party.
And when Amazon abandoned plans to build a major headquarters in New York City, Ocasio-Cortez exulted at the power of “dedicated, everyday New Yorkers & their neighbors” who “defeated Amazon’s corporate greed, its worker exploitation, and the power of the richest man in the world. ” But this was really the work of strident progressive activists; “everyday New Yorkers” just saw 25,000 jobs and $27 billion in revenue vanish.
Poor in the polls
This could be why some members of the Squad are extremely unpopular. A CBS/YouGov poll found that Ocasio-Cortez has a favorable rating of 23%, Omar 19%, Tlaib 18% and Pressley 17%. Democratic leaders also leaked a poll showing that the Squad is deeply unpopular in swing states, and that “socialism is toxic to these voters,” according to Axios. This was a shot across the bow, telling Squad members to shape up or face the consequences, either from Democratic primary challengers or in the general election.
Republican tip: I'm telling Democrats how to beat Trump in 2020. It's Job One so get over it.
But Pelosi has been remarkably ineffective in disciplining Squad members. She allowed a rebuke of Omar for anti-Semitic comments to be watered down. She has not stripped Squad members of important committee memberships, like Speaker John Boehner did back in 2012 when three freshmen Tea Party Republicans opposed him on a mere procedural measure.
And she has not forced a purge of troublesome staff members. In the wake of the border bill vote, Ocasio-Cortez's chief of staff, Saikat Chakrabarti, tweeted that the moderates who supported the speaker were akin to 1940s segregationist Democrats and were voting to “put kids in concentration camps. ” This sparked outrage in the caucus, and Chakrabarti deleted one of his offensive tweets. But how does someone that maladroit and confrontational still have a job? If Chakrabarti is still employed at the end of the week, it will be a signal that anything goes.
Pelosi’s meeting this week with Ocasio-Cortez is being treated by the news media as though it is a summit, as if they were peers. The very fact that a meeting between the speaker and a new member is considered newsworthy speaks to the Squad’s power, and they are well aware of it.
Their perspective on the liberal Democratic old guard was summed up by Omar: "We never need to ask for permission or wait for an invitation to lead. " One can’t imagine powerful Democratic old pols like Tip O’Neill, John McCormack or Sam Rayburn putting up with that kind of nonsense.
Pelosi needs to bring the gavel down on her meddlesome freshmen, and demonstrate that messing with her still has consequences. Or else she will ride out her remaining years as a much weaker speaker.

Aaron Rosand, 92, Legend Who Owned a Rare Violin

Texto completo: Aaron Rosand, a leading violinist who closed out an astonishingly long career with a dramatic, emotion-filled gesture, selling his beloved rare violin for some $ 10 million and donating $ 1.5 million of that to a music institute, died on July 9 in White Plains. He was 92.
His wife, Christina Khimm Rosand, said the cause was pneumonia. He lived in Scarsdale, N.Y.
Mr. Rosand made his orchestral debut with the Chicago Symphony when he was 10 and was still performing until just a few years ago. In the intervening years he was nothing if not consistent.
In 1948 The New York Times praised his debut recital at Town Hall in Manhattan, citing "a tone of unusual quality and a technique of near-perfection."
A half-century later, when he released a recording of Brahms and Beethoven concertos, the notices were much the same.
"Rosand has lost none of his fabled technique," Richard Dyer wrote in The Boston Globe in 1999, "and plays both pieces with secure intonation, a sound that grows ever sweeter as it ascends, a directly communicative warmth of feeling, and a swashbuckling dash that has always characterized his playing."
Mr. Rosand performed with major orchestras all over the world, for much of his career playing an instrument made in 1741 and known as the ex-Kochanski Guarneri del Gesù (because it was previously owned by Paul Kochanski, a Polish virtuoso, and was made by Giuseppe Guarneri, known as "del Gesù"). Mr. Rosand acquired the violin in 1957 for about $ 50,000, financed with a loan that he said took him about a decade to pay off.
That was the instrument he sold to a well-heeled Russian in 2009 for $ 10.1 million, thought to be a record for a violin at the time. He handed the instrument over in a London hotel suite.
"I just felt as if I left part of my body behind," Mr. Rosand told The Times shortly after. "It was my voice. It was my career."
He gave $ 1.5 million of the proceeds to the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia, from which he graduated in 1948 and where he taught for 38 years. But the gift was only part of his legacy, the institute said in a tribute on its website.
"Mr. Rosand's students," it said, "have won every major violin competition; can be found as concertmasters in top ensembles including the Metropolitan Opera, Saint Paul Chamber and National Symphony orchestras, Deutsche Oper Berlin, and the Royal Danish Opera Orchestra; and are themselves highly sought-after teachers."

Mr. Rosand was born Aaron Rosen on March 15, 1927, in Hammond, Ind. His father, Allen, and his mother, Ida (Rubin) Rosen, were both musically inclined; in a 2014 interview with violinist.com, Mr. Rosand said that when they met, his father was singing in a cabaret near Hammond and his mother was playing piano to accompany silent movies. They used to perform together and would take him along when he was a toddler. Once, when he was about 3, his father was to sing a Schubert lieder.
"I ran up to the stage and said, 'I want to sing, too!' " Mr. Rosand said. "To their amazement, I sang it in German." He had been listening to his parents practice.
"That's when they realized that maybe they had a musical monster on their hands," he said.
He took up the violin after the family had moved to Chicago, where he studied under Leon Sametini, a noted violin teacher, at the Chicago Musical College before taking his degree at Curtis.
Early on, Mr. Rosand developed a reputation for playing the somewhat out-of-fashion Romantic repertoire and for programming seldom-played composers like Jeno Hubay and Joseph Joachim. It was a trait that, as The Times put it in a 1982 article, "marked him as a specialist in the arcane and overly sentimental." Mr. Rosand, though, was unapologetic.
"If performing 'Romantically' means projecting yourself into the period in which the music was written," he said in an interview for that article, "and then injecting your own personality to show what that music means to you, then Romanticism is for me."
An early benefactor, the philanthropist Max Adler, supplied Mr. Rosand with a Stradivarius to play. But when Mr. Rosand began to date and then married the pianist Eileen Flissler early in his career, he said, it "did not sit very well with Mr. Adler, who felt that my total dedication must be to the violin."
"I suddenly found myself in New York without a violin, with a wife and no means of support," he said.
That led to his acquisition of the ex-Kochanski. Mr. Rosand struck up an arrangement with a New York violin dealer, Rembert Wurlitzer: Mr. Wurlitzer would lend him instruments to play in concerts, and, in exchange, Mr. Rosand would play those instruments in demonstrations for potential buyers.
"But there was one violin that he could never allow me to take out of the shop, and that was the 'Kochanski' Guarnerius," Mr. Rosand told violinist.com. It was kept at the shop by a private owner who was in failing health but would stop by once a week to visit it.
"I played on that violin in the shop," Mr. Rosand said, "and I realized that this is my voice."
When the instrument became available, he was given six months to raise the money to buy it.
He did that in part by taking a job at CBS, playing on radio shows. And, he said, there was the Chock Full o' Nuts connection. At the time, the brand was opening a lot of coffee shops, the Starbucks of the day.
"Those stores were like mushrooms," Mr. Rosand said. "They were all around New York, and then they came out with a stock, at $ 16. Whatever work I did, whatever money I had, I bought stock. Don't ask me why, I didn't know anything about stocks at that time, but I thought, every time you turn the corner, there's a new Chock Full o'Nuts, so I kept buying stock."
The stock price soared, and he used his shares as collateral for the loan that bought him the violin.
From 1962 to 1975, Mr. Rosand played that violin primarily for European audiences. He struggled to get top-notch engagements in the United States, something he later attributed in part to the violinist Isaac Stern, a power in the classical music world. In an eyebrow-raising essay he wrote for the music site Slipped Disc in 2014, Mr. Rosand recounted several instances in which he said Stern, who died in 2001, had sabotaged his career.
Stern, he wrote, objected that he had "gone commercial" in taking the CBS job. There was what seemed to be professional jealousy too, he wrote, as when Mr. Rosand played a Samuel Barber concerto with the New York Philharmonic under Leonard Bernstein in 1960. Mr. Rosand intended to record the piece with the orchestra a few weeks later.
"A fuming Isaac Stern was waiting in the wings when we walked offstage after the first performance," Mr. Rosand wrote. "He never shook my hand, grabbed Bernstein and took him to his dressing room. I walked out alone for the bows, and from then on Bernstein's attitude towards me changed."
Years later, he said, Bernstein told him that Stern "had threatened to cancel his five concerto recordings with the NY Philharmonic if he recorded the Barber concerto with me."
By the late 1970s, though, Mr. Rosand was performing more often with American orchestras, and in 1981 he joined the Curtis faculty.
Mr. Rosand also taught for years at the Summit Music Festival at Manhattanville College in Purchase, N.Y., where Christina Khimm Rosand, also a violinist, directs the festival's Aaron Rosand Intensive Violin Program.
Mr. Rosand's three previous marriages, to Ms. Flissler, Maree Macpherson and Monica Woo, ended in divorce. In addition to his wife, he is survived by three stepdaughters, Suzy Khimm Sarlin, Mia Khimm and, through his second marriage, Dierdre Regina Shula.
Mr. Rosand was known for being able to play dozens of pieces from memory. In the violinist.com interview, he was asked the benefits of memorizing a piece of music.
"I'll tell you in one word: heart," he said. "It's in your brain, it's in your heart."
His wife said that in his final days, when he was losing his ability to communicate, she played him a recording of his rendition of the Bach chaconne.
"I thought he was asleep," she said. But he surprised her.
"He said, 'Me playing,' " she said. "Those were the last words he spoke."

Texto completo: Vivid strands of wine-colored cabbage and rings of sangria-shaded onions brightening a salad.
Lilac-hued cauliflower elevating dishes formerly starring its paler cousin.
Grapes and figs the color of amethyst featured in drinks, jams and desserts.
Fruit salad dotted with berries, their skins such a deep purple that they look almost black.
These are just a few examples of the world of purple foods you can use to add color, texture and nutrients to your menu.
The dependable eggplant, long the star of Italian, Middle Eastern, vegetarian and other cuisines, brings a hearty meatiness to vegetable dishes.
The purple versions of asparagus, carrots and bell peppers can bring that extra pop of color to green vegetal dishes.
And the purple buds of the lavender plant can add a floral essence to drinks and desserts.
While you’re trying to maximize nutrition by “eating the rainbow,” don’t forget the purple.
It’s the featured hue in this week’s edition of our “Color Palate” series.
Making dishes that highlight purple foods can add vibrance, flavor and nutrition to your menu.
For example, you can substitute the purple versions of cauliflower, peppers, asparagus or cabbage in your existing recipes to add that extra big of eye appeal.
Here are a few recipes that will help put the color purple into your culinary life.
This recipe comes from The New York Times, and combines healthy greens with vibrant purple cabbage.
It can be served with rice, noodles or other grains.
Although this is a last-minute dish, the ingredients can be prepared hours before you cook it.
SPICY STIR-FRIED COLLARD GREENS WITH PURPLE CABBAGE
Makes 4 servings
Ingredients:
• 2 tablespoons Shao Hsing or other rice wine or dry sherry
• 2 tablespoons chicken broth, vegetable broth or water
• 1 tablespoon soy sauce
• 2 tablespoons peanut oil, rice bran oil or canola oil
• 2 teaspoons minced ginger
• 2 garlic cloves, minced
• 1/4 teaspoon ground toasted Sichuan pepper or red pepper flakes
• 2 cups shredded red or green cabbage
• 1 pound collard greens, stemmed and roughly chopped
• Salt to taste
Directions:
In a small bowl or measuring cup, combine the rice wine or sherry, the broth or water and the soy sauce. Have all the ingredients within arm’s reach from your pan.
Heat a 14-inch flat-bottomed wok or 12-inch steel skillet over high heat until a drop of water evaporates within a second or two when added to the pan.
Swirl in 1 tablespoon of the oil by adding it to the sides of the pan and swirling the pan, then add the garlic,
ginger and pepper and stir-fry for no more than 10 seconds.
Swirl in the remaining oil and add the cabbage and collard greens.
Turn the heat to high and stir-fry for 1 minute, or until the greens begin to wilt.
Add the salt, toss together and add the soy sauce mixture.
Stir-fry for 2 minutes, until the collard greens and cabbage are crisp-tender. Remove from the heat and serve.

Kilene Knitter, regional nutritionist for Giant Food Stores, recommends this eggplant parm salad recipe from Giant’s in-store food and nutrition magazine, Savory.
“I love it because it puts a summer spin on a traditional dish,” Knitter says in an email. “The flavors are light and fresh with eggplant being marinated and grilled instead of breaded and fried, plus it’s served on a bed of arugula with melted mozzarella and seasonal tomatoes.”
EGGPLANT PARM SALAD
Makes 4 servings
Ready in 15 minutes: 7 minutes prep time and 8 minutes cooking time
Ingredients:
• 2 medium eggplants
• 1/2 cup of your favorite Italian dressing, divided
• 2 plum tomatoes
• 1 cup shredded part-skim mozzarella cheese
• 1 (5-ounce) package arugula
• 2-ounce chunk Parmesan cheese
Directions:
Set grill to medium.
Thinly slice the eggplants into rounds. Place in a baking dish and add 1/4 cup Italian dressing.
Season with salt and pepper. Toss to coat.
Thinly slice the tomatoes. Grill the eggplants, covered, 3 to 4 minutes per side, until tender.
Top each with a slice of tomato and mozzarella. Cover and grill 1 minute until cheese melts. Remove from heat.
In a large bowl, toss the arugula with remaining 1/4 cup Italian dressing.
Divide among 4 plates.
Top with eggplant rounds. With a vegetable peeler, shave the Parmesan on top.

America’s Test Kitchen recommends topping your burgers with a different sort of condiment this summer: pickled red onion, made from onions that are actually purple in color.
A few minutes of preparation and a half-hour of brining turns onion slices into a vibrant accompaniment.
Look for a firm, dry onion with thin, shiny skin and a deep purple color.
(Pickled onions can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 1 week.)
QUICK-PICKLED PURPLE ONIONS
Makes about 1 cup
Ingredients:
• 1 cup red wine vinegar
• 1/3 cup sugar
• 1/4 teaspoon table salt
• 1 red onion, halved and sliced thin through root end
Directions:
Bring vinegar, sugar and salt to simmer in small saucepan over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until sugar has dissolved.
Off heat, stir in onion, cover and let cool to room temperature, about 1 hour. Serve.

Here’s a recipe for a dessert, dotted with shades of purple and reddish-purple, that comes from the North American Raspberry & Blackberry Association.
It’s adapted from a blueberry dessert recipe in The New York Times.
You can also use black raspberries in this recipe.
BLACKBERRY POLENTA UPSIDE-DOWN CAKE
Ingredients:

Dried purple figs dot this brunch dish that comes from the Valley Fig Growers, a California fig-growers cooperative that’s celebrating its 60th anniversary this year.
The dish serves a crowd, and can be customized with different types of sausage or cheese.
It can be served for brunch with an arugula salad, coffee and mimosas on the side.
BRUNCH STRATA WITH CALIFORNIA FIGS, SAUSAGE AND SAGE
Ingredients:
• 1 tablespoon olive oil
• 12 ounces cooked chicken apple sausage, halved lengthwise and cut diagonally into 1/2-inch slices
• 12 ounces crusty Italian or French bread, with crusts, cut or torn into 3/4-inch pieces (about 12 cups)
• 2 cups quartered (halved if small) dried figs, such as Blue Ribbon Orchard Choice or Sun-Maid California Figs, stems removed
• 4 ounces fresh goat cheese, crumbled (about 1 cup)
• 3 tablespoons chopped fresh sage leaves
• 7 large eggs
• 3 cups milk
• 3/4 teaspoon table salt
• 2 tablespoons chopped pecans
• Maple syrup, for serving (optional)
Directions:
In a medium skillet over medium-high heat, warm the oil. Add the sausage and cook, stirring occasionally, until browned, about 3 minutes.
Remove the skillet from the heat and set aside.
Spray a 2 1/2- to 3-quart casserole dish with nonstick cooking spray.
Arrange 1/3 of the bread in the dish. Top with 1/3 of the sausage, 1/3 of the figs, 1/3 of the cheese and 1/3 of the sage.
Repeat 2 times, making 3 layers. Set aside.
In a large bowl, whisk the eggs. Whisk in the milk and salt.
Pour the egg mixture over the casserole and set aside at room temperature for 20 minutes or covered in the refrigerator for as long as overnight.
(If refrigerated, return the casserole to room temperature before proceeding.)
Meanwhile, heat the oven to 350 F.
Cover the casserole loosely with foil and bake for 45 minutes.
Remove the foil, sprinkle the pecans on top, and continue baking until browned and a knife inserted in the center comes out only a little wet, 15 to 20 minutes.
Let the strata stand 10 minutes.
Serve warm, with maple syrup, if using, alongside.

Texto completo: La ciudad de Los Ángeles no había visto tal brutalidad en décadas: asesinatos con machetes, bates de béisbol, cuchillos, tubos de metal; pandilleros que torturan a sus víctimas hasta la muerte y luego les sacan el corazón.
El fiscal del gobierno federal asignado al distrito centro de California, Nick Hanah, reveló el pasado 16 de julio los atroces crímenes de la Clica Fulton, la fracción más violenta y numerosa de la pandilla MS-13, también conocida como la Mara Salvatrucha.
La acusación contra 22 miembros de la Clica Fulton enlista crímenes que van desde el vandalismo, el tráfico de drogas y la extorsión hasta el asesinato de siete personas, seis de los cuales eran inmigrantes. Todos han sido detenidos y se encuentran bajo custodia, reportó el diario The New York Times.
Las detenciones han sido resultado de más de un año de investigaciones que involucraron a agencias federales, estatales y locales.
“Ya hemos sacado de las calles a casi dos docenas de personas asociadas con el brazo más violento de la MS-13 en Los Ángeles, donde se cree que la pandilla asesinó a 24 personas en los últimos dos años”, dijo Hanah en un comunicado de prensa.
Al jurado, sin embargo, sólo se le presentaron los casos de siete víctimas de homicidio, reportó el diario citado.
Los pandilleros llevaban a sus víctimas al Bosque Nacional de Los Ángeles. En una ocasión, secuestraron a un miembro de otra pandilla y lo ahogaron, posteriormente lo llevaron al bosque y allí lo descuartizaron, le arrancaron el corazón con un machete y arrojaron sus restos a un barranco. Su crimen había sido rayar una pinta o grafiti de la Clica Fulton.
Para entrar a la pandilla, los posibles nuevos reclutas tenían que probar su valor asesinando a un enemigo o adversario de la MS-13 .
Aunque esto podía variar desde un miembro de otra pandilla hasta un indigente con la mala suerte de cruzarse en su camino, como sucedió con un hombre sin hogar que vivía en un parque “controlado por la pandilla”, dijo Hanah.
La mayoría, 19 de los 22, son inmigrantes indocumentados de entre 19 y 24 años y no tiene más de cinco años que llegaron al país. Recientemente, dijo el fiscal Hanah, la pandilla aumentó sus filas y su actividad criminal “con el flujo de jóvenes migrantes provenientes de Centroamérica”, reportó la cadena británica BBC Mundo.
“La mayor tragedia en estos casos es que estas jóvenes víctimas probablemente dejaron sus países de origen con la esperanza de que en los Estados Unidos encontrarían seguridad y prosperidad”, dijo la Fiscal del Distrito del Condado de Los Ángeles, Jackie Lacey.
“En cambio, estas víctimas tuvieron la desgracia de cruzar caminos con pandilleros violentos que se aprovecharon de las vulnerabilidades de su experiencia de inmigrante”.
Pero, a pesar del recrudecimiento de la violencia de pandillas como la Clica Fulton, en general, hay menos homicidios hoy Lós Ángeles que en la década de los años 90, cuando las pandillas dominaban, señaló a BBC Thom Mrozek, portavoz del Fiscal General del Departamento de Justicia para el distrito centro de California.

THURSDAY’S PAPER: Look for complete coverage in Thursday’s Dayton Daily News
WHAT TO LOOK FOR IN MUELLER TESTIMONY
Democrats want incriminating, hidden-till-now details about Donald Trump and Russia. Republicans want Robert Mueller to concede it was all a waste of time and money, if not an outright hoax.
Neither side is likely to get just what it wants Wednesday, but the former special counsel’s first open testimony on his investigation has Washington and the rest of the political world in a high state of anticipation just the same.
President Donald Trump speaks to reporters while meeting with Prime Minister Imran Khan of Pakistan in the Oval Office of the White House, in Washington, July 22, 2019. Ahead of speci­al couns­el Robert Mueller's testimony before Congress, Trump and his aides sought to dismiss the congressional hearings as nothing more than a desperate attempt to elicit from Mueller something that could justify impeachment proceedings.

Some things to look for when Mueller appears before the House intelligence and judiciary committees to answer questions about his investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election and possible cooperation with the Trump campaign.
OBSTRUCTION, OBSTRUCTION
Much of Mueller’s report focuses on the question of whether Trump obstructed justice, and Democrats on the Judiciary Committee say that’s where their attention will be, too. And for good reason: His report examines in blow-by-blow detail nearly a dozen episodes in which the new president sought to control the Russia probe, narrow its scope or even have investigators fired.
Democrats say they expect to draw Mueller out in several of these areas. They include his demands that then-White House Counsel Don McGahn press for Mueller’s firing and his push to have former Attorney General Jeff Sessions limit the investigation to future election interference rather than past conduct.
The afternoon session before the intelligence committee is likely to dwell more on Mueller’s investigation into whether the Trump campaign coordinated with Russia to sway the outcome. Mueller found insufficient evidence of a criminal conspiracy there, but did leave open the question of whether Trump illegally stymied the investigation.
MUELLER THE MARINE
Expecting Mueller to stray outside his report and drop scintillating details you’ve never heard before? Well, don’t.
Mueller, an ex-Marine with a famously taciturn style, never relished his congressional appearances in his 12 years as FBI director — and this will be no exception.
He cautioned lawmakers in May that he would not go beyond the pages of his report if called upon to testify. The Justice Department expects him to fulfill that commitment and to also steer clear of discussing the redacted portions of the report or the behavior of people who were investigated but not charged.

That means he’s unlikely to answer certain critical questions, including whether he would have recommended indicting Trump himself if Trump had not been president of the United States. That question matters since Mueller cited Justice Department legal opinions that say a sitting president cannot be charged in explaining his decision to not reach a conclusion on whether Trump had broken the law.
Mueller’s not one for hypotheticals, though, so it’s fair to assume he won’t engage Democrats on that one.
THE “SNITTY” LETTER
Mueller will almost certainly be pressed about tensions with Attorney General William Barr over the way his report was handled and how the Justice Department communicated its findings to the public, including the attorney general’s decision to exonerate the president even when the special counsel pointedly did not do so.
Mueller complained privately to Barr in March that the attorney general’s four-page letter summarizing the main findings of his report “did not fully capture the context, nature and substance of this office’s work and conclusions.” Barr, in turn, has called Mueller’s note “a bit snitty.”

Mueller has made clear he didn’t think it was appropriate to make a determination one way or the other about whether the president had committed a crime. He has rejected Barr’s assessment that the evidence couldn’t satisfy an obstruction of justice allegation, noting both in his report — and, again, in a public statement from the Justice Department podium — that if he had confidence the president had not committed a crime, he would have said so.
Barr had no such hesitation and has said Mueller shouldn’t have started investigating the president if he wasn’t prepared to reach a conclusion.
Mueller probably doesn’t want to extend a public war of words with Barr, a longtime friend and his former boss. But he’ll very likely be asked about the dispute, and he may have a hard time getting around it.
THE DOSSIER
Republicans aren’t likely to directly attack Mueller himself . The former special counsel is a decorated Vietnam War veteran who steered the FBI through the Sept. 11 attacks and was appointed by a Republican president to run the storied law enforcement agency.
But that doesn’t mean they won’t have areas to mine.
They’re likely to seize on the origins of the investigation and press Mueller on the extent to which the FBI, in the early weeks and months of its Russia probe, relied on information from a dossier of anti-Trump research paid for by Democrats. The Justice Department has acknowledged that the dossier helped form the basis of a secret surveillance warrant it obtained to monitor the communications of a Trump campaign aide, though the investigation had actually begun months earlier and was based on entirely separate allegations.

Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida, who serves on the Judiciary Committee, foreshadowed that line of attack Monday with a tweet that said: “We have to do more than just question Mueller. We have to expose his biased investigation.”
IMPEACHMENT SUPPORTERS WILL BE WATCHING
More than 85 House Democrats — around a third of the caucus — have declared their support for opening an impeachment inquiry, and those who are pushing impeachment are hoping there will be a flood of additional Democrats who side with them after Mueller’s hearing.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has said she doesn’t favor starting an impeachment process, for now, and would need a public groundswell to change her mind.
The House is scheduled to head out on a five-week recess next week, and reaction from constituents back home after the Mueller hearing will be crucial as Democrats decide how to proceed with their investigations of the president.

Texto completo: Megan Rapinoe scored big in Sonoma Valley earlier this week.
The fleet and outspoken soccer superstar spoke and posed with fans during and outside an invitation-only conference on mobile marketing that was headquartered at the Fairmont Sonoma Mission Inn & Spa.
Rapinoe, co-captain of the U.S. national team that on July 7 won the Women’s World Cup in France, was the “Inspirational Speaker” at the elite summit of the Mobile Marketing Association. Appearing in a post-dinner talk Sunday at Hanson of Sonoma Distillery, she engaged in conversation with interviewer Kara Swisher, the New York Times contributor and co-founder of Recode, the tech news website that earlier this year joined with Vox Media.
“It was phenomenal,” the Carneros distillery’s Scott Hanson said of the Rapinoe-Swisher talk before about 250 guests of the marketing group’s summit for chief executives and chief marketing officers. “They talked about a little of everything.”
The stage conversation followed a dinner held at Ceja Vineyards.
Hanson said Rapinoe did address her widely publicized spat with the Trump White House, which she famously declared her soccer team would not visit were it invited upon winning the World Cup.
The vodka-from-grapes distiller said Rapinoe told the crowd Sunday the conflict was old news when it broke, as she’d made the remark about the unlikelihood of a White House visit in January, months before the tournament.
After her remarks went viral, but still before the U.S. team’s triumph, Trump tweeted in response, “Megan should WIN first before she TALKS!”
On Sunday night at the Burndale Road distillery, Rapinoe also said something to the assembled tech company executives that she repeated to ESPN FC on Monday.
Recalled event host Hanson, “She said the publicity around it (the White House controversy) was a little bit disruptive but it also inspired them and it charged her up.”
In the interview with ESPN on Monday, the chameleon-haired soccer forward said, “If anything, it kind of united everyone around us and united the team sort of around itself.
“And it was kind of emboldening in a way.”
In the distillery talk to invitees, Rapinoe also touched on the quest to resolve the inequity between what professional male soccer players are paid — including those for the men’s national team — and what she and her teammates are paid.
Hanson said it impressed him that Rapinoe spoke without anger or bitterness.
“We were taken by her groundedness, and candor, and honesty,” he said. He added that he and his wife, Judy, spent some time with Rapinoe and found her delightfully personable.
“I enjoyed talking to her,” he said.
The soccer star made a big splash also when she dropped in hours before the talk at El Molino Central, the acclaimed Mexican restaurant in Boyes Hot Springs.

The border crisis has reached unprecedented levels

Texto completo: The crisis at our southern border shows no signs of slowing down, as the number of individuals attempting to cross our border illegally continues at a rapid pace. In May of this year, border patrol agents made 132,887 apprehensions. That is three times more than the same month in 2018, and nine times more than the same month in 2017. This has overwhelmed our system as our border patrol agents are overburdened and detention facilities are growing more crowded every day by individuals who have illegally crossed our border. The result has been both a border security crisis and a humanitarian crisis along our southern border.
How did we get here in the first place? Our broken immigration policy is primarily to blame. Central Americans, living in countries without the opportunities and freedoms we have in the U.S., want to come here for a better, more prosperous life. Due to our generous asylum laws, word has spread among citizens in Central America that if they can reach our soil, they can claim asylum and stay in the United States until their court hearing, in which a decision is made whether their asylum claim is legitimate. Because immigration judges are overwhelmed with backlogged cases, the court date is often years away. According to the administration, 90 percent of the asylum seekers fail to show up to their court date. There is currently a backlog of more than 875,000 immigration cases.
Asylum is meant to provide a safe haven for individuals fleeing persecution. It should be a last resort for those sincerely fearing for their lives – not be used as a free ticket into the United States for those who would simply prefer to live in our country. Under current law, those who want to live in the U.S. should go through the legal immigration process instead of falsely claiming asylum to get across the border, and those who want to legitimately claim asylum should do so at the ports of entry at our southern border.
President Trump's administration has recently taken steps to help stem the flow of illegal immigrants by issuing an interim rule that changes the process for those seeking asylum. Under the rule, migrants who enter through our southern border will be ineligible for asylum unless they apply for and are denied asylum in one of the countries they traveled through first.
It's not often that I agree with the New York Times, but a recent editorial declared that "The United States needs an immigration policy that combines border security, justice and humanity." I couldn't agree more. The status quo fails to protect our borders, fails to address the humanitarian crisis and fails to uphold legal immigration which is meant to meet our country's needs. The administration's rule is a good start, as is the border supplemental bill passed in June that provides $4.59 billion in additional funding to help improve the situation at the border. Additionally, the administration authorized the deployment of more troops to the border, for a total force of 6,600 who are tasked with providing support to Customs and Border Patrol. But these are only temporary patches and they don't address the entire problem.
Congress must take action if we are ever to find a long-term solution to strengthen our borders, fix the humanitarian crisis and make certain our legal immigration system is merit-based so we can adequately meet our workforce needs. We must do better, and I continue to stand ready to work with my colleagues – on both sides of the aisle – to fix the crisis once and for all.

Amid Industry Crisis, Bruising Fight Erupts Over City's Next Taxi Chief

Texto completo: [What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox. ]
For months, tensions have mounted between Mayor Bill de Blasio and the City Council over how to respond to a crisis in the taxi industry that has bankrupted hundreds of drivers and led thousands more to the brink of ruin.
The battle claimed a casualty late Monday: Mr. de Blasio withdrew his nominee for the next leader of the agency overseeing the industry. The move came just days after a contentious Council hearing in which some members accused the nominee, Jeffrey D. Roth, of sidestepping tough questions about the city's role in the crisis.
A mayoral spokesman described the delay as temporary, saying the administration planned to build support among Council members, who must approve the appointment, before resubmitting the nomination.
But it is extremely rare for a mayor to shelve an appointment, and opponents quickly declared victory.
"The stakes are too high, and the status quo is no longer acceptable," said Councilman Ritchie Torres, a Democrat from the Bronx who has been critical of the nomination.
The fight marked a sharp escalation in a debate that began after a New York Times series, published in May, detailed the financial devastation among drivers who took on massive debt under exploitative terms to buy taxi medallions, the city permits that allow drivers to own their own yellow cab.
Between 2002 and 2014, The Times reported, a handful of industry leaders artificially inflated medallion prices -- driving them up to more than $ 1 million -- and made huge profits by channeling thousands of purchasers into loans they could not afford. Prices then crashed, along with the life savings and futures of thousands of medallion owners.
Industry leaders denied any wrongdoing and blamed problems on the unexpected emergence of ride-hailing apps, such as Uber and Lyft.
The investigation also found that the city officials at the Taxi and Limousine Commission, the agency that oversees the industry, fed the frenzy by selling medallions at auctions and running advertisements saying medallions were "better than the stock market."
Some City Council members have called on the T.L.C. to acknowledge a role in the crisis and for the city to help bail out drivers. But the mayor does not support a bailout, saying it would be too expensive.
Mr. de Blasio's administration has begun enforcement proceedings against some of the taxi brokers who arranged medallion loans, arrested a debt collector, written new regulations, strengthened oversight of the industry, and waived up to $ 10 million in fees owed by drivers.
The mayor nominated Mr. Roth as Taxi and Limousine Commission chairman last month, citing his experience in the Army National Guard and in government, including two years as deputy commissioner for policy and external affairs at the T.L.C., after the crash in medallion prices.
"His depth of experience in city government will serve New Yorkers well as we continue to root out practices that prey on medallion owners, and help hardworking drivers feed their families," the mayor said.
The nomination got off to a good start when the Taxi Workers Alliance, a prominent group representing medallion owners as well as drivers for taxi fleets, issued a statement praising Mr. Roth as sharp and engaging.
But at the confirmation hearing last week, problems quickly emerged during questioning about the possibility of a bailout, among other topics.
The council speaker, Corey Johnson, began the questioning by asking Mr. Roth to apologize, on behalf of the T.L.C., to medallion owners for the inflation of medallion values.
Mr. Roth turned to medallion owners in the audience and said, "My pledge to you is knowing there is suffering, I will work every single day to work with you, to work with the City Council, to find ways to alleviate suffering wherever possible."
"But do you think that the T.L.C. leadership should apologize?" Mr. Johnson asked.
"Whether or not the T.L.C. leadership should apologize, I don't know," Mr. Roth said. "I know moving forward, I look forward to working with driver groups to see how we can rectify this."
"I think the T.L.C. should apologize," Mr. Johnson said.
Later, Mr. Johnson asked four times if the T.L.C. had properly regulated the medallion market before Mr. Roth conceded it had not. Then, after the nominee sidestepped multiple questions about legislation that the Council had drafted in response to the crisis, the speaker paused, dropped his head in his hands and groaned into his microphone.
"We need more specifics here today," he said. "We need to be more specific, given the crisis that we're facing."
After the hearing, another councilman, Mark Treyger, a Democrat from Brooklyn, said the day had left more questions than answers.
Even Bhairavi Desai, founder of the Taxi Workers Alliance, which had praised Mr. Roth, criticized his appearance, saying the mayor should have let him speak more freely.
The Council then scrapped a vote that had been planned for Tuesday, leaving little time before the nomination was going to expire on Friday.
The mayor's decision means the acting director of the T.L.C., Bill Heinzen, will remain in place for now. Mr. Heinzen also has a rocky relationship with the City Council after a contentious hearing last month.
On Tuesday, the mayor's office declined to say when it would resubmit Mr. Roth's nomination, and the City Council declined to say whether it would consider the nomination. Still, a spokeswoman for Mr. de Blasio expressed confidence in the selection.
"We still believe this is the best man for the job," said the spokeswoman, Freddi Goldstein. "And I think if we work with the Council a bit longer, then they will see that."

Texto completo: This review of "The Great Hack" is the first article that I've felt mildly concerned about emailing to my editors. Why am I even using the internet? Why is Twitter open on another tab? Wouldn't it be smarter to disconnect, move to the woods and live off the land?
These are some of the questions inspired by the movie, an eye-opening new documentary from Jehane Noujaim ("Control Room") and Karim Amer that explores how our personal data has become a commodity that is collected, analyzed and then spit back at us in the form of targeted messaging, with the hope of changing our behavior, as one of the movie's subjects puts it. You can see the movie in theaters or watch it on Netflix, but if you watch it on Netflix, Netflix might know and then direct you to other alarming documentaries.
If that seems harmless enough, the film explores how such tactics might have played a role in the 2016 presidential election. The target is squarely on Cambridge Analytica, the defunct political data firm backed by the Republican donor Robert Mercer. According to Brittany Kaiser, a former Cambridge Analytica executive turned turncoat who emerges as the documentary's principal figure, the firm's strategy was to target voters whom it called "persuadables" in swing states and then to bombard them with content supposedly pushing them to vote for Donald J. Trump.
That assertion is one of several unsubstantiated claims in the film. In 2017, The New York Times reported that the "psychographics" technology that ostensibly set Cambridge apart from other firms remains unproved, and that Cambridge executives admitted that the technology had not been used in the Trump campaign.
But if the paranoia level could probably withstand a slight reduction, much of the movie feels utterly credible. Other interviewees include the journalist Carole Cadwalladr, one of the authors of the collaborative report by The New York Times, The Guardian and The Observer of London that exposed how Cambridge Analytica harvested information from the profiles of more than 50 million Facebook users. David Carroll, who teaches media design at Parsons, has tried to use the laws in Britain to obtain whatever information the firm had on him. The whistle-blower Christopher Wylie, shown testifying before a committee of the British Parliament, compares cheating in the democratic process to doping in the Olympics.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
But most vexing is Kaiser, whose motives for speaking out -- not least to the filmmakers -- are never entirely disentangled. She is shown luxuriating in a pool "somewhere in Thailand." A former social-media worker for Barack Obama's 2008 campaign, she comes across as a selectively savvy, status-conscious opportunist with flexible politics who is remorseful for her work with Cambridge Analytica, but only to a point. (After all, she says, in theory these voters were on the fence. "In the end," she says, "they're the ones that go to the ballot box and make their decision.")
That Kaiser has turned into an advocate for owning your own data makes "The Great Hack" seem vaguely uplifting, the story of her education. But she is still not someone you would trust with your data.

Robyn reveals how fans influenced her performance ahead of upcoming Forum concert: ‘I made the song, but they gave it the meaning’

Texto completo: Robyn took eight years to record her most recent album “Honey,” but when she called from Brussels last month on a European tour that all seemed like ancient history to the Swedish dance pop star. She returns to Southern California for her third date here this year on July 27.
“I feel like I have talked about it enough,” she says of the circumstances — the death of a close friend, a romantic partnership on the rocks — that led to the break from her acclaimed album “Body Talk” in 2010 and the follow-up that landed in October. “But I will say some things about it.
“It was a very particular time of my life, which I’m really thankful for,” Robyn says. “I was also in a privileged situation where I could take time off — a lot of people can’t do that. I really had the means and the space to explore things, and get to know myself better, which is such a luxury and something I really don’t regret at all.”
Her show at the Forum in Inglewood on Saturday, July 27 follows a pair of shows at the Palladium in Los Angeles in February where fans heard many of the songs on “Honey” live for the first time. It was clear then as it was on the record that with “Honey” she had taken the difficulties with which she’d wrestled and used that make music that over its dance beats and rhythms offered comfort, hope and joy.
“I think in order to talk about the things that are difficult, sadness and pain and stuff, sometimes you do it from a really unconscious place, but for me it was important to know what it was I wanted to talk about,” she says. “I wanted it to have that depth because I think it’s like the thing you can do as an artist for the people that listen to your music.
“You can make discoveries about yourself, and then you can present them to people in a way where they can explore things that they might recognize they felt before, or things that they haven’t felt before but when you describe it to them they know.”
We should note that Robyn’s music isn’t sad or bittersweet so much as cathartic. Singer Sam Smith, who works a similar vein in the pop mines, told the New York Times in a story about Robyn last year that what makes her brilliant is her “mixture of sadness and euphoria,” two sides of life that Robyn says are essential to each other.
“It’s just how I experience life,” she says. “For me, it’s not a constant. It’s kind of like I think melancholy, and also happiness or sadness or whatever, they don’t feel as good if the other thing isn’t there.
“Only sadness, it can be really, really painful,” Robyn says. “Only happiness can be really weird as well. There’s always the other side and I think those are the most interesting moments, when you can feel both of those things together.”
On “Honey,” though, she consciously moved in a lighter direction, she says.
“I think there’s another space which I’m exploring now, and I think a little bit more on this record, which is not as dramatic,” Robyn says. “I may have people thinking I’m not doing well” — she laughs — “but for me it'[s important to find something that’s less dramatic, that’s more about fun.
“Not fun like no problems, but like playfulness, like a sense of relaxation,” she says. “Which I think (the title song) ‘Honey’ is about and other things on this album as well.”
The Forum show will be similar to the Palladium dates, though the set has changed in the five months since then.
“When we played the Palladium, we were still adding and changing things, so it will be different,” Robyn says. “A lot is similar but we’ve played so many shows since then, so to me the show has matured.”
One constant highlight is how she and her band include the crowd in the performance of “Dancing On My Own,” a song from the “Body Talk” album on which the band drops out for the chorus to let the crowd sing, a truly chills-inducing moment in her show. That song, in which its protagonist is in the club watch an ex-lover dance with another, has been taken over by her fans in ways she says she never imagined.
“I really didn’t know or understand what ‘Dancing On My Own’ has meant to my fans,” she says. “But I understand from people telling me. So whether it’s me watching, like, people dance in a subway or Instagram about a night out listening to my music, those are things I see, and then, of course, I feel the response from the audience when I’m touring.”
On the “Body Talk” tour there were moments where the audience sang so loudly she could hardly hear herself, so sometimes Robyn and the band simply stopped playing for a few bars. For this tour, they decided to make it a feature of the song.
“It’s like they’re singing the song back to us, which is also a way of acknowledging them, and what they have done with the song in their lives,” she says. “(It’s) what happens when I’m not there. What happens when they’re in a karaoke bar or with friends, or they’re listening to the song at home.
“That’s something that I never get to see,” Robyn says. “It’s like a moment to share that. I made the song, but they gave it the meaning or whatever it has in their life.”

Texto completo: Robyn took eight years to record her most recent album “Honey,” but when she called from Brussels last month on a European tour that all seemed like ancient history to the Swedish dance pop star. She returns to Southern California for her third date here this year on July 27.
“I feel like I have talked about it enough,” she says of the circumstances — the death of a close friend, a romantic partnership on the rocks — that led to the break from her acclaimed album “Body Talk” in 2010 and the follow-up that landed in October. “But I will say some things about it.
“It was a very particular time of my life, which I’m really thankful for,” Robyn says. “I was also in a privileged situation where I could take time off — a lot of people can’t do that. I really had the means and the space to explore things, and get to know myself better, which is such a luxury and something I really don’t regret at all.”
Her show at the Forum in Inglewood on Saturday, July 27 follows a pair of shows at the Palladium in Los Angeles in February where fans heard many of the songs on “Honey” live for the first time. It was clear then as it was on the record that with “Honey” she had taken the difficulties with which she’d wrestled and used that make music that over its dance beats and rhythms offered comfort, hope and joy.
“I think in order to talk about the things that are difficult, sadness and pain and stuff, sometimes you do it from a really unconscious place, but for me it was important to know what it was I wanted to talk about,” she says. “I wanted it to have that depth because I think it’s like the thing you can do as an artist for the people that listen to your music.
“You can make discoveries about yourself, and then you can present them to people in a way where they can explore things that they might recognize they felt before, or things that they haven’t felt before but when you describe it to them they know.”
We should note that Robyn’s music isn’t sad or bittersweet so much as cathartic. Singer Sam Smith, who works a similar vein in the pop mines, told the New York Times in a story about Robyn last year that what makes her brilliant is her “mixture of sadness and euphoria,” two sides of life that Robyn says are essential to each other.
“It’s just how I experience life,” she says. “For me, it’s not a constant. It’s kind of like I think melancholy, and also happiness or sadness or whatever, they don’t feel as good if the other thing isn’t there.
“Only sadness, it can be really, really painful,” Robyn says. “Only happiness can be really weird as well. There’s always the other side and I think those are the most interesting moments, when you can feel both of those things together.”
On “Honey,” though, she consciously moved in a lighter direction, she says.
“I think there’s another space which I’m exploring now, and I think a little bit more on this record, which is not as dramatic,” Robyn says. “I may have people thinking I’m not doing well” — she laughs — “but for me it'[s important to find something that’s less dramatic, that’s more about fun.
“Not fun like no problems, but like playfulness, like a sense of relaxation,” she says. “Which I think (the title song) ‘Honey’ is about and other things on this album as well.”
The Forum show will be similar to the Palladium dates, though the set has changed in the five months since then.
“When we played the Palladium, we were still adding and changing things, so it will be different,” Robyn says. “A lot is similar but we’ve played so many shows since then, so to me the show has matured.”
One constant highlight is how she and her band include the crowd in the performance of “Dancing On My Own,” a song from the “Body Talk” album on which the band drops out for the chorus to let the crowd sing, a truly chills-inducing moment in her show.

Texto completo: Melania y Donald Trump anunciaron el lunes que celebrarán su segunda Cena de Estado en septiembre, celebrando su tercer año en la Casa Blanca. Para ese momento, los Obama ya habían celebrado cinco .
La primera dama Melania Trump, a última hora de la tarde del lunes, no había tuiteado sobre el evento, pero el anuncio de la Casa Blanca decía: “El Presidente y la Primera Dama darán la bienvenida al Primer Ministro de Australia y a la señora Morrison a la Casa Blanca el 20 de septiembre de 2019 para una visita oficial, que incluirá una cena de estado”.
Se espera que Melania Trump, quien recibió algunas críticas sobre cómo planeó la primera Cena de Eestado para el presidente francés, Emmanuel Macron , y su esposa, siga la tradición y se haga cargo de la segunda cena de estado también.
“La Primera Dama y su personal son responsables de la elaborada planificación de la ceremonia de la cena estatal” , afirma un artículo de la Asociación Histórica de la Casa Blanca. “Estas cenas formales implican la creación de invitaciones y listas de invitados, menús, flores, mesas, asientos y entretenimiento para la noche. La Primera Dama trabaja estrechamente con su secretaria social, el personal de la residencia ejecutiva y el Departamento de Estado para coordinar cada detalle. de este evento muy especial”.
“La visita celebrará la estrecha amistad y la historia compartida de nuestros dos países y reafirmará nuestra visión común para la paz mundial, la seguridad y la prosperidad”, indica la publicación de la Casa Blanca.
Melania Trump fue criticada en abril de 2018 por la corta lista de invitados de la primera Cena de Estado, que no incluía miembros demócratas del Congreso.
La entonces vocera de la primera dama, Stephanie Grisham, desmintió las posibles dudas sobre el éxito de Melania Trump en la planificación del evento.
“Probablemente no vamos a obtener el crédito que merecemos, pero sé que este equipo es excelente y ella sabe que este equipo es excelente”, dijo Grisham a The New York Times. “No hemos fallado, y ella no ha fallado”.

Where were you in '69?

Texto completo: Here are what a few Mainers were doing or thinking during an historic summer 50 years ago.
Susanne MacArthur sat on her living room couch late on the night of July 20, 1969, and hoped that her 18-day-old son would wake up. When he did, she told him they were witnessing history.
“I was aware that this was about as big an event as had ever happened,” said MacArthur, 72, of South Portland. “Now I tell my grandchildren, ‘Your dad and I watched the moon landing.’ It made me feel like the impossible was attainable.”
The 50th anniversary of man’s first steps on the moon was Saturday, and Aug. 15 will mark a half-century since the cultural phenomenon that was Woodstock. Both events were among a summer of historic happenings in 1969, which continue to impact and inspire people today.
The moon walk by astronaut Neil Armstrong fulfilled a pledge by President John F. Kennedy just eight years earlier and became a symbol of American innovation and determination, setting the stage for an era of lightning-fast technological advances.
Woodstock was supposed to be a pop music festival with an audience of 50,000 but drew 400,000 young people who largely shared anti-war and anti-establishment sentiments. Concert-goers who slept on muddy hillsides, shared food and water with strangers and were not afraid to openly smoke marijuana became part of a generation-defining moment.
Other culture-shifting events during the summer of 1969 included a gathering storm of Vietnam War protests and the Stonewall Riots in New York City, which kicked off the LGBTQ civil rights movement that continues today.
All those happenings helped define and propel the Baby Boomers, who were roughly between age 6 and 23 in 1969 and who as an outsize generation would go on to have a massive influence on U.S. and world history for the 50 years that followed.
Here are the stories of some Mainers and their experiences during that extraordinary summer.
Steve Romanoff was at Woodstock, sort of. A founder of two Maine folk bands, Devonsquare and Schooner Fare, Romanoff was at a party in Portland when he and a friend decided they should go to the much-anticipated music festival, happening the next day.
So they got in a Chevrolet Corvair and drove all night to the concert site in Bethel, New York. They arrived around 9:30 a.m. and saw people and cars everywhere. They left their car on the roadside and walked “toward the sound of the festival.” Romanoff and his friend soon realized they had little money, no food, no change of clothes and no sleeping bags. They looked at the crowds of people already wallowing in mud and rain and decided to go home.
“We looked at each other and said, ‘this is stupid.’ Ten hours after we left, we were back in Maine,” said Romanoff, 72, of Falmouth.
CURIOUS COPS, COMMON BONDS Craig Brown was 16 when he left his home in Cape Elizabeth one day in mid-August of 1969, telling his mother he was going camping with friends in New Hampshire. But he was headed to Woodstock, on a farm in upstate New York, piling into a van with friends. Brown was a big music fan, and the chance to see a couple dozen mega-stars — including Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, and Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young — all in one place excited him. Music festivals that attract hundreds of thousands of people are commonplace today, but in 1969 they were unheard of.
Because of a massive traffic standstill, Brown and his friends ended up ditching the van and walking 6 miles to the concert site. Heavy rain meant that they slept under soggy blankets on the ground, and the massive crowd meant that food vendors quickly had nothing to sell and bathrooms were nearly impossible to find. The event, in Brown’s mind, was a symbol of his generation’s struggles and common bonds. It was filled with young men who either were draft age or approaching it, and anti-Vietnam War sentiment was high.
Woodstock was also a moment when marijuana began to go mainstream, being used publicly by thousands of people. In its stories on Woodstock, The New York Times felt compelled to explain the terms “grass” and “stoned” for readers unfamiliar with them. But Brown and his friends needed no explanation. They were stopped by police on the way home, about 20 miles from Woodstock. The officers took the pot from their van and brought them into the police station. “They mostly wanted to hear whether we saw naked women,” he said. The police gave Brown and his buddies a case of beer to drink and eventually sent them on their way.
Brown, 66, lives in Cape Elizabeth and has spent his career in politics and public affairs, working as a community organizer and political consultant as well as running campaigns. He was chief of staff for Tom Andrews, congressman from Maine’s 1st District in the 1990s. He now runs Common Dreams, a progressive news website based in Maine. Feeling part of an empowered and politically active generation, something he felt strongly at Woodstock, helped fuel his life’s work.
“Conditions were bad, but people were taking care of each other and sharing whatever they had, and there was really no anger. There was this feeling of we’re all in this together,” Brown said of Woodstock. “I think for a lot of us who felt the same way, being against the war, it was a very empowering event.”
Split attention Author Stephen King was working at the University of Maine library in the summer of 1969 and remembers watching the moon landing on a small black-and-white TV atop a refrigerator in an Orono boarding house. Or at least he tried to. A fellow resident named Grover, a retired railroad worker, sat next to King and tried to divert his attention from the historic broadcast. Grover badgered King to look at his fishing scrapbook as Apollo 11 was about to touch down.
“I divided my attention between the first men landing on the moon and a series of old photographs, including one of Grover and a prize-winning salmon in the Bangor Daily News. It was (expletive) surreal,” King, 71, wrote in an email to the Portland Press Herald/Maine Sunday Telegram.
Lunar learning Jim Harmon was 9 years old and decided to watch the moon landing only after his older brother explained to him that it was a big deal. Harmon, who grew up in Windham, knew little about the mission or its significance. He had heard little about it in school.
But soon after watching it, he began launching model rockets in the backyard with his brother and wondering when more people might head to the moon. A few years later, he built a walking-talking robot for a school science fair. Today, he’s a science teacher at Deering High School in Portland and works part time at the University of Southern Maine’s Southworth Planetarium.
“I have to give my brother credit for getting me to watch,” said Harmon, 59, of Scarborough. “I do believe it helped lead me to a career in science.”

Surviving the 'Heat Dome'

Texto completo: America is sweating this weekend, blanketed by a "heat dome" that spread from the middle part of the country to the Great Lakes and the East Coast.
New York is hotter than New Delhi, Washington feels like Death Valley and Cincinnati is warmer than Nairobi. Millions of people are finding different ways to cope with the dangerously high temperatures -- above 100 degrees in some places.
The New York Times took more sweaty snapshots of Americans as they braved the heat.
To combat the heat, some people wore sunglasses and wielded umbrellas, taking a defensive approach to blocking the sun's rays. Others found it better to fill bottles with ice, and periodically hold them against their skin for relief.
The National Weather Service encouraged everyone to drink plenty of fluids, check on relatives and neighbors, stay in air-conditioned rooms and avoid the sun. But not everyone heeded the advice.
With temperatures soaring into the high 90s and above, resourceful children in Chicago found a way to play outside and stay cool at the same time.
And don't forget about the animals. A zoo in Ohio made blood-infused pops for the lions, jaguars and snow leopards. Dogs ate ice cream and a panda ate frozen fruit. Farmers poured water on poultry to keep them cool.
Some used the heat as an enterprising opportunity, selling cold beverages to anyone who would take them. Of course, those entrepreneurs had to contend with the heat to make any sales.
An outdoor market in Detroit remained open on Saturday despite a heat warning. Vendors continued to sell flowers, blueberries, hot sauce and salsa. The more notably resilient even endured smoking grills.
Philadelphia was also under an excessive heat warning with temperatures reaching nearly 100 degrees, but that did not stop people from enjoying the parks and lakes.
And as many young people on summer break would tell you, a classic antidote to the oppressive heat is the public pool.

Texto completo: Two articles in the May 11 Santa Fe New Mexican caught my eye. The first, from the New York Times, detailed the ordeal of a woman who stopped to help three undocumented immigrants in dire need and how she was detained by the authorities for doing so ("New border policy: Good Samaritan crackdown," May 11). The second, from the Washington Post, described a plan by the Trump administration to displace as many as 55,000 children, all of whom are legal residents or U.S. citizen, from government-subsidized housing by changing the rules regarding undocumented immigrants' access to the same ("HUD: 55K children could be evicted," May 11).
What struck me about both articles, apart from the total wrongheadedness of those policies, was the degree of human cruelty they demonstrate. And these are not isolated incidents. Other examples include the separation of families (with no plan to reunite them), the use of cages to incarcerate human beings and denying the right of those legally seeking asylum to remain in the U.S. while their cases are adjudicated. The list goes on.
The cruelty doesn't just manifest itself in immigration policy. It extends to virtually every aspect of the Trump administration. It shows up in the refusal of adequate aid to hurricane-ravaged Puerto Rico. It rears its ugly head in the denial of human rights to the LBGT community. It appears in the repudiation of women's control over their own reproductive rights. It is in regarding these as policy issues and not understanding (nor perhaps caring) that such cruelty affects the lives and fortunes of real human beings.
This level of cruelty did not just appear out of thin air. To the contrary, Americans have always been known for empathy and charity, especially for those in need. And we have always looked toward our president to demonstrate these traits for all of us. To comfort us in times of sorrow, to support us in times of disaster, to lend a hand to those of us who are less fortunate. We do not currently have such a president.
Instead, President Donald Trump has consistently appealed to the darker side of our emotions. To encourage hatred of everything he deems in opposition to his own sociopathic personality. To trash-talk his opposition, whether they be political adversaries, war heroes, Gold Star families or ordinary citizens. To demonize entire groups, whether they be FBI officials, journalists, Muslims, undocumented immigrants or those who believe we should do something about climate change. And in doing so, reducing humans to evil caricatures, the easier to perpetrate further cruelty.
In the two or three years that Trump has been on the political stage, it seems that actions once considered outrages to the national sense of decency and fair play are routinely accepted. Have we had that much of a change of national heart? Are the forces of evil intimidating the forces of good into silence? Are we failing to remember the lessons of 1930s Germany, the Chinese under Mao or the former USSR under Stalin? In school, I asked myself how whole populations could fall under the spell of such evil. I am now beginning to understand.
Kindness is in our national blood. "With malice toward none, with charity for all, with firmness in the right as God gives us to see the right" and "Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free" are not simply words that we learned in school.
They are reflections of our true national character. We are now at a time in history to put up or shut up, to meekly accept this change or to reject hatred and cruelty. Which shall it be?

Texto completo: In the great swirl of lead-ups to the moon landing's half-century anniversary, we've heard from astronauts, scientists, journalists and historians about the event and its import.
But one category I hadn't seen weigh in was poet. Which is why I was delighted to get an email with the subject line "Pacheco Moon Day Poem."
Sanibel's Joe Pacheco and Tropicalia go way back. He has contributed much to these pages over the years, participating in stories about ArtPoems, which he co-founded, and helping us celebrate the magazine's 10th birthday on Captiva with a sunset Marching Mullet Band Parade.
His piece, "Moon Day (Where Were You On July 20, 1969?)" was composed a few years ago, he told me, and he surprised himself by surviving to the event's five decade mark.
"When I wrote the poem, I never thought I would make it to the 50th," he says. "But, I made it."
If you missed hearing Joe reading it on WGCU-FM Friday, you can hear it online at https://news.wgcu.org/post/where-were-you-july-20-1969
Today, Joe also told me, is Moon Day, celebrated each year on this day.
But speaking of special days, today marks the 89th of Joe's birth.
I, for one, am glad he made it.
Moon Day (Where Were You On July 20, 1969?) On the eve of my thirty-ninth birthday,
wheeling the TV cart
into the living room
of my center hall colonial
with my wife and in-laws
and my eldest daughter Randy
on her grandfather's lap,
(four year old Allegra
asleep in her room),
five pairs of human eyes
drinking in the incredible —
men on the moon,
greatest scientific feat of all time,
and I still struggling
with the rabbit ears antenna
to make the image clearer;
Armstrong's carefully prepared
"one step, one leap" metaphor
milking in best Madison Avenue style
the great moment for what
it would always be worth;
my father-in-law and I
engaged in speculation
about how Jewish astronauts
could observe Rosh Hodesh,
or say the prayer to the new moon
while standing on it,
my daughter interrupting,
"Grandpa, I know the prayer by heart."
then all of us quiet for a long time —
my last hope that it might be a hoax gone,
I felt bereft — beauty and belief
and fancies once owned proudly
now replaced by a lifeless sphere.
Next day, my birthday,
having been declared Moon Day,
the New York Times
printed its special edition
with several poems by poets
including Archibald MacLeish,
some acclaiming the achievement,
others lamenting the loss,
a feast for poets
but my muse silent, lifeless.
Since then,
the moon reminds me
from time to time
that on that day
a member of my species
trampled on her face,
violating with one irreverent step
a million years of magic
and myth and wondrous gazing —
brother Apollo's module chariot
pulling from afar
and away from us
the last ebb of silver dream.
— Joe Pacheco

Talking Volumes' 20th season tilts to nonfiction

Texto completo: The 20th season of Talking Volumes will bring a famed Minnesota novelist back home to discuss his first book in more than 10 years -- a memoir, not a novel.
This year's lineup is weighted toward nonfiction: two memoirs, a poetry collection, a deep dive into religious history, a witty cultural critique and just one novel.
Everything begins, though, with that novel. Alice Hoffman, bestselling author of "The Dovekeepers" and "The Marriage of Opposites," will discuss her latest book, "The World That We Knew," Sept. 25 at the Fitzgerald Theater in St. Paul. Set during World War II, it's the story of a young girl whose mother sends her away from Berlin to escape the Nazis. She gets help from a rabbi, his daughter and a magical golem.
Talking Volumes, a partnership between the Star Tribune and Minnesota Public Radio, branches out to Minneapolis this fall with two events at the Parkway Theater. Poet Saeed Jones will be there Oct. 9 to talk about his new memoir, "How We Fight for Our Lives," about growing up black and gay in the American South. His first collection of poetry, "Prelude to Bruise," published in 2014 by Coffee House Press of Minneapolis, was a finalist for a National Book Critics Circle Award and won the Stonewall Book Award/Barbara Gittings Literature Award.
Minnesota-born writer Tim O'Brien, author of the acclaimed Vietnam War novels "The Things They Carried" and the National Book Award-winning "Going After Cacciato," will be at the Parkway Oct. 16. His new book, "Dad's Maybe Book," is a memoir, inspired by becoming a father late in life. Feeling moved to write down his life for his young sons, O'Brien has laced the book with flashbacks of his youth in Worthington, Minn., and service in Vietnam. The work is permeated with a deep awareness of mortality.
British author Karen Armstrong, who was part of Talking Volumes in 2014, returns to the Fitzgerald Nov. 7 to discuss her new book, "The Lost Art of Scripture: Rescuing the Sacred Texts." Sacred books such as the Bible, the Torah and the Qur'an have, in modern times, been interpreted narrowly and sometimes literally, Armstrong posits, which leads to deep misunderstandings of faith and belief.
New York Times columnist Lindy West will be at the Fitz Nov. 14 with "The Witches Are Coming," a funny and insightful book of cultural criticism that looks at the age of Trump, the #MeToo movement, and other manifestations of pop culture. We did not get here in a vacuum, West points out, and she examines films, TV shows and the internet to trace the roots of today's America -- and how it is changing.
The season concludes Nov. 21 at the Fitzgerald with Tracy K. Smith, former U.S. poet laureate and winner of the Pulitzer Prize for her collection, "Life on Mars," published by Minneapolis' Graywolf Press. Smith will discuss her 2018 collection "Wade in the Water" -- also published by Graywolf -- which, as the Star Tribune noted in a review, "presents a clear-eyed portrait of the present, reconsiders the past and offers love as an ethical response to injustice."
Hosted by MPR's Kerri Miller, all shows are at 7 p.m. and include musical guests, real-time open captioning and signed books for sale. Talking Volumes has hosted more than 100 celebrated writers over the years, including Margaret Atwood, Stephen King, Joan Didion, Robert Bly and Colson Whitehead.

Harriet Tubman is no wedge issue

Texto completo: The following editorial appears in The Washington Post:
President Donald Trump, who as a candidate in 2016 derided as “pure political correctness” the plan to honor Harriet Tubman by featuring the Underground Railroad’s most celebrated conductor’s image on the front of the $20 bill, can rest easy: Thanks to the intervention of his treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, only likenesses of white men will appear on U.S. paper money for the duration of his presidency.
Mnuchin’s far-fetched pretext for the delay — that eight more years of technical planning were required to prevent counterfeiting issues in the bill’s new design — is now exposed as risible. As The New York Times reported, the design of the new bill, featuring Tubman, was already quite advanced when Mnuchin announced the move, apparently fearing an even greater backlash should Trump cancel the project outright. The treasury secretary’s postponement means the new note will not be complete until after Trump leaves office, even if he serves a second term.
The Trump administration’s stock in trade is divisiveness, particularly where it concerns race and ethnicity. As usual, though, Trump underestimates thhe American people: Many Americans of every race despaired that the plan to honor Tubman was derailed, and that includes some Republicans. Among them is Gov. Larry Hogan of Maryland (where Tubman was born), who wrote to Mnuchin expressing his disappointment. The famed abolitionist, Hogan wrote, “more than earned her rightful place among our nation’s most pivotal leaders.”
Not that the Trump administration appears to care. A spokeswoman for Mnuchin, whose department oversees the Bureau of Engraving, told The Times that the timetable for printing a new $20 is on schedule; it should be in circulation by 2030. However, she made no mention of whether Tubman’s likeness would appear on it, perhaps for fear of provoking that tireless sentry in the White House in his vigilant lookout for political correctness.
In fact, political correctness has nothing to do with the impulse to honor Tubman, a woman of astonishing valor. As a child slave, she was beaten and tortured before escaping, in her 20s, to Philadelphia. Whereupon she returned to slave-holding territory, again and again, to rescue relatives and dozens of other African Americans in bondage, guiding them northward to freedom and helping them find work once they arrived. They called her Moses. She was a Union Army scout and spy in the Civil War and an early activist in the suffrage movement after that; hence the original plan, devised in the Obama administration by then-Treasury Secretary Jack Lew, to unveil the new note’s design next year, on the 100th anniversary of the ratification of the 19th Amendment, by which women gained the right to vote.
Harriet Tubman is an American hero, not a wedge issue. As Hogan said, she deserves to be recognized by having her image enshrined on U.S. currency, much as her name adorns parks and monuments in Maryland.

America is more than 'just OK'

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – Maybe President Trump was right that we needed a "Salute to America," because apparently some Americans have lost sight of the greatness of our country. Case in point: To mark Independence Day, The New York Times posted a video op-ed challenging what it called the "mythology" of American greatness. "America may once have been the greatest," the Times video declares, "but today, America, we're just OK."
The video is like a caricature of how conservatives think the left sees America — except it isn't a caricature; it's real. It's a straw man come to life. As evidence we're just OK, the video cites statistics showing that other developed countries, such as Luxembourg, Sweden and Norway, have lower poverty rates or better education and health care outcomes than America. And as for our "kick-ass democracy," the Times says, it's not that big a deal because "a lot of countries have freedoms."
Put aside for a moment all the misleading data the video uses to show America is not so great. The fact is, all the freedom and progress those other countries enjoy today would not be possible without the United States.
The reason that "a lot of countries have freedoms" today is because our Founding Fathers pioneered the principle of popular sovereignty, where governments answer to the people instead of the other way around. At the time of our founding, the rest of the world was ruled by monarchs. Our founders established the first country in human history that was built on an idea — the idea of human liberty.
For most of our history, American democracy was a global outlier. In 1938, on the eve of World War II, there were just 17 democracies. It was not until 1998 — just two decades ago — that there were more democracies than autocracies.
That dramatic explosion of freedom didn't just happen. It was the direct result of the rise of the United States as a global superpower. The U.S.-powered victory over Nazi tyranny in World War II and our triumph over Soviet tyranny in the Cold War defeated the hateful ideologies of fascism and communism, and unleashed a wave of freedom that has spread across the world. Today, 4.1 billion people live in democracies. (Of those who do not, four out of five live in China.)
The unprecedented expansion of liberty has produced unprecedented prosperity. Last September, the Brookings Institution reported that "for the first time since agriculture-based civilization began 10,000 years ago, the majority of humankind ... some 3.8 billion people, live in households with enough discretionary expenditure to be considered 'middle class' or 'rich.'"
None of that would be possible without the Pax Americana guaranteed by U.S. military. Americans liberated a continent, rebuilt much of it from the rubble of war with the Marshall Plan, and then stood watch on freedom's frontier and prevented a Soviet tank invasion across the Fulda Gap. And today, the only thing that stops North Korea from invading South Korea or China from invading Taiwan is American military might.
So, let's be clear: Every country that enjoys democratic governance today owes its birth of freedom to our Founding Fathers, and the continued existence of their democracy to the U.S. military.
Today, for all its flaws, America remains the freest, most innovative, most prosperous country in the history of the world. We invented the lightbulb and the iPhone. We put a man on the moon and a rover on Mars. We are a nation of unparalleled military power and unlimited opportunity. There's a reason we have a crisis on our southern border; millions want to come here so that they can share in the abundance of American prosperity.
The men and women who flew those fighters and bombers over the Mall make it all possible. They provide the critical foundation of peace and security upon which our freedom, and the freedom of all the world's democracies, is built. Maybe Luxembourg scores better on some measures, but no one is counting on Luxembourg to secure the peace of the world. Trump was right to shine a spotlight on our men and women in uniform and to remind those who have lost sight of it that the United States is not simply the greatest nation on Earth; we are indispensable. Without us, the world would be mired in the darkness of totalitarianism rather than the light of liberty.
That is better than "just OK."

Texto completo: NPR in May changed the long-familiar theme music to its “Morning Edition” newscast.
After 40 years of hearing B.J. Leiderman’s original score every weekday, you were either sick of it, or, for sticks in the mud such as yours truly, flummoxed at the very idea of messing with a good thing.
But I’ll get over it. Especially ‘cause the new, poppy, synthy thing is just a rewrite of the old tune anyway. Same chord progression; a few tweaks.
The reason for the move by the public radio commissars in D.C.?
It was, as Josh Benton wrote for Nieman Lab, “for the kids.”
Meaning, trying to get a few listeners under 60 to listen to the show.
The New York Times wrote: “The new theme is intended to attract a younger and more diverse audience, while also aligning with the evolution of ‘Morning Edition’ into a newsier program, said Kenya Young, the executive producer. ‘I wanted a sound and a mood and a tone and a feel and a vibe all mixed in one,’ she said.”
Actual young people seem to consume as much radio news as they do daily print newspapers. Meaning, none. The only reason I know at least one 20something has ever listened to a second of NPR is that Clementine Creevy’s great L.A. rock band Cherry Glazerr takes its name from KCRW’s morning host Chery Glaser, who Clem used to hear in her parents’ car as they drove her to school.
So where do young people get their news? I know, I know, Instagram, fool.
But it’s not just Millennials who don’t follow the old-fashioned definition of what’s going on in the world. Academics who study the subject say that, at a time when it is far easier than ever to get an enormous amount of information about everything by clicking on the screen of that telephone in your pocket, many are simply opting out.
Josh Benton, again, for Nieman: “News, you may have noticed, isn’t that great at generating happiness these days. So lots of people are happy to stick to Keanu and avoid Trump/Iran/Putin/climate change/mass shootings/Brexit/racism entirely.”
Yes, of course, there have been plenty of times as terrifying as these, and people still followed — hungered for — the news. When the Third Reich was bombing London and on the brink of ruling Europe, that didn’t stop people from listening to Edward Murrow broadcasting from the rooftops. So mere logic won’t do here. Something else is going on.
As someone who learned to read at age 4 out of fascination with the morning newspaper, and haven’t stopped since, it doesn’t matter that this makes no sense to me. It’s a thing. Benton cites data from Digital News Report: “In 2017, 29 percent of those surveyed worldwide said they ‘often or sometimes avoid the news,’ including 38 percent in the United States and 24 percent in the U.K. By 2019, those numbers had increased to 32 percent worldwide (+3), 41 percent in the U.S. (+3) and 35 percent in the U.K. (+11). (Even the Japanese — the world’s most devoted news consumers — saw news avoidance increase from 6 to 11 percent.)”
Harshing their vibe is the major reason for news avoidance, 57 percent of the avoiders said: “It can have a negative effect on my mood.”
Second, yes, is the more than a third of us who have concocted a conspiracy theory about the press: “I can’t rely on news to be true,” say 35 percent. You want real untruthiness? Try the internet.
“I haven’t read a newspaper in years,” said one respondent. “It was all too depressing.”
I hear you, dude. But you want real depressing? Try a future in which the creeps and crooks we report on win the day because you decided to just tune out.

Podcast finds the funny in conspiracies; 'Last Podcast on the Left' has gone from cult hit to mirror of Trump-era obsessions.

Texto completo: The hosts of "Last Podcast on the Left" do not feel especially vindicated that they were right about an alleged pedophile conspiracy that has ensnared top government and media figures.
"It's sad that so many conspiracy theories have become true, but it's good that the rocks are being overturned and we're seeing all the bugs," said co-host Ben Kissel.
"No one knows where Jeffrey Epstein's money comes from, and the president has no interest in seeing him going down," co-host Henry Zebrowski added.

For close to a decade, Kissel, Zebrowski and Marcus Parks, all in their mid-30s, have covered conspiracy-theory culture on their show, a pioneer of true-crime and horror-comedy podcasting. Subjects have run the gamut from the very plausible (intelligence failures around 9/11) to gleefully nutty (the moon is secretly hollow) to the sad and sordid (Jeffrey Epstein and the history of pedophiles in government). With Epstein and R. Kelly now looking at serious prison time for allegedly running organized sex cults, and with a president who embraces far-reaching conspiracy theories, the fringe culture the podcast has documented for years is more salient than ever.
"It's interesting to see society catch up with what we've been talking about for a decade now," Kissel said. "If people spoke about these things before, it was with a book they'd self-published."
"Last Podcast's" flagship show pulls over a million downloads per episode, with the back catalog drawing 11 million downloads a month. The show is a mix of long-form episodes, shorter clips covering current true-crime stories and news of the weird, and interviews with authors and paranormal-research figures. The trio is playing a live show outdoors Sunday at Hollywood Forever Cemetery, which more typically hosts arena-level rock acts.
As true-crime podcasts like "My Favorite Murder" and shows like "Mindhunter" have boomed, they've matured into something that often feels more like journalism or history. "Last Podcast on the Left" is a comedy show that, while frequently NC-17 in its humor and morbidity, still treats its subjects with a fundamental credulousness and respect. The tone is something like overnight radio host Art Bell as a self-aware Los Feliz stand-up, or if "Documentary Now" actually tried to do reporting.
Zebrowski is an actor who has appeared on HBO's "Crashing" and "The Wolf of Wall Street"; Kissel is a former television and radio commentator who (unsuccessfully) ran for Brooklyn borough president in 2017. Parks is the primary author of their forthcoming book on serial killers for publisher Houghton Mifflin Harcourt.
Comedy has lately grown more consequential in exposing real-life malevolence. Hannibal Buress' stand-up reignited investigations into Bill Cosby; Seth MacFarlane joked about Harvey Weinstein's lecherousness at the 2013 Oscars, and a few years later Weinstein was found to be using ex-Mossad agents to silence his alleged sexual-assault victims.
"Comedians have been at the foreground of telling the truth about what's going on," Kissel said. "You're seeing all of these jokes become serious, and no one listened to us."
There are vast differences between the alleged predations of R. Kelly and Jeffrey Epstein and the daffier stuff around Bigfoot and real-life Men in Black, which the hosts treat with a much lighter touch.
But then there are things like Q Anon and YouTube radicalization cults that, while transparently false and strange, still exert influence over American life and politics.
Pizzagate sent a man with a gun on a mission to hunt phantoms in a restaurant. Incel and dark-web culture has led to multiple murders, most recently of a young teen, Bianca Devins, which "Last Podcast" covered with appropriate solemnity. Believers in Q Anon (an inscrutable conspiracy starring Trump as a pedophile hunter as well as a secretly-still-alive John F. Kennedy Jr.) are showing up at Trump rallies.
"Things have become so normalized, especially because the president is in their dream world," Zebrowski said.
"If you go back to Ruby Ridge and Waco, those types used to go to gun shows and listen to shortwave radio, but you had to go seek that stuff out," Parks added, citing the escalation of conspiracy-theory shows and YouTube rabbit holes. "Now it's in your pocket. And they have a president who subscribes to their same worldview. They're ecstatic."
Not all of their newly validated conspiracy research is quite so dark. The mainstreaming of UFO culture, including major stories in the New York Times and Washington Post about a push within the military to acknowledge unexplained phenomena, is a major shift in how the government and public treat such theories.
"Navy pilots moved to change the forms for filling out UFO sightings because they were seeing too much [stuff] and were sick of being made fun of," Zebrowski said. "Now we're getting to a gray area where it's OK to say 'I don't know,' and those things lead toward research."
Despite making a career in it, the "Last Podcast" hosts are not encouraged by the scale of conspiracy culture. As the 50th anniversary of the Manson murders approaches, the hosts see some uncomfortable similarities between the culture on Spahn Ranch and the dark corners of YouTube and 8Chan today.
"When the Logan Paul thing was heating up, I wouldn't have put it beneath him to murder somebody. Money and attention can twist you," Zebrowski joked (and Paul did, in fact, face backlash for posing with a dead body). "But an Instagram influencer just got murdered and her corpse was put on the internet. These [Manson] people would already be on the internet, and they'd be low-level celebrities."
"Lots of people believe in conspiracies," Parks said, "because it's easier than believing the fact that life is chaos and nobody's in charge."

Big issues remain despite Sudan power-sharing deal

Texto completo: Sudan's ruling military council and pro-democracy movement signed a political document Wednesday that formalized the broad outlines of a power-sharing deal announced this month. But key details of the deal, including the powers of a transitional ruling council and Cabinet, have yet to be agreed on.
The two sides, which have been wrestling for control of Sudan since the ouster of President Omar al-Bashir in April, signed the document early Wednesday at a hotel in the capital, Khartoum, after a night of talks led by African Union mediators.
Lt. Gen. Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, known as Hamedti, signed the deal for the military in a visible sign of the shifting balance of power in Sudan. Troops under Dagalo's command led a violent dispersal of pro-democracy demonstrators June 3 that tilted the negotiations in favor of the military. Since then, Dagalo has emerged as one of the most powerful figures in the country.
Potential immunity from prosecution for Dagalo and other military leaders accused of using violence to suppress protests is one of several core issues that still divide military and civilian negotiators. Within hours of the political agreement being signed Wednesday, protest leaders warned that a return to civilian rule is by no means assured in Sudan.
But the deal at least signaled that the country's fraught transition to democracy remains on track, after a bruising three-month confrontation between military and civilian leaders that has seen huge street protests, tense negotiations and military-led violence that killed scores of people.
After they helped oust al-Bashir on April 11, protesters refused to leave the streets until the military agreed to completely hand over power to a civilian-led administration. The standoff ended June 3, when troops from Dagalo's paramilitary unit, the Rapid Support Forces, swept through the protest area and opened fire on protesters.
Doctors said that at least 128 people were killed in the rampage, during which bodies were dumped in the Nile and many people were raped. The government acknowledged 61 deaths, including three soldiers.
Weeks later, mediators from Ethiopia and the African Union, with backing from Western and Persian Gulf countries, brought the two sides together for new talks that led to the power-sharing deal announced July 4.
Since then, the two sides have been hammering out the fine details of the deal amid considerable mutual distrust.
Protest leaders are uncomfortable with the prominence of Dagalo and his Rapid Support Forces, which have emerged as the dominant group in a byzan-tine security apparatus that under al-Bashir included military units, security agencies and semiofficial militias.
The deal signed Wednesday confirmed the broad strokes of the agreement reached July 4 - that Sudan would be run during a transition period of just over three years by a sovereign council comprising five military members, five civilians and an 11th member agreed on by both sides.
A military general would lead the council for the first 21 months of the transition and a civilian leader for the following 18 months. A Cabinet of as many as 20 ministers, all nominated by civilians except for the defense and interior portfolios controlled by the military, would run the country day to day.
But arguments continue over the division of powers between the sovereign council and the Cabinet, and more detail about how that would work is expected to be included in a second constitutional agreement yet to be signed. Mediators said that talks on that agreement would resume Friday.
The two sides are also at odds over the composition of a transitional legislative council. The military originally agreed to a legislative council with two-thirds of its members nominated by the Forces for Freedom and Change, the coalition representing pro-democracy groups, but later changed its mind.

Former CEO says attempt to 'depoliticize' Planned Parenthood led to ouster

Texto completo: Former Planned Parenthood president Dr. Leana Wen said that the organization's board ousted her because of her efforts to refocus the organization to approach abortion as a healthcare issue rather than as a political one.
Wen, who served as Planned Parenthood president for just eight months before being terminated on Tuesday, said in a Friday op-ed in the New York Times that she and the organization’s board held “philosophical differences,” including disagreements about her plans to emphasize the organization's role as a women's healthcare provider rather than as a political entity and abortion provider. Wen wanted to promote Planned Parenthood’s healthcare services to counter the criticism that the organization is primarily geared toward providing abortions and lobbying for abortion rights.
Wen says that team she brought with her “faced daily internal opposition from those who saw my goals as mission creep.”
“There was even more criticism as we worked to change the perception that Planned Parenthood was just a progressive political entity to show that it was first and foremost a mainstream health care organization,” she said.
Wen led the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, which was behind filing myriad lawsuits against states enacting abortion bans, and oversaw a forum with 2020 Democratic presidential candidates in June to highlight the party's support for abortion.
While Planned Parenthood did not publicly elaborate on the decision to replace Wen on Tuesday, PPAF board chairwomen Aimee Cunningham and Jennie Rosenthal said in a statement: “We thank Dr. Leana Wen for her service to Planned Parenthood in such a pivotal time and extend our best wishes for her continued success."

Texto completo: The last time I spoke with former Justice John Paul Stevens was in 2017 at a reception for Associate Justice Neil Gorsuch after his investiture on the Supreme Court. Stevens was sitting near a corner looking frail and alone. I went over and immediately teased him over my seething jealousy over his scoring tickets to Game 4 of the 2016 World Series. Both Stevens and I grew up ardent Chicago Cubs fans and Stevens just gave his signature smile, shrugged, and said, when you pass 90, "people are in a hurry to give you stuff."
When Stevens passed last night at 99, most of us felt that we had not given him nearly enough. Stevens transformed this country in decades of decisions, but most people only have a passing knowledge of who he was. That is how he wanted it. No, he is not the "real RBG" or Scalia. He was not a rock star. He was a jurist who spoke entirely through his opinions and what he said has helped shape the lives of every American.
Few justices have left a footprint on American jurisprudence to match John Paul Stevens. It was not simply because he served 35 years – the third-longest in Supreme Court history. It was way that Stevens ruled. He wrote opinions that were anchored in simple, coherent values that he saw in the Constitution. Stevens changed on the court from a conservative to one of the most liberal justices in history. Along the way, he found his voice as a strong defender of individual rights and an advocate for a Constitution that must evolve with society – a living document capable of securing the guarantees of the Framers in a new and changing world.
His decisions remain the foundation for whole areas of law. He is the author of Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., – a decision that controls how agency decisions are reviewed and enforced by the courts. He wrote core cases under the First Amendment, the commerce clause and the Fourth Amendment that still define core rights for all Americans.
He had confidence in the underlying values of the Constitution that served as his guiding beacon. Thus, when police acquired new technology to read thermal images through the walls of homes, Stevens ruled that it was still an intrusion in the home. Thermal imagery did not exist at the time of the Framers but privacy did and Stevens had no difficulty in seeing the need for a warrant.
Yet, it is not just Stevens' wisdom that should be missed. It is his style of judging. What is most remarkable about Stevens is that he resisted efforts to turn him into a public figure. Years ago, I wrote about the advent of the "celebrity justice" as members of the court became more active in speaking publicly to adorning crowds. These events often had strong ideological identifications. Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Antonin Scalia were the most active and often created controversies over statements about pending cases or issues. The notion of judicial constituents did not sit well with some of us.
As justices actively sought public acclaim, the concern was that their public personas might influence their judicial perspective. Stevens never liked being pigeonholed by advocates. In 2007, Stevens told the New York Times "I don't think of myself as a liberal at all."
There was a time when public speaking was frowned upon by the court. Justices were supposed to speak entirely through their opinions and avoid the public spotlight. I have long favored that model and Stevens was the ultimate example of the traditional approach.
Stevens rarely spoke publicly and never craved the public acclaim. One time, Stevens and I were flying to Milwaukee on the same plane to speak at the Seventh Circuit Judicial Conference. A lawyer walked up and said that he was a big fan. To my surprise, he shook my hand. I then introduced him to Justice Stevens. The lawyer turned an ashen white and made a quick retreat. Stevens was so unknown by sight that when we were on the plane, I saw a woman hit Stevens in the head with her bag – not knowing that she was putting the future of Roe v. Wade one carry-on away from extinction.

Texto completo: Cubs radio announcer Pat Hughes deserves to receive the Baseball Hall of Fame's Ford C. Frick Award, the sport's highest honor for a broadcaster, when it's handed out at this time next year.
Certainly, no one is better than Hughes, a distinction that might even be enough to snag it for him. You never know.
The man is a consummate professional who has studied and honed his craft through good seasons and bad with the Twins, the Brewers and, since 1996, the Cubs.
Would-be announcers would do well to study the precision with which Hughes reports the game while conveying drama through the tone, pace and volume of his delivery without it ever becoming overwrought, enabling listeners to "see" the action. He's not flashy, but it's a high-def call.
"Future Hall of Famer" is practically part of his name.
But the Hall of Fame is, well, the Hall of Fame.
The overt goal is to honor the game's all-time greats and bring tourists to Cooperstown, N.Y., but it seems the unofficial mission is to foment and fuel arguments.
So hold off on booking trips to upstate New York for the big party. See who the finalists are in October. Wait for the announcement at baseball's winter meetings in December to see if he joins the club with Jack Brickhouse, Harry Caray and Bob Elson.
It's not just that there are other announcers with solid credentials. There are, although again, there's no one better.
It's that the Frick Award winner is determined by a committee of living former honorees and a handful of broadcast historians and journalists. It's hard to predict a consensus.
In Hughes' favor is that their stated criteria -- "Commitment to excellence, quality of broadcasting abilities, reverence within the game, popularity with fans and recognition by peers" -- virtually defines him.
Hughes not only is in his 37th successive season as a major-league announcer, but also spends his offseason producing an ongoing series of "Baseball Voices" recordings showcasing many of the game's great announcers. (Among them to date, and this can't hurt, are living Frick honorees Marty Brennaman, Denny Matthews, Jon Miller and Bob Uecker, with whom Hughes worked a dozen seasons before coming to Chicago.)
The problem is if Hughes doesn't get the Frick in 2020, he'll have to wait until 2023.
That's because the Hall a few years back embraced a three-year cycle for the award, and that's how long it will take to reconsider the so-called Major League Markets candidates.
This year, from the Broadcasting Beginnings pool of candidates, the late Al Helfer is being recognized for a career announcing games that began at age 16 with the Pirates in 1933. He also had stints with Reds, Yankees, Giants, Dodgers, Colt .45s and Athletics as well as a national radio gig with Mutual Broadcasting.
Two years ago, among National Voices, Bob Costas was picked over Al Michaels, Joe Buck, Dizzy Dean, Pee Wee Reese, Don Drysdale and others.
(Obviously, guys such as Michaels, Buck, Reese and Drysdale worked for teams at some point too. But see? Arguments!)
Meanwhile, Major League Markets announcers have been left hanging since 2017, when the committee picked Bill King, the late A's announcer, from a field of eight finalists that included Hughes and now-retired White Sox voice Ken "Hawk" Harrelson as well as former Cubs announcer Dewayne Staats (who now calls Rays games) and onetime Cubs pitcher Mike Krukow (with the Giants).
A very strong case can be made for Jacques Doucet, who also has been a finalist but hasn't gotten the call.
Before you say "who?" just know many consider Doucet French Canada's Vin Scully.
He now calls games in French for the Blue Jays, but for 33 years he was the French announcer for the Montreal Expos, a job that required him to create his own idiom.
One example, courtesy of a 2010 New York Times story, is his translation of "shoestring catch" to "vol au sol."
The Times said that means "theft at the ground," though Google Translate reads it more prosaically as "flight on the ground."
Either way, "vol au sol" is lyrical.
The Frick Award has gone to Spanish-language announcers Buck Canel in 1985, Jaime Jarrin in '98 and Felo Ramirez in '01. Longtime Padres voice Eduardo Ortega remains a contender, but Doucet would be truly novel.
It's hard to know whether there's lingering sentiment for Cardinals announcer Mike Shannon, the Mets' Gary Cohen or Staats, a major-league announcer for 40-plus seasons and with the Rays since their 1998 debut.
Krukow remains popular with the Giants, pushing on while battling the effects of inclusion body myositis, a muscular disorder. His announcing partner, Duane Kuiper, once was a finalist too.
Where do deceased former finalists such as Skip Caray, Ken Coleman and Ned Martin fit into the mix? And what of potential new finalists?
An excellent argument can be made on behalf of longtime Cubs and current White Sox analyst Steve Stone to be considered.
The 1980 Cy Young Award winner has been an excellent broadcaster from the day he made his debut with ABC's "Monday Night Baseball" in mid-1982, less than a week after he officially announced his retirement as a player.
Yankees announcer John Sterling has his critics, but the 81-year-old only recently ended a remarkable streak of 5,058 consecutive games, a run including postseason games that dated to 1989. Tough to ignore that.
Still, there's no one better than Hughes.
Anyone who doesn't agree is just asking for a fight.

Drogas: el nuevo atractivo “turístico” de la tolerante Nueva York que tiene las calles en jaque

Texto completo: Unas 600 mil personas cruzan a diario por la central de trenes Penn Station, en pleno Midtown de la ciudad de Nueva York.
Meca del turismo por diversas razones, Manhattan se ha convertido cada vez más en un destino para adictos a opioides y otras drogas , venidos desde diversas partes del país. Son visitantes sin planes de marcharse.
Nueva York tiene su propia crisis de adictos locales: las muertes por sobredosis aumentaron considerablemente en 2016 con la llegada del fentanilo, y las autoridades dicen que la ciudad se ha convertido en un centro para el opioide sintético ilegal. Pero aparte de El Bronx y Staten Island, la crisis tendía a ocultarse en gran medida de la vista del público, especialmente en Midtown.
Ya no es así en Penn Station, el terminal de autobuses de la Autoridad Portuaria, ambos en Midtown West; Jamaica Station en Queens y otros centros de tránsito masivo. Allí, los adictos buscan droga, piden dinero e incluso duermen en campamentos improvisados. Sus números aumentan a medida que el clima se vuelve más cálido, y su presencia recuerda una época más dura que se pensaba superada en Nueva York.
“Son refugiados drogadictos”, dijo a New York Times Dimitri Mugianis, consejero de NYHRE, organización sin fines de lucro que trabaja con adictos y sus familias para promover el uso seguro de drogas.
Mugianis dijo que los usuarios de opioides vienen a Nueva York en busca de drogas , pero también porque pueden encontrar más tolerancia y apoyo aquí que en sus lugares de origen, y un mayor acceso a servicios como clínicas y el intercambio de jeringas.
Los funcionarios de la ciudad dijeron que esta población es transitoria y no representa un aumento general en las filas de las personas sin hogar. Aún así, su creciente presencia es difícil de ignorar.
Barbara A. Blair, presidente de Garment District Alliance, que representa a empresas y dueños de propiedades en el área entre Penn Station y la Autoridad Portuaria, conocida como el “Distrito de la Moda”, dijo que a partir del verano pasado llegaron muchas más personas que parecían estar consumiendo drogas.
“Regresaron este año”, dijo Blair. “Están allí con sus carteles de cartón. Están desmayados”.
El Departamento de Policía de Nueva York, cuyo Buró de Tránsito patrulla el sistema de Metro, dijo que los arrestos por delitos relacionados con drogas aumentaron 55% hasta junio en las estaciones conectadas a Penn Station, Port Authority y Jamaica en Queens, en comparación con el mismo período del año pasado.
Ciertamente, la gente ha venido a Nueva York a comprar drogas durante décadas. Pero en el pasado normalmente regresaban a casa una vez que hacían una adquisición.
Ahora se están quedando más. La primera ola llegó a la ciudad desde Long Island, Nueva Jersey y Connecticut hace unos cinco años, según varias entrevistas.
Muchos dijeron que primero se habían vuelto adictos a los opioides recetados, pero que habían progresado a las drogas callejeras y estaban luchando contra las adicciones a la heroína cuando llegaron.
Grace Cohen arribó con su novio desde un suburbio de Atlanta el otoño pasado, después de haber luchado contra la adicción a los opiáceos y terminar sin hogar. “Hay más recursos para nosotros aquí”, dijo la joven de 19 años, en la entrada del Metro en West 42nd Street.
No sólo los vecinos y empresarios se quejan. Varias personas que han vivido en las calles de Midtown durante años dicen que ya no recogen suficiente dinero debido al aumento de la competencia de estos recién llegados.
Yolanda Rodríguez (30), residente de El Bronx, ha pasado varios años mendigando en West 40th Street, luchando contra enfermedades mentales y el uso de sustancias. La razón del crecimiento de la población, dijo, es obvia. “Drogas… Mira alrededor. Están por todas partes”.
People struggling with addiction have been appearing in greater numbers near New York City’s transit hubs https://t.co/9fajRkPTEa

Covering Protests Where Social Media Is Distrusted

Texto completo: How do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? Daniel Victor, a reporter in Hong Kong who covers news in Asia and overnight news in the United States, discussed the tech he's using.
What are your most important tech tools for doing your job?
My desktop assaults me with a terrible mess of information from far too many sources, and I like it almost as much as I hate it. To cope with that onslaught, or perhaps to enable it, I connect my MacBook Pro to two external monitors.
One is dedicated entirely to TweetDeck, which allows me to mainline Twitter in deeply unhealthy ways. When you open the Twitter app on your phone, you see a single column of tweets; now imagine you had 14 similar columns with individual, narrow focuses, all updating in real time. That's what TweetDeck does for me, with custom lists I've created of news organizations, Hong Kong tweeters, my personal friends, Times journalists, and Philadelphia 76ers reporters and fans. It's out of control.
But that's not the only way I suffocate myself, as I almost always have several dozen tabs open in Google Chrome. When I'm feeling truly overwhelmed, I use the OneTab extension to close them all but produce a handy list of links to each page I just closed. It can be a lifesaver.
I still cover quite a bit of news in the United States, just from a different time zone, so my other tech needs are built around pretending I'm still there.
If your phone was ringing and you saw the call was from an unknown number in another country, would you pick up? Many of the sources I'm calling probably wouldn't, I figure. Luckily, Google Voice allowed me to keep my American cellphone number -- I can place free calls from Gmail on my desktop and it'll show up on caller ID as the same central Pennsylvania number I've had for years.
I also encounter some crucial websites that are available only inside the United States. I use NordVPN, a virtual private network, to trick the websites into giving me access.
What have you noticed about the difference between the way people use tech in Hong Kong versus the United States?
SMS is no longer part of my life. Instead, WhatsApp is universally used here for texting, both by my friends and sources. This is very common almost everywhere outside the United States, I've learned, and I've had to talk many of my American friends into using it to keep in touch.
Hong Kong uses Octopus, a contactless card, for its subway system, and it can also be used at 7-Elevens and many restaurants. It's very handy. I also find there are more businesses that take Apple Pay -- I don't use my physical credit card nearly as often as I used to.
There are a few things I wish I could have from back home. I deeply miss Venmo for settling small debts between friends, like a happy hour tab, and Google Maps has a nasty habit here of placing me about a block away from where I am, making it much less useful.
You recently covered some of the Hong Kong protests over the extradition law. How did marchers use tech?
The demonstrations thus far have been mostly leaderless -- there's no single person or organization deciding what comes next. Instead, they're directly voting on what actions to take by participating in online discussion forums, the most popular one being LIHKG.
An individual will post with a suggested course of action, like protesting outside a specific building at a specific time. Other participants can upvote or downvote the post, and when a post gets enough attention, they solidify those plans.
They've also used messaging apps like Telegram to communicate those plans and organize logistics, but a lot of protesters are wary of it after the police arrested the administrator of a group that had 20,000 members. There's a lot of fear that the government will use their digital footprint against them.
A lot of protesters also share important information through the AirDrop feature of iPhones. I was anonymously sent two images while covering a demonstration, and I've had friends report they've been dropped images while commuting on the train.
Another key difference is in how they have a far more hands-off approach to social media than any comparable effort in the United States would. Whereas a lot of demonstrations in the United States would be grist for selfies and Instagram-ready signs, protesters here are very concerned the government could identify their faces in photos and later charge them with crimes. Many hide behind surgical masks and would never post evidence of themselves taking part. They discourage people, even news photographers, from taking photos where faces are identifiable. It's not built for gaining likes, and they trust exposure will come through the larger messaging.
You have been learning Cantonese. What apps and online programs have helped with that?
Since I'm still awful at it, I use an app called Hong Kong Taxi Cards to show taxi drivers an image with my desired address written in Cantonese.
Pleco is handy for quick translations, and includes audio files so I can come close to getting the pronunciation right. Google Translate has been pretty handy for audio translations whenever I travel.
Outside of work, what's your favorite tech gadget or app and what do you use it for?
I love One Second Everyday, an app that will cobble together a video of one-second snippets. I found it a great way to smash together a year's worth of memories when I wrote about using it in 2015, and I'm doing it again this year to document my first year in Hong Kong. I may annoy my friends by taking videos every time we're together, but it'll be worth it.
Can you please bid us adieu in Cantonese?
Bai baai! (It sounds just like bye-bye.)
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - John Paul Stevens, the bow-tied, independent-thinking, Republican-nominated justice who unexpectedly emerged as the Supreme Court's leading liberal, died Tuesday in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, after suffering a stroke Monday. He was 99.
During nearly 35 years on the court, Stevens stood for the freedom and dignity of individuals, be they students or immigrants or prisoners. He acted to limit the death penalty, squelch official prayer in schools, establish gay rights, promote racial equality and preserve legal abortion. He protected the rights of crime suspects and illegal immigrants facing deportation.
He influenced fellow justices to give foreign terrorism suspects held for years at the Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, naval base the right to plead for their release in U.S. courts.
Stevens served more than twice the average tenure for a justice, and was only the second to mark his 90th birthday on the high court.
From his appointment by President Gerald Ford in 1975 through his retirement in June 2010, he shaped decisions that touched countless aspects of American life.
He remained an active writer and speaker into his late 90s, surprising some when he came out against Justice Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation following Kavanaugh's angry denial of sexual assault allegations. Stevens wrote an autobiography, "The Making of a Justice: My First 94 Years, that was released just after his 99th birthday in April 2019.
At first considered a centrist, Stevens came to be seen as a lion of liberalism. But he rejected that characterization.
"I don't think of myself as a liberal at all, Stevens told The New York Times in 2007. "I think as part of my general politics, I'm pretty darn conservative.
The way Stevens saw it, he held to the same ground, but the court had shifted steadily to the right over the decades, creating the illusion that he was moving leftward.
He did change his views on some issues, however. He morphed from a critic of affirmative action to a supporter, and came to believe the death penalty was wrong.
His legal reasoning was often described as unpredictable or idiosyncratic, especially in his early years on the court. He was a prolific writer of separate opinions laying out his own thinking, whether he agreed or disagreed with the majority's ruling. Yet Stevens didn't consider his methods novel. He tended toward a case-by-case approach, avoided sweeping judicial philosophies, and stayed mindful of precedent.
The white-haired Stevens, eyes often twinkling behind owlish glasses, was the picture of old-fashioned geniality on the court and off. He took an unusually courteous tone with lawyers arguing their cases, but he was no pushover. After his fellow justices fired off questions, Stevens would politely weigh in. "May I ask a question? he'd ask gently, then quickly slice to the weakest point of a lawyer's argument.
Stevens was especially concerned with the plight of ordinary citizens up against the government or other powerful interests - a type of struggle he witnessed as a boy.
He voiced only one regret about his Supreme Court career: that he had supported reinstating the death penalty in 1976. More than three decades later, Stevens publicly declared his opposition to capital punishment, saying that years of bad court decisions had overlooked racial bias, favored prosecutors and otherwise undermined his expectation that death sentences could be handed down fairly.
One of his harshest dissents came when the court lifted restrictions on spending by corporations and unions to sway elections. He called the 2010 ruling "a rejection of the common sense of the American people and a threat to democracy.
As he read parts of that opinion aloud, Stevens' voice wavered uncharacteristically and he repeatedly stumbled over words. For the 90-year-old who'd worried he wouldn't know when to bow out, it was a signal. "That was the day I decided to resign, Stevens said later.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - John Paul Stevens, the bow-tied, independent-thinking, Republican-nominated justice who unexpectedly emerged as the Supreme Court’s leading liberal, died Tuesday in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, after suffering a stroke Monday. He was 99.
During nearly 35 years on the court, Stevens stood for the freedom and dignity of individuals, be they students or immigrants or prisoners. He acted to limit the death penalty, squelch official prayer in schools, establish gay rights, promote racial equality and preserve legal abortion. He protected the rights of crime suspects and illegal immigrants facing deportation.
He influenced fellow justices to give foreign terrorism suspects held for years at the Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, naval base the right to plead for their release in U.S. courts.
Stevens served more than twice the average tenure for a justice, and was only the second to mark his 90th birthday on the high court. From his appointment by President Gerald Ford in 1975 through his retirement in June 2010, he shaped decisions that touched countless aspects of American life.
“He brought to our bench an inimitable blend of kindness, humility, wisdom and independence. His unrelenting commitment to justice has left us a better nation,” Chief Justice John Roberts said in a statement.
He remained an active writer and speaker into his late 90s, surprising some when he came out against Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s confirmation following Kavanaugh’s angry denial of sexual assault allegations. Stevens wrote an autobiography, “The Making of a Justice: My First 94 Years,” that was released just after his 99th birthday in April 2019.
At first considered a centrist, Stevens came to be seen as a lion of liberalism. But he rejected that characterization.
“I don’t think of myself as a liberal at all,” Stevens told The New York Times in 2007. “I think as part of my general politics, I’m pretty darn conservative.”
The way Stevens saw it, he held to the same ground, but the court had shifted steadily to the right over the decades, creating the illusion that he was moving leftward.
He did change his views on some issues, however. He morphed from a critic of affirmative action to a supporter, and came to believe the death penalty was wrong.
His legal reasoning was often described as unpredictable or idiosyncratic, especially in his early years on the court. He was a prolific writer of separate opinions laying out his own thinking, whether he agreed or disagreed with the majority’s ruling. Yet Stevens didn’t consider his methods novel. He tended toward a case-by-case approach, avoided sweeping judicial philosophies, and stayed mindful of precedent.
The white-haired Stevens, eyes often twinkling behind owlish glasses, was the picture of old-fashioned geniality on the court and off. He took an unusually courteous tone with lawyers arguing their cases, but he was no pushover. After his fellow justices fired off questions, Stevens would politely weigh in. “May I ask a question?” he’d ask gently, then quickly slice to the weakest point of a lawyer’s argument.
Stevens was especially concerned with the plight of ordinary citizens up against the government or other powerful interests - a type of struggle he witnessed as a boy.
When he was 14, his father, owner of a grand but failing Chicago hotel, was wrongly convicted of embezzlement. Ernest Stevens was vindicated on appeal, but decades later his son would say the family’s ordeal taught him that justice can misfire.
More often, however, Stevens credited his sensitivity to abuses of power by police and prosecutors to what he learned while representing criminal defendants in pro bono cases as a young Chicago lawyer.
He voiced only one regret about his Supreme Court career: that he had supported reinstating the death penalty in 1976. More than three decades later, Stevens publicly declared his opposition to capital punishment, saying that years of bad court decisions had overlooked racial bias, favored prosecutors and otherwise undermined his expectation that death sentences could be handed down fairly.
One of his harshest dissents came when the court lifted restrictions on spending by corporations and unions to sway elections. He called the 2010 ruling “a rejection of the common sense of the American people” and a threat to democracy.
As he read parts of that opinion aloud, Stevens’ voice wavered uncharacteristically and he repeatedly stumbled over words. For the 90-year-old who’d worried he wouldn’t know when to bow out, it was a signal. “That was the day I decided to resign,” Stevens said later. He also disclosed in his autobiography that he had suffered a mini-stroke.
The retirement of Stevens, known as a defender of strict separation of church and state, notably left the high court without a single Protestant member for the first time.
“I guess I’m the last WASP,” he joked, saying the issue was irrelevant to the justices’ work. Justice Neil Gorsuch, who joined the court in 2017, was raised Catholic, but attends a Protestant church.
A great-grandfather, Stevens eased into an active retirement of writing and speaking, still fit for swimming and tennis in Fort Lauderdale, where he and his second wife, Maryan, kept a home away from Washington.
He is survived by two daughters, Elizabeth and Susan, who were with him when he died. Other survivors include nine grandchildren and 13 great-grandchildren. Stevens’ first wife, Elizabeth, second wife, Maryan, and two children died before him. Funeral arrangements are pending, the Supreme Court said in a statement announcing his death. But he is expected to be buried in Arlington National Cemetery, next to Maryan.
Born in 1920, Stevens was a privileged child of a bygone era: He met Amelia Earhart and Charles Lindbergh at the family hotel and was at the ballpark when Babe Ruth hit his famous “called-shot” home run in the 1932 World Series.
He joined the Navy the day before the attack on Pearl Harbor, and was awarded the Bronze Star for his service with a Japanese code-breaking team. The code breakers’ work enabled the U.S. to shoot down a plane carrying the commander of the Japanese Navy, and that targeted wartime killing later contributed to his misgivings about the death penalty.
After World War II, Stevens graduated first in his class at Northwestern University’s law school and clerked for Supreme Court Justice Wiley Rutledge. As a lawyer he became an antitrust expert, experience he brought to Supreme Court rulings such as one ending the NCAA’s control over televised college football games.
President Richard Nixon appointed Stevens, a lifelong Republican, to the federal appeals court in Chicago. Judge Stevens was considered a moderate conservative when Ford - whose nominee would need the approval of a Democratic-controlled Senate - chose him for the Supreme Court.
Stevens won unanimous confirmation after uneventful hearings nothing like today’s partisan shows. Stevens’ liberal bent once on the high court was “different than I envisioned,” Ford acknowledged decades later, but he still supported and praised him as “a very good legal scholar.”
Stevens’ influence reached its height after other liberals retired in the early 1990s, leaving him the senior associate justice and the court’s leader on the left. For a dozen years after, he proved adept at drawing swing votes from Republican appointees Sandra Day O’Connor and Anthony Kennedy, often frustrating conservative Chief Justice William Rehnquist.
Stevens’ clout diminished after Roberts arrived in 2005 and O’Connor was replaced by the more conservative Samuel Alito. But he didn’t lose spirit. Throughout his career, Stevens unleashed some of his most memorable language in defeat.
He wrote a scathing dissent in Bush v. Gore, the 2000 case that ended Florida’s presidential recount and anointed George W. Bush: “Although we may never know with complete certainty the identity of the winner of this year’s presidential election, the identity of the loser is perfectly clear. It is the nation’s confidence in the judge as an impartial guardian of the rule of law.”

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez are in talks to set up a face-to-face meeting with each other, amid intra-party tension between the two Democratic lawmakers.
Pelosi spokesman Drew Hamill said Ocasio-Cortez's office reached out Tuesday afternoon for a one-on-one meeting.
During an interview with New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd earlier this month, Pelosi downplayed four votes from a group of progressive Democrats against a border funding bill.
Reps. Ocasio-Cortez, D-N. Y. , Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass. , Ilhan Omar, D-Minn. , and Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich. , all voted against the bill. The four congresswomen of color are colloquially known as "The Squad. "
"We are working to schedule this meeting," Hamill said of Pelosi meeting with Ocasio-Cortez, adding that the speaker's chief of staff has already met with the four chiefs of these offices.
In an interview with CBS News broadcast Wednesday, Ocasio-Cortez said she "absolutely" wants to meet with Pelosi.

Pelosi in the New York Times said of The Squad: “All these people have their public whatever and their Twitter world. But they didn’t have any following. They’re four people and that’s how many votes they got. ”
Since then, some members of "The Squad" have individually responded to the speaker's remarks on Twitter.
That prompted Pelosi in a closed-door meeting to warn Democratic lawmakers that if any lawmaker had an issue within the party, they should come directly to her and not tweet about it.
During an interview with the Washington Post last week, Ocasio-Cortez accused Pelosi of "singling out of newly elected women of color. " The next day, she told CNN that she "absolutely" did not believe Pelosi was racist.
Since then, however, the tension between Pelosi and the Squad has been drowned out by days of tweets and attacks on the four progressive lawmakers by President Donald Trump.
Trump on Sunday tweeted that the four lawmakers should "go back" to their countries, and has since doubled down several times on his attacks and criticisms of the Democrats. Three of the congresswomen were born in the United States. Omar immigrated to the U. S. over 20 years ago from Somalia and is a naturalized U. S. citizen.
The House voted Tuesday to condemn Trump's comments as racist, by a 240-187 vote.
During the CBS interview, Ocasio-Cortez said she did not believe there is a fracture in the Democratic Party.
"I think that just as there were members of Congress that did not vote for the speaker on the House Floor the day of our swearing-in, just as there are members who challenge her conclusions, who disagree with her, so do we from time-to-time," she said. "But that does not mean that there is a fundamental fracture or a dehumanizing going on within our caucus. "

More Affordable Housing, but Report Finds More Racial Segregation

For more than two years, lawyers for New York City have fought to keep secret a report on the city's affordable housing lotteries, arguing that its release would insert an unfavorable and "potentially incorrect analysis into the public conversation."
The report was finally released on Monday, following a federal court ruling, and its findings were stark: The city's policy of giving preference to local residents for new affordable housing helps perpetuate racial segregation.
White neighborhoods stay white, black neighborhoods black, the report found.
The findings by Andrew A. Beveridge, a sociology professor at Queens College, presented a far different picture than the one offered by Mayor Bill de Blasio, who has touted his record on housing as he runs for president.
Indeed, they suggested that Mr. de Blasio's vast expansion of affordable housing might well come with an asterisk: It is deepening entrenched racial housing patterns.
Professor Beveridge analyzed data from 7.2 million affordable housing applications for 10,245 city-subsidized apartments from 2012 to 2017. He did so on behalf of plaintiffs in a lawsuit brought by three black women from Brooklyn and Queens who said they were not given a fair chance to win affordable apartments in city-managed lotteries.
The report looked at 168 city-administered lotteries along with demographic and other information about applicants, comparing that to census data for the areas surrounding the affordable housing apartments being offered.
In each case, Professor Beveridge found that the majority group -- whether white, black Hispanic or Asian -- enjoyed a strong advantage over the other racial groups because of the city's policy.
Moreover, because it is a first-come-first-served system, by the time applicants from other areas of the city might want to move into an area, the apartments that they would qualify for have sometimes already been taken by local residents, he found in the 31-page report, a preliminary version of which was first filed in 2017.
The issue of segregation has become a political flash point in New York City, particularly as the schools chancellor, Richard Carranza, has moved to address racial divisions in city schools. Mr. de Blasio has struggled to find his footing on the issue, and has long argued that racial segregation in city schools can be traced to housing patterns.
The lawsuit in federal court is focused on a city policy, dating back to the 1980s, that gives local residents priority in the affordable housing lotteries. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg expanded the preference to 50 percent of the apartments.
The plaintiffs, represented by Craig Gurian of the nonprofit Anti-Discrimination Center, argue that the policy does not meet federal fair housing requirements. In fact, they argue, the approach exacerbates racial segregation and impedes integration, a finding that Professor Beveridge's report supported.
"The problem here is that the city takes the luck of the draw and then fixes the deck, and fixes it in a way that it knows will cause a racially disparate impact," Mr. Gurian said.
Vicki Been, who ran much of the city's affordable housing program and is now a deputy mayor for housing, rejected the idea that the city's policy violated federal law or exacerbated residential segregation, observing that the beneficiaries of the city's housing lottery system were largely black and Hispanic.
"Segregation is a question of choice, and people who chose to live in a neighborhood, we believe, should be able to choose to stay in a neighborhood," she said in an interview on Monday. "We shouldn't be telling people you have to move to some other neighborhood."
She added that one reason for the local preference policy is to address the fear of displacement in communities, particularly when new housing is being built.
"If they fear displacement, they will oppose the housing," she said. "And the only way that we get a more integrated city is if we have more affordable housing across a wider range of neighborhoods. If people fear that they're going to be pushed out of their neighborhood, they will not accept housing."
City Hall on Monday also released its rebuttal report, which had been completed last month.
The question of whether the policy has a racially disparate impact should be considered across the whole city, not neighborhood by neighborhood, argued the city's statistics expert, Bernard R. Siskin. The policy has no disparate racial impact citywide in part because, as Mr. Beveridge also recognized, every racial group is helped somewhere, wrote Mr. Siskin.
Even before Monday's release of the dueling reports, the case, filed in the Federal District Court in Manhattan in 2015, had already drawn out extraordinary admissions from the mayor and high-level officials in his administration.
Ms. Been admitted in a deposition that she would not choose the policy if her only goal was to reduce segregation.
Mr. de Blasio, in successfully resisting being deposed himself, argued in a signed declaration last year that he had little to do with housing policy. "While I am sometimes briefed on specific decisions being made by an agency, I typically do not have unique knowledge on the subject," he said in court papers.
The data being considered in the case covers 7.2 million applications by more than 700,000 unique households, an indication that those who fail to get housing apply again and again, often far from their current homes.
"The allocation of affordable housing units perpetuates segregation more (and allows integration less) than what would be the case without the policy," Professor Beveridge, who is also a demographic consultant for The New York Times, wrote.
The city had successfully argued for Professor Beveridge's report to be sealed during discovery. But with that phase of the case ending, Magistrate Judge Katharine H. Parker wrote on Friday that the city now had to make the report public.
With a trial on the horizon, and his own presidential hopes on the line, Mr. de Blasio has hinted that he would be open to settling the case -- possibly by changing the policy.
On Monday, Ms. Been reiterated that possibility, saying the city could include reducing the percentage of apartments set aside for neighborhood residents.
"How far down will you go -- that obviously has to be a calculation," she said.

Texto completo: The fraud usually starts the same way: Someone claiming to be a lofty entertainment executive makes a phone call, sends a text or drafts an email offering an enticing job on the other side of the world.
Some of the unwitting industry professionals who receive the offers -- photographers, writers, stunt performers, makeup artists, security reps and others -- end up flying to Indonesia and spending thousands of dollars up front on flights, a driver and other services, believing they will be reimbursed. They never see their money again.
The F.B.I. issued a warning on Monday, saying it was looking for victims in these cases. The Hollywood Reporter, which first broke the news last year, refers to the unknown perpetrator as the "Con Queen of Hollywood." According to an article it published on Monday, several high-profile executives have been impersonated, including Kathleen Kennedy, the Lucasfilm president; Victoria Alonso, a Marvel executive; Amy Pascal, the former chairwoman of Sony Pictures; Wendi Deng Murdoch, the businesswoman and film producer; and Sarah Finn, a casting director.
Todd Hemmen, assistant special agent in charge at the F.B.I.'s San Diego office, where the investigation is centered, said potential victims need to be cautious about offers involving trips to Indonesia, the only country that has come up as a destination so far. Providing money up front is an arrangement that does not usually raise red flags in the entertainment industry, he added, so it is imperative to verify that a potential employer is who they claim to be.
"The fraudsters appeared to do a very thorough job of both vetting the background of their fictitious identity, so knowing a lot about the individual they're representing themselves to be, and also a thorough job on vetting the work done by many of the defrauded victims," Mr. Hemmen said in an interview with The New York Times.
"Please be advised this is an ongoing scam, and individuals who have plans to travel to Indonesia for a job opportunity in the entertainment industry should perform additional research and proceed with caution," the F.B.I. said in a news release on Monday. The agency has an online form for people who think they might have been a victim of this swindle as far back as 2013.
Nicoletta Kotsianas, senior director of K2 Intelligence, an investigations firm with headquarters in New York, said in an interview Monday that her company believed that the fraudulent offers were being made by an individual. K2 has been looking into the case since 2017 on behalf of some industry executives who say they have been impersonated.
As for the individuals being defrauded, if they are looking for work and have contact information available online, they can be easy for criminals to find, Ms. Kotsianas said.
While the F.B.I. would not provide estimates of how many people had been duped or how much money they had lost, Ms. Kotsianas said K2 had spoken to about 100 victims. Some have lost around $ 3,000, which typically accounts for airline tickets and an Indonesian driver, she said. In other cases, the losses have extended to $ 150,000 for those who made multiple trips to Indonesia and believed they were deeply involved in projects that later proved to be nonexistent. On average, she added, the victims she knew about had lost $ 15,000 to $ 20,000.
Some of the phone calls have veered in a sexually explicit direction, Ms. Kotsianas said, which has set off warning bells for some targets.
"If things like that are going on, clearly that should be a red flag," she added.
Performing some due diligence in trying to verify the caller's identity prevented many others from getting caught up in the scheme, Ms. Kotsianas added.
"For every person that we heard from who went to Indonesia," she said, "there were 20 who got the calls."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Trump focuses on race, returning to his electoral strategy ahead of 2020

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — President Trump appears to have settled on a 2020 reelection strategy — and it looks a lot like his old playbook.
With a Sunday Twitter screed telling four first-term House lawmakers of color to “go back" to their countries, Trump signaled that stirring up racial animus will continue to be a key part of his strategy to reactivate his base heading into what's likely to be a fierce reelection battle.
This worked for him last time, as voters delivered Trump a victory after he called for a wall on the Mexican border, expressed a desire to ban all Muslims from entering the country, and made a name for himself questioning Barack Obama's citizenship. But the political ground has shifted under Trump's feet since then. By fanning these same flames, he now risks activating the voters who delivered House Democrats a victory in the 2018 midterms — the same wave that swept the four women he's targeting into power in the first place.
“The strategy was an epic failure in the midterms and not just because women in Orange County didn't like it — they failed in many working-class white areas too," said Ian Russell, the former political director of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. “There was a flop at the box office and for some reason they greenlit a sequel."
On Tuesday, the House voted 240-187 to condemn Trump's “racist comments," with four Republicans joining all the Democrats.
Trump doesn't appear to be sweating the possibility of electoral damage from his comments, despite widespread criticism of his attack on Representatives Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, who call themselves “the Squad." All are US citizens — three of them born here — and yet Trump said they should “go back" to their “broken and crime infested" countries — a suggestion that was widely panned as racist.
“It doesn't concern me because many people agree with me," Trump said Monday, when asked whether he was worried about white nationalists supporting his argument.
Still, many on Trump's staff appeared to struggle to defend his choice of words, with some arguing that Trump only meant the lawmakers should visit other countries and then come back. “What's your ethnicity?" Kellyanne Conway asked of a reporter in the White House driveway Tuesday in one awkward exchange. “My ancestors are from Ireland and Italy."
On Tuesday, Trump indicated that his broadside was all part of a master plan to elevate the four women who are further to the left than many in the party, and to seize upon tensions between them and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ahead of the 2020 election.
“Nancy Pelosi tried to push them away, but now they are forever wedded to the Democrat Party," he tweeted of the four women. “See you in 2020!"
Republican political strategists expressed skepticism that Trump's original tweets were part of any kind of carefully planned strategy. (A spokeswoman for the Trump campaign declined to comment.)
“My guess is he was bored on Sunday morning and wanted to start a fight," said Alex Conant, a Republican strategist who worked on Senator Marco Rubio's 2016 presidential campaign.
But they do see potential in the tactic of making the four progressive lawmakers the face of the Democratic Party in 2020, given that one, Ocasio-Cortez, identifies as a democratic socialist. “The tactics are deeply flawed but the Squad makes an excellent foil for Trump," Conant said.
Trump has attacked some of the Democrats vying for the 2020 nomination — tossing out “sleepy Joe Biden" and calling Senator Kamala Harris “nasty" — but nothing has seemed to stick.
“He wants to contrast with some of the more liberal elements of the party and that's why he's picked this group of liberal congresswomen," said Ryan Williams, a former staffer on Mitt Romney's presidential run, who added that he doesn't support the way in which the president attacked the women.
There's a long tradition of presidents and politicians creating foils who they think are easier to run against than the candidate who actually appears on the ticket. President Bill Clinton tied his opponent Bob Dole to the unpopular Republican Speaker Newt Gingrich. And former Senate majority leader Harry Reid used the specter of the billionaire donor Koch brothers to motivate Democrats in key Senate races.
Conservatives are already signaling that the Squad will be their foil for 2020. Fox News focuses on them, and particularly Ocasio-Cortez, so much that the satirical Onion website joked the cable network was debuting a premium channel featuring 24-hour coverage of her.
Democrats are skeptical that strategy will pay off, betting that instead, Trump targeting four progressive women of color will only motivate their side. In the midterm elections, Democrats were able to pick up Republican districts in part by motivating suburban voters who were turned off by Trump's incendiary comments.
“As far as we're concerned, he declared war," said LaTosha Brown, the cofounder of Black Voters Matter, a political group designed to expand the black vote. “Women are going to organize and activate."
Far from worrying about the political fallout of elevating the Squad, Democratic activists see danger in the original cracks in party unity that Trump seized upon. The controversy began when Pelosi told The New York Times earlier this month that the four lawmakers have their “Twitter world" but no “following" within the House, following a dispute when the Squad didn't back a compromise bill for border funding Pelosi had put forward.
Ocasio-Cortez shot back that Pelosi was singling out four women of color, which led to another round of recriminations.
It highlighted the division between Pelosi's pragmatism — which is fueled by a need to reelect the moderate Democrats who created her House majority — with the more confrontational, and impatient, liberal wing of the party.
Trump's attack has papered over that division for now, with Pelosi leading the charge to censure the president for his words. But the stylistic and ideological differences remain, and further infighting could be a drain on Democratic enthusiasm in 2020.
Getting those voters, including young people and people of color, to the polls would be crucial to Democratic victories.
“The big risk is for Nancy Pelosi to give an opening to Trump," said Aimee Allison, the founder of She the People, a national advocacy network of women of color. “I don't fear Trump's base of voters expanding as much as I do the core voters and women of color not to be motivated and to feel like the Democratic Party doesn't have our best interest in mind."

ICE captura a migrantes en Home Depot y toca a puertas de madrugada. Esta joven supo cómo responderles

Texto completo: El presidente, Donald Trump , aseguró el lunes que “muchos, muchos” inmigrantes fueron capturados el domingo por el Servicio de Inmigración y Control de Aduanas (ICE, en inglés) en el primer día de la operación con la que planeaba arrestar a al menos 2,000 personas.
Hasta el momento no se han tenido noticia de detenciones masivas, pese a que tanto los migrantes (aterrorizados, y escondidos en sus casas) como los activistas (en guardia, defendiendo los derechos de los afectados) están en alerta máxima.
“Simplemente, ustedes no conocen lo que ha sucedido”, explicó Trump sobre esta falta de noticias sobre arrestos. “Fue un día muy exitoso, pero no vieron mucho de lo que pasó”, añadió el presidente, sin citar cifras concretas.
La operación, que debería llevarse a cabo durante toda la semana en nueve ciudades (Atlanta, Baltimore, Chicago, Denver, Houston, Los Ángeles, Miami, Nueva York y San Francisco), puede ganar fuerza en cualquier momento.
Y ICE, en cualquier caso, no ha dejado de arrestar a inmigrantes.
Entre el 7 de julio y el pasado jueves, por ejemplo, detuvo a docenas de personas en Los Ángeles. La semana pasada, arrestó a 20 migrantes, la mayoría con antecedentes criminales, en San Diego. El lunes capturó a seis más en una redada en un edificio de apartamentos de Houston (Texas).
En Estados Unidos hay 10,5 millones de indocumentados. ICE cifra en 565.892 los fugitivo s (migrantes que han desobedecido una orden final de expulsión).
La agencia federal arrestó a 160,000 personas (440 al día) en el año fiscal de 2018, y deportó a 256,000 (700 al día). Es decir, en una semana normal detiene a más de 2.000 migrantes y deporta a casi 4,000, cifras muy similares a las anunciadas para la operación de esta semana.
Si se cree en peligro, recuerde sus derechos y siga los consejos de activistas sobre qué hacer si se ve involucrado en una redada.
Agentes de ICE tocaron a la puerta de una vivienda en Passaic (Nueva Jersey) el domingo a la una de la madrugada, según cuenta el diario The New York Times. Despertaron a una joven adolescente, pero gracias a que había leído una información en Internet sobre qué hacer en estos casos, decidió no abrir.
“Dijeron, ‘tenemos que hablar contigo, ¿puedes salir, puedes abrir la puerta?’. Yo dije, ‘¿tienen permiso para entrar en mi casa, tienen un papel?’”, explicó la joven. “Ellos dijeron, ‘no estamos intentando entrar en tu casa, sólo queremos hablar contigo’, y yo dije, ‘no, no voy a salir”, añadió.
Los agentes regresaron a las cinco de la madrugada, pero la joven se escondió con sus padres hasta que se fueron, según cuenta el diario.
No fue la única redada.
“Hablan del domingo, pero no necesitamos esperar al domingo, ya están deteniendo a inmigrantes”, explicó la activista Nora Sandigo a la cadena NBC.
Según contó, el viernes fueron detenidos cinco hombres en el área de Homestead (Florida), al menos uno de ellos en su casa y otro mientras esperaba a las puertas de un centro comercial Home Depot esperando trabajo en la construcción.
Se trata de un guatemalteco que lleva 16 años en el país y tiene cinco hijos de entre dos y 16 años. “Es totalmente injusto”, explicó Sandigo, “es el que trae el dinero a la familia, una buena persona sin problemas con la ley, su único problema es que no tiene papeles”.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – The House formally condemned President Donald Trump’s Twitter posts as racist on Tuesday – in a vote split largely along party lines despite pressure for Republicans to denounce the president’s attacks on four Democratic congresswomen of color that they should "go back" to where they came from.
The vote on the resolution condemning a series of Trump’s remarks and Twitter posts came after a dramatic and combative hours-long debate that hit several snags due to long-standing House rules that prohibit any personal attacks on the president.
The vote, 240-187, fell nearly entirely along party lines with only four Republicans voting with Democrats. The four Republicans lawmakers are: Rep. Will Hurd of Texas, Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania, Rep. Fred Upton of Michigan and retiring Rep. Susan Brooks of Indiana. Rep. Justin Amash of Michigan, who recently left the GOP to become an independent, also voted in support of the resolution.
The resolution specifically called Trump's comments about "The Squad" — Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N. Y. ; Ilhan Omar, D-Minn. ; Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass. ; and Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich. — "racist" and says the attacks have "legitimized fear and hatred of new Americans and people of color. "
Everything we know: Trump triples down on his controversial tweets about 'The Squad. '
Reparations bill: Calling racism the 'poison of America,' Schumer backs reparations bill
The vote put Republicans on the record as to whether they denounced the president's comments or stuck beside him. Throughout Tuesday's debates Democrats aimed to pressure Republicans to hold Trump accountable while Republicans resisted, denouncing the resolution as a political ploy.
The intense debate over the president's rhetoric led to the House halting proceedings for nearly two hours after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called Trump's comments “racist” and a top Republican asked her remarks be taken down.
"These comments from the White House are disgraceful and disgusting and these comments are racist," Pelosi said. "Every single member of this institution — Democratic and Republican — should join us in condemning the president’s racist tweets. To do anything less would be a shocking rejection of our values and a shameful abdication of our oath of office to protect the American people. "
Editorial: Trump's racist rants are too offensive to overlook
As Pelosi called the president’s tweets racist, Rep. Doug Collins, R-Ga. , tried to interrupt and cut off her speech. Pelosi only spoke louder, looking down at her prepared remarks.
After Pelosi was done, Collins looked wide-eyed at Pelosi and asked if she wanted to "rephrase that comment. " Pelosi shot back: "I have cleared my remarks with the parliamentarian before I read them. " House Democrats started cheering and clapping.
The move led to two hours of delay as officials debated over whether Pelosi violated House rules, which the House ruled she had. Rep. Emanuel Cleaver, D-Mo. , who was presiding over the House floor at the time, abdicated his post due to the dramatic fighting on both sides.
"We don’t ever, ever want to pass up, it seems, an opportunity to escalate. That’s what this is,” he said, noting that he tried to remain fair. But, he said. “fairness isn’t enough. We want to just fight. "
“I’ll abandon the chair,” Cleaver said, slamming the gavel on the dais and storming away as House officials watched in amazement.
The moment was replayed on loop on C-SPAN like a moment from an NFL game with reporters left with their jaws dropped remarking aloud whether this had happened before. A large crowd of journalists gathered in the gallery overlooking the House floor to watch the debate.
Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Mass. , and chairman of the House Rules Committee, also got in a heated back-and-forth with Republicans after he attacked the president's comments in a speech as something that "used to be reserved for the darkest corners of the internet. "
More on resolution: House resolution will condemn Trump's 'disgusting' attacks on AOC, Tlaib, Omar and Pressley
Trump should 'aim higher': Lindsey Graham and other Republicans respond to Trump's 'go back' tweets
"This is proudly using Twitter as a megaphone to attack fellow Americans," he said. "These are American citizens being turned into some kind of scary 'other,' not because of their party, but because of their background, their race and their opinions. "
He added: "I implore my colleagues to think twice before you follow the president off a cliff. "
Rep. Rob Woodall, R-Ga. , took issue with McGovern's comments, saying they clearly violated rules and were "diminishing" the institution of the House of Representatives.
Pelosi told members of her caucus Tuesday morning she wasn't worried about House rules on calling out the president's comments, describing the four congresswomen as their "sisters" and saying Trump's "words were racist," according to an aide in the room.
She added that she hoped Republicans would join them in condemning the comments by voting in a bipartisan fashion for the resolution.
"If they can’t support condemning the words of the President, well that’s a message in and of itself," Pelosi said, according to the source.
Most Republicans did not condemn the president and Republican leaders in both the House and Senate refused to do so throughout the day Tuesday, alleging the outcry is over politics.
“Let’s not be false about what is happening here today,” said GOP minority leader Kevin McCarthy. “This is all about politics and beliefs of ideologies. "
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell declined to call the comments racist and specifically said "the president's not a racist. "
"Our words do matter. We all know politics is a contact sport. But it's about time we lowered the temperature all across the board," said McConnell, R-Ky. "All of us ought to contribute to a better level of discourse. "
After Tuesday's vote, Republicans said they felt the day was wasted talking about the president instead of working to settle issues that will help the American people.
"This resolution divides our nation and distracts us from addressing the issues the American people sent us here to solve," Republican Whip Steve Scalise, R-La. , said. "It's time House Democrats start focusing on the real problems facing the American people, instead of their own. "
Rep. Dan Newhouse, R-Wash. , said the debate and chaos the resolution caused on the House floor left him "struggling. " He said, to him, this debate "is not about race. "
"It should be about the issues that we disagree on, trying to come together and find common ground," Newhouse said. "That’s what I’m looking forward to try to find some respectful discourse and some civility out of all this. "
Along with the resolution, Rep. Steve Cohen, D-Tenn. , introduced a measure that would censure Trump for his racist comments. Democrats aren't expected to take up the measure for a vote, instead hoping the resolution on Tuesday would garner bipartisan support.
Trump wrote on Sunday that it was "so interesting to see 'Progressive' Democrat Congresswomen, who originally came from countries whose governments are a complete and total catastrophe" now telling the U. S. how to run its government. He did not mention Ocasio-Cortez, Omar, Pressley or Tlaib by name.
"Why don’t they go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came," Trump wrote on Twitter. "Then come back and show us how it is done. "
All four are American citizens. The four progressive freshmen lawmakers are some of the president's most vocal critics in the House and have become known as "The Squad" — sticking together even when they seem to go against the rest of their party on key votes and issues.
The president's tweets appeared to help unite House Democrats after weeks of infighting that exploded into the public last month over sending emergency money to border agencies running migrant detention centers.
The feud garnered headlines after Pelosi criticized members of "The Squad," telling New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd that the four congresswomen "have their public whatever and their Twitter world" but do not "have any following. "
Ocasio-Cortez questioned why Pelosi would single out the new women of color in the caucus, telling the Washington Post it was "outright disrespectful. "
The back-and-forth digs ended over the weekend after Trump's attacks. Instead, Democrats united against the president and denounced his comments.
More: 'The Squad': These are the four congresswomen Trump told to 'go back' to other countries
The resolution not only condemns Trump's comments. It also highlights immigration as a centerpiece of American history and culture, quoting presidents throughout history and comparing them to the policies of the Trump administration, which has been heavily scrutinized due in part to the worsening conditions in migrant detention centers at the southern U. S. border.
"The commitment to immigration and asylum has been not a partisan cause but a powerful national value that has infused the work of many Presidents," the resolution reads. "American patriotism is defined not by race or ethnicity but by devotion to the Constitutional ideals of equality, liberty, inclusion, and democracy and by service to our communities and struggle for the common good.

Texto completo: Award-winning journalist Lester Holt, anchor of "NBC Nightly News with Lester Holt," is the recipient of the 2019 Walter Cronkite Award for Excellence in Journalism.
This is the 36th-annual Cronkite Award from the Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication at Arizona State University.
Holt joins other recipients and media leaders including Anderson Cooper, Tom Brokaw, Ted Turner, Bob Woodward, Robin Roberts, Bill Moyers, Helen Thomas and Katharine Graham.
Since 1984, the award honors outstanding journalists during a ceremony in the fall. Holt's luncheon ceremony will be in Phoenix on Nov. 4, Cronkite's birthday. The school's namesake and late CBS News anchor would have been 103.
Holt has anchored "NBC Nightly News" since 2015, after eight years as the newscast's weekend special and 12 years as co-anchor of "Weekend TODAY." His work has been honored with Emmy Awards, a Robert F. Kennedy Journalism Award and the Fred Friendly First Amendment Award. He also was named the 2016 Journalist of the year by the National Association of Black Journalists.
His work has brought him all over the world. He traveled to Manchester, Brussels and Paris to cover terrorist attacks that took place across Europe. He also anchored from South Africa during the Nelson Mandela memorial service, from Japan during the 2010 earthquake and nuclear crisis and from Cairo about the political and civil unrest during the Arab Spring. Holt also traveled to and covered every Olympics for NBC News since the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City.
"Lester Holt is a fantastic role model for our students and all journalists for his insightful, caring, fact-based journalism and stories that focus on the impact of major news events on everyday Americans," said Cronkite Dean Christopher Callahan in a press release. "He embodies the cherished news values of accuracy, honesty, fairness and objectivity championed by Walter throughout his long career."
The Cronkite School, located in downtown Phoenix with Arizona PBS, has been recognized in the New York Times and USA Today as a leader in journalism education and innovation.

Texto completo: We know Arizona is more than the stereotypical heat, cacti and crazy politics. But do outsiders?
We asked our Voices: Engaging Arizona Facebook group to name one overlooked thing about living in Arizona that they wished most outsiders knew.
They offered practical advice: Hike the Grand Canyon. Take a road trip to Sedona, the White Mountains or Tombstone. But they also took a deeper dive into Arizona's psyche.
Excerpts follow:
Arizona is actually inclusive In Arizona, it is not uncommon to walk into stores and see "immigrants welcome" displayed proudly for people to see. Even people from the most isolated communities are making an effort to provide helping hands to the most vulnerable here in Arizona.
For the first time ever, little girls in 2018 could look at our senators and genuinely think to themselves, "there is a space for me in Arizona politics."
Arizona gets trashed for politics and its heat, rightfully so at times, but its true beauty isn't found in the purple sunset skies or the great swaths of open desert and wildlife. The beauty is found within the community.
Arizona is adopting an inclusive ideology a lot quicker over the previous few years.
I firmly believe that this underdog will rise above our past and break the stereotype Arizona has made for itself.
Spencer Gantt,
Tucson, IT security
We are changing as a state I was at two women's marches and attended a rally at then-Sen. Jon Kyl's office regarding the Brett Kavanaugh vote, and it was uplifting to see a range of perspectives. That is definitely a change.
But our reputation persists because of some of our extreme politics and politicians. The important thing is we see it.
Elizabeth Saliba, Phoenix,
community-college educator
Our politics are pretty evenly split Are you insinuating that Arizona politics are extreme? Arizona is perhaps now one of the most centrist states in the U.S., as evident by its voter registration breakdown. Political party affiliation/registration in Arizona is almost evenly split between Republicans, Democrats and independents.
Diego Rivera, Tucson,
marketing coordinator
Arizona is not a cultural wasteland Too often, outsiders wrongly presume Arizona is a cultural wasteland. Nothing could be further from the truth. Our arts and cultural offerings are rich and diverse. The Heard Museum, the Desert Botanical Gardens, the Musical Instrument Museum, the Museum of Northern Arizona and Desert Sonoran Museum offer experiences not found anywhere else.
People flock to these activities – more than 14 million tickets and admissions a year. That's more participation, by the way, than attendance for professional sports and major sports at our universities.
Catherine Foley, Phoenix,
retired communications executive
This place is gateway to the world Yes! Ballet Arizona's 'The Nutcracker' was named by The New York Times as one of the top three to see in the U.S. It is not a cultural wasteland.
Also travel – it's easy to get places, and our airport doesn't have snow delays. Ten hours to London!

P&amp;G calls for equal pay in soccer

Texto completo: Procter & Gamble Co. has called out U.S. Soccer on equal pay for women players in a full-page ad in the New York Times, according to the publication.
"Inequality is about more than pay and players," the ad reads. "It's about values."
In addition to siding with the players just months before the women's team is expected to enter mediation for their gender discrimination lawsuit, the Cincinnati-based consumer goods giant donated $529,000 to the team's players association.
P&G sponsors U.S. Soccer through its Secret brand.
The women's team has been fighting for equal pay and treatment for years. Wages, travel accommodations, marketing, pay for coaches and support for youth programs have all been accused of being unequal between the men's and women's teams.
In the courts, the team filed a wage discrimination lawsuit in 2016, but has since withdrawn that and instead filed a gender discrimination suit accusing U.S. Soccer of "institutionalized" discrimination.
Fresh off their World Cup win, the players have also been supported by brands including Visa and Luna Bar in seeking equality, according to the New York Times.

South Africa's Impey takes Tour's Stage 9

Texto completo: Daryl Impey of South Africa won Stage 9 of the Tour de France, on a day when the top contenders for the overall race victory were happy to take it easy far behind on the hilly trek through the Massif Central mountains. Impey pointed to the South African flag printed on his jersey as he crossed the line in the agricultural town of Brioude, having beaten Belgian rider Tiesj Benoot in a two-man sprint. They were part of a 14-man group that rode away shortly after the stage start in the mining town of Saint-Etienne. Because none of the breakaway riders were contenders for the Tour title in Paris on July 28, race leader Julian Alaphilippe and other top riders allowed them to scoot off ahead. The stage victory was Impey's first in seven Tours. He also held the race lead for two days at the 2013 Tour.
SOCCER
Women's equal-pay bid gets a boost
One of US Soccer's official sponsors has sided with the World Cup-winning US women's team in its fight with the federation for equal pay, urging its partner, the governing body for soccer in the United States, “to be on the right side of history." The sponsor, Procter & Gamble, declared its support for equal pay in a full-page ad in Sunday's editions of The New York Times. It is the first of more than a dozen US Soccer partners and sponsors to side so openly with the team in the equal pay fight, and its support could increase the pressure on federation officials on the eve of mediation discussions to try to resolve the players' federal gender discrimination lawsuit.
Football
Players union rejects 18-game season
The leader of the NFL Players Association shot down a proposal from league owners to expand the regular season to 18 games, a sign that both sides remain diametrically opposed in what will be one of the linchpin issues in the league's next labor deal. Owners suggested lengthening the season by two games, but capping players' participation to only 16 of them to conform to the union's player-safety concerns about a longer season. But DeMaurice Smith , the NFLPA's executive director, dismissed the idea. "If somebody wants to make an 18-game proposal, we'll look at it," he told ESPN on Friday. "I haven't seen anything that makes me think that it would be good for the players."
WNBA
Sun snap four-game losing streak
Jonquel Jones had 16 points, 8 rebounds, 3 steals, and 3 blocks to help the Connecticut Sun beat the Indiana Fever, 76-63, and snap a four-game road losing streak. Jasmine Thomas added 14 points and Shekinna Stricklen scored 12, hitting four 3-pointers . . . Natasha Howard scored 14 points a day after abuse allegations were raised against her to help the Seattle Storm beat the New York Liberty, 78-69. The team says it is looking into allegations on social media that Howard threatened and abused her wife. No charges have been filed. Howard was in her regular starting forward position, and there was no noticeable backlash from the 6,733 fans. She received the same loud round of applause as the other four starters.
Miscellany
Hamilton wins British Grand Prix
Formula One championship leader Lewis Hamilton won a record sixth British Grand Prix after jumping ahead of Mercedes teammate Valtteri Bottas by taking advantage of the safety car being deployed. In front of his home fans, Hamilton made the decisive move to the front in the 20th of the 52 laps by pitting to get new tires. With the safety car still out after Antonio Giovinazzi spun off in his Alfa Romeo, Hamilton rejoined ahead of pole-sitter Bottas . . . Simon Pagenaud won his third race of the season as IndyCar's championship fight tightened up in Toronto. Pagenaud had to save fuel in the waning laps to hold off Scott Dixon . But Penske teammate Will Power caused a caution on the final lap and Pagenaud was able to coast to the finish in his Chevrolet . . . The Kansas City Royals traded Homer Bailey to the Oakland Athletics for minor league infielder Kevin Merrell after scratching the 33-year-old righthander about 45 minutes before his scheduled start of their series finale against Detroit. Bailey, who signed a minor league deal in February, is 7-6 with a 4.80 ERA.

Texto completo: Democratic leaders from across the country reacted with outrage after President Trump said Sunday that four progressive freshmen congresswomen who have been at odds with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi should return to the countries where they “originally came from."
Trump did not name the congresswomen but was apparently referring to a group that includes Representative Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts, along with Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan. The lawmakers — three of whom were born in the United States — have clashed with Democratic House leadership over how to protect migrants on America's southern border.
“So interesting to see 'Progressive' Democrat Congresswomen, who originally came from countries whose governments are a complete and total catastrophe, the worst, most corrupt and inept anywhere in the world (if they even have a functioning government at all), now loudly and viciously telling the people of the United States, the greatest and most powerful Nation on earth, how our government is to be run," Trump said in a series of tweets.
He added: “Why don't they go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came. Then come back and show us how it is done. These places need your help badly, you can't leave fast enough. I'm sure that Nancy Pelosi would be very happy to quickly work out free travel arrangements!"
Pressley said she was not surprised at the attack, which she noted came the same weekend as planned deportation operations by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents.
“This is just another example and demonstration of the bigotry, the xenophobia, the hatred of this administration," Pressley said in an interview with the Globe Sunday.
She also fired off a tweet: “THIS is what racism looks like. WE are what democracy looks like. And we're not going anywhere. Except back to DC to fight for the families you marginalize and vilify everyday."
The reaction was swift from Trump's critics, who characterized his comments as racist and un-American.
Campaigning for president in New Hampshire, US Senator Kamala Harris of California decried the president's language.
“It is an old trope, 'go back to where you came from,' that — you might hear it on the street, but you should never hear that from the president of the United States," Harris said. “This guy doesn't understand, he doesn't understand his responsibilities, and I don't think he understands what the American people want from their president, which is somebody who's going to elevate public discourse and speak with a level of dignity, with a goal of unity."
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, also a presidential candidate, called the president's statement “a racist and xenophobic attack."
Representative Seth Moulton of Massachusetts, who is also running for president, reacted to Trump's statements with his own tweets: “This is white nationalism. The president thinks if you're not white, you're not an American."
Their statements were echoed by numerous other Democratic lawmakers, who seemed to find unity in defending their fellow members of Congress. That included Pelosi, who responded: “When @realDonaldTrump tells four American Congresswomen to go back to their countries, he reaffirms his plan to 'Make America Great Again' has always been about making America white again. Our diversity is our strength and our unity is our power."
The president doubled down, with a series of late tweets.
Trump's tweets and the full day of angry pushback from Democrats changed the dynamic of what had been a feud among Democrats over immigration politics.
The disagreement became public recently when Pelosi pushed a vote on a border spending bill without a series of amendments advocated by liberal members to further protect migrants. The legislation without the amendments, Omar said, amounted to a vote “to keep kids in cages."
Pelosi downplayed the influence of the four freshmen — often called The Squad — in an interview with New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd. “All these people have their public whatever and their Twitter world," she said. “But they didn't have any following. They're four people, and that's how many votes they got."
Ocasio-Cortez accused her of “singling out" the four, all women of color, and said it was “outright disrespectful."
The rift had brought into stark relief the delicate balance Pelosi is attempting to walk: keeping control of her caucus while opposing the president on myriad fronts.
But on Sunday, Democrats of all persuasions were quick and unanimous in their response to Trump.
Boston City Councilor Lydia Edwards, with whom Pressley served before winning her seat in Congress, chided the president for the way he described the lawmakers' backgrounds, noting that Pressley, Ocasio-Cortez, and Tlaib were all born in the United States. Omar was born in Somalia and is a US citizen.
“They are US-born citizens, or naturalized citizens like his wife," Edwards said. (Melania Trump was born in Slovenia and became a US citizen in 2006.) “I think it's typical of the way he communicates. It makes no sense, it's intended to be hurtful, and it's intended to create an other-ness in perfectly patriotic Americans.
“The fact that he would tell anybody to leave and to go back where you come from because they disagree with him is not American," Edwards said.
Peter Ubertaccio, a political science professor at Stonehill College in Easton, called the president's tone “egregious" but said it's “just one additional example of his behavior that ultimately has no impact among his core supporters."
“This isn't new," Ubertaccio said. “The president's views on the issue of race, and his reaction when challenged by people of color or women, have been documented for a long time."
Some of Pressley's other former colleagues from the Boston City Council, where she served for nine years, also came to her defense.
“This man [Trump] viciously and dangerously misunderstands what's most special about America, that we are a country where anyone can come and reach for their dreams," Councilor Michelle Wu said. “We can't get distracted by tweet after tweet after tweet. There are deep structural challenges that we need to usher the political will to change, and that's at every level. From the federal level to the city and neighborhood level."
Councilor Annissa Essaibi George said she read the president's tweets by happenstance while watching the national soccer team from Tunisia — her father's native country — and teaching her children about their own immigrant roots.
“To hear this and to read it in our moment of celebrating our own family history, it had a certain irony to it," Essaibi George said.

House votes to check Trump's power to strike Iran

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - The House voted Friday to curb President Donald Trump's ability to strike Iran militarily, adopting a bipartisan provision that would require the president to get Congress' approval before authorizing military force against Tehran.
The 251-170 vote reflects lawmakers' growing desire to take back authority over matters of war and peace from the executive branch, a reclamation legislators contend has grown increasingly urgent amid escalating tensions with Iran.
The vote also reflected war weariness on both sides of the aisle after 17 years of conflict in the Middle East; 27 Republicans joined the Democrats to approve it.
Last month, Trump led the United States to the brink of a retaliatory missile strike before abruptly reversing course minutes before launch. On Thursday, three Iranian boats briefly tried to block passage of a British tanker in the Strait of Hormuz, according to Britain.
Trump said last month he believes he does not need congressional approval to strike Iran. The vote Friday amounted to a pointed and bipartisan rebuttal - led by strange ideological bedfellows, Rep. Ro Khanna, a liberal Democrat from California, and Matt Gaetz of Florida, one of Trump's most strident Republican allies in Congress.
"When this passes, it will be a clear statement from members of Congress on both sides of the aisle that this country is tired of endless wars, that we do not want another war in the Middle East," Khanna said before the amendment vote.
Gaetz issued a challenge to his Republican peers late Thursday night.
"If my war-hungry colleagues - some of whom have already suggested we invade Venezuela and North Korea and probably a few other countries before lunchtime tomorrow - if they're so certain of their case against Iran, let them bring their authorization to use military force against Iran to this very floor. Let them make the case to Congress and the American people," Gaetz said.
The amendment, attached to the annual defense policy bill, would not restrict the president's ability to respond to an attack.
But Gaetz failed to persuade the majority of his conference, who castigated the notion of limiting the president's military options against an antagonistic nation. Rep. Michael McCaul of Texas, the top Republican on the Foreign Affairs Committee, called the measure "a propaganda win for the Iranian regime and the Houthi allies."
"The administration's measured response to Iran shoot-down of our U.S. military asset in international airspace shows the president is not looking for a war with Iran," McCaul said, referring to the downing of a U.S. drone.
A bipartisan group of lawmakers led by Sen. Tom Udall, D-N.M., attempted to attach a similar measure to the Senate's version of the defense policy bill last month, but the amendment failed 50-40.

Texto completo: Headnote VOICES UNITED
As a first-generation Nigerian American, Isabella Ntigbu is well acquainted with the immigration system.
That compelled her to attend a rally on Friday in Center City against the nation's immigration policies and detention centers.
"I'm a child of immigrants, so this is very important to me," said the Howard University student from New Jersey. "I just don't feel like any country should be participating in any kind of system where they are breaking apart families for whatever reason."
The rally was part of the nationwide action "Lights for Liberty," where communities organized individual events condemning President Donald Trump's harsh immigration policies and the mass incarceration of undocumented immigrants.
But the gathering focused on local issues, too, said Miguel Andrade, a member of the immigration advocacy group Juntos that helped organize the rally. Other organizers included POWER, Philly for REAL Justice, Philadelphia Community Bail Fund and the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR).
Protesters' demands included ending white supremacy, police brutality, stop-and-frisk and gentrification; supporting transgender and LGBTQ issues; and closing the Berks Family Residential Center, a 96-bed ICE detention center near Reading.
"We need to talk about more issues than just immigration right now," Andrade said. "We need to talk about all the different ways that white supremacy is affecting our communities."
Shortly before noon, hundreds of protesters gathered outside the Pennsylvania Convention Center at the corner of 12th and Arch streets, where the multi-day Netroots Nation convention brought together thousands of progressives from throughout the nation.
Traffic came to a standstill on Broad and Market streets as hundreds of protesters marched and chanted to the sound of drums and shakers around City Hall to the ICE field office located at 8th and Cherry streets before continuing on to Race Street.
While Africans were often excluded from the immigration debate, they remain a "significant portion of those immigrating to the United States and also a significant portion of those who are being targeted and ultimately deported," said Timothy Welbeck, a civil rights attorney for the Philadelphia chapter of CAIR, at the rally.
Blacks, as a historically disenfranchised and oppress people, should "unite with those who are disenfranchised as well" and "we should be willing to come and stand in solidarity with marginalized groups," Welbeck said.
While speaking before protesters outside the ICE office, Karla Rojas, 25, shared a letter from an immigrant teenager named Victor, who called for the end of family detention centers after spending more than 700 days in the Berks Center "full with worry and desperation."
"We need to fight," said Rojas, a member of the national immigrant organization Cosecha. "This is happening under our roof, in our communities. We need to be aware of what's there."
The protests on Friday came days before scheduled nationwide raids to arrest and deport undocumented migrants, which President Trump called a 'major operation," according to The New York Times. The sweep was expected to occur in nearly a dozen cities.
In an email, Adrian Smith, a spokesman for the ICE Philadelphia field office, declined to discuss enforcement operations.
Smith said ICE prioritizes the arrest and removal of unlawfully present undocumented immigrants "who pose a threat to national security, public safety and border security," but he warned that others can get caught up in raids.
"However, all of those in violation of the immigration laws may be subject to immigration arrest, detention and - if found removable by final order - removal from the United States," Smith said.
Since Trump first issued threats of an immigration crackdown months ago, Andrade said Juntos has conducted community trainings to ensure people know their rights.
Andrade advised people not to open their door if ICE agents knock because agents cannot enter without a warrant.
Although Andrade did not believe Philadelphia is among the cities to be targeted in this weekend's sweep, he cautioned that there was no way to know when a raid may occur.
"So we need to make sure that, one, our communities know what their rights are," he said, "and that our allies are willing and ready to fight back in case they see any raids or police stops happening."

Texto completo: Ahora resulta que otra persona reclama ser quien presentó al presidente Donald Trump y a la primera dama Melania Trump .
En el libro “El método de la locura: el ascenso de Donald Trump según lo dicho por aquellos que fueron contratados, despedidos, inspirados e investidos” , escrito por Allen Salkin y Aaron Short se afirma que el empresario italiano Paolo Zampolli fue quien a la pareja presidencia.
La información fue revelada en Page Six y desmiente los reportes The New York Times de que supuestamente Jeffrey Epstein –acusado de tráfico sexual de menores– afirmó haber presentado al presidente Trump y a su ahora esposa en 1998.
Según el relato de Salkin y Short preguntaron al empresario Zampolli, si Epstein había asistido a la fiesta donde supuestamente se conoció la pareja presidencial.
“¡De ninguna manera!” , fue su respuesta. Agregó que la noticia de que Epstein había presentado al mandatario y la exmodelo fueron calificadas de falsas.
De esa afirmación, lo único que no cambió fue que la pareja se conoció durante una fiesta en la Semana de la Moda.
La Primera Dama ha contado que conoció a Trump en el Kit Kat Club en Nueva York en 1998 .
Reportes indican que en aquel entonces, la exmodelo no tenía suficiente dinero, por lo que conocer al empresario neoyorquino fue “su salvación”.

AUGUST WILSON WAS THE BLUES, AND MA RAINEY WAS HIS MUSE

Texto completo: August Wilson, poet, playwright and Pittsburgher, wrote in the language of the blues. He learned it in his hardscrabble youth spent in the Hill District, and he learned it from the recordings of artists such as Gertrude "Ma" Rainey, the Mother of the Blues.
It was music that spoke to Wilson, seeping into his soul and pouring out again in his writing.
As filming begins in Pittsburgh on the Netflix movie adaptation of Wilson's "Ma Rainey's Black Bottom," the late writer's relationship with the blues is as relevant as it was for each revelatory release of his 10 plays. With nine set in Pittsburgh and one - "Ma Rainey" - set in Chicago, the works chronicle the 20th-century experience of African Americans in the lyrical prose that brought him two Pulitzer Prizes before his death in 2005, at age 60.
An essay Wilson wrote on "Ma Rainey," included as a foreword in the Theatre Communications Group hardcover collection of his plays, is almost as riveting as the script. He describes in detail what life is like for the "sleepy-eyed Negroes" from the South Side of Chicago, people who come alive at night, filling bars and juke joints to listen and move to music.
"Suffice it to say," Wilson wrote, "that it is music that breathes and touches. That connects. That is in itself a way of being, separate and distinct from any other. The music is called the blues."
The scene and the music may just as well have been conjured from the Hill District of his childhood - a lively, robust culture in a community that was considered "the crossroads of the world" for black Americans.
Ma Rainey - one of the very few real-life people Wilson ever put into his works - released the recording of the song "Black Bottom" in 1927, when Wilson's play is set. But the roots of the blues are found in the songs and chants of enslaved black people.
As Harmony-based blues musician Eugene Morgan tells it, "The blues comes from the year 1619 in Jamestown, when the first slaves were brought here. They couldn't play the drums and couldn't speak their own language. What they had was the blues. It's an expression; people who play the blues, they feel the blues."
George C. Wolfe is a Tony winner and director of the Denzel Washington-produced "Ma Rainey" movie. Seated on the North Side set last week, as an exterior scene was being readied, he talked about the blues and how deeply it is embedded in the America that Wilson put into words.
"There's more accurate history to be found inside the blues than in most history books of the day," Wolfe said. "They would write blues about a big flood that passed through, they would write blues about the Titanic, about the Lusitania, they would write blues about Jack Johnson. So the blues wasn't just an expression of emotion. The blues was this incredible chronicle of history."
Mark Clayton Southers, a Wilson disciple, has directed four theatrical productions of "Ma Rainey's Black Bottom," twice for his Pittsburgh Playwrights Theatre Company, and two years ago, he led a student production at Pittsburgh CAPA.
"August's style of writing traditional poetry aligned with the prose style of some of the great Irish poets drastically changed when he first heard a recording of blues artist Bessie Smith's 'Nobody in Town Can Bake a Sweet Jelly Roll Like Mine.' After listening to it over and over again, he realized that he could write in the voice of African Americans, and it now felt right to him. He was struck by the blues and never looked back. He went on to write 'Ma Rainey's Black Bottom,' and the rest is history," Southers said.
In their book, "August Wilson: Pittsburgh Places in His Life and Plays," Laurence Glasco and the Post-Gazette's Christopher Rawson tell the story, related by Wilson, of that discovery of the blues: "He was known to haunt Pittsburgh resale shops ... buying up old 78 rpm vinyl records. One day, he took home one with a typewritten label." It was that Bessie Smith recording.
"I listened to the record 22 straight times. Just over and over," Wilson said. "It was someone speaking directly to me."
Rainey (1882-1939), a gay black woman in a world of white managers and producers, was described in The New York Times as she was often pictured: "With a mouthful of gold teeth, richly dark skin and flashy jewelry dangling about her, Rainey cast a striking figure, with a ruggedly powerful voice and lavish stage presence to match."
Wilson's play paints a fierce portrait of the uncompromising Ma, with her music as his guide.
"August Wilson spoke at length about how the blues became the bedrock of his work, how the lyrics were a testament to the resilience and nobility of black people," said Janis Burley Wilson, CEO and president of the August Wilson African American Cultural Center.
Wilson's connection to the blues is the inspiration for the center's Blues&Heritage Festival, Sept. 28-30.
"As I curate this project," Ms. Burley Wilson said, "I'm listening to voices, the blues - the artists that tell the most profound stories of pain, love . life."
Sala Udin, the politician and actor who worked with Wilson, said "Ma Rainey" is an example of how blues music is fused to Wilson's works.
"Ma says, 'I don't sing the blues to feel good. The blues is a way of understanding life.' August's plays are not just plays to make us laugh and feel good. They are a way of understanding life. The betrayal, the pain, the laughter, the joy - all parts of understanding life."
Wilson wrote similar words about the blues in his notes about the play - Wilson's second ("Jitney" came first) and the first of his American Century Cycle works to be produced on Broadway. It also follows the Oscar-nominated "Fences" as the second Denzel Washington-produced filmed-in-Pittsburgh screen adaptation of a Wilson play.
"Ma Rainey" stands out as being set directly in the musical world that touches all of his works.
Pittsburgh blues musician Jimmy Adler of the Jimmy Adler Band teaches English at Pittsburgh CAPA, where Wilson's "The Piano Lesson" is part of his curriculum.
"I wish they'd teach him in all the schools," he said.
A student of the blues, he noted that even the titles of some of Wilson's 10 plays, "in my opinion are direct references to the blues." As an example, he offers first "Joe Turner's Come and Gone."
"Big Joe Turner was a real blues shouter who was born in 1911. He was a giant of the blues during the 1940s and '50s," Adler said.
It has been noted by Wilson biographers and scholars that the name is inspired by the 1978 Romare Bearden collage and painting "Mill Hand's Lunch Bucket (Pittsburgh Memories)," which references the real-life Joe Turney, who was responsible for escorting black prisoners from Memphis to the state penitentiary in Nashville but is said to have sold some prisoners to convict farms along the Mississippi River. Joe Turney was reworked as Joe Turner, for not only the singer but also the W.C. Handy song "Joe Turner's Blues."
"Two Trains Running" is the title of a Muddy Waters song and "thus, a tip of the hat to Muddy, who was arguably one of the inventors of electric blues," Adler said.
When he teaches "The Piano Lesson," Adler invites blues musician Eugene Morgan to give his students a sample of the authentic sound of the blues.
"Wilson's 'Piano Lesson' has characters who are in Pittsburgh but used to live in Mississippi," noted Adler. "Several of the characters spend time in Parchman Farm, [a notorious Mississippi prison] that is steeped in blues history and mythology, and they even sing songs at the kitchen table that harken back to their days on the Farm."
Morgan, 67, has known the blues since he "came out of the womb." With a guitar or two at the ready, he can ease into the songs of blues greats such as Eddie James "Son" House Jr. and Robert Johnson at the drop of a name.
When told that August Wilson said of himself, "I am the blues," the musician agreed.
"He is the blues," Morgan said. "I sing a song, and just like that, it's gone. He wrote words that live forever."

Texto completo: Gerrymandering is obviously democratically obnoxious. With modern technologies, it's also increasingly democratically dangerous. It is inconsistent with the principles of equality and free association. Without doubt, it should be excised from our republic. Yet the fury generated by Chief Justice John Roberts' opinion last month declining to end the practice shows precisely why Justice Roberts may have been right.
Since its founding, the Supreme Court has balanced two types of fidelity - one, a fidelity to the meaning of the Constitution; the other, a fidelity to its own role. Under the first, the court asks what the Constitution, properly interpreted, means. Under the second, the court reckons whether it in particular, or courts in general, can apply that meaning, consistent with the obligations of a court.
Justice Elena Kagan's dissenting opinion does a masterful job showing why the Constitution's principle of equality should render partisan gerrymandering unconstitutional. The Founders would see nothing wrong in racial gerrymandering and be astonished that "one person, one vote" was constitutionally required. Yet our Constitution is now more than they gave us. And Justice Kagan was right to insist that, rightly read, it means partisan gerrymandering is wrong.
Yet the question for the court is never solely what justice requires. The question is also whether justice can be served - by justices.
This was the critical idea of the extraordinary 1992 joint opinion in Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey, in which the court declined to overturn Roe v. Wade. The joint opinion considered whether Roe was wrongly decided, but critical as well was whether overturning the 1973 decision would be consistent with the court's own role. "The Court must take care," the joint opinion advised, "to speak and act in ways that allow people to accept its decisions on the terms the Court claims for them, as grounded truly in principle, not as compromises with social and political pressures." Meaning was not everything; instead, perception constrained meaning.
This same instinct guided this term's gerrymandering decision. Justice Roberts had no kind words for gerrymandering itself. While he affirmed that the framers would have permitted it, he affirmed as well the court's later jurisprudence cabining their understanding in the name of equality. The difference with partisan gerrymandering was in application, not principle. There was no rule that could be applied consistently or with clarity that would "allow people to accept," as the 1992 Casey opinion would put it, that its decisions were grounded in principle, not politics.
On that standard, the reaction to the court's partisan gerrymandering decision may well show precisely why the decision was right. The court reviewed two partisan gerrymanders, one Republican, one Democratic. The actual result thus benefited neither party directly. Yet the court's decision was widely characterized in simple partisan terms. This was, as it was received, just another case of a Republican court bending the rules to benefit Republicans. It was partisan politics, not legal principle.
Yet that is precisely the reaction Justice Roberts feared, not just in the one case but in every future case applying an antipartisan-gerrymandering principle. Whenever the partisan makeup of the court matched the particular result, the ruling would be framed as political. That is unavoidable when the rule is unavoidably unclear.
American democracy is at a fragile moment. It is not unwise to worry about further weakening the institution of the court. Justice Roberts made clear that the problem of partisan gerrymandering - at least at the federal level - could be ended by a simple statute.
Indeed, this is what those opposed to gerrymandering should want as well. In the most optimistic case, the court could only rule against the most extreme instances of gerrymandering. A rule by Congress could end them all. Rather than a partial victory stifling the growing and vibrant political movement against gerrymandering, the court's decision will add fuel to the political fire that could end this monstrous practice in Congress more effectively than anything courts could ever do.

In next debate, will Biden fight back or continue to walk the line?

Texto completo: PORTSMOUTH, N.H - Former vice president Joe Biden became a punching bag in the first debate a few weeks ago, which took some of the luster off his candidacy. Is he ready to fight back when the Democrats meet for their second debate in Detroit later this month?
Right now, he's trying to walk a line, praising the field collectively - "a lot of good people running" - while stepping more directly into the question of whether their policies or his are better for the country and good politics. The coming clash points are clear, as his day of campaigning in New Hampshire indicated.
At a Friday afternoon rally in Dover, he had commented about the state of the race and how he sees his own position in it. "The good news about being a front-runner is that you're the front-runner," he said. "The bad news about being a front-runner is everybody's behind you. You know what I mean. I'd rather be there than anywhere else. I get it. But, you know, it's amazing."
Biden warned then, as he has before, about the danger of Democrats forming a circular firing squad, rather than keeping their focus on President Trump. He seemed to cast himself as the most likely casualty if Democrats were to concentrate on tearing each other down. "I know I'm getting skewered by the quote 'New Democratic Party,' " he said, before quickly adding, "And I respect them, by the way."
Outside Annabelle's Natural Ice Cream shop in Portsmouth an hour or so later, his cone melting and dripping, Biden was asked about that skewering comment by CNN's Jeff Zeleny. "At what point do you plan to point out sharper differences between you and" Sens. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), on health care specifically? Zeleny asked. "What are your differences with them?"
"Profound differences," Biden responded. "I think that we should not be scrapping Obamacare; we should be building on it." Biden wants to add a public option to the Affordable Care Act, which would allow people to buy into a government plan if that's what they prefer.
"Took a long time to get us to where it is now," Biden said, adding a warning that too many people are at risk with their health to go through another prolonged debate over totally restructuring the system.
Sanders, Harris, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and others in the Democratic field have said they advocate scrapping the system. They would replace it with a Medicare-for-all system that, eventually, would eliminate private, employer-based insurance. Some supplemental insurance probably would be available, just as it is today for those on the Medicare system.
Biden argues that what his rivals are advocating is something far more complex than simply adding everyone on private insurance today to the Medicare system. "It's not Medicare as you know it," he said. "The present Medicare system goes away. It's a brand new Medicare system. And so it is one that I think is going to be difficult to pass."
Biden credited Sanders at least with being upfront about the cost of a new program and the tax implications. "Bernie's been very honest about it," he said. "He said you have to raise taxes on the middle class. He says he's going to end all private insurance. I mean he was straightforward about it."
Sanders has said his plan would require increased taxes but argues that it would result in people paying less for their health care than under today's system.
Jonathan Martin of the New York Times asked Biden whether the other Democrats have been as honest as Sanders about the tax and cost implications of their plans. "So far not," he said. "So far not. They may. They may." He added, "I oppose the Republican Party trying to get rid of Obamacare . . . and I oppose Democrats who are" trying to do the same.
Asked specifically whether Harris has been clear on her position about eliminating private insurance under a Medicare-for-all plan, Biden grinned. "I'll let you guys make that judgment," he said.
Sanders responded on Saturday to what he called the "misinformation" in Biden's critique. "It is preposterous to argue that as we expand Medicare For All that people with cancer and other illnesses will not get the care that they need," he said in an email sent out by his campaign. "In fact, under Medicare For All, the good news is that we will end the horror of millions of people going into bankruptcy and financial distress simply because they need hospital care for serious conditions."
Just how deep are Biden's differences with the others on the issue of health care? Is this a policy difference or does this go to the kind of campaign Democrats should run to maximize their chances of defeating Trump in 2020?
Biden was asked directly whether Democrats can win a general election in 2020 if their nominee is advocating Medicare-for-all. He was clearly uncomfortable. He hesitated. He took a stab at answering, saying, "Well, look, I'm not going to," before pivoting back to safety by talking about the merits of keeping the Affordable Care Act and building on it.
He avoided a direct answer, but the question probably will come back to him as the campaign goes forward.
Biden also pushed back at Democrats who have criticized him for suggesting that, as president, he would try to work with Republicans and would seek compromises. That, in fact, was what prompted his reference to being skewered by what he called the New Democratic Party. He knows he's been called naive for suggesting the kind of legislating he did in the past could work in today's charged political climate.
In Dover, he pointed to the Constitution and indicated he believes a president must respect the authority of the legislative branch and therefore work with lawmakers to enact legislation, rather than operating independently.
"We have a Constitution that says we have a separation of powers," he said. "I love my candidates I'm running with who would say to me, 'Trump is abusing the executive authority by using executive orders for things he has no right to do,' and then say, 'By the way, if I'm elected I'm going to issue an executive order to make sure the following things happen.' "
He did not mention Harris by name, but she has said if Congress does not move on gun legislation during her first 100 days in office, she would take action by executive order to do so. What Biden didn't note was the degree to which the man whom he served under, President Barack Obama, turned to executive orders during his final years in office when he found his path blocked by the Republican-controlled Congress.
Biden can't afford another wobbly debate performance. He will defend his positions in Detroit, but the question is how effectively he will challenge the ideas of others. If his views are as deeply felt as he suggests, if he believes in smaller steps on health care as the smartest course politically and in terms of policy, if he believes his rivals are the ones who are naive about how to make the system work, will he advocate that forcefully or tentatively?
In other words, will Biden be as strong an advocate for his positions as his leading rivals are for theirs?

Bouton's iconic 'Ball Four' allowed us to look at the game in a truly novel way

Texto completo: It is difficult to know where to begin when writing about Jim Bouton, who died Wednesday at age 80. If he had never written "Ball Four," Bouton no doubt still would have merited a New York Times obituary as a former Yankees pitcher who won 21 games in 1963 and 18 in 1964, then tacked on two World Series wins that October.
But a sore arm cost Bouton his fastball and caused him to end up pitching as a 30-year-old knuckleballer for the expansion Seattle Pilots at the start of the 1969 season. It probably also was the reason he was willing to team with longtime sportswriter Leonard Shecter on a book chronicling that season.
Before it was over, Bouton had been sent to Class AAA Vancouver, returned to Seattle and then been traded to Houston.
Bouton never stopped taking notes. A year later, "Ball Four," written in diary form, was published and became arguably the most iconic baseball book ever written. Some will argue for Roger Kahn's lyrically brilliant "The Boys of Summer," but nothing changed baseball or sports journalism as much as Bouton's seminal work.
Never had an athlete written with as much honesty, candor and humor about what life was like inside a locker room. People often compare "Ball Four" to Jim Brosnan's 'The Long Season," written 10 years earlier, and there's certainly common ground. But "Ball Four" went to places no athlete had previously gone.
Bouton shocked people by writing honestly about good ol' boy Yankee Mickey Mantle - not so much about his home runs but rather his drinking, womanizing and mean streak.
His description of joining Yankees teammates on the roof of Washington's Shoreham Hotel to "beaver-shoot" - check out women through their hotel windows - would be unacceptable in today's world, and Bouton's revelation of it infuriated baseball insiders.
Bouton took ordinary players and made them into icons: journeyman pitcher Gary Bell yelling, "Smoke 'em inside," as his scouting report for every hitter in baseball; Alvin Dark's famous "take a hike, son," remark to an autograph seeker; Jim Gosger's "yeah-surre" comment as he burst from a hotel room closet during a tryst between his roommate and a young woman.
And, of course, there was Seattle Manager Joe Schultz's "Let's go pound some Budweiser" war cry and his ability to repeat his two favorite profane words in, as Bouton wrote, "all their possible combinations."
"Ball Four" has sold more than 5 million copies - Bouton updated it often - so there are plenty of people who will know those anecdotes and many more by heart. The book also made Bouton into a baseball pariah. When it came out in 1970, he was reprimanded by Commissioner Bowie Kuhn, who called the book "detrimental to baseball." Kuhn also asked Bouton to sign a statement saying that the book was fiction. Bouton, naturally, refused.
Kuhn was hardly the only one to take issue with it. Players and many longtime baseball writers, some of whom considered themselves part of their teams, agreed with Kuhn.
No doubt many writers were simply jealous. In those days, with the wide-open access the media had, a good reporter could have told many of the same stories that Bouton told. But no one wanted to be drummed from the fraternity.
The irony is that few loved baseball more than Bouton. He made a comeback with the Atlanta Braves in 1978 - eight years after first leaving the game - and pitched in semipro leagues into his 50s. The final line of "Ball Four" poignantly expresses Bouton's feeling about the game: "You see," he wrote, "you spend a good deal of your life gripping a baseball, and in the end it turns out that it was the other way around all the time."
He also wrote often about sometimes "forgetting to tingle" as he walked across the outfield grass to the bullpen before a game, reminding himself how lucky he was to make a living playing baseball.
Bouton wrote a number of other books, including "Foul Ball," about his efforts to save a minor league ballpark in Pittsfield, Mass., where he had settled after retirement. The book was written in the same diary form as "Ball Four" and, although the topic was completely different, had the same funny, anecdotal feel to it.
The book was also poignant. Bouton describes the death, in 1997, of his daughter, Laurie, in a car accident. He also addressed a New York Times op-ed written by his son Michael pleading with the Yankees to release him from baseball purgatory and invite him to Old-Timers' Day. The Yankees relented and invited Bouton, who joyfully recounts his return to the Yankees' clubhouse and the mixed reactions of his former teammates.
I wrote a favorable review of "Foul Ball" and was thrilled when Bouton reached out to thank me. That began a sporadic friendship, most of it on the phone. I loved hearing Bouton's views of baseball today and his stories about old friends and teammates who had stayed in touch.
Bouton isn't a Hall of Famer, but baseball should find a way to pay tribute to him and acknowledge, almost 50 years later, his massive influence on the game.
As for sports journalism, we were all influenced by him - whether my colleagues want to admit it. Bouton proved the importance of firsthand reporting, of truly getting inside a subject. No book - other than "All the President's Men" - influenced me more as a reporter. Woodward, Bernstein, Bouton - pretty good role models.
Bouton did one other thing for me. Whenever I'm having a tough day at a ballgame - because of a rain delay or because someone refused to talk to me or failed to show up for a scheduled interview or an editor is being difficult (yes, it happens) - I look around and I think about what Bouton would have said.
"Don't forget to tingle."
Thanks, Jim.

Texto completo: ST. PETERSBURG  Jim Bouton, pitcher, author, all-time baseball rebel, died Wednesday. He was 80.

My bookshelves contain his masterpiece, between the Baseball Encyclopedia and The Boys of Summer, Roger Kahns moving elegy to the Brooklyn Dodgers.

Ball Four.

Boutons tell-all baseball memoir, published in 1970, remains the most important sports book ever written. It was one reason why I wanted to become a writer. It was so alive, full of insight and insanity  and fun. God, it was fun.

I remember speaking to Bouton in 1998, when he had been invited back to Old Timers Day at Yankee Stadium. The Bulldog, who won 21 games for the Yankees one season, hadnt been asked back since his book.

The chief suspects seemed to be Yankees owner George Steinbrenner and Mickey Mantle. But a letter from Boutons youngest son, Michael, to the New York Times that summer changed all that. It spoke of Jim Boutons daughter, Laurie, dying in an accident, and how life is too short. Bouton received an invite to Old Timers Day and went.

Baseball is just baseball, Jim Bouton said.

Bouton dared to say that nearly 50 years ago. If you hate Ball Four, you never really read it. If you loved it, your copy is dog-eared. Boutons irreverence taught us that ballplayers, athletes, all of us, are human. It was by no means a sports book.

It upended heroes like Mantle. It brought them down to scale. It opened up baseballs closed society. It spared no one, including the author. It gave us window into a 30-year-old pitcher trying to hang on. It remains a nonstop read.

Bouton was labeled a base

ball pariah, a social leper. Ball Four was not Mein Kampf, but it might as well have been in baseball clubhouses. That said, people have been trying to write Ball Four ever since Ball Four. Some have died trying.

Boutons knuckleball approach helped carry me into journalism. Baseball was just baseball. Games were just games. People were just people. It was an important lesson.

Jim Bouton was my hero, as much as Mantle. He later became a broadcaster and wrote Ball Four sequels as he kept trying to scratch an itch in semipro baseball. He was an interesting cat. When I talked to him, he had just taken up masonry.

Im the last guy who should be throwing up walls, Bouton said.

When Mickey Mantles son died in 1994, Bouton sent Mantle a note. Mantle called to thank Bouton and left a message. Bouton kept the recording. It outlived Mantle, who died in 1995. Life is too short.

James Alan Bouton didnt build walls. He opened doors. Were better because of it. I kept that in my mind every time I wrote a story. Keep it loose, keep it funny, but let fly. If I ever begin to wonder why I still love what I do, I go and find Ball Four. The pages still turn themselves. Im always reminded: Games are just games.

Games are just games.

Texto completo: A Kentucky native says wealthy financier Jeffrey Epstein sexually assaulted her in 1996 and she witnessed school-age girls being escorted upstairs in his New York mansion.
Maria Farmer met the hedge fund manager in New York while she was a graduate student and later went to work for him, she said in an affidavit filed in April in a Florida court. It was through her work at Epstein's home in 1996 that Farmer, then 25, claims she witnessed underage girls coming through Epstein's mansion.
And later, she said in the affidavit, she and her sister were both subjected to unwelcome sexual and inappropriate behavior at the hands of Epstein and his socialite associate, Ghislaine Maxwell.
Epstein faces no direct charges associated with Farmer's claim.
The financier, philanthropist and registered sex offender was arrested and jailed July 6 after his private jet arrived from France. A federal indictment unsealed Monday charged him with sex trafficking girls as young as 14.
He has pleaded not guilty to the charges.
Farmer's affidavit is part of a complaint that Virginia L. Giuffre filed against Alan Dershowitz that accuses the famed lawyer and retired Harvard law professor of being a "co-conspirator" along with Epstein in the sex trafficking and sexual abuse of minors.
In her lawsuit, Giuffre said Epstein and Maxwell sexually trafficked her to Epstein's friends, including Dershowitz, who previously was a lawyer for the financier.
Farmer also named Dershowitz in her affidavit, claiming that he was aware of Epstein's behavior.
"Alan Dershowitz was an individual who came to visit Epstein at his New York mansion a number of times when I was working for Epstein," she wrote.
"Dershowitz was very comfortable at the home and would come in and walk upstairs," she added. "On a number (of) occasions I witnessed Dershowitz at the NY mansion going upstairs at the same time there were young girls under the age of 18 who were present upstairs in the house."
Dershowitz has denied the allegations. In an interview with the Courier Journal, he called the affidavit "totally and completely and categorically false."
Dershowitz said he has never been in the private quarters of Epstein's home and has never seen Epstein in the presence of underage females, adding that his and Farmer's respective relationships with Epstein have never overlapped.
"So, it is inconceivable that she could have seen me in Epstein's house," he said. "She made up a story carelessly because it's easily disprovable."
Dershowitz said he was never in Epstein's house until "well into 1997," at which time Farmer had left New York to work for Victoria Secret's owner Leslie Wexner on a special art project at his Ohio home.
Farmer, a native of Paducah, would not comment when the Courier Journal contacted her. Giuffre's lawyer, Joshua Schiller, said her affidavit speaks for itself.
"Maria's affidavit has been one of those pieces of evidence that we will use in court to support Virginia's claims," he said.
"(Dershowitz) is patently denying all of this stuff, obviously, and if he believes in what he's saying then he can go to court and he can testify," Schiller said, "and he can see whether a jury of his peers believe him or not."
Schiller said Dershowitz had moved to dismiss the case, and he filed an opposition to that Tuesday.
Farmer's responsibilities while working at Epstein's mansion included supervising the front door and keeping track of the people who came through the large Manhattan home, she said in court documents.
During her time working at the Epstein household, she saw "a number of school-age girls coming to the home, some of the young girls would be wearing their school uniforms," according to her affidavit filed in April.
According to Farmer's written testimony, she asked Maxwell what the young girls were doing at the mansion.
"She said that the girls were interviewing for modeling positions," wrote Farmer, who was an artist and graduate student in New York when she met Epstein in 1995.
"At the time, based on my observations at the home, it did not seem credible to me that these young girls were interviewing for modeling positions," she said.
That was in the summer of 1996, Farmer stated in her affidavit. That same summer, she wrote, she went to stay at Wexner's home with her two younger brothers and her 15-year-old sister, who she said Maxwell and Epstein later assaulted.
They "took an interest in my younger sister," she wrote. "Epstein took us to a movie in New York, and during the movie he held my younger sister's hand and was rubbing her in a sexual manner without my knowledge."
After this incident, Farmer wrote that Epstein called the sisters' mother and offered to put Farmer's younger sister into a special school in Thailand.
Then, in the summer of 1996, Epstein and Maxwell flew her sister to their New Mexico ranch, where they "directed her to take off her clothes and get on a massage table" and then "touched her inappropriately on the massage table," according to Farmer's affidavit.
That same summer, while Farmer still lived in Ohio, she alleges that Epstein and Maxwell lured her into a bedroom and sexually assaulted her "against my will" at Wexner's mansion.
Immediately after this incident, she claims she was held against her will for around 12 hours before being allowed to leave. She left the bedroom and called the local sheriff's department, she wrote, but couldn't get through to officers.
"The Wexner's security staff refused to let me leave the property. I pleaded with them," she wrote.
She was finally able to leave with her father, who'd driven from Kentucky to Ohio to come to get her, she said.
The Courier Journal could not reach Farmer's father for comment.
Farmer said in the affidavit that when she returned to New York, she went to police and asked for help. They told her to contact the FBI and report Epstein.
"To my knowledge, I was the first person to report Maxwell and Epstein to the FBI," Farmer wrote. "It took a significant amount of bravery for me to make that call because I knew how incredibly powerful and influential both Epstein and Maxwell were, particularly in the art community."
In 2007, Epstein made a deal with Florida prosecutors, including Labor Secretary Alex Acosta, when he faced similar charges of having sex with underage girls. He pleaded guilty to prostitution charges, paid restitution to his victims, registered as a sex offender and served 13 months in county jail — while leaving for work during the day.
On Friday, Acosta resigned amid the fallout over the 2007 plea deal.
Vicky Ward, a New York Times bestselling author and an investigative journalist, wrote on Twitter in April, when Giuffre's lawsuit was filed, that she had spoken to Farmer and her sister in 2003 about their experiences "at Epstein's hands."
"I will never forget their mother telling me that Epstein had made her afraid to even walk the dog at night," she tweeted.
In her affidavit, Farmer also said that Epstein and Maxwell threatened her several times.
"Maxwell and Epstein contacted my art clients and individuals in the art community in an effort to ruin my art career. (They) were successful," she wrote, adding that she was denied opportunities to grow her art and "my life was ruined."
She wrote that she was terrified of the two and that she has moved several times to hide from them.
"I have struggled throughout my life as a direct result of Epstein and Maxwell's actions against me," she wrote, "and my hope is that they will be held accountable for their crimes."
"While I am still afraid," she added, "I am coming forward because I think it is so important to do so."

Texto completo: A lighthearted look at the news of the day:
The U.S. women’s soccer team was criticized because Alex Morgan pantomimed sipping a cup of tea after scoring a goal against the British team, which was seen by some as making fun of British culture. The British team could have reacted in kind against American culture, but it would have taken too long to pantomime eating a burger, fries and a stack of bacon.
---
The first round of debates among Democratic presidential candidates gave Americans an in-depth 10-second look at each one. To be fair, that’s more time than Americans gave “The Alec Baldwin Show” on ABC.
---
Some parents are hiring coaches to teach their families how to stop using mobile phones so much. One such coach explained her strategy to The New York Times. “Is there a ball somewhere? Throw the ball.” A network of such coaches charges up to $250 an hour to parents in large cities. They probably take Venmo, if you want to pay through your, um, phone.
---
It’s not fair to compare generations, but somehow, I can’t imagine my parents paying several times the price of a television set to teach them how to get me to stop watching TV so much.
---
The president held a summit last week to look at unfair practices by social media companies against conservative voices. He said the “fake news” media would be invited to part of the event. But some news outlets said the guest list included people who post actual fake news, including a guy who tweeted a doctored video that seemed to show Joe Biden getting a shoulder massage. l’m guessing whoever was invited to provide music for this event had to just hum a few bars and fake it.

UCF grad has magical 'Prom' on Broadway; commentary

Texto completo: For Central Floridian Jerusha Cavazos, her Broadway debut in "The Prom" came at the perfect time with the perfect message. And each night she performs in the musical, she thinks of the Pulse nightclub tragedy - and the friend she lost.
"I can't believe this was the show I got," says the 2014 UCF graduate who grew up in the south Orlando neighborhood of Hunter's Creek before moving to Celebration. "All the things I dreamed of happened in this one show: a wonderful cast, recording the album, going to the Tonys, good reviews and a New York Times Critics' Pick. Those things don't always happen in a single show."
"The Prom," a heartfelt musical comedy about love, will close Aug. 11 after playing more than 300 performances on Broadway. Cavazos, a member of the ensemble, has been involved since the show's pre-Broadway workshops. So have the leading actors, which include Beth Leavel ("The Drowsy Chaperone"), Brooks Ashmanskas ("Something Rotten!") and Christopher Sieber ("Spamalot").
"I looked up to these people growing up," Cavazos says. "Now they're my friends."
They've taught her an important lesson: "You can get to the highest point of your career and still be the nicest people in the world," she says. "They are excited every day to be here. It forces us all to keep our games up."
Their approachability was a nice surprise. "Being new to New York, I was treading with caution," Cavazos said. "But I can definitely knock on their dressing-room doors."
She chats with Sieber, whom she calls "my career guru." During the strenuously energetic dance numbers, Leavel and Ashmanskas cheer the ensemble from the wings.
The encouragement gives Cavazos a boost of confidence.
"I knew I could move, I took basic dance classes, but I was not walking around, saying 'I'm a singer-actor-dancer,'" Cavazos says. "Everyone who has flown up from Orlando to see the show has been like, 'When did you learn to dance?'"
She credits, in part, the coaching of director Casey Nicholaw. He can bring out the best in anyone, she says. Coincidentally, while a UCF musical-theater student, Cavazos did a project on Nicholaw's work on Broadway smash "The Book of Mormon."
"I always thought he was a big, huge director I'd never meet," Cavazos says. "Now he's 'Daddy Casey.'"
But if her dancing had to be honed, she had a good foundation. A well-rounded individual - and self-described nerd - she enjoys reading about Albert Einstein ("I love him!" she exclaims). As a young girl, she studied gymnastics. As a student at Osceola High School, she participated in weightlifting and track and field.
"The Prom" does more than make use of her athletic background; it stirs her heart.
The musical tells of a high-school girl who wants to bring her girlfriend to the prom. But the PTA president has other ideas about same-sex couples attending the big dance - and then a gaggle of self-obsessed Broadway stars descends on the sleepy Midwest town in a misguided attempt to help.
The gay romance reminds Cavazos of her friend Shane Tomlinson, a singer who died when a gunman opened fire at Orlando's Pulse nightclub in 2016, killing 49. The two had performed together for many years at Walt Disney World's Epcot.
"I wish he could have seen this story," Cavazos says. "I feel like I'm seeing him every night in the audience and singing 'Unruly Heart' to him, like telling him it was OK that he loved who he loved, and that his death wasn't in vain."
The song "Unruly Heart," a ballad about finding love and being proud of yourself, is Cavazos' favorite part of "The Prom."
"I can hear the tears from the audience," Cavazos says. "I love that moment."
The song's uplifting message is reflective of the show as a whole. Even those who are against the girls attending the prom are acting with good intentions.
"What this show does is not preach to the audience or yell at the audience, but open a dialogue," Cavazos says. "By showing love, we could change lives."
Those who see it are moved.
"High-school students, and especially middle-school students, are in tears at the stage door, saying, 'This is my story. Thank you,'" Cavazos says. Older gay theatergoers become emotional as they share stories of how they missed their own proms.
For Cavazos, coming when it did, the show has helped her make peace with the death of her friend.
"The show is for so many people, for everybody in the world, but it's specially for Orlando," Cavazos says. "In a weird way, it helped me heal."
"The Prom" will live on, with a touring production already announced for 2021 and a movie adaptation starring Meryl Streep, James Corden and Nicole Kidman headed to Netflix.
As for Cavazos, she's coming home to Central Florida for a bit to visit family. Then, as actors do, she'll start pounding the pavement again to "keep hustling for the dream." This time, the idea of a Broadway role seems more real.
"Now, it's not something I hope I can do," she says. "Now I know it's attainable."

Texto completo: SALT LAKE CITY, UT – The following local residents have earned a degree from Western Governors University (WGU). The online, nonprofit university held its 70th (Orlando, Florida); 71st (Cincinnati, Ohio); and 72nd (Anaheim, California) commencement ceremonies this year to celebrate the graduation of more than 22,000 students from across the country.
• Cherish Sweetser of Deming (88030) has earned her Bachelor of Science, Nursing
• Erik Morrow of Deming (88030) has earned his MBA, IT Management
WGU has recognized 13,244 undergraduate and 8,930 graduate degree recipients, who have completed their degrees in the last six months. Their areas of study include business, K-12 education, information technology, and health professions, including nursing. The average time to graduation for those earning a bachelor's degree was 2 years, 4 months, while the average time to degree for graduate programs was 1 year, 7 months.
WGU pioneered competency-based education, which measures learning rather than time spent in class. Designed to meet the needs of working adults, students study and learn on their own schedules with individualized, one-to-one faculty support.

Texto completo: Julie Sweet will become the new chief executive of Accenture, the consulting firm announced on Thursday, adding another female leader to the senior-most ranks of the corporate world.
With Ms. Sweet's appointment, 27 women will be leading companies in the S&P 500. That figure is up slightly from a year ago, but still means that just slightly more than 5 percent of the most valuable public companies in the United States are led by women.
Ms. Sweet, a former lawyer who is currently Accenture's head of North America, will bring a measure of stability to the firm, which has been without a permanent leader for most of the year. In January, Pierre Nanterme stepped down as chief executive, citing poor health. Mr. Nanterme led the company for eight years, significantly enlarging Accenture's market value, influence and head count.
Accenture's chief financial officer at the time, David Rowland, was tapped to serve as interim chief executive while the board conducted a search for a full-time replacement. Mr. Nanterme died in January.
Mr. Rowland will become executive chairman of Accenture. KC McClure, who took over as chief financial officer from Mr. Rowland in January, will continue in her role, making Accenture the rare company to have women in both the chief financial officer and chief executive roles.
"On this day, I am focused on the fact that I am the fifth C.E.O. of Accenture since we became a public company," Ms. Sweet said in an interview. "I represent all our employees, which includes over 200,000 women."
A former lawyer at Cravath, Swaine & Moore, Ms. Sweet was recruited to become Accenture's general counsel in 2010. After five years in that role, she became chief executive for North America, Accenture's largest market, with annual revenues of $ 17.8 billion.
Accenture's work increasingly focuses on helping large corporations adopt new technologies such as artificial intelligence and cloud computing. The firm works with most of the biggest companies in the United States, and Ms. Sweet's clients include Marriott, Halliburton and the Golden State Warriors.
"Julie is the right person to lead Accenture into the future, given her strong command of our business and proven ability to drive results in our largest market," Mr. Rowland said in a statement.
In an effort to expand its offerings and bolster its growing marketing division, Accenture bought the advertising agency Droga5 this year.
Though Accenture has grown rapidly in recent years, the consulting business remains unpredictable. The company has forecast strong full-year earnings, but last month, Accenture reported a 9 percent drop in quarterly bookings.
Ms. Sweet said that was the nature of the consulting business. "Bookings are lumpy quarter to quarter," she said, noting that Accenture reaffirmed its guidance on Thursday.
Ms. Sweet, who grew up in Southern California, decided she wanted to be a lawyer in eighth grade. She attended Columbia Law School, then started working at Cravath, one of Wall Street's most prestigious law firms.
She was only the ninth woman to be named partner at Cravath and developed a strong roster of corporate clients. But when a recruiter called her about the Accenture job, she decided to go for it, in part because her career had become somewhat predictable.
"I could see my future," she said in an interview with The New York Times this year.
In addition to her duties running the business at Accenture, Ms. Sweet has emerged as a leading voice on diversity and inclusion in the workplace. She is pragmatic in her approach to developing more female leaders in the corporate world, and pushes for developing mentorship programs, setting goals and measuring progress to systematically expand the number of women and minorities in senior leadership roles.
"I have an unwavering commitment to inclusion and diversity," she said this week. "We already have a very robust global program around inclusion and diversity. Wherever it's legally available, we have benefits available for our L.G.B.T.Q. community."

America is greater than 'just OK'

Texto completo: Maybe President Trump was right that we needed a "Salute to America" last week, because apparently some Americans have lost sight of the greatness of our country. Case in point: To mark Independence Day, The New York Times posted a video op-ed challenging what it called the "mythology" of American greatness. "America may once have been the greatest," the Times video declares, "but today, America, we're just OK."
The video is like a caricature of how conservatives think the left sees America -- except it isn't a caricature; it's real. It's a straw man come to life. As evidence we're just OK, the video cites statistics showing that other developed countries, such as Luxembourg, Sweden and Norway, have lower poverty rates or better education and health care outcomes than America. And as for our "kick-ass democracy," the Times says, it's not that big a deal because "a lot of countries have freedoms."
Put aside for a moment all the misleading data the video uses to show America is not so great. The fact is, all the freedom and progress those other countries enjoy today would not be possible without the United States.
The reason that "a lot of countries have freedoms" today is because our Founding Fathers pioneered the principle of popular sovereignty, where governments answer to the people instead of the other way around. At the time of our founding, the rest of the world was ruled by monarchs. Our founders established the first country in human history that was built on an idea -- the idea of human liberty.
For most of our history, American democracy was a global outlier. In 1938, on the eve of World War II, there were just 17 democracies. It was not until 1998 -- just two decades ago -- that there were more democracies than autocracies.
That dramatic explosion of freedom didn't just happen. It was the direct result of the rise of the United States as a global superpower. The U.S.-powered victory over Nazi tyranny in World War II and our triumph over Soviet tyranny in the Cold War defeated the hateful ideologies of fascism and communism, and unleashed a wave of freedom that has spread across the world. Today, 4.1 billion people live in democracies. (Of those who do not, four out of five live in China.)
The unprecedented expansion of liberty has produced unprecedented prosperity. Last September, the Brookings Institution reported that "for the first time since agriculture-based civilization began 10,000 years ago, the majority of humankind ... some 3.8 billion people, live in households with enough discretionary expenditure to be considered 'middle class' or 'rich.' "
None of that would be possible without the Pax Americana guaranteed by U.S. military. Americans liberated a continent, rebuilt much of it from the rubble of war with the Marshall Plan, and then stood watch on freedom's frontier and prevented a Soviet tank invasion across the Fulda Gap. And today, the only thing that stops North Korea from invading South Korea or China from invading Taiwan is American military might.
So, let's be clear: Every country that enjoys democratic governance today owes its birth of freedom to our Founding Fathers, and the continued existence of their democracy to the U.S. military.
Today, for all its flaws, America remains the freest, most innovative, most prosperous country in the history of the world. We invented the lightbulb and the iPhone. We put a man on the moon and a rover on Mars. We are a nation of unparalleled military power and unlimited opportunity. There's a reason we have a crisis on our southern border; millions want to come here so that they can share in the abundance of American prosperity.
The men and women who flew those fighters and bombers over the Mall last week make it all possible. They provide the critical foundation of peace and security upon which our freedom, and the freedom of all the world's democracies, is built. Maybe Luxembourg scores better on some measures, but no one is counting on Luxembourg to secure the peace of the world. Trump was right to shine a spotlight on our men and women in uniform and to remind those who have lost sight of it that the United States is not simply the greatest nation on Earth; we are indispensable. Without us, the world would be mired in the darkness of totalitarianism rather than the light of liberty.
That is better than "just OK."

Texto completo: Las redadas a nivel nacional para arrestar a miles de miembros de familias indocumentadas se han programado para comenzar el domingo, según dos oficiales de seguridad nacional actuales y uno anterior, informa The New York Times, avanzando con una operación que cambia rápidamente, cuyos detalles finales permanecen en proceso.
La operación, respaldada por el presidente Trump, se había pospuesto, en parte debido a la resistencia entre los funcionarios de su propia agencia de inmigración.
Las redadas, que se llevarán a cabo por la Agencia de Inmigración y Control de Aduanas (ICE), durante varios días, incluirán deportaciones “colaterales”, según los funcionarios, quienes hablaron con NYT bajo condición de anonimato, debido a la etapa preliminar de la operación. En esas operaciones de captura, las autoridades podrían detener a otros inmigrantes que se encuentren en la escena, a pesar de que no sean el objetivo de las redadas.
Cuando sea posible, los miembros de la familia que son arrestados juntos, serán recluidos en centros de detención familiar en Texas y Pennsylvania.
Pero debido a las limitaciones de espacio, algunos pueden quedarse en habitaciones de hotel hasta que se puedan preparar sus documentos de viaje. El objetivo de ICE es deportar a las familias lo más rápido posible.
Los funcionarios dijeron que los agentes de ICE están previendo la detención de al menos 2,000 inmigrantes a los que se les ordenó deportar, algunos por no presentarse en el tribunal, pero que permanecen en el país ilegalmente. Se espera que la operación se lleve a cabo como se había anunciado, en al menos 10 ciudades importantes.
Las familias que ICE espera detener, son de personas que cruzaron la frontera recientemente: la administración Trump aceleró sus procedimientos de inmigración el otoño pasado. En febrero, a muchos de esos inmigrantes se les notificó que se presentaran en una oficina de ICE y se fueran de Estados Unidos, dijeron las autoridades de seguridad nacional.

* Activistas alertan por grandes redadas de ICE en 10 ciudades

Texto completo: 'Confirmation Bias'
By Carl Hulse, Harper, 310 pages, $28.99
Federal judges are supposed to be neutral decision-makers. But any pretense of neutrality has slipped away as the appointment process for Supreme Court justices and prominent lower-court judges has become mired in political partisanship.
President Donald Trump seems to expect his appointees to automatically side with him, just as he expects judges selected by President Barack Obama to be against him. His administration has allowed conservative advocates to play an outsize role in picking nominees. And the Senate, with its power to confirm or reject those choices, has sunk deeper into partisan score-settling.
Republicans and Democrats alike have contributed to today's hyper-politicized process. But nothing approaches the muscle that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell exerts. McConnell thwarted Obama's opportunity to replace the late justice Antonin Scalia in 2016 and, once Trump took office in 2017, began directing the swift approval of a record number of appeals court judges, as well as two Supreme Court justices.
In his new book, "Confirmation Bias," journalist Carl Hulse delves deeply into recent confirmation battles, describing the Senate's advice-and-consent power as "corrupted to what appears to be the point of no return."
The book is an absorbing, if dispiriting, look at the maneuverings of inside players like McConnell and Donald McGahn, Trump's first White House counsel, and outside advocates like Leonard Leo of the Federalist Society, who appears to have steered judicial selection as much as anyone at the White House.
Hulse, a New York Times correspondent and Illinois native, probes moments of escalation over the years and the backroom machinations of the Trump strategy now transforming the courts and the law. Inevitably, he covers previously reported ground, but "Confirmation Bias" is an important guide at this crucial time for the stature of America's judiciary.
Chief Justice John Roberts, himself a Republican appointee, has lamented the current state of affairs. In November Roberts pushed back on Trump. Roberts issued a statement saying: "We do not have Obama judges or Trump judges, Bush judges or Clinton judges. What we have is an extraordinary group of dedicated judges doing their level best to do equal right to those appearing before them."
Yet individual judges have sometimes reinforced the notion that they are bent on favoring the president who appointed them. Of equal concern, the selection process appears patently designed to produce men and women who will do just that.
Tracing the origins of the Trump plan for the federal bench, Hulse recounts McGahn's early interaction with the candidate. They were introduced by David Bossie, president of the conservative advocacy group Citizens United. Trump inscribed a copy of "The Art of the Deal" to McGahn's young son, Don III, writing, "You've got a great dad." McGahn then helped draw up Trump's spring 2016 list of possible Supreme Court nominees.
Once Trump became president, McConnell and McGahn formed an early partnership to place ideological soul mates on the bench. McGahn engineered the appointment of Neil Gorsuch to fill Scalia's seat on the Supreme Court. In 2018 he managed the resignation of Justice Anthony Kennedy and his replacement by Brett Kavanaugh.
Back in 2008, Kavanaugh, then an appeals court judge, swore in McGahn after his confirmation to the Federal Election Commission. "That guy's going to be on the Supreme Court someday," McGahn said privately. Nearly a decade later, in 2017, Hulse writes, McGahn confided to Trump strategist Steve Bannon his continued interest in Kavanaugh as a Supreme Court choice.
During the televised Kavanaugh confirmation hearings last year, McGahn coached the nominee on his response to Christine Blasey Ford's sexual assault allegation. As Ford testified before senators, Hulse reveals, McGahn received "worried texts from his circle" and then urged Kavanaugh to respond aggressively: "He wanted to see the nominee push back, cut off his interrogators, and turn their questions back on them." Kavanaugh denied Ford's allegations dating back to their teen years in suburban Maryland, chalked them up to partisan critics and challenged senators about their drinking habits after they suggested that Kavanaugh drank to excess as a young man.
For decades, Republicans in Washington, dismayed at the judicial liberalism of the 1960s and 1970s, have made judicial appointments a higher priority than Democrats have. There have been exceptions, of course, when Democrats went on the offensive. In 1987 the Democratically controlled Senate rejected Robert Bork, and in 2013 Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid instigated a change in filibuster rules to win confirmation of stalled Obama nominations. A decade earlier, Reid helped block several nominees of President George W. Bush.
Yet Republicans such as McConnell have more recently been in control and ready to play hardball, partly as retribution. On Feb. 13, 2016, when Scalia died, McConnell received early word. When the death became public, McConnell was ready with his statement that an appointment to the seat should be saved for the next president, to be elected in November. On that same Feb. 13 McGahn called Trump to advise him on addressing the vacancy and offering names of possible successors.
Hulse writes of the ensuing angst among some on Obama's team that the president moved too slowly on a successor. Ron Klain, then chief of staff to Vice President Joe Biden, wanted the president to quickly name presumptive nominee Merrick Garland, chief judge of the D.C. Circuit. The well-regarded moderate's name had been kept in reserve for just such a moment.
Within a few days of Scalia's death, Hulse reports, Klain told White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough: "The president ought to go to the Rose Garden tomorrow and name Merrick Garland. Tomorrow. Not a month from now. Tomorrow. Every day that ticks by is a day that you are letting McConnell consolidate his position."
Obama announced the Garland choice a month later. Senators never held a hearing.

Texto completo: Federal agents who searched the East Side Manhattan mansion of wealthy sex offender Jeffrey Epstein turned up a "vast trove of lewd photographs" of young-looking girls, including hundreds of meticulously labeled nude pictures locked in a safe, according to federal court documents.
The description, laid out in a memo by prosecutors from the Southern District of New York, was aimed at convincing a federal judge that Epstein, who was arrested July 6 upon return from Paris on his private jet, should not be freed pending trial on charges of sex trafficking.
Agents used crowbars to force open the front door of the seven-story Upper East Side mansion.
The memo said the search turned up not only evidence supporting its sex trafficking allegations against Esptein but also "hundreds – and perhaps thousands – of sexually suggestive photographs of fully – or partially – nude females."
While investigators were still reviewing the material, the memo said one of the girls, according to her attorney, "was underage at the time the relevant photographs were taken."
It noted that other photographs were found in a locked safe that included CDs with handwritten labels including the descriptions "Young (Name) + (Name)," "Misc nudes 1," and "Girl pics nude."
In calling for Epstein to remain in jail, the memo noted that he is a registered sex offender after a 2008 conviction in Florida and "is not reformed, he is not chastened, he is not repentant, rather he is a continuing danger to the community and an individual who faces devastating evidence supporting deeply serious charges."
Epstein, 66, has pleaded not guilty to one federal count of sex trafficking and one count of sex trafficking conspiracy for allegedly sexually exploiting minor girls at his homes in Manhattan, Palm Beach, Florida, and other locations, according to the federal indictment.
In a report on the mansion, valued at more than $55 million, The New York Times noted that its artwork includes a commissioned mural of a "photorealistic prison scene that included barbed wire, corrections officers and a guard station, with Mr. Epstein portrayed in the middle."
The Times quotes R. Couri Hay, a public relations specialist who recently met with Epstein at his home, as saying, "(Epstein) said, 'That's me, and I had this painted because there is always the possibility that could be me again.'"
The home also includes such oddities as a hallway covered with artificial eyeballs originally made for wounded soldiers, a life-size female doll hanging from a chandelier, and a chess board with custom figures, many dressed suggestively and modeled after one of Epstein's staffers, The Times reported.
Federal prosecutors said in the indictment that they were moving to seize the mansion as part of the proceedings against Epstein.

Texto completo: Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez described House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's verbal attacks against her and other freshman liberal members of the party "outright disrespectful."
Pelosi has spent much of the week feuding with Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar, Rashida Tlaib, and Ayanna Pressley, the four female members of Congress who have received the most media attention since being elected to their first terms last fall.
“When these comments first started, I kind of thought that she was keeping the progressive flank at more of an arm’s distance in order to protect more moderate members, which I understood,” Ocasio-Cortez told the Washington Post on Wednesday. “But the persistent singling out ... it got to a point where it was just outright disrespectful ... the explicit singling out of newly elected women of color.”
In a closed-door meeting, Pelosi warned her party against tweeting about other members of the Democratic Party, according to the Post. The speaker's admonition came days after she told New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd that the vocal freshmen had little real power in Congress.
“All these people have their public whatever and their Twitter world,” she said. “But they didn’t have any following. They’re four people and that’s how many votes they got.”Story URLPhoto Caption:Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Nancy Pelosi

They Kinda Want To Believe The Moon Missions Were Maybe A Hoax

Texto completo: Shane Dawson, an impish, sandy-haired star of YouTube, has always had an instinct for the platform’s shifting moods. When he started posting videos 10 years ago, he dealt in sketch comedy and song parody. But in 2015, he pivoted to paranoia.
Now, in a typical video, Dawson pipes in eerie music, wiggles his fingertips in the malevolent style of Mr. Burns and breathily announces: “It’s time for some conspiracy theories.”
Dawson’s “theories” are assembled from pop culture detritus, stitched together through video clips, off-the-cuff podcast interviews and spooky internet chatter. His videos are pegged to trending topics - whipping up nefarious plots around fidget spinners and Avril Lavigne - but they also plug into old-fashioned lines of conspiratorial thinking: the Illuminati rules humanity, the Earth is flat, and the Apollo 11 mission was faked. His “Moon Landing Conspiracy Theory” video has been viewed more than 7 million times.
Dawson is a capricious conspiracist. In the middle of his paranoid rant about the moon, he places his hands sincerely over his chest and says: “Once again, it’s a theory. I don’t want to get sued or put in jail.” Then he narrows his eyes, as if to size up the whole field of space science, and scoffs, “But I mean, the evidence is not looking good.”
Skepticism’s changing face
This is a newly fashionable posture. “I go back and forth with conspiracies. I have a love-hate relationship with conspiracies,” Joe Rogan said in April on his podcast, which has hosted discussion on theories around chemtrails, flying saucers and Magic Johnson’s HIV status. In March, YouTube shock jock Logan Paul dropped a 50-minute pseudo-documentary that stages him pratfalling into Flat Earth paranoia, inhaling anti-NASA propaganda and finally pronouncing it the dumbest thing he has ever heard.
The internet’s biggest stars are using irony and nonchalance to refurbish old conspiracies for new audiences, recycling them into new forms that help them persist in the cultural imagination. Along the way, these vloggers are unlocking a new, casual mode of experiencing paranoia. They are mutating our relationship to belief itself: It’s less about having convictions than it is about having fun.
Moon conspiracy theorizing used to be a serious business. Bill Kaysing, a former employee of a company that built rockets for NASA, boosted the movement in 1976 when he self-published “We Never Went to the Moon: America’s Thirty Billion Dollar Swindle” - a 200-page pursuit that quoted Lincoln and Shakespeare and featured arcane meditations on rocket propulsion and grainy photocopies of “evidence.” The theory was rekindled in 2001, at the dawn of the crowdsourced web, when a guy named Bart Sibrel produced a 47-minute “documentary” called “A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Moon.” It mashed up moon footage with ominous shots from the Soviet Union and Vietnam, was narrated by a severe British woman, and was sold on a website called MoonMovie.com.
The quasi-investigations of Kaysing and Sibrel share similarities to the ones we see today. Dawson, like his predecessors, is a collage artist. All three men are personal essayists, too, unspooling their theories as tales of each man’s journey toward skepticism.
But the mood has shifted.
Kaysing and Sibrel were sincere kooks. Self-publishing a book through great personal expense requires a steadiness of conviction. So does making an almost-feature-length movie that you sell, for money, on DVD. When Sibrel finally accepted his belief in the moon hoax, he told The New York Times in 2003, he wept.
But today, it is no longer necessary to commit to the cause to help spread it around. You can just type it into Reddit, or blurt it out on a podcast, or drag a crying-laughing emoji onto a picture of the lunar lander and post it on Instagram.
Sheer lunacy
In recent years, the specter of a fake moon landing has been raised by figures as disparate as Infowars founder Alex Jones (who treated it as a deathly serious issue), podcast host Rogan (who conjured it as a trippy thought experiment) and NBA star Steph Curry (who tossed it out as a joke, prompting a NASA invitation to visit its moon rock collection). Dawson, YouTube’s conspiracy king, channels all of those moods at once, modulating his perspective line by line and shot by shot. He represents a new archetype: the ambivalent conspiracy theorist.
In Richard Hofstadter’s 1964 diagnosis of “The Paranoid Style in American Politics,” he described paranoid thinkers as “angry minds” addled by “heated exaggeration, suspiciousness and conspiratorial fantasy.”
But today’s more fashionable conspiratorial figures are not mad at all. You won’t find them crying over the moon. Rogan has cultivated a persona as an easygoing bro, willing to entertain out-there ideas before swatting them aside. And though Dawson is preaching from among the internet’s largest platforms - his channel surpassed 20 million subscribers this year - he acts as if he is bumbling through the dark corners of the web and reacting with wonder at whatever freaky idea pops up, as if he is watching a scary movie with millions of his closest friends.
At the end of his moon investigation, he decides: “I kinda believe it.”
Emotional ambivalence may be contemporary internet culture’s dominant mode. It is the hallmark of the internet troll, who blurs the line between sincerity and jest to wreak havoc online. It is the posture of the alt-right, which recycles old ideas about white nationalism into the language of internet memes, cloaking its seriously held beliefs with an ironic sheen. But it is a feature of the sunny YouTube personality, too.
Like his fellow vloggers who monologue about makeup or relationships or family life, Dawson pingpongs easily between self-confidence and self-deprecation. He stakes claims and then awkwardly undermines them in quick cuts and asides.
A looping snippet Dawson cut from one of his videos sums this up. “That’s just the facts,” he confidently tells the camera amid his “investigation” into the integrity of Chuck E. Cheese pizza. Then he blinks, throws up his hands in a protestation of innocence, and abashedly corrects himself: “No wait, no it’s not. It’s just an opinion.” The camera zooms in as his mouth curdles into a cringe.
The point isn’t whether the conspiracy is true or false, opinion or fact, or even remotely plausible. The point is that it’s stimulating.
There is no evidence that crowdsourced platforms like YouTube, Facebook or Reddit have stoked belief in conspiracy theory. Some segment of the population has always been drawn to outlandish tales of government plots. But the internet has achieved something even more cynical. It has made belief irrelevant. As soap operas have been supplanted by reality television and now YouTube vlogging, the line between fantasy and reality has become somewhat passé. Conspiracy theorizing is no longer stigmatized; it’s just for fun.
As Dawson put it last year, in a video questioning whether the Earth is, in fact, round: “Maybe 20 years ago, everybody thought, ‘Oh, that’s stupid. That’s crazy.’ But now, I feel like kinda everybody’s down for the moon landing being fake.”
Kinda.

Texto completo: The El Paso Times and USA TODAY stand firm in the accuracy of their reporting and continue to be a leading and impartial voice in the coverage of border security and immigration.
The strength of the partnership between the El Paso Times and the New York Times lies in the fact that you have a team of reporters and editors who understand the immigration crisis and are subject matter experts.
The journalists spoke to current and former Customs and Border Protection agents and supervisors who work or have worked at the detention facility in Clint, TX. These agents and supervisors are witnesses to the severe problems at the secretive site and spoke on condition that they not be named because of fear they will face repercussions for exposing such squalid conditions.
The journalists reviewed CBP documents, sworn statements from those housed at the border facilities, inspection reports, spoke with immigration attorneys and lawmakers who toured the facility and also provided first-hand accounts.
The on-the-ground reporting also led to the creation of a graphic that outlines the detention center, from cinder block cells, holding rooms, nurses' station, and a padded cell, with no toilet, where sick children were quarantined and sometimes held.
The El Paso Times and USA TODAY stand firm in the accuracy of their reporting and continue to be a leading and impartial voice in the coverage of border security and immigration. The New York Times issued a statement: "We are confident in the accuracy of our reporting on the U.S. Border Patrol's detention centers."
Tim Archuleta is the executive editor of the El Paso Times. He is also the Plains Regional editor who oversees news operations in the Texas and New Mexico. He can be reached at 915-546-6141 and opinion@el pasotimes.com

Power to draw maps is at stake, officials argue

Texto completo: DALLAS - Only hours after the U.S. Supreme Court said it could do nothing to stop partisan gerrymandering of the nation's political maps, Eric Holder had a message for his fellow Democrats in downtown Dallas.
"Texas is a place where we have to win," Holder, who served as attorney general during Barack Obama's presidency, said last week. "This is doable. This is possible."
Holder was not talking about the 2020 presidential election. He was not talking about a congressional race. He was talking about the nine seats Democrats would need to flip to wrest control of the Texas House of Representatives and gain a voice in the redisricting process.
While much of the country's attention is focused on presidential politics, the court's recent gerrymandering ruling instantly raised the stakes for the nation's state legislative races, which are often overlooked by voters, but can shape the course of policy from abortion rights to education.
Yet this cycle of legislative elections carries added significance: In most states, the political party that wins control of the legislature gains the power to draw once-a-decade maps setting district boundaries for state and congressional elections after a new census count.
Acutely aware of that prize, which offers a chance to tilt political power further in one party's favor, Republicans and Democrats are starting campaigns early, knocking on doors and rallying donors with the pitch that a tiny statehouse election in suburban Dallas or coastal Virginia could have national reverberations.
"We're going to make sure we do everything we can to influence the elections because the future of the party for the next 10 years depends on it," said Austin J. Chambers, president of the Republican State Leadership Committee, which focuses on electing Republicans to State-house offices.
Chambers' party is rushing to defend its gains from 2010, when Republicans swept into power in many state capitols across the country and redrew political maps that secured a decade of political dominance.
Democrats, under intense pressure to make up for years of losses in statehouses and for maps that sealed their disadvantages, are racing to gain enough power to block a new set of gerrymandered maps - or perhaps draw their own. And the Supreme Court's ruling, clearing the way for more partisan gerrymandering, has only intensified the scramble for state legislative seats all over the country.
"We're going to be talking about redistricting constantly," said Joanna Cattanach, a Democrat who is already campaigning for a Dallas-based state House district that is up for election in 2020. "There is an added urgency. There's a new talking point."
Gerrymandering is hardly new, but it has vaulted to the top of the political agenda in the last decade as single-party domination in state capitols birthed a set of bizarrely shaped districts meant to protect a vulnerable incumbent, vanquish a political foe or dilute the voting power of the minority party.
In Republican-held Texas, claims that the maps discriminated against Black and Hispanic voters were ultimately heard, and mostly rejected, by the Supreme Court. In Maryland, Democrats drew maps that left a Republican congressman without a base of support. And in North Carolina, Republican-drawn maps have been the subject of years of litigation and political fighting.
With the justices' ruling, lawmakers were expected to feel more emboldened in their next round of map drawing after 2020.
"If our party doesn't maintain the state Senate at a minimum, we know the lines will be gerrymandered outrageously by the Democrats and our likelihood to win legislative and congressional seats in this state may be lost for a decade or more to come," Jennifer Carnahan, chairwoman of the Minnesota Republican Party, said in an email. Minnesota Democrats, who insist that they do not plan to gerrymander, control the governorship and House, and are optimistic about flipping the Senate.
Jessica Post, the executive director of the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, which works to elect Democrats to statehouses, said her party was taking a more aggressive approach this cycle, having learned from its string of losses in 2010. Post said Democrats want to win control of at least one legislative chamber in Georgia, North Carolina and Texas, and to gain full control of state government in Virginia and Minnesota.
Georgia Democrats are outnumbered 105-75 in the State House, but say they believe they could win that chamber by focusing on suburban districts outside Atlanta and anti-abortion legislation championed by Republicans. In North Carolina, where the Democratic governor does not have a veto over the new maps, Democrats are looking in 2020 to flip one or both legislative chambers to gain a voice in redistricting.
With 29 state legislatures currently dominated solely by Republicans and 18 by Democrats, many are unlikely to change hands during this cycle, and in those states, the campaigns for 2020 elections have yet to gain steam. (Two states, Nebraska and Alaska, do not easily fit the model.) Still, in some states where Republicans are firmly in control of the legislative chambers and seem unlikely to lose it, Democrats have tried a different tack on the political maps: Pushing to remove mapping power from the politicians and turn it over to nonpartisan redistricting committees, similar to those used in California and Arizona.
The fight is playing out more immediately in Virginia, where all of the state's 140 legislative seats are on the ballot this November and Republicans fear their two-seat majorities in both the Senate and the House of Delegates might evaporate.
There, the current maps are part of the tug-of-war that will decide future ones: Though the state's political maps were drawn by Republicans, some of those were thrown out by the courts, which found them to be racially gerrymandered. (Racial gerrymandering has been banned by *the Supreme Court, while it said it could not weigh in on the partisan equivalent.) The new maps drawn under court order are widely believed to be less favorable to Republicans than the earlier versions.
For Texas Democrats, who have not won a statewide elected office since 1994 and have not held a legislative chamber since the 2002 election, flipping the state House now seems tantalizingly plausible - though still incredibly difficult. The potential payoff is huge: A say in drawing congressional maps for a House delegation that currently numbers 36 and, with the state's growing population, could increase still more after the next census.
In Texas, as in many states that give their legislatures the authority to draw political maps, control of the State House would not hand Democrats full control over new congressional boundaries; it would merely give them a voice, along with the Republicans, who hold the governor's office and are expected to maintain control of the state Senate. Still, in states where one party has single-handedly controlled the process, the possibility of having any role holds enormous appeal.
"The Texas congressional delegation is going to pack a huge punch, for good or for ill, in national politics," said Lydia Bean, a former college professor who is running as a Democrat in a Fort Worth-based state House district.
There are reasons for skepticism about Democrats' chances. The party has expressed hope before of Texas triumphs - with Hillary Clinton's presidential bid in 2016 and Beto O'Rourke's Senate campaign in 2018 - but come up short. And in order to seize the House majority next year, Democrats will have to hold seats they narrowly won in 2018 and overcome a well-financed Republican Party that has mobilized early and tried to register additional voters.
Chambers, who is leading the Republicans' national effort, projected confidence about his party's chances. Yes, he conceded, statehouses dominated by Republicans for years are now up for grabs. But he said the leftward shift among Democrats nationally could help Republicans keep moderate suburban voters. And, for now at least, the political maps continue to favor Republicans.
As for Democrats' dreams of gaining power in places like Texas and Georgia? Chambers chuckled.
"Bring it on," he said.

Texto completo: Three projects from ProPublica Illinois and ProPublica were named finalists for the National Association of Black Journalists’ 2019 Salute to Excellence Awards.
The Driven Into Debt series, begun by ProPublica Illinois and continued in partnership with WBEZ Chicago, received a nomination in the Digital Media - Online News Project category. The investigation revealed that Chicago’s parking ticket system has been driving motorists into bankruptcy through fines and fees that unfairly target majority-black neighborhoods and people who can least afford to pay. The reporting led to a number of policy proposals and reforms, including city officials agreeing to refund or dismiss 35,000 duplicate citations and calls for action from Chicago mayoral election candidates. ProPublica Illinois reporter Melissa Sanchez and WBEZ Chicago’s digital editor Elliott Ramos collaborated on the series, with contributions from ProPublica Illinois news applications developer David Eads and former data reporter Sandhya Kambhampati.
ProPublica’s Miseducation was also nominated in the Digital Media - Online News Project category. The online news application allows users across the country to look up racial disparities in education opportunity and school discipline for more than 96,000 schools and 17,000 districts using data from the 2015-16 school year. The many local stories informed by the Miseducation database included examinations of the history of segregation and resistance to integration in Charlottesville, Virginia, and how discrimination has fueled high school dropouts on a Montana reservation. Eads, ProPublica reporter Annie Waldman, news applications developer Lena V. Groeger and New York Times correspondent Erica L. Green collaborated on the project.
“I Don’t Want to Shoot You, Brother,” an investigative narrative about a fatal police shooting in Weirton, West Virginia, was named a finalist in the Digital Media - Single Story category. Written by ProPublica senior editor Joe Sexton and published in partnership with The Frontline Dispatch, the story highlights how police officer Stephen Mader opted to defuse a tense situation rather than shooting a young man, and the surprising ramifications of his decision.
ProPublica Illinois reporting fellow Lakeidra Chavis was also nominated in the Radio News Series Category (Top 15 Markets) for “Chicago’s Black Communities Hit Hardest in Opioid Overdoses.” The story, which aired while she worked at WBEZ Chicago before joining ProPublica Illinois, highlighted how the opioid epidemic deeply affects African Americans in the city, even as most narratives about the crisis have focused on white, suburban areas. WBEZ Chicago senior news editor Rob Wildeboer also contributed to the project.

US isn't perfect, but it's exceptional

Texto completo: Two foreign observers deserve credit for coining the notion of American exceptionalism. It was Alexis de Tocqueville, in his book "Democracy in America," which remains the greatest examination of American government ever written, who first connected the idea.
"The position of the Americans," he wrote, "is therefore quite exceptional, and it may be believed that no democratic people will ever be placed in a similar one."
It is easy, now that more than half of the world's nations are democracies, to think that this was always the standard, but in the 1830s when the first volume of the book was released, the American model remained quite abnormal. It would be an additional 100 years before the growth of democracy really began on a global scale. In America, Tocqueville recognized something uniquely forward-looking, separate from a mere inheritance of the European tradition, but a bold new direction that the rest of the world would have to learn from. What for him was a defining American characteristic was for Karl Marx, decades later, a source of confusion.
The world became more like America Though Marx never visited America, he was enamored with it and the conundrum it created for his worldview. America was an industrial nation with the supposed prerequisites for communism, yet it never developed a class system or seriously entertained a proletariat uprising. This, he reasoned, could only be temporary. The United States might be an exception now, he reasoned, but as the population grew, land became less abundant and more time passed, it too would bend toward communism. America's future, Marx reassured his followers, was to be more like Europe, the opposite of Tocqueville's proclamation.
Tocqueville was right, and Marx was wrong. America's conditions never led to a communist revolution, yet Europe and the rest of the world did grow more democratic. Thinking more in line with Tocqueville's view, that America is not merely an exception but that it is exceptional, took root and has long been central to the national identity.
There is an evident effort by the postmodern left to change that today though, to reduce the notion not only of American exceptionalism but also American history as a whole to nothing more than a vile unsalvageable blip, relevant only as a study in institutionalized power structures.
A combination of this influence and the omnipresent fear of angering the "woke left," ready at their keyboards to unleash social media rage, has encouraged many Democratic politicians to refrain from patriotic gestures, or worse, to seek a pathway by undermining America's achievements.
This trend was evident on this year's remembrance of Juneteenth, which was hijacked by a contingent of postmodern leftists who went through the preposterous public exercise of proclaiming that America had effectively made no progress, as if the nation's remarkable journey from Antietam to Bloody Sunday to Barack Obama did not occur.
Patriotism is not a dirty word Recently, New York Times columnist Bari Weiss, appearing on Bill Maher's television show, raised frustration with the reservation of Democratic presidential candidates to appear patriotic. They are "scared to touch" patriotism, she said. "They are scared to touch anything that will give them the whiff of xenophobia and bigotry and all the rest of the things that they are terrified of being accused of. And they need to come up with sensible answers to those things."
This is most plainly understood as a rejection of American exceptionalism and one that has infected parts of the Democratic base. A Gallup poll this year, conducted annually near Independence Day, found that only 22% of Democrats are "extremely proud" to be American, a 10-point decrease since last year and a 34-point decline since just 2013. Among self-identified liberals, only 21% say they are "extremely proud" to be American.
America is not exceptional because it is perfect; it is exceptional because it measures itself against, and strives for, perfection. We retain the greatest structure of self-government ever created and a people who strive constantly toward a more perfect union.

Texto completo: Briefcase
TEMPE, Ariz. - Starbucks executives have met with a suburban Phoenix police department after six officers were asked to leave one of the company's shops because a customer felt unsafe.
Tempe Officers Association President Rob Ferraro said the officers met Monday with the company's leadership and police Chief Sylvia Moir.
Ferraro says Starbucks again apologized for the July4 incident, and the police officers "came away from the meeting feeling heard and respected."
Starbucks' executive vice president Rossann Williams reiterated the company's apology in a note to Moir after their talk.
The association says the officers were having drinks at a Tempe Starbucks when the barista made the request.
The New York Times reported the customer and the officers were all white.
Judge allows opioid case to continue
OKLAHOMA CITY - An Oklahoma judge decided Monday the state's ongoing opioid drug lawsuit against consumer products giant Johnson & Johnson can move forward, rejecting the company's argument that the state failed to prove its public-nuisance claim.
District Judge Thad Balkman denied Johnson & Johnson lawyers' motion asking him to end the case midtrial and rule in favor of the New Brunswick, New Jersey-based company and its subsidiaries, including Janssen Pharmaceuticals Inc. The defendants filed the motion last week after the state rested its case. The trial began May 28.
Company attorneys had argued the state's case is an inappropriate use of a public-nuisance claim, typically reserved for disputes over property such as an unruly saloon or a smelly livestock operation that bothers neighbors.
Oklahoma argues the company helped fuel the state's opioid crisis with an aggressive marketing campaign that overstated the drug's effectiveness and understated the addiction risk. The state has proposed a $17.5 billion abatement plan to address the problem over the next 30 years, a figure that attorneys for Johnson & Johnson say is wildly inflated.
Traders weighing rate-cut odds
Technology and health care companies drove U.S. stocks to a lower finish Monday as the market fell for a second straight day following a run of record highs.
The selling came amid growing speculation on Wall Street that an unexpectedly strong pickup in U.S. employment growth last month may keep the Federal Reserve from aggressively cutting its benchmark interest rate. Many investors still expect a cut of a quarter percentage point, but fewer are now expecting a half-point reduction.
The market rallied through much of June after the central bank signaled it's prepared to lower interest rates to offset slowing global growth and the fallout from U.S. trade conflicts. The benchmark S&P 500 index closed at record highs three days in a row last week before stumbling Friday following a report showed U.S. employers added a robust 224,000 jobs in June and stoked uncertainty about the Fed's next move on interest rates.
The S&P 500 fell 14.46 points, or 0.5%, to 2,975.95. The index is now about 0.7% below its all-time high set Wednesday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slid 115.98 points, or 0.4%, to 26,806.14. The Nasdaq composite lost 63.41 points, or 0.8%, to 8,098.38. The Russell 2000 index of smaller company stocks dropped 14.24 points, or 0.9%, to 1,561.39.

Kraft joins Trump at round table of business leaders, Qatar officials

Texto completo: President Trump dined with New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft Monday night, less than five months after the billionaire businessman was charged as part of a South Florida prostitution investigation.
Kraft was among a group of government and business leaders invited to the dinner, hosted at the Treasury Department, to honor the Emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim Bin Hamad Al Thani. Kraft sat one seat away from the president, with International Monetary Fund Chairwoman Christine Lagarde, who last week was nominated to lead the European Central Bank, seated between the two. Los Angeles Rams owner Stan Kroenke was also seated at the head table.
In February, Trump said the episode involving Kraft was “very sad" but pointed out that the Patriots owner had “proclaimed his innocence, totally."
“But I am very surprised to see it," the president added.
Kraft, 77, was among more than two dozen people charged in a widespread prostitution investigation involving a day spa in Jupiter, Fla.
But a Florida judge ruled police did not follow proper procedures while installing hidden cameras that the authorities said secretly recorded Kraft. That is expected to cripple the prosecution's case. Kraft turned down an offer by prosecutors to drop the prostitution charges if he admitted he would have been found guilty at trial and completed an educational course on prostitution, according to The Wall Street Journal. Kraft has pleaded not guilty.
The NFL owners were among numerous high-profile business leaders at Monday's events, including Citigroup Inc. chief executive Michael Corbat, AT&T Inc. CEO Randall Stephenson, Blackstone Group president Jonathan Gray, Bank of America Corp. chairman Brian Moynihan, and cofounder of Creative Artists Agency Michael Ovitz.
“This is a who's-who," Trump said of the crowd.
One Washington dignitary not in attendance was UK Ambassador Kim Darroch, who was disinvited after Trump tweeted that his administration “will no longer deal with" Darroch following the publication over the weekend of leaked cables in which the ambassador derided the American president. — BLOOMBERG NEWS
Cuomo signs bill opening Trump's taxes to Congress
As the battle over President Trump's federal taxes intensifies in Washington, Governor Andrew Cuomo of New York signed a bill Monday to allow Congress to access the president's state tax returns.
The bill requires state tax officials to release the president's state returns for any “specified and legitimate legislative purpose" on the request of the chairperson of one of three congressional committees: the House Ways and Means Committee, the Senate Finance Committee, and the Joint Committee on Taxation.
It is effective immediately, though it is unclear whether it would be challenged by the Trump administration, or used by the congressional committees; the Ways and Means Committee, for instance, has said previously that it remains focused on pursuing Trump's federal tax information.
Still, the state tax documents from New York — the president's home state and business headquarters — would probably contain much of the same information as the contested federal returns, tax experts say.
Democrats in Washington have been unable to obtain Trump's federal returns. The House Ways and Means Committee has unsuccessfully sought six years of the president's personal and business tax returns, and last week the House of Representatives sued the Treasury Department and the IRS to try to force them to release the returns.
Cuomo said that signing the bill would help Congress “fulfill its constitutional responsibilities, strengthen our democratic system, and ensure that no one is above the law."
The Legislature had passed the measure in late May.
The bill has been harshly criticized by Republicans as a “bill of attainder" — an unconstitutional piece of legislation aimed at a single person or group — as well as a potential invasion of privacy. In a statement, Cuomo agreed that “tax secrecy is paramount," with, however, “the exception being for bona fide investigative and law enforcement purposes."

CNN will assign debate slots in 'live draw' on July 18
WASHINGTON — CNN, the host of the next Democratic presidential primary debate, said Monday it would conduct a televised "live draw" next week to determine which candidates in the crowded field appear on which of two nights.
CNN said its process would air July 18 in the 8 p.m. period of its "Anderson Cooper 360" program. The second Democratic debate is scheduled for July 30 and 31 in Detroit.

Steyer to enter Democratic race; Swalwell drops out
Tom Steyer, the California billionaire who toyed with the idea of a Democratic presidential campaign before announcing in January that he would not run, has changed his mind and intends to enter the 2020 contest on Tuesday, according to multiple people who have been told of his plans.
Word of a possible Steyer candidacy was a surprise to the Democratic political world, which has counted on the 62-year-old's largess to finance super PACs in recent years.
The news came as a fellow Californian, Representative Eric Swalwell, said he was ending his bid for president, becoming the first candidate to do so since the field expanded to historically large proportions.

Texto completo: As Europe heats up, Greenland melts and the Midwest floods, many news organizations are devoting more resources to climate change as they cover the topic with more urgency.
In Florida, six newsrooms with different owners have taken the unusual step of pooling their resources and sharing their reporting on the issue. They plan to examine how climate change will affect the state's enormous agriculture sector as well as "the future of coastal towns and cities -- which ones survive, which ones go under," according to a statement released when the initiative was announced last month.
Florida's record-breaking heat waves, devastating storms like Hurricane Michael and increased flooding at high tide have not been lost on Mindy Marques, the publisher and executive editor of The Miami Herald, one of the six organizations taking part in the effort.
"It's undeniable that we are living with the impact of changes in our climate every day," Ms. Marques said.
The other five outlets that have joined the initiative are The Palm Beach Post, The South Florida Sun Sentinel, The Tampa Bay Times, The Orlando Sentinel and WLRN Public Media. Ms. Marques said the partnership was not politically motivated.
"We're not launching a campaign," she said. "We're launching information, knowledge."
The Guardian, the left-wing British daily, recently updated its house style to prefer the phrase "climate emergency" over "climate change." It also recommends "climate science denier" in place of "climate skeptic." The publication has also started listing the global carbon dioxide level on its daily weather page.
The New York Times established a desk dedicated to climate change in 2017, with editors and reporters in Washington and New York who collaborate with bureaus around the world.
But even among journalists who want to convey that climate change is a crisis, there is not unanimity about how to play it.
Matthew C. Nisbet, a communications professor at Northeastern University and the editor of the journal Environmental Communication, has argued for more nuance.
"We have good research that in amping up the threat without actually providing people with things they can do, you end up with fatalism, despair, depression, a sense of paralysis, or a sense of dismissiveness and denial," he said.
Mr. Nisbet, who recently published an article headlined "The Trouble With Climate Emergency Journalism" in the journal Issues in Science and Technology, warned that fever-pitch coverage could make climate science go the way of dietary science, a discipline that has suffered, in his view, from credulous reports of new studies that regularly upend conventional wisdom -- fat is bad; no, carbs are bad; no, eat like a cave man.
"People don't know what to believe," Mr. Nisbet said. "They lose trust in the science and in the journalism about the science, and the complexity of the issue is lost."
David Wallace-Wells, the deputy editor of New York magazine whose work has appeared in The Times, argued the contrary, saying that a dash of alarmism suits alarming developments.
Mr. Wallace-Wells's 2017 cover story for New York magazine -- a precursor to his recently published book, "The Uninhabitable Earth: Life After Warming" -- drew criticism from scientists who said he had painted worst-case scenarios based on exaggerations of the data's implications. Mr. Wallace-Wells said he had written the article "consciously outside the boundaries that had been established of what was considered responsible storytelling about climate, because I felt that was not serving the story all that well."
Barely a year after the kerfuffle around that article, a panel of scientists convened by the United Nations issued a dire report, which forecast severe climate change as soon as 2040.
To describe it, some news organizations pressed the panic button, à la The Guardian: "We Have 12 Years to Limit Climate Change Catastrophe, Warns U.N." (Mr. Wallace-Wells's contribution was headlined: "U.N. Says Climate Genocide Is Coming. It's Actually Worse Than That.") But even those that played it straight could not help but convey urgency. "U.N. Report: 'Unprecedented Changes' Needed to Protect Earth From Global Warming," went the USA Today headline.
Other outlets held off, however, with 28 of the top 50 American newspapers by Sunday circulation publishing nothing on the report the day after it was issued, according to the liberal watchdog Media Matters for America.
The Columbia Journalism Review bashed the nonchalant response to the United Nations report in an April 22 essay headlined "The media are complacent while the world burns." Written by the longtime environmental reporter Mark Hertsgaard and the magazine's top editor, Kyle Pope, the piece, which was also published in The Nation and The Guardian, took issue with the "climate silence" of major news organizations and singled out the paucity of time given to the issue on television news, "where the brutal demands of ratings and money work against adequate coverage of the biggest story of our time."
An illustration of the extremes in how climate change has been covered was evident on a recent edition of the nightly Fox News program "The Story With Martha MacCallum." The segment began with a clip from John Oliver's HBO show in which Bill Nye the Science Guy, a winner of multiple Emmys who specializes in explaining scientific concepts in simple terms, lit a globe on fire and ordered his viewers, in unprintable language, to grow up and face the crisis. After the clip played, Ms. MacCallum's guest, the Fox News personality Jesse Watters, weighed in.
"The planet renews itself," Mr. Watters said. "And I just am doubtful that man is causing the warming, because these experts have been saying this for years. The experts said there was going to be a Y2K meltdown. Didn't happen. The experts said there was Russian collusion. Didn't happen. The experts said there was going to be President Hillary Clinton. Didn't happen."
Mr. Watters's view lines up with the roughly one-third of Americans who believe that climate change is mostly due to natural trends, according to a new study from the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication. It is also in keeping with the opinion of Mr. Watters's onetime dining partner President Trump, who pulled the United States out of the Paris climate accord and has called the idea that climate change results from human activity a "hoax" and "fake science."
At the other end of the spectrum, the activists of Extinction Rebellion, a group founded in Britain last year, argue that most journalists have not met the crisis with sufficient urgency. In addition to recent protests in London and Paris (where some participants were tear-gassed), the group has aimed at the news media, with demonstrations last month outside the offices of The New York Times, The Washington Post and Fox News.
"You're still not talking about it like it's an emergency," said a group spokeswoman, Alanna Byrne, referring to large media outlets, "and that's what we have to do now: Be honest to the public about the full-scale changes we have to make."
On April 30, The Columbia Journalism Review and The Nation sponsored a town hall on how to cover climate change as part of an initiative called Covering Climate Now. It has brought together Japan's Asahi Shimbun, Canada's McLean's, The Philadelphia Inquirer and other outlets that have pledged to step up coverage of the issue before a United Nations climate summit scheduled for September.
"It's outdated to say that covering the effects of climate change is advocacy," said Mr. Pope, the Columbia Journalism Review editor. "It's an enormous story. The effects of this are completely nonpartisan."

Texto completo: In January, California ended a decades-old legal doctrine that put numerous people behind bars for murders they did not commit.
Yet six months after the new state law—Senate Bill 1437—took effect, some prosecutors are trying to overturn it, resorting to scare tactics and false distortions.
We are the legislators who wrote and supported this critical reform, and we need to set the record straight about it.
SB 1437 passed the Legislature last year with bipartisan support and was signed into law by then-Gov. Jerry Brown. It reformed California’s outdated and unfair felony murder rule, which had allowed people who did not kill to nonetheless be charged, convicted, and sentenced as murderers.
The old felony murder doctrine allowed prosecutors to charge all accomplices to a crime with first degree murder. It did not matter if there was no intention to kill, if the death was accidental, or if the accomplice had no knowledge that someone else would kill. Everyone was just as responsible, as if they had planned and committed the murder themselves.
The California Supreme Court, in a 1983 ruling, termed the state’s felony murder rule “barbaric.” And yet it remained on the books, and people were unfairly sentenced to long prison terms under this law.
We studied this issue for over a year before passing Senate Concurrent Resolution 48 in 2017. That measure recognized “the need for statutory changes to more equitably sentence offenders in accordance with their involvement in a crime.”
Then in the following legislative session we introduced SB1437 to correct what we concluded was a grave and needless injustice.
As SB1437 moved through the legislative process, we made significant improvements to ensure it was fair and that our reform did not let people who are responsible for a murder off the hook.
Based on input from district attorneys and other public safety advocates, we amended SB1437 to ensure that a criminal was held accountable for murder if they:
* Are the actual killer.
* Aided, abetted, counseled, commanded, induced, solicited, requested, or assisted the actual killer with the intent to kill.
* Were a major participant in the underlying crime and acted with reckless indifference to life.
And so it’s been disappointing to see some of California’s district attorneys now working to block the law’s implementation. They remain intent on pursuing murder convictions for people not guilty of that crime, despite the fact that it’s not in the interest of public safety nor is it just.
Yet they have challenged SB1437 in court arguing it’s unconstitutional on the grounds that it’s allegedly inconsistent with two ballot initiatives California voters passed decades ago.
Before introducing SB1437, we spent over a year carefully reviewing past statutes, court decisions, and, yes, voter-approved ballot initiatives, to ensure that the provisions in SB1437 did not overstep our role.
SB1437 falls squarely within the Legislature’s broad authority to make policy.
Prosecutors have also challenged SB1437 in the press with mischaracterizations. The president of the Association of Deputy District Attorneys for Los Angeles County, for example, recently told The New York Times that under SB1437, “We’re literally talking about letting murderers go free.”
That’s a false claim designed to stoke fear.
Thankfully, many prosecutors have properly applied the law, and courts around the state have upheld the reform as constitutional. As a result, many deserving people have been able to go home—some after serving decades in prison for murders they did not commit.
It’s not just those newly freed and their families who have recognized the justice served in these cases. In San Luis Obispo County, after a judge found SB1437 constitutional, a reporter went to the parents of the victim.
They said that while they still endure the pain of their son’s death, it did not justify an unfair sentence: “It certainly wouldn’t bring closure to me to see him punished as if he were the murderer,” the parent of one murder victim was quoted as saying
SB1437 is a just and overdue reform. We’re confident that California’s courts will uphold it.

Margaret Sullivan: ‘Democracy ... is about to die in Youngstown’ with closing of local newspaper

Texto completo: Youngstown, Ohio • Mere moments after the start of the hastily called community forum, the tears started to flow.
"Gobsmacked" was how one Youngtown reader described her horrified reaction to the surprise announcement, just days before, that the city's 150-year-old daily newspaper, The Vindicator, would publish its last edition on Aug. 31.
And Mary Beth Earnheardt, who teaches journalism at Youngstown State University, briefly left the meeting room at the local history center to pull herself together.
Like many others, she feels the impending loss deeply.
“The Vindy connects us all. A community without a strong, central newspaper is missing leadership — and a big part of its identity.”
The paper's demise is another blow for a region hit hard earlier this year by the shutdown of the sprawling General Motors plant in Lordstown, a 20-minute drive from downtown, which once employed 14,000. The plant, which made the Chevrolet Cruze, is part of the auto and steel industry that President Donald Trump vowed he would bring back.
With The Vindicator’s closing, Youngstown will become an unfortunate first: a good-size city with no daily newspaper of its own. (The metro area has more than 500,000 residents; the city about 65,000.) Many other newspapers have folded in recent years, but they were mostly weeklies; the dailies were in cities with a competing newspaper — that was not the case in Youngstown.
Given the dire state of the industry, it certainly will not be the last. More likely, this will look like the tumbling of the first domino, with the situation repeating across the country - especially when the next economic downturn wipes out what's left of the print advertising that once was the lifeblood of local newspapers.
For Mark Brown, The Vindicator’s general manager, the loss is personal, devastating — and, he told me, unavoidable.
His family has owned and run the paper for 132 years. His mother, Betty Brown Jagnow, the publisher who is well into her 80s, still comes into the office regularly and has called the decision "gut-wrenching."
"It's all we've ever known and all we ever wanted to do," Brown said as we talked last week in his bare-bones office, a converted storage room filled with filing cabinets and blazing with bright lights.
Brown realized five years ago that he probably should put The Vindicator up for sale but hesitated because he knew that a chain buyer would slash the staff and harm the paper's quality.
"I didn't have the stomach for that, so we decided to ride it out," he said.
The Vindicator's 44-member newsroom staff digs deep into local issues, and it has won plenty of state awards for general excellence, for reporting and commentary, and for its website, which has no paywall.
Still, The Vindicator has lost money for 20 of the past 22 years. Even at its richest in 1989, the profit margin was 17%, Brown said.
That’s about half of what many American newspapers were pulling in during their pre-internet heyday when advertisers had little choice about how to reach customers. And circulation has plummeted: from more than 100,000 daily and 160,000 on Sunday in the late 1970s, to now about 25,000 daily and 32,000 on Sunday.
One Vindicator journalist told me it would be telling to have a show of hands at the mournful community meeting: How many of the bereft were actual subscribers?
When Brown finally got serious about selling, hiring a broker in 2017 to explore the market, there were no takers — at any cost.
Two potential buyers took a serious look, but both dropped out. For most, the picture was simply unappealing: endless losses, a weak advertising market, an underfunded pension plan and a unionized staff that had not been cut to the bone.
So, after spending $23 million to cover losses — and to buy a new press in 2010 (with the unrealized hope of bringing in new revenue through outside printing) — Brown found himself out of options.
He worries about the staff — and even more about the loss of the journalistic watchdog: “I’m scared for the community.”
What this means, said Joel Kaplan, associate dean of Syracuse University's Newhouse School, "is that no one in that community will be covering, on a regular basis, school board meetings, City Council meetings, the cops and the courts. Democracy, as we know it, is about to die in Youngstown."
The city and its surrounding Mahoning Valley have an ugly history of corruption. “Crimetown, USA — the city that fell in love with the mob” was how the New Republic magazine described Youngstown in a 2000 retrospective piece.
And it's the hometown, after all, of the late James Traficant, expelled as a member of Congress and sent to prison after being convicted of taking bribes, filing false tax returns, racketeering and causing his staff to do chores at his Ohio farm and Washington houseboat.
"Public corruption here is deeply rooted," said Bertram de Souza, whose 40-year Vindicator career spans revealing corruption as a reporter and his role now of columnist and editorial-page editor.
The paper, he told me, gets consistent complaints for being “too negative” — especially about Trump, who has many fervent local fans. The county surrounding Youngstown was a narrow loss for Trump after going big for Obama; and Trump, of course, took Ohio overall.
Trump's Youngstown rally in 2017 drew 7,000 people. They cheered as he vowed to resuscitate the local factories: "They're all coming back. They're coming back. Don't move. Don't sell your house."
De Souza predicted that Trump will win Mahoning County next year, despite the empty promises — and despite the raft of for-sale signs on neatly maintained Lordstown houses.
But chances are that The Vindicator won't be there to cover the election results. The ideas that surfaced at last week's meeting were heartfelt but probably unrealistic: community donations, citizen-generated stories, converting the paper to a nonprofit, or finding a deep-pocketed savior. (The nearby Warren newspaper may expand into Youngstown, and the local Business Journal has pledged to fill some of the void.)
Vindicator Managing Editor Mark Sweetwood, who attended the meeting along with Editor Todd Franko, later shared his reaction to the outpouring:
"There was a lot of passion for The Vindicator, and that was humbling. But good intentions aside, all that talk about a nonprofit model or a wealthy benefactor swooping in" seemed pointless.
After all, there's been no profit for a long time. And The Vindicator has had a generous local benefactor: Mark Brown.
"We've tried that model," Sweetwood told me, "and last Friday, he decided that model was not sustainable."
It’s a sad story. And, as local newspapers enter an inevitable new phase of their decline, one that will become far too familiar.

Texto completo: Sin el conocimiento los automovilistas, los funcionarios de Inmigración y Control de Aduanas ( ICE ) utilizan las bases de datos de licencias de conducir estatales para aplicar tecnología de reconocimiento facial.
Al menos en Utah , Vermont y Washington –que ofrecen licencias de conducir a inmigrantes indocumentados– los oficiales de ICE han solicitado revisar la información de los automovilistas.
En Utah y Vermont se hicieron las búsquedas requeridas para encontrar a un número no indeterminado de personas, indicó The New York Times.
En el tercer estado, Washington, los agentes autorizaron citaciones administrativas del Departamento de Licencias para realizar un escaneo de reconocimiento facial de todas las fotos, pero se desconoce si logró contretarse la búsqueda.
Los documentos que exponen estos tipos de búsqueda fueron obtenidos a través de solicitudes de registros públicos por el Centro de Privacidad y Tecnología de Georgetown Law y reportados por primera vez por The Washington Post.
Es la primera vez que se confirma que ICE utiliza tecnología de reconocimiento facial para escanear las bases de datos de licencias de conducir estatale s, incluidas fotos de residentes legales y ciudadanos.
“Esto es un escándalo”, dijo Harrison Rudolph , un experto en privacidad. “Los estados nunca han aprobado leyes que autoricen a ICE a sumergirse en las bases de datos de licencias de conducir que utilizan el reconocimiento facial para buscar personas” .
Agregó que las entidades no alertan a los indocumentados sobre esa posibilidad.
“Estos estados nunca le han dicho a las personas indocumentadas que cuando solicitan una licencia de conducir también están entregando su rostro a ICE. Eso es un enorme cebo” , consideró.
El Post destaca que la Policía siempre ha tenido acceso a huellas dactilares, ADN y otros “datos biométricos” tomados de sospechosos criminales, pero los registros del DMV contienen las fotos de una gran mayoría de los residentes de cada entidad, la mayoría de los cuales nunca han sido acusados ​​de un delito.
Esto se desarrolla sin autorización de las legislaturas estatales, por lo que un creciente número de legisladores demócratas y republicanos están criticando la tecnología como una herramienta de vigilancia peligrosa, generalizada y propensa a terribles errores.
“El acceso de las agencias de la ley a las bases de datos estatales, especialmente las bases de datos del DMV, a menudo se realiza sin consentimiento” , dijo el presidente del Comité de Supervisión de la Cámara de Representantes, Elh Cummings al Post.
Cuando firmó la reforma que permite otorgar licencias a indocumentados, el gobernador de Nueva York, Andrew Cuomo, dijo que estos datos no se compartirían con agencias como ICE.

Yankee Doodle Donald; Trump wraps himself in the flag, and his opponents are oddly eager to help.

Texto completo: In the classic 1942 film musical "Yankee Doodle Dandy," an autograph seeker asks song-and-dance man George M. Cohan the secret of his success. "Oh," he responds, "I'm an ordinary guy who knows what ordinary guys like to see."
You could say the same for Donald Trump. Whether it's a parade featuring tanks and military aircraft, bright red "Make America Great Again" hats, or fast food at the White House to celebrate college football champs, the president has a knack appealing to ordinary guys. His unembarrassed, over-the-top patriotic displays give him something in common with Cohan, whose statue still stands over Broadway.
With this difference: When Mr. Trump gives the ordinary guy what he likes, his critics come unglued. Though the president himself offers some prime targets, rather than limit their attacks to these, so often his political foes end up attacking things ordinary people like simply because Mr. Trump likes them too.
This dynamic was on display at Washington's July 4 parade as much as the B-2 stealth bomber that soared above. Maybe you have to be a Harvard Law professor to see U.S. Army tanks in the nation's capital as a "chilling" reminder of Tiananmen Square, as Laurence Tribe tweeted. Or a New York Times editor to believe that the week of July 4 is the perfect time to drop a video op-ed under the title "Please Stop Telling Me America Is Great."
It's no surprise when celebrities like Bette Midler and Rob Reiner issue silly statements. But it's amazing to see the same from Democratic presidential candidates, whose success come November 2020 will depend on winning back some of those who voted twice for Barack Obama but went for Mr. Trump in 2016.
Now Democrats have even made Betsy Ross an issue. Right before the Fourth, Nike pulled a new line of sneakers featuring the Ross flag after former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick, a Nike brand ambassador, told the company he thought it offensive and connected to an era of slavery. In reaction, presidential aspirant Julián Castro said he was "glad" Nike pulled the sneaker, and went on to liken the original stars and stripes to the Confederate battle flag.
Ditto for Beto O'Rourke, who praised Nike and said he is "grateful for the conversation." One wonders how many Democrats will be grateful for the conversation if, during the next debate, a moderator asks for a show of hands for all those who find Betsy Ross's flag offensive.
Meanwhile, other Democratic candidates accused the president of politicizing the parade and making it all about himself—when they were the ones who made the parade all about Mr. Trump and politics. Even Joe Biden, who prides himself on his ordinary guy credentials, used his own July 4 speech in Iowa to denounce the Washington parade as "an event designed more to stroke [President Trump's] ego than celebrate American ideals."
Imagine how much stronger Mr. Biden would be today if he had opted for a grace note. Something along the lines of, "July 4 isn't a day for politics. I wish everyone in Washington a wonderful Independence Day parade, and God bless our men and women in uniform."
This is the Achilles' heel of today's American liberalism—the barely disguised sense of superiority not only toward the president but toward any who support him. Hillary Clinton gave voice to this disdain when she dismissed half of Mr. Trump's supporters as not only "deplorables" but "irredeemable" as well.
It is this same sentiment that presumed a group of high-school boys from Covington, Ky., racist simply because they were wearing MAGA hats. And because the American people are benefiting from a booming economy, for some it also means rooting for a recession even if it hurts people, as comedian Bill Maher has said.
Since those first Democratic debates June 26-27, much of the focus has been on policy proposals such as eliminating private insurance or extending Medicare to all those who are in the U.S. illegally. Some wisely question whether this agenda will excite voters in the battleground states Democrats need if the party is to retake the White House.
But policy choices outside the political mainstream are part of a larger vulnerability. This past weekend, a former Journal colleague emailed to say how moved he was by the "Capital Fourth" concert broadcast on PBS after the parade, where he saw nostalgia for American achievements such as the moon landing, pride in being American, and people singing "God Bless America" without fear of the religion police. Democrats, he thought as he watched, might be underestimating the president as a culture warrior.
Perhaps, he added, what he saw in those wholesome July 4 celebrations was "the America that Trump discovered hiding in plain sight, people who responded to his MAGA message." If George M. Cohan were alive, he might have written a musical about it. President Trump is no less a showman, but those looking for his performance will find it in his re-election campaign.

Trump defends detention centers

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump and two of his top immigration officials defended the conditions at federal immigrant detention centers on Sunday, amid reports of squalor and overcrowding at several facilities.
Trump, in a tweet posted from his Bedminster, New Jersey, golf resort, called the accounts of unsafe and unsanitary conditions "phony" and "exaggerated" days after an internal government watchdog issued a report describing "dangerous" overcrowding at facilities in Texas.
Acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan, in an interview with ABC's "This Week," said he has been warning lawmakers for months that border security agencies were ill-equipped to handle the growing number of migrants seeking asylum at the southern border.
"My explanation is that it's an extraordinarily challenging situation," McAleenan told "This Week" co-anchor Martha Raddatz. "We had an overflow situation with hundreds of children crossing every single day ... I'm not denying that there are challenging situations at the border. I've been the one talking about it the most."
McAleenan's interview came after an internal Department of Homeland Security report detailed squalid conditions at five facilities in Texas. His comments also followed a tour by a group of congressional Democrats, including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), of two Texas facilities where they denounced the treatment of detainees inside, saying they had inadequate access to food, water and medicine.
A DHS Office of Inspector General report released last Tuesday detailed "dangerous" overcrowding at several of the facilities and showed photos of detainees pressed against cell windows in crammed, standing-room only cells that far exceeded their intended capacity. The report also found that children often went days without having access to a shower, remained in soiled clothes and often slept on floors.
"We are concerned that overcrowding and prolonged detention represent an immediate risk to the health and safety of DHS agents and officers, and to those detained," the report said.
McAleenan said the department has done a "tremendous amount" to alleviate the pressure on detention facilities by having the U.S. Coast Guard medical corps provide additional medical care at border facilities, and by building additional temporary tent housing for children and families.
McAleenan dismissed a joint report published Sunday by The New York Times and El Paso Times that quoted border agents at a Clint, Texas, facility, who said they raised the alarm about the treatment of children at the facility, which has grappled with outbreaks of scabies, chicken pox and shingles.
"What I can tell you right now is that there's adequate food, water, and the reason those children were at Clint station in the first place was so they could have medical care and shower facilities," McAleenan said.
Acting Citizenship and Immigration Services Director Ken Cuccinelli, appearing on "Fox News Sunday," blamed the influx of migrants fleeing poverty and gang violence in Central America on congressional Democrats, saying they should agree to Trump's calls for stricter entry standards for asylum-seekers.
"You can complain about conditions; conditions are driven by those numbers," Cuccinelli said. "So ultimately they're complaining about the numbers that they're attracting here."
Rep. Rashida Tlalib (D-Mich.), who was part of the congressional delegation that toured the Clint facility last week, told ABC's "This Week" she voted against a $4.6 billion emergency border funding bill that ultimately passed Congress last month because she and other like-minded Democrats, including Ocasio-Cortez, did not want to direct money to a "broken" and "inhumane" system.
"Three agents took me aside, away from my colleagues and said more money is not going to fix this, that they were not trained to separate children," Tlalib said. "That they don't want to separate two-year-olds away from their mothers. That's not what they were trained for, that's not what they signed up for in their service to our country. They signed up to protect the border, not to separate children, not to put people in cages."
Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), appearing on NBC's "Meet the Press," took aim at Trump administration officials who described the reports of unsanitary conditions as unsubstantiated.
"I'm just like, 'What world are they living in?' " Merkley said."From every direction you see that the children are being treated in a horrific manner. And there's an underlying philosophy that it's OK to treat refugees in this fashion. And that's really the rot at the core of the administration's policy."

Financier faces sex-trafficking charges

Texto completo: Miami Herald
MIAMI — More than a decade after receiving one of the most lenient sentences for a serial sex offender in U.S history, multimillionaire Jeffrey Epstein has been arrested outside of New York, sources confirmed to The Miami Herald over the weekend.
Epstein was arrested at Teterboro Airport in New Jersey, according to one of the sources. However, about a dozen federal agents broke down the door to Epstein’s Manhattan townhouse around 5:30 p.m. to execute search warrants, witnesses and sources said.
“We heard the loud banging and we walked over and saw all these FBI agents just pounding down the door,” the witness told the Herald.
Epstein, 66, is expected to be arraigned in federal court in New York on Monday on charges that he molested dozens of underage girls in New York and in Florida, the sources said. His arrest, first reported by The Daily Beast, comes nearly two weeks after the Justice Department announced that it would not throw out his 2008 non-prosecution agreement, even though a federal judge ruled it was illegal.
Rumors had been circulating for months that Epstein was under investigation on sex charges in the Southern District of New York. It’s not clear what instances those investigations involved, and the Herald had not been able to confirm the status of the New York probe.
Sources said he was arrested by the FBI pursuant to a sealed indictment that will be unsealed on Monday. He is in custody in New York and a bail hearing is set for Monday.
“That bail hearing will be critical because if they grant him bail, he has enough money that he will disappear and they will never get him,: a source in New York told the Herald.
Last November, the Herald published a series of stories, titled Perversion of Justice, that described the ways in which the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Florida, Alexander Acosta, worked in conjunction with Epstein’s lawyers to engineer the non-prosecution agreement — and keep it secret from Epstein’s victims. Acosta is now President Donald Trump’s secretary of labor.
Sources told the Herald that the indictment includes new victims and witnesses who spoke to authorities in New York over the past several months.
Epstein, who has homes in Manhattan, Palm Beach, New Mexico, Paris and in the U.S. Virgin Islands, sexually abused nearly three dozen girls, mostly 13-16 years old, at his Palm Beach mansion from 1999 to 2006, according to investigators. He used the girls to help recruit other young girls as part of an operation that ran similar to a pyramid scheme. He also had recruiters who helped with his appointments, scheduling as many as three or four girls a day, the FBI probe found.
Acosta met one-on-one with Epstein’s lawyer, Jay Lefkowitz, in October 2007, at a West Palm Beach Marriott.
Records reviewed by the Herald showed that it was at that meeting that Acosta agreed to a non-prosecution agreement that gave Epstein and others involved in his operation federal immunity.
As part of the deal, Epstein was allowed to plead guilty to two state prostitution charges involving a 17-year-old girl, and he served 13 months in the Palm Beach County jail. The deal was sealed, however, so that no one — not even his victims — knew the details about the agreement until nearly a year later. By that time, Epstein had already been released from jail and had returned to his jet-setting life.
On Wednesday, a federal appeals court in New York ordered the unsealing of up to 2,000 pages of documents that are expected to show evidence relating to whether Epstein and his partner, Ghislaine Maxwell, were recruiting underage girls and young women as part of an international sex trafficking operation. Maxwell, 57, has never been charged.
The ruling came after the Herald, joined by a consortium of media companies, including The New York Times, asked that the records be opened. Two other parties, social media blogger Michael Cernovich and lawyer Alan Dershowitz, also sought to have some of the documents made public. Dershowitz, who represented Epstein during the 2006-2007 federal criminal probe, has also been accused of having sex with one of Epstein’s underage girls. Dershowitz has denied the allegation and has said that the records will clear him of any wrongdoing.
As part of its investigation, the Herald was able to identify nearly 80 girls who were molested by Epstein. Four of the victims, now in their late 20s and early 30s, spoke on camera about how they were traumatized first by Epstein, then by his lawyers and private investigators, and finally by the prosecutors themselves, who disposed of the case without telling them.
One of the victims, Virginia Roberts Giuffre, said that she was forced by Epstein and Maxwell to have sex with a number of wealthy and powerful politicians, academics and government leaders, including Dershowitz and Prince Andrew. She has never named the other men, largely because she has been afraid, her lawyers said.
In October 2017, as the #MeToo movement spurred a national conversation about the sexual harassment and abuse of women, the Herald had already begun examining the Epstein case. Earlier that year, following Acosta’s nomination as labor secretary, the Herald began to take a closer look at what role he played in Epstein’s controversial plea bargain. In the 10 years since Epstein’s case was closed by the FBI, about two dozen civil court cases had been filed, often alleging that Epstein’s sex crimes with underage victims were far more serious than prosecutors led the public to believe.
The vast trove of litigation included tens of thousands of pages of court pleadings, motions, appeals, depositions, hearing transcripts, judges’ decisions, witness and victim statements, as well as emails and letters between federal prosecutors and Epstein’s defense lawyers.
Besides sorting through volumes of court documents, the Herald also began the process of trying to locate Epstein’s victims — most of whom were labeled in court documents as Jane Does in order to protect their identities as minors. Many of the women said they had never told anyone of the abuse because they were too ashamed and already felt that the criminal justice system had failed them.
The Herald then set about obtaining 10 years of public records connected to the Epstein criminal cases. These included the Palm Beach State Attorney’s Office files, the Palm Beach police files, and records from the Florida Department of Corrections, the Palm Beach Sheriff’s Office, the FBI and the U.S. Department of Justice.
Epstein’s primary residence is on Little St. James, an island off the coast of St. Thomas. Last year, he purchased a second larger island, Great St. James, where he has been clearing land in preparation for building. His plane records show that during the time he was abusing young girls, he was flying former President Bill Clinton, Harvard professors and administrator, Nobel-prize winning scientists, actresses, actors, philanthropists and a who’s who of wealthy and powerful people to his island.
His plane, nicknamed “the Lolita Express,” was also allegedly used to traffic women and girls from overseas, Giuffre told the Herald.

Texto completo: After it emerged that thousands of taxi drivers had been lured into reckless loans that left them with overwhelming debt, city leaders took steps to keep it from happening again. They have begun enforcement proceedings against brokers who arranged the loans, arrested a debt collector, strengthened oversight and written new rules.
But there is one thing they have not offered: a bailout for the cabbies who are still struggling.
"It's great to say 'never again,' but it's not enough," said Mark D. Levine, one of 10 members of the City Council who, along with the city's comptroller, Scott M. Stringer, have said they support at least a partial bailout of affected drivers. "It's just incredibly frustrating that all of the response has been about trying to prevent further fraud and abuse going forward without doing anything about the fraud and abuse that has already occurred."
The tension is expected to increase Monday, when Mayor Bill de Blasio is set to release the results of a 45-day review of the taxi industry he ordered after The New York Times reported on the exploitative loans.
The review -- City Hall's main response to the crisis -- calls for more oversight and tighter rules, but it does not raise the idea of a bailout.
The Times's investigation, which was published in May, found that taxi industry leaders had artificially inflated the price of the permit -- called a medallion -- that allows drivers to own a cab and made hundreds of millions of dollars by directing drivers into risky loans they could not afford. The price of a medallion soared to more than $ 1 million in 2014, from $ 200,000 in 2002, before crashing, leaving thousands with underwater loans, The Times found.
Industry leaders have denied wrongdoing and placed the blame on the city for allowing ride-hailing apps, such as Uber and Lyft, into the market with little regulation.
More than 950 medallion owners have filed for bankruptcy. Thousands more are struggling to survive.
In its review, the city determined that the brokers who usually arranged the medallion sales, as well as the loans, were plagued by conflicts of interest and frequently violated city rules, including by failing to explain loan terms to borrowers, according to a summary obtained by The Times. As a result, the summary says, several brokers could face fines.
The summary recommends that the city require brokers to disclose more information about themselves and their loans; translate documents into 10 languages; publish all future broker violations online; and create a city unit to more closely supervise industry leaders.
But the split over a potential bailout is the biggest dispute among city officials in response to The Times's investigation.
Asked about a bailout, the mayor's office noted that the city had already agreed to waive $ 10 million in fees owed by taxi owners and had started to build a driver assistance center to give financial counseling and mental health services to drivers.
A full bailout would cost billions, the office said. City Hall has estimated that it could cost about $ 13 billion, although some councilmen say it could be done for less money.
The office also referred to the mayor's comments in a recent radio interview, in which he said that a lot of people in the city are suffering and that not everybody can be bailed out.
On Sunday, Mr. de Blasio released a statement saying: "This report shines a light on many of the predatory practices of the broker industry and with this new insight, we'll be able to do even more to help taxi drivers too long taken advantage of by those they trusted for guidance and help. If you're a cabdriver in New York City, know we're in your corner and that this is just a start."
Corey Johnson, the speaker of the Council, declined to comment. He has sponsored legislation to prevent future problems but has not publicly said whether he supports a bailout.
In the weeks since the investigation was published, Attorney General Letitia James of New York has opened an inquiry into the lending practices, and political leaders in Albany and Washington have begun discussions about holding hearings and drafting legislation.
But advocates for cabdrivers said the city has the biggest obligation to respond to the crisis because of its role in causing it.
"Drivers don't want some city official telling them they're getting screwed over," said Bhairavi Desai, the founder of the Taxi Workers Alliance, which represents medallion owners as well as drivers who work for taxi fleets. "They want to know how their poverty is going to end."
For years, the investigation found, city, state and federal regulators ignored warning signs. The Taxi and Limousine Commission, the city agency that oversees the industry, went even further, choosing to sell medallions and running advertisements claiming that the permits were "better than the stock market" and a path to a "worry-free retirement."
Some members of the City Council expressed optimism that the mayor and other officials will ultimately support a bailout. "This conversation is really just beginning, and I really hope we're going to get there," Councilman Stephen T. Levin said.
But others expressed deep frustration. Several said they were dismayed by City Hall's estimate for a bailout, which is based on paying $ 1 million to buy back each of the city's 13,587 medallions.
Some councilmen, including Ydanis Rodriguez, the transportation committee chairman; Ritchie Torres, the oversight committee head; and Brad Lander, the deputy leader for policy, said a bailout would target only medallions that are owned by individual drivers, not fleets. There are between 4,000 and 6,000 driver-owners, they said.
In addition, the councilmen said, the city would not need to spend $ 1 million per medallion. (The average borrower owes about $ 500,000 on a medallion.) Under one proposal, the city would provide about $ 100,000 per medallion, with the driver keeping a debt of about $ 200,000 and the lender being pressured to forgive the rest of the loan.
"We don't have to buy it all back, but we need to do something," Mr. Rodriguez said. "City Hall needs to work with us to figure this out."

Texto completo: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) faced sharp criticism Sunday from some liberal lawmakers and activists over her latest comments about a group of Democratic women who opposed last month's House emergency border aid bill that was supported by the leadership and most Democrats.
The increasingly charged debate over the House's approach to what became a $4.6 billion package - and complaints that it failed to set standards for the humane treatment of migrants held in federal custody - underlined the tensions among Democrats over strategy and policy as they counter President Trump.
Although Pelosi maintains that she is aggressively confronting Trump on immigration and other fronts, there is widespread anger among liberals about the president and growing calls for Pelosi to resist working with the administration and begin impeachment proceedings.
"It is very disappointing that the speaker would ever try to diminish our voices in so many ways," Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.), who voted against the border bill, said on ABC's "This Week."
Tlaib's remarks came hours after Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) voiced her frustration with House Democratic leaders on Saturday night in tweets. Ocasio-Cortez was responding to Pelosi's comment in a New York Times interview that the opposition to last month's border bill was misguided and scant, with just four Democrats opposing the House version of the border bill.
"I don't believe it was a good idea for Dems to blindly trust the Trump admin when so many kids have died in their custody," Ocasio-Cortez tweeted. "It's a huge mistake."
The original, House-passed bill had stronger restrictions for the administration on migrant custody issues. Elements of that bill were later dropped in the Senate's border legislation.
Pelosi has repeatedly swatted back criticism of the House border bill by citing her own horror at reports of poor conditions at overcrowded U.S. Customs and Border Protection facilities where unaccompanied children have been kept. She has said those reports made swift action necessary, even as Democrats oppose Trump's immigration policies.
Still, four first-term House Democratic women with high profiles - Tlaib, Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar (Minn.), and Ayanna Pressley (Mass.) - voted against the measure, encouraged by liberal activists and migrant advocacy groups. Omar said at the time that the bill was only "throwing more money" at the Trump administration, which she accused of committing "human rights abuses."
"All these people have their public whatever and their Twitter world," Pelosi said in an interview with New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd that was published online Saturday. "But they didn't have any following. They're four people and that's how many votes they got."
Ocasio-Cortez rebuked Pelosi's comment to Dowd about her bloc's "public whatever" in a Saturday tweet, writing, "That public 'whatever' is called public sentiment. And wielding the power to shift it is how we actually achieve meaningful change in this country."
Tlaib argued Sunday that the opposition of the four first-term women is significant because of their backgrounds and life experiences, regardless of whether it caused consternation for House Democratic leaders.
"You know, people like us, people like me and Ayanna, Ilhan and Alexandria, we're reflective of our nation in many ways," Tlaib told ABC News. "Guess what? We know what it feels like to be dehumanized. We know what it feels like to be brown and black in this country. And I'll tell you right now, we're not going to stand by and sit idly by and allow brown and dark-skinned children to be ripped away from their parents to be dehumanized."
Some House Democrats voiced support as the four lawmakers stood by their opposition to Pelosi's handling of the border bill.
Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), a co-chair of Sen. Bernie Sanders's campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination, tweeted Saturday, "Do not dismiss [Ocasio-Cortez] for casting lonely votes. . . . History proves that dissent provokes reflection & change."
Pelosi's deputy chief of staff, Drew Hammill, shrugged off Fallon's critique. "Said with all the anti-establishment gusto a former Schumer and Clinton spox can manage," he tweeted.
Fallon previously worked as an adviser and spokesman for Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign.
Hammill also tweeted Sunday that Pelosi was responding to Dowd's question about the specific criticism "this group leveled against Pelosi" on the border bill - and he said she was not making a broadly contemptuous statement about their political standing.
"She's not talking about them as votes but referring to the Tuesday vote where they were the only four Dem nays," Hammill wrote.
In the Dowd interview, Pelosi criticized news coverage of the Democratic response to Trump's immigration efforts as making "a story that is more about Democrats divided than the fact that" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) "doesn't care about the children."
Pelosi's interview with Dowd is not the first time she has drawn the ire of liberals for how she has talked about Ocasio-Cortez and other influential freshmen.
During an April interview with CBS's "60 Minutes," Pelosi said the faction of lawmakers clashing with leadership was "like five people" as she defended her record as a liberal leader.
Rep. Joaquin Castro (D-Tex.), the Congressional Hispanic Caucus chairman, called on Congress last week to pass a bill this month addressing next year's spending by the Department of Homeland Security, frustrated that emergency legislation failed to include explicit standards for the care of migrants in federal custody.
Pelosi did not personally respond to the criticism from Tlaib and Ocasio-Cortez on Sunday.

'Trump radiates insecurity': UK to investigate leak of ambassador's scathing takes on White House

Resumen: When asked about the leaked remarks, President Donald Trump told reporters that Ambassador Kim Darroch "has not served the U.K. well."

Texto completo: Leaked diplomatic cables published Sunday revealed unflattering comments from the British ambassador to the United States about the Trump administration, which he called "diplomatically clumsy and inept. "
Ambassador Kim Darroch's critical assessment was part of several documents from 2017 to the present, which The Mail said it was given in an "unprecedented leak" that it dubbed "The Washington Files. "
Some of the most inflammatory statements from Darroch came from a June 22, 2017, briefing note on the president and his team, which was prepared for top British officials, The Mail reported.
"For a man who has risen to the highest office on the planet, President Trump radiates insecurity," Darroch wrote in that memo.
"We don’t really believe this administration is going to become substantially more normal; less dysfunctional; less unpredictable; less faction riven; less diplomatically clumsy and inept," Darroch wrote.
A statement from the British Foreign Office did not dispute the documents' authenticity and said it did not believe the "mischievious behavior" would hurt diplomatic ties with the administration.
"The British public would expect our ambassadors to provide ministers with an honest, unvarnished assessment of the politics in their country. Their views are not necessarily the views of ministers or indeed the government," the statement said, according to The New York Times.
A spokesman for the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office later said that "a formal leak investigation" would be conducted, according to the Times and NBC News.
When asked about the leaked remarks, Trump told reporters that Darroch "has not served the U. K. well. "
In his 2017 briefing note, written a month after Robert Mueller was appointed special counsel to investigate Russian interference in the 2016 election, Darroch said he feared the "worst cannot be ruled out" about potential coordination between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin.
"There could have been active collusion between individuals associated with the Trump campaign and Russian intelligence, especially over the timing of release of hacked emails from inside the Clinton camp," he said. "Dodgy Russian financiers may have bailed out the Trump and Kushner enterprises when both were at risk of bankruptcy in previous decades. "
And, Darroch said, "Trump's attempts to close down the FBI investigation" into former national security adviser Michael Flynn "might amount to obstruction of justice. "
But despite the scandals swirling around the White House, Darroch said Trump could still win a second term and "emerge from the flames, battered but intact, like Schwarzenegger in the final scenes of The Terminator. "
More recently, in a June 22 cable from this year, Darroch called the administration's policy toward Iran "incoherent" and "chaotic" and said that he did not expect it to become "coherent any time soon," The Mail reported.
44% approval: Trump approval rating jumps to highest level of his presidency in Washington Post/ABC News poll
Darroch said he did not believe Trump's explanation that he aborted a planned military strike against Iran in retaliation for a downed unmanned drone because he was concerned about Iranian casualties.
"His claim, however, that he changed his mind because of 150 predicted casualties doesn't stand up; he would certainly have heard this figure in his initial briefing," Darroch wrote.
"It's more likely that he was never fully on board and that he was worried about how this apparent reversal of his 2016 campaign promises would look come 2020," Darroch said, apparently referring to Trump's pledge to avoid foreign entanglements.
On June 17, Darroch shared his views on Trump's recent diplomatic visit to the U. K.
"With this unorthodox President, there were genuine risks," he said. But he wrote that "the gamble" paid off.
According to The Mail, Darroch said that while Trump was "used to being feted by foreign governments," his visit with British royalty offered "an honour that no other country can match. He said Trump "revelled in every element of it" and "knew from the outset that it amounted to genuinely special treatment. "
Opinion: The real reason why the left was against Donald Trump's July 4 speech
Darroch also noted that it was critical that those around the president, whom he called the "Trump Whisperers," had a good time.
"His team were also dazzled, telling us that this had been a visit like no other – the hottest ticket of their careers," he said, according to The Mail. "These are close contacts, with whom we have spent years building relationships: they are the gatekeepers . . . the individuals we rely upon to ensure the UK voice is heard in the West Wing. "
But he cautioned that the visit's impact could be short-lived because, "This is still the land of America First. "
Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage said Sunday that the documents made it clear that Darroch was a "globalist" and "completely anti-Trump. "
"Some of these comments he's made go way beyond fair reporting," Farage said. "We're into the world here of opinion, clearly strongly biased opinion. And the sooner he's gone as the U. K. 's ambassador in Washington the better. "
Farage added that his assessment had nothing to do with Trump's 2016 tweet saying he thought Farage should be the ambassador to the U. S.

Hard-won pride, 50 years after Stonewall

Texto completo: It was 1969. I was 13, bookish and feeling a strange attraction to other girls on the softball team. So, I read Time Magazine on the June 28th Stonewall riots in far-off Greenwich Village: "The homosexual subculture is, without question, shallow and unstable."
Previously, Time had described homosexuality as "a pathetic little second-rate substitute for reality, a pitiable flight from life [that] deserves no encouragement, no glamorization, no rationalization, no fake status as minority martyrdom, no sophistry about simple differences in taste - and above all no pretense that it is anything but a pernicious sickness."
Fifty years after Stonewall - when police and protesters famously clashed outside the Stonewall Inn, a New York gay bar - we need to remember our journey.
I came out as a teenager in Baltimore in the early 1970s. My mother said, "Kissing a woman is like kissing a horse." That didn't track with my experience with the cheerleading squad. I found a lesbian bar on Pratt and Exeter called Mitch's that rocked on the weekends. But police came in regularly to harass us - a terrifying, humiliating, infuriating experience.
By my 20s I was appearing on local TV at gay protests. I remember protesting "Cruising" at the Rotunda - a film that presented gay men as maniacal serial killers. A family friend saw the news coverage and called me a "bulldyke" at Emmanuel Episcopal Church's coffee hour. My family nearly disowned me.
I fled to New York City, a gay mecca during the Reagan years, and got a job as national spokesperson for Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund, the gay legal group. At first all I could do was give background because national journalists did not view us "homosexuals" as credible sources. In the early 1980s the New York Times would call me, get information on a Lambda case heading to the Supreme Court, then call a straight person at the ACLU or Harvard Law to get a quote. What we "homosexuals" said or thought did not matter. Our names were certainly not fit to print.
Not until the AIDS crisis erupted did the national press start regularly quoting me and other gay advocates. It was a political breakthrough and a personal heartbreak. Everyone I had grown up with and gone to school with saw me. In the New York Times. In the Washington Post. In USA Today. Personal and professional relationships vanished.
I was so preoccupied with what straight America thought of me back then. I remember distinctly putting on pearls for a photo shoot with US News and World Report, thinking of my mother in Towson. Then in 1986 the Supreme Court decided "Bowers v. Hardwick," ruling that it was perfectly fine for the police to enter our homes, go into our bedrooms and arrest us for having consensual sex.
The night of June 30, 1986, I spoke at a swelling, roiling protest in Sheridan Square, calling for a day of national protest. At our massive march in New York City on July 4 that year, I saw a man viciously beaten by anti-gay thugs. When I visited him the next day in the hospital the doctors were trying to save his eyesight. I felt responsible because I had called the march and only found consolation by reading Martin Luther King Jr.: "Our lives begin to end the day we become silent about things that matter."
I look back on this painful personal and national journey and marvel. Now Ellen DeGeneres is on TV, and Wanda Sykes is touring. A married gay man is running for president. Marriage equality is the law of the land. This June, Pride events happened in every major city and town in America and around the world. As for me, I have my own family, my own children, my own hard-won pride.
Celebrate with me, but remember, my friends, it's equality only if we can keep it.

Texto completo: For a brief period in the 1980s in the northern Chicago suburbs, there was no cooler clothing than Ocean Pacific.
I do not know why these trends appear, how a California surfwear brand suddenly becomes de rigueur among Midwestern teens, but as one of those teens, my job was not to wonder why.
So imagine the thrill of attending one of the country's largest swap meets in Shipshewana, Ind., and seeing a table of OP T-shirts priced at a fraction of their usual retail cost.
Then picture the disappointment when, upon the first washing and drying of the T-shirts, they seem to have all the heft and consistency of cotton candy, almost disintegrating entirely before one's eyes.
Lesson learned. Caveat emptor reigns at swap meets. Similarly, there is little expectation that the Gucci bag purchased on vacation from a dude with a pushcart stand out front of the Vatican is the real article, but when it comes to a retail store, there's certain expectations that what something appears to be is indeed what it is.
But what are our expectations for Amazon? Is it a respected retailer standing behind its products or a swap meet?
Some of both?
Writing at The New York Times, David Streitfeld alerts us to the problem of counterfeit books sold through Amazon, including "The Sanford Guide to Antimicrobial Therapy," which has confronted a "flood" of illicit copies -- which is no big deal, except that an incorrect recommended drug or dosage could kill someone -- and it may be undercutting the real book's sales by 25%.
Print-on-demand technology has led to fakes of award-winning books and best-sellers, such as Andrew Sean Greer's Pulitzer Prize-winning "Less" and Lauren Groff's "Florida," both of which were undercut in price by copies put up for sale on Amazon.
Books in the public domain are dumped into barely formatted pages and peddled to unsuspecting readers. Popular books, such as John Carreyrou's "Bad Blood," about the implosion of the Theranos blood-testing start-up, are undercut by cheap digest versions that claim to summarize the original's contents.
To Amazon, it's all the same: a sale is a sale, and as Kaitlyn Tiffany observes at Vox, Amazon makes money on the counterfeit books just like it does the real ones.
You see, Amazon is both a retailer and not a retailer. You can buy items stocked and fulfilled by Amazon, but they are also a platform through which third-party sellers can list their wares. Some of those third-party sellers would make the street-cart vendors with their $5 Ray-Ban shades look like paragons of virtue.
Legally, it is not Amazon's responsibility to make sure all those third parties are on the up-and-up. Chalk this up as another example of how our pre-internet laws did not anticipate what would happen when digitized information is so readily produced and distributed.
As individuals, we lack the defenses to respond to these threats. Consider this akin to the "deep fake" videos that spoof prominent people, making them appear to say incendiary and outrageous things. Because of the intersection of technology and largely unregulated platforms, we cannot trust that what we see is, in fact, genuine.
We can fall back on caveat emptor when we have the opportunity to inspect the merchandise. We knew those Ocean Pacific T-shirts were most likely fake, not just because of the price, but their tissue-thin fabric.
But with some of these digital counterfeits, there's no way to discern the difference until it's too late. We're at the mercy of these tech giants who are profiting, even if they're selling us a worthless knock-off.
Buyers shouldn't just beware; they should demand more from Amazon and its regulators.

Book recommendations from the Biblioracle
John Warner tells you what to read next based on the last five books you've read.

1. "Hell's Corner" by David Baldacci
2. "No Second Chance" by Harlan Coben
3. "American Assassin" by Vince Flynn
4. "The Third Target" by Joel Rosenberg
5. "The Justice Game" by Randy Singer
-- Tom M., Rockford
A clear predilection for thrillers here, which makes the recommendation both easy and hard. Easy in that we know what Tom likes. Hard in that it's tougher to find something he hasn't read. I also wouldn't be a true Biblioracle if I didn't try to expand the window a bit. I normally don't recommend books by close friends, but in this case, my buddy Kevin Guilfoile's "Cast of Shadows" fits the bill.

1. "The Woman in Cabin 10" by Ruth Ware
2. "The Woman in the Window" by A.J. Finn
3. "Where'd you go, Bernadette?" by Maria Semple
4. "Missing You" by Harlan Coben
5. "The Witch Elm" by Tana French
-- MaryKay T., Lake Villa
Another reader where there's a clear readerly bent. In this case, it's handy that we have Kate Atkinson's new Jackson Brodie novel out. I would suggest MaryKay start with the first installment, "Case Histories."

1. "Dangerously Funny: The Uncensored Story of the Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour" by David Bianculli
2. "Stone Mothers" by Erin Kelly
3. "Calypso" by David Sedaris
4. "Rules of Civility" by Amor Towles
5. "No Sunscreen for the Dead" by Tim Dorsey
-- Heidi O., Volo, Ill.
For Heidi I want something with plenty of wit and a little bite. That suggests the strange, short, but for me, laugh out loud, "Riots I Have Known" by Ryan Chapman.

Texto completo: When David Carr died, he left behind 1,946 pieces of digital correspondence with his daughter.
His death had been sudden: In 2015, he collapsed in the newsroom of the New York Times, where he served as the paper's renowned media columnist. An autopsy would later reveal he had lung cancer; he was 58.
And so in the wake of her father's unexpected death, Erin Lee Carr clung to every email, each G-chat they'd exchanged. She saw in him the same demons that plagued her -- the call to alcohol and drugs, an unbridled need to achieve that he once described to her as a kind of birthright: "You are a Carr, and that is a complicated, wondrous inheritance. That means you are tough, you are smart, you are someone others want to be around. But it also means that mistakes of hubris, excess, and indulgence will stalk you."

When he died, she was 26, in the early stages of a documentary filmmaking career that he had helped her launch. He'd long been eager to help her find success, and she did not eschew his guidance.
He connected her with industry contacts he'd interviewed, like Shane Smith, the former CEO of Vice -- the company where she'd go on to land her first job. He spruced up a pitch letter she'd written to Judd Apatow, tossing in some of his distinctive prose. And after she was fired from Vox Media, he reached out to Andrew Rossi -- the filmmaker who'd trained his lens on the journalist in 2011's "Page One: Inside the New York Times" -- asking if the director would have coffee with his kid.
It was a meeting that proved instrumental for Carr, leading her to make four documentaries for HBO. Two of those projects are being released in quick succession: In May, the network aired "At the Heart of Gold: Inside the USA Gymnastics Scandal," a film she made about the sexual abuse inflicted on dozens of young female athletes by team doctor Larry Nassar.
And on Tuesday comes the first in a two-part docuseries, "I Love You, Now Die: The Commonwealth Vs. Michelle Carter," about a 17-year-old who seemingly encouraged her boyfriend to commit suicide via text message.
Both are coming out on the heels of the April publication of her first book, a memoir about her relationship with her dad called "All That You Leave Behind." The confluence of events has led to a flurry of attention for Carr, now 31, and interviews on NPR's "Fresh Air" with Terry Gross and "Armchair Expert," the popular podcast hosted by Dax Shepard -- the kind of recognition her dad knew well, something he simultaneously pushed her toward and cautioned her against.
"As soon as you figure out the job, or the case, or the story, there will be another," he wrote in an 2014 email to Carr that she shares in her book. "The reward for achievement is a hunger for more, a blessing that lives inside a curse."
That's exactly what the Brooklyn-based Carr was grappling with on a recent trip to Los Angeles, a day after sitting opposite Shepard in his famous attic.
"All this stuff is happening, but I'm feeling fearful about it going away," she admitted. "It's about balancing the deep ambition that my father instilled in me -- but I think was also what led to his death. This extremism of cigarettes and coffee and not sleeping. He died when he was 58. That's not something I want for myself."
--
Depths of addiction
It was a hazy spring morning, and Carr was drinking coffee, wearing the same kind of round, black-rimmed eyeglasses her dad often sported. She had on a tank top, making the tattoos on her arms visible. In a few hours, she'd head back to the airport, one of the few places she finds still tests her sobriety because of the "cornucopia of alcohol" for offer in the lounge.
In his own memoir, Carr's father revealed the depths of his addiction -- he was a crackhead, and when Erin and her twin sister were just months old, he left them alone in a freezing car for two hours while he went off in search of a score. So when Carr began drinking too much in her early 20s, she sought her dad's help in 12-stepping her through Alcoholics Anonymous. She's been sober for 31/2 years and attributes her work ethic in part to being clean.
"If you look at the amount of films I've made in the last couple of years, I don't have a peer that's done that, and that's because I'm sober," she said. "At night, I keep working or watch ... TV."
But she has also been a diligent student of the genre. When Carr first sat with Rossi in 2013, she had made two short films for Vice -- projects he was a fan of. She was up for a gig as the head of video at Cosmopolitan, but the director urged her to consider making her own films instead.
"She has a real emotional intelligence and a sort of savvy about how the market works," said Rossi. "I think directors need to have a connection to a subject and the courage to put themselves on the line. Those are things you don't necessarily need a PhD in -- they're instinctive. You don't have to be 40 years old to be a director."
So Rossi set up a meeting with Sheila Nevins, then the head of documentary film at HBO. Carr was scared. She'd heard tales of how "incredible and revered and out there" the executive was. And within minutes of pitching her first idea to Nevins -- about Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht -- she was shot down.
"She was like, 'That's boring! I don't like that! It smells like gasoline in here!' " Carr remembered, laughing.
But she didn't want to lose her shot with Nevins, so she kept bringing up ideas. Eventually, Nevins bit: She was interested in the story of the so-called Cannibal Cop, a New York City police officer accused of conspiracy to kidnap, rape, torture and eat women.
Nevins, not one to mince words, acknowledged she was not initially impressed by Carr and said she "did pick up on the fact that Erin had an easily intimidated side."
"I guess I have that effect on young women," Nevins said in a phone call. "To me, she was a young filmmaker, and I thought her idea was horrible. I do remember being excited to meet her and not knowing much about her work. I had a repertoire of seasoned people, and it was time to break out of the mold. She was young and ambitious and aggressive. I was curious. I thought, how big can she grow?"
With a development deal in hand, Carr set out to make "Thought Crimes: The Case of the Cannibal Cop," which was released in 2015. Every night, she watched documentaries "compulsively" -- films like "Capturing the Friedmans" and "There's Something Wrong with Aunt Diane" to gather a better understanding of the genre. She started keeping a Google Doc to track the mistakes she made on set and learn from them: Check if the cinematographer has extra batteries. Always have a spare hard drive with you. When you are done interviewing a subject, it's time to get them to sign a release.
She also kept in mind a lesson from her father: Approach the craft like a journalist would, finding a beat, sticking to it and eventually excelling in it.
Her follow-up film, 2017's "Mommy Dead and Dearest," would further establish her niche in the true crime genre. The film told the story of Gypsy Rose Blanchard, who was convicted of conspiring to kill her mother after years of being the victim of Munchausen syndrome by proxy. The case gained further notoriety this year when, in March, Hulu released "The Act," a critically acclaimed fictionalized version of the story starring Patricia Arquette and Joey King.
Carr has no interest in watching "The Act" and is conflicted about the project's existence.
"I spent my life figuring this out, and then somebody fictionalized it without the family's consent," she said. "I've heard good things about it, and they got incredible actors to do it. But I'm close to the family, and it's painful for them."
Carr said she likes true crime tales because she is interested in "demystifying motives" -- exploring culpability and holding power to account. She often mines for ideas in People magazine and on Reddit threads, seeking layered stories that often have to do with complicated women. Rossi, who has produced three of Carr's films, described her as having a strong radar that allows her to know which stories will "push the right buttons and penetrate the noise."
"I think that what I bring to a table -- and how I pitch people now -- is I will give you an empathetic portrait, a human rendering of something really terrible that happened," she explained. "I will look at it from all sides, and it will feel nonjudgmental. I think that so often filmmakers have such a point of view, but with my films, I don't know if you can really tell what I think."
--
'I have to court her'
With Carr's latest, "I Love You, Now Die," Nevins said she was impressed with how her protegee uncovered the human side of a young woman she expected to hate.
"I'd thought Michelle Carter forced her boyfriend to kill himself in his truck. And there are very few filmmakers who would have gone so deep to find an abused kid and not the murderous villain who was portrayed in the press," said Nevins, who is now leading MTV's nascent documentary division. "Erin finds something in these very strange, difficult people that is enormously human and compelling. She has a way of knowing we're all in it together, drunk or sober, evil or good. She's not without sorrow. She's not without evil thoughts. And that's helped her understand those emotions."
Nevins joked that she no longer intimidates Carr -- instead, the young upstart scares her, mostly because she now has the ability to work with other top executives.
"She was, like, so accessible and now I have to court her," Nevins lamented. "She's very loyal, but she wants to work. She wants to have an apartment."
Carr said she's trying to overcome what she calls her "scarcity complex" -- saying yes to everything she's offered because she's worried each job may be her last. She's been pitched some biopics on comedians, and friends wonder why she doesn't want to tackle something lighter, but she said she's committed to becoming "the best possible director" in the true crime space.
But if she wants to avoid her dad's fate, she knows she needs to be mindful of her health -- going to the doctor when she says she will instead of blowing off the appointment for a shoot.
"One time, my dad asked me: 'What if you become more successful than me?' And I was like, 'I hope so!' " Carr said. "I think he was joking, but he was somewhat serious. Do I want to be equal to or surpass my dad, or is that a delusion? What is the ambition for?
"With the gymnastics documentary, I got one review that was a little tough. And one of the subjects told me: 'I'm in it. I suffered abuse and you helped me. Isn't that what matters?' She set me straight in this moment of ego. And I was like, 'Yes, that's what matters. Connecting with others as a result of work.' That is the privilege.
"Yes, I'm interested in money ... but is that really gonna impact my soul? I print out some of those emails and hang them in my office, because this is how I'll get better. Just in the way that I used to print out my dad's emails."

Texto completo: It seems an inevitability that every year around the Fourth of July, certain media will publish a series of articles reminding people how unremarkable it is to live in America.
This year The New York Times' opinion team didn't disappoint, publishing a video that declared, "we're just OK," and explaining to viewers that when compared to other industrialized nations, the U.S. really doesn't stack up.
The video cites "a whopping 18% poverty rate, closer to Mexico than Western Europe," lower high school science, reading and math levels compared to other nations, and high rates of obesity that result in far higher healthcare costs, to name of few of America's unforgivable blemishes.
The video, of course, mockingly mentions the areas in which America excels, including "civilian gun ownership, mass shootings, TV watching, prescription drug abuse, prison population - Oh, and almost No. 1 on environmental damage, edged out by China."
The narrator suggests that at times, it would be understandable to confuse America for a developing country and ultimately determines that one's understanding or sense of American greatness is determined by personal wealth and little else.
The narrator's mocking continues with a quip about American liberty - "But we have freedom in America, and everyone's jealous ... or something," reminding viewers that hey, other countries have freedom, too, and we don't even use ours, since just over half the population participates in national elections.
Never mind that (however ill-advised), abstaining from an election is a critical element of freedom. The video was of course intended to be provocative and to challenge the reflexive notion of some that American exceptionalism is permanent and static - an honor forever justified by long-dead Americans' collective contributions to the world, (although, it's worth noting that even the greatness of the nation's Founders is a point of contention these days).
And here, the video's creators may have a point, albeit a small one. The United States' status as a great nation, secured early and defended courageously over the ensuing centuries, isn't a guarantee.
Every successive generation is charged with living up to the high standards set by those who first envisioned America as a beacon on a hill.
That's a difficult challenge, especially during a modern age where the primacy of the individual has subverted the pursuit of the common good. But I digress. There have been, and will continue to be, notable failures along our nation's moral course.
Still, to borrow a phrase popularized by the great, yet flawed American, Martin Luther King, Jr., its arc will always bend toward justice and freedom. Thanks to the high ideals established when America was still a nascent nation, it always (ultimately) has.
Despite The New York Times' poo-pooing of American freedom as something ordinary or banal, freedom is a hallmark of American greatness. It is what has made many of its other attributes (and failures) possible. And over the years, despite arguments to the contrary, freedom in the U.S. has vastly expanded - from women's rights to race relations and civil rights to gay rights - and it has happened in a remarkably short period of time. There are legitimate reasons for concern over our nation's direction.
Political extremism on both ends of the spectrum, although hardly a U.S.-specific problem, has the potential to limit freedoms in ways the Founders foresaw; and we have the power to prevent.
The images of migrants crossing our nation's southern border and enduring awful conditions in detention centers for many reasons are difficult to stomach. Yet they are the starkest reminder that our nation is more than just OK. It is great.
People wouldn't be clamoring to get here if it weren't. It's best we keep that in mind this Fourth and every day after.

Kamala Harris is elected president in 2020 and reelected in 2024, by the time she leaves office 114 months from now she might have a coherent answer to the question of whether Americans should be forbidden to have what 217 million of them currently have: private health insurance. Her 22 weeks of contradictory statements, and her Trumpian meretriciousness about her contradictions, reveal a frivolity about upending health care's complex 18% of America's economy. And her bumblings illustrate how many of the Democratic presidential aspirants, snug in their intellectual silos, have lost -- if they ever had -- an aptitude for talking like, and to, normal Americans.
Seven days after announcing her candidacy in January, Harris, appearing on CNN, endorsed "Medicare for All" and was asked: So, people "who like their [private] insurance, they don't get to keep it?" She answered: "The idea is that everyone gets access to medical care, and you don't have to go through the process of going through an insurance company, having them give you approval, going through the paperwork, all of the delay that may require. ... Let's eliminate all of that." More government, less paperwork. Really.
She subsequently, as The New York Times -- not an unsympathetic auditor of her campaign -- says, "waffled" regarding private insurance. But at the second Miami debate she raised her hand ("just as quickly as Mr. Sanders," the Times reported) when a moderator asked: "Many people watching at home have health insurance through their employer. Who here would abolish their private insurance in favor of a government-run plan?" Harris also raised her hand just as quickly as Sen. Elizabeth Warren had done the night before, who exclaimed "I'm with Bernie." Sen. Bernie Sanders is the purest advocate of a government-only health care system.
The next morning on MSNBC, Harris said "No, I do not" support ending private health insurance, claiming that she heard the pronoun "their" in the debate moderator's question (see the paragraph above) as an ungrammatical reference to each individual candidate. This alibi might be less implausible if she had not recently said, in a detailed response to a Times inquiry about her health insurance policy, that she favored abolishing private insurance.
One cannot unring a bell and Harris cannot erase the fact that she has repeatedly said she wants to take from 217 million Americans -- 80 million more than voted in 2016 -- something most of them like. And she is striking at a core function of organized labor, which is to negotiate employer-provided health care as untaxed compensation.
Equally maladroit was her debate decision to wrap herself in an unpopular policy that ended 20 years ago. Nothing did more to fuel the conservative ascendancy in the 1980s than the 1970s enthusiasm of some judges and politicians for the compulsory busing of (other people's) children away from their neighborhood schools, assigning children to schools on the basis of skin color in order to engineer a desired racial balance. In a 1973 Gallup poll, just 4% of whites and 9% of blacks chose busing from among a variety of means of achieving integration.
Yet Harris chose this issue as a cudgel with which to bludgeon Joe Biden. He, evidently lacking the courage of what once supposedly were his convictions, had neither the gumption nor the mental nimbleness to ask her whether, as president, she would favor reviving the compulsory busing of children away from homes that many parents, black and white, purchased because of their proximity to desirable neighborhood schools. Biden is becoming a conviction contortionist, as with his retreat from 40 years of support for the Hyde Amendment. Suddenly he favors federal funding of abortions -- forcing many taxpayers to be complicit in a practice they abhor.
Many Democrats striving to replace Donald Trump are, while execrating him, paying him the sincerest form of flattery: imitation. He prepared to campaign for president by calling America a "hellhole" and he began his presidency with an inaugural address that his would-be replacements are mimicking with their versions of his trope about "American carnage."
The day the Supreme Court held that "partisan gerrymandering" is not a justiciable issue, Massachusetts Rep. Seth Moulton, yet another presidential candidate, tweeted: "Make no mistake: the partisan gerrymandering SCOTUS just allowed is also racial gerrymandering -- modern-day Jim Crow. Just look at what happened with Stacey Abrams last cycle in Georgia." Abrams lost a gubernatorial race. How can a statewide race be gerrymandered? How can presidential candidates be so silly?

Texto completo: President Donald Trump loves big foreign policy events that draw the nation's attention to — well, President Donald Trump.
He went to London recently for the spectacle of dining with the queen, ignoring the fact that he could have no meaningful discussions with her government, which is in a state of transition. He also savors his meetings with Russian President Vladimir Putin because the outrage they draw merely amps up the attention. But nothing is like his approach to North Korea, where he'll apparently do anything, potentially even undermining America's interests, for the coverage it brings.
As the result of a tweet, the foundation of a lot of his on-the-go policymaking, Trump met with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un on Sunday to announce the reopening of nuclear talks.
To Trump, the get-together was a grand spectacle. Not only has he already become the first U.S. president to meet with a North Korean leader, he did so this time on North Korean soil, also a first. But he has been down this road before with little result. When Trump first met with Kim, in Singapore, he also drew the world's attention. Then after a second meeting in Vietnam, the talks broke off. Now he's at it again.
There's more here than self-promotion, though. In constantly providing a stage for Kim, Trump is giving him legitimacy and global standing that he most assuredly does not deserve.
Making matters worse, Trump is, according to The New York Times, considering recognizing North Korea as a nuclear power and merely asking for it to freeze its arsenal, rather than giving it up. That's a step back from last year, when Kim promised to denuclearize.
Not that it is likely Kim would follow through with either. North Korea has a long history of reneging on pledges to eliminate or freeze its nuclear weapons program. These pledges go back to 1985, when it joined a nuclear nonproliferation treaty, and 1992, when North Korea and South Korea signed a pact to denuclearize the peninsula. In 1994, it negotiated a deal with former President Jimmy Carter to freeze its program.
To give Kim so much upfront now, in hopes that he'll reform his ways, is unwise. Other rogue nations will be encouraged to develop their own nuclear arsenals.

Texto completo: National security adviser John Bolton recently declared that “we’re now opening the aperture, broadening the areas we’re prepared to act” in cyberspace to meet a Russian threat that extends far beyond the ballot box, costing American companies billions of dollars and posing unacceptable risks to our citizens’ safety and the American way of life.
It’s about time.
For years, the Russians have been preparing the digital battlefield, treating our critical infrastructure as if it were their own cyber weapons range.
Overseas they’ve gone even further. In 2015 and 2016, the Kremlin planted malware in Ukraine’s electric grid, disrupting power for hundreds of thousands of residents in the middle of winter. Keenly aware of its capabilities and motivations, Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats has said that “the warning lights are blinking red again” — an allusion to CIA Director George Tenet’s warning to Congress just months before 9/11.
The federal government has a fundamental responsibility to deter Russia and other state actors from holding civilian infrastructure at risk. This is precisely why reports from The New York Times that the United States is embedding “potentially crippling malware” in Russia’s power grid should concern all Americans. Cyber weapons are horrible deterrents — and mimicking targeting civilian infrastructure sets a dangerous precedent for America.
Fear of punishment or retribution is a fundamental tenet of deterrence theory. And it’s true, as the head of U. S. Cyber Command, Army Gen. Paul Nakasone, told a Senate panel last year, the Russians “don’t fear us. ” But to think that Vladimir Putin fears cyber-induced power outages in Moscow is a naive and dangerous miscalculation. To the contrary, an American cyberattack against Russia’s power grid would play right into the Kremlin's strategic playbook.
Commander in cyber: Dear 2020 candidates, cybersecurity chief is your most important hire. Don't screw it up.
First, the costs to the Kremlin would pale in comparison with the benefits. The vast scale of Russia’s power grids, which include a total power generation capacity of 236 gigawatts, would render the military effects of any cyberattack relatively limited while granting the Kremlin its long-awaited case study of American cyber aggression, which it would use to consolidate domestic support for more censorship policies under the guise of cybersecurity.
Furthermore, an American cyberattack against civilian infrastructure — especially a preventative one aimed at deterring Russian hackers — would erode the United States’ international credibility as a champion of a free and open internet governed by universal norms of acceptable behavior. Far more than sporadic blackouts — something that isn’t uncommon anyway in Russia — Putin fears a digital age in which the West writes the rules.
The politics of cybersecurity: Huawei — Politicizing cybersecurity is a losing proposition
And finally, what better way to justify an even more persistent cyber presence in American infrastructure than in the name of self-defense? Fighting cyber with cyber is inherently escalatory, and reports of American cyber operations targeting Russia’s power grid — true or not — will inevitably trigger an equal and opposite response.
Detractors argue that we must reserve the right to hold dual-use infrastructure at risk. And because Russia would depend heavily on its power grid for any attack on the United States, then we should be prepared to disrupt it at any time. But America is the most digitally dense nation in the world, and we risk establishing this norm at our own peril.
We cannot fall into the trap of applying nuclear rules of deterrence to today’s Cold War of digital proportions. Cyber weapons can be a tremendous military asset, especially if used as a proportionate means of neutralizing conventional weapons — as took place last month when the Trump administration approved cyber strikes against the Iranian missile systems that took down a U. S. drone. But they are not conducive to threatening punishment. You can’t parade them through public squares or test them in the desert — indeed the very knowledge of their existence by your adversaries renders them obsolete.
President Donald Trump says it’s “NOT TRUE" that the United States is increasing cyberattacks on Russia’s power grid. I hope he’s right. No nation should target civilian infrastructure via cyberspace. It’s wrong and not in our long-term national interest.

Texto completo: What's Streaming
BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY (2018) Stream on HBO platforms. Few songs are as evocative of an American summer as those of Queen, whether you're stomping along to "We Will Rock You" at a baseball game or belting out "Don't Stop Me Now" at a backyard barbecue. Sure, Freddie Mercury and his bandmates were from England, but Queen's music continues to reverberate across American culture, a phenomenon this Academy Award-winning biopic explores. Rami Malek (wearing a convincing set of prosthetic teeth) plays the Queen frontman in the film, which charts the band's dazzling rise and experimental songwriting, alongside some of Mercury's personal struggles. Although Malek's performance earned him an Oscar for best actor, the New York Times critic A.O. Scott wrote that the film doesn't do enough to capture "the glorious and unlikely artifice of Queen itself, a band whose scrambling of sexual and musical codes remains a remarkable phenomenon in the history of popular culture."
FORREST GUMP (1994) Rent on Amazon, YouTube, Google Play, Vudu and iTunes. Saturday marks 25 years since moviegoers first saw Tom Hanks sprint across the screen as Forrest Gump, a tenderhearted Alabama man who pops up across some of the most important historical moments of the 20th century. Heralded for its seamless use of special effects and archival footage, the film follows Forrest from childhood -- he is raised by his mother (Sally Field) and bullied relentlessly -- until a talent for running makes him a football star. He goes on to fight in Vietnam, helps to expose the Watergate scandal, works on a shrimping boat and becomes an early investor in Apple, all while chasing after his childhood crush, Jenny (Robin Wright). The film won six Academy Awards, including best picture, and remains a classic cultural touchstone about America's complicated history.
What's on TV
ENCHANTED KINGDOM (2014) 9 p.m. on BBC America. Whether he's acting in "The Wire," "Luther" or "The Office," or performing as a D.J. at some of the world's largest music festivals, Idris Elba can command an audience. But in this immersive documentary, the sweeping visuals take center stage, and Elba simply lends his voice as a narrative guide. "Enchanted Kingdom" takes viewers across Africa, examining plant and animal life in some of the continent's harshest and most complex environments. Like "Planet Earth," the film features state-of-the-art camera techniques that capture close encounters with nature, from active volcanoes to the depths of the ocean.
LAVELL CRAWFORD: NEW LOOK SAME FUNNY! 10:35 p.m. on Showtime. You might recognize Lavell Crawford from "Breaking Bad," where he played Saul Goodman's bodyguard, Huell Babineaux, or from his stint on "It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia" as Landslide, a catchphrase-loving comic. But Crawford has been performing stand-up for years, first on "ComicView" on BET in the 1990s, and later as a contestant on "Last Comic Standing" on NBC. In his latest comedy special, he touches on his recent 120-pound weight loss, former President Barack Obama's first term and his view of the police in 2019.

Indeed, Iranian leaders, who signed a deal to freeze their nuclear program in 2015, have to see the way their nation is being treated even as Trump coddles North Korea. Making a nuclear deal without weapons in hand has left Iran vulnerable to renewed sanctions from an administration hellbent on blowing up the agreement. On Monday, Iran's foreign minister announced that his country had exceeded the enrichment caps set down by the accord.
Now, instead of one nuclear headache in North Korea, Trump's diplomacy has resuscitated a second, making each more difficult to address. So far, Trump's diplomatic moves in Iran and North Korea have shown great success in focusing international attention on the White House, but they show little sign of tangible nuclear progress.
With dictator Kim Jong Un, President Donald Trump crosses the Demilitarized Zone into North Korea on Sunday.

By Eduardo Garcia
A heat wave scorched Europe through the weekend and Americans are facing what's predicted to be a very hot couple of months. Last summer ranked as the fourth-hottest on record for the lower 48 states, and this year's temperatures are expected to be above average in most of the country.
So, how do you win the battle against summer heat in a sustainable way?
When it comes to cooling your home, you basically have three options: open your windows, use fans or turn on the air conditioning.
Natural ventilation is the most sustainable choice, hands down, because it doesn't use power. It's an especially good option in coastal areas, where temperatures often drop at night, but it won't work for everyone.
When temperatures stay high and there's little wind, fans are the next-most-sustainable choice because they bring relief while using relatively little electricity.
"Ceiling fans are very effective because they help a room feel colder while using a lot less energy than a central air-conditioner," said Lauren Urbanek, who works on energy policy at the Natural Resources Defense Council.
Box fans are a good option, too. They typically consume less energy than a 100-watt light bulb.
Air-conditioners are the most popular way to cool a house -- nearly 90 percent of homes in the United States have them. But, they are also the most damaging to the environment because they consume a lot of power and discharge hot air that can raise outside temperatures, a phenomenon known as the heat-island effect. That's especially a problem in cities.
"They exacerbate climate change by increasing carbon dioxide emissions from power plants as well as some direct leakage of HFCs," said David Abel, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. He was referring to hydrofluorocarbons, chemical coolants that are also powerful greenhouse gases.
The human and environmental impacts of air-conditioners are mixed. A study in 2016 that focused on the immediate cooling benefits found that air-conditioners had cut premature deaths on hot days in the United States by 75 percent since 1960. On the other hand, Dr. Abel was the lead author of separate study, in 2018, that looked at the air pollution aspect. That research concluded that air-conditioners could cause hundreds of deaths in the Eastern United States by midcentury because of air pollution.
So, air-conditioners may be both a blessing and a curse. To use them in a sustainable way, experts recommend that you set them at a relatively high temperature (78 degrees Fahrenheit, or about 25 Celsius) when you're at home, make sure that your house is properly insulated so that the cold air doesn't escape, and use them in tandem with a fans to increase their cooling efficiency.
If you plan to be away from home for at least a couple of hours, raise the temperature to 85 Fahrenheit, or roughly 29 Celsius, or just shut your air-conditioners off. If you have a programmable system or a thermostat app, you can set it up to resume cooling before you return.
One last thing: Bear in mind that heat largely comes into your home via sunlight, so using curtains or shades when the sun is high will help you win the battle.

Greenland's sand surplus
By Henry Fountain
I've seen a lot ice over the past year. Reporting for a series of articles about the impact of glacial melting took me to the Tuyuksu Glacier in Kazakhstan, the Aletsch in Switzerland and the Nisqually on Mount Rainier in Washington.
But in Greenland last month, I had a close encounter with a byproduct of glacial melting: sand and silt.
I'll take ice any day. It's far less messy.
My Times colleague Ben C. Solomon and I flew to Greenland's small capital, Nuuk, and then took a boat along the southwestern coast to one of the country's many spectacular fjords. This one, the Sermilik, is especially spectacular because of what's pouring into it every year: about 200 million tons of sediment, carried in water from the Greenland ice sheet as it melts in a warming climate.
We were there with a Danish scientist, Mette Bendixen, who was researching the idea that, as its ice sheet continues to melt and eroded sediment keeps pouring into fjords like Sermilik, Greenland might become a major provider of sand to the construction industry around the world.
As part of her studies, Dr. Bendixen wanted to sample the sand in the fjord. So, she and two colleagues launched themselves in a rubber dinghy. There was room for a fourth, so Ben, being the photographer, went along to document their work.
When they came back about half an hour later they were covered, practically head to toe, in what looked like off-white paint. The water was so thick with extremely fine silt (often referred to as glacial flour) that, with all the splashing around, it had been impossible to stay clean.
I went out a little later and managed to avoid being completely covered, but only because, by then, the tide was so low that we quickly ran aground; our small motor became fouled in the muck and we had to paddle back. My hiking boots got covered, however, and even now, a month later, still wear a patina of fine Greenland silt.
I hope you get a chance to read the article, and view Ben's photographs and drone videos, that resulted from our trip. The possibility of Greenland becoming a purveyor of sand to the world raises a lot of interesting issues, not the least of which is the appropriateness of benefiting from climate change.
The day after our foray into the fjord, Ben and I and Dr. Bendixen took a helicopter to a nearby spot so Ben could do more drone work. We all agreed that this was a much more civilized way to investigate Greenland's sediment. As the photograph above shows, we stayed clean and dry.

New York declares a climate emergency
By Somini Sengupta
Emergency. The word has a dire ring to it. It can signify curfews, a crackdown on dissidents, or an infusion of emergency funding to deal with a big problem.
But what does it mean for New York City to have declared a climate emergency in June? The emergency declaration by the City Council comes with no specific legislation, nor funding. It is a symbolic gesture, and its champions see it as a way to send a message about the urgency of taking climate action.
New York City is the largest city in the United States to take this step, though not the only one. Oakland, Calif., and San Francisco declared climate emergencies in 2018. Cities abroad have been moving in this direction, too, some accompanying the gesture with specific targets to ratchet down their emissions. Sydney, the most populous city in Australia, declared a climate emergency in June, in an apparent effort to draw attention to the inaction of its national government.
Britain, Ireland, Canada and France have also all declared climate emergencies. Those moves don't come with any specific legislation, either. Those countries all continue to support fossil fuels.

Texto completo: Elaine May's genius goes beyond her Tony-winning performance in "The Waverly Gallery." The four movies she wrote and directed between 1971 and 1987 are among the strongest Hollywood films of the period.
The first two, "A New Leaf" (1971) and "The Heartbreak Kid" (1972), were popular and critical hits; the last two, "Mikey and Nicky" (1976) and "Ishtar" (1987), were subversive buddy films that first mired and then ended her directorial career.
[Manohla Dargis on "The Marvelous Ms. Elaine May." ]
While "Ishtar" is now acknowledged as perhaps the slyest political satire of the Reagan era, "Mikey and Nicky," revived at Film Forum in a new restoration, has yet to be fully appreciated. An exhilarating feel-bad movie about a pair of desperate wiseguys, it was in production at the same time as Martin Scorsese's "Mean Streets," a film with which it has numerous points of contact.
Both concern low-level hoods and draw on the personal history of their directors. (May grew up in Philadelphia, where "Mikey and Nicky" was shot; she has said that members of her family were connected to the mob.) Both are buddy films that deal with betrayal. And both, in their exuberant acting and freewheeling camera work, show the influence of John Cassavetes. Indeed, "Mikey and Nicky" actually features Cassavetes in a role analogous to Robert De Niro's Johnny Boy in "Mean Streets."
Giving a supremely volatile performance as the hunted Nicky, Cassavetes plays off the deceptively reasonable demeanor of his childhood friend Mikey (Peter Falk, then enjoying national celebrity as the perennially underestimated police detective Columbo). Seemingly improvised by two method actors, "Mikey and Nicky" was totally scripted. To watch Cassavetes and Falk inhabit their roles is to watch two great jazz musicians riffing on a score. (May brilliantly cast Ned Beatty against type as the harassed, methodical hit man who is given the contract on Nicky.)
"Mikey and Nicky" is often very funny, albeit painfully so. Some reviewers -- primed for the broader comedy of May's first two films -- were taken aback by its darkness. (The most farcical scene is set in a graveyard.) The New York Times critic Vincent Canby was particularly harsh, writing that "to watch it is to risk an artificially induced anxiety attack."
The first print ads used the tag line, "Mikey and Nicky -- Don't expect to like them." But if May disliked her characters, she also loved them. It's telling that their names seem to reference her famous partner, Mike Nichols. Released the year "Taxi Driver" capped the Hollywood New Wave and "Rocky" reversed it, "Mikey and Nicky" is as much a virtuoso performance as Scorsese's film and scarcely less disturbing. May deals head-on with her characters' racism and, particularly, their misogyny (always from the perspective of their targets).
A lengthy scene in which Nicky alternately abuses and pimps out his vulnerable girlfriend (Carol Grace, then married to Walter Matthau) is excruciating to watch. May's great theme is the abjectness of women and the idiocy of men. Unique among buddy movies, "Mikey and Nicky" shows bromance from the point of view of its victims.

Ocean County joins lawsuit against opioid makers

Texto completo: TOMS RIVER – Ocean County will join hundreds of cities, towns and county governments across the United States in a federal lawsuit against some of the biggest pharmaceutical companies in the world over America's epidemic of opioid abuse.
Without comment, the Board of Freeholders last month approved a resolution authorizing that a complaint be filed on its behalf in the National Prescription Opiate Litigation multidistrict litigation, MDL 2804. The vote was 4-to-0.
The lawsuit alleges that the manufacturers of prescription opioids grossly misrepresented the risks of long-term use for patients with chronic pain, and that distributors failed to properly monitor suspicious orders of those prescription drugs — all of which contributed to the current crisis.
In 2017, Toms River, Brick and Berkeley moved forward with similar litigation — although it was not immediately clear whether those municipalities were part of the same lawsuit.
Earlier this year, The New York Times reported that "the litigation has ballooned to 1,548 federal court cases, brought on behalf of cities and counties, 77 tribes, hospitals, union benefit funds, infants with neonatal abstinence syndrome and others — in total, millions of people. With a potential payday amounting to tens of billions of dollars, it has become one of the most complicated and gargantuan legal battles in American history."
After the meeting, Freeholder Director Virginia E. Haines explained that the litigation would not cost county taxpayers a dollar — the law firm representing the county would take about 20 percent of whatever fraction Ocean County was entitled to from whatever judgment or settlement may be reached in the case.
In the event of such a judgment or settlement, Haines said she would advocate that Ocean County use its share of the money to fund long-term drug rehabilitation care in the county for residents who cannot afford the cost and whose health insurance does not cover long-term treatment.
"I feel like we need to put a lot more money into rehab facilities," Haines said. "Right now, it's 14 days unless you have insurance. But you really need nine months to a year to really get full treatment — that's what I feel is important."
ABC News reported Friday that the number of public entities which joined the lawsuit had reached about 1,800 last week — they included Bergen County, New York's Albany County, as well as Baton Rouge, Louisiana and major cities such as Atlanta and Phoenix.
"The federal bundle of cases accuses opioid manufacturers, like Purdue Pharma and Johnson & Johnson, of aggressively marketing the drugs while misleading doctors and the public about how addictive they are," ABC News reported on its website. "They also accuse distributors, like McKesson, of moving huge quantities of the painkillers without alerting authorities, and accuse pharmacies like CVS Health and Walgreens of selling large amounts of the pills to patients."
The network reported that a potential settlement in the case could reach about $100 billion in total.
Ocean County has consistently been one of the counties in New Jersey hardest hit by the scourge of opioid addiction and overdose deaths.
In 2016, Ocean County had the second-highest total and rate of overdose deaths of any county in the state. Only Essex County, the most populous in the state, had more deaths and only Atlantic County had a higher rate of fatal overdoses per capita.
In Ocean County, between 2013 and 2016, 576 people died of suspected overdoses, according to state records.

Ocean County Freeholder Director Virginia E. Haines said she would like to see the board use any judgment or settlement in the case to fund up to a year of drug rehab.

Texto completo: The toxicity of the resistance to President Donald Trump has risen in recent days.
A justification for denying public accommodation came from The Washington Post in an op-ed by Stephanie Wilkinson, the owner of a farm-to-table restaurant in Lexington, Virginia. Wilkinson became famous last year when she refused to serve White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders and told Sanders and her family to leave the restaurant.
Wilkinson later told the press she ejected Sanders because the Trump administration is "inhumane and unethical" and because the Red Hen "has certain standards that I feel it has to uphold, such as honesty, and compassion and cooperation."
In her column, Wilkinson discussed the case of The Aviary, a trendy bar in Chicago where a waitress recently spat on Eric Trump, the president’s son. Wilkinson wrote that the incident, along with her own decision to oust Sanders, shows that in the age of Trump, "new rules apply" in public accommodations: Americans who work for the administration or support the president should stay away.
"If you’re directly complicit in spreading hate or perpetuating suffering, maybe you should consider dining at home," Wilkinson wrote.
Wilkinson noted that "no one in the industry condones the physical assault of a patron," but at the same time declared that Americans should understand that a "frustrated person" -- for example, a restaurant employee -- will "lash out at the representatives of an administration that has made its name trashing norms and breaking backs." Americans should accept that such things will happen.
An apology for doxxing came from The New York Times in a piece by Kate Cronin-Furman, an assistant professor of human rights at University College London. The article focused on the treatment of illegal immigrant children in detention centers near the U.S.-Mexico border.
Cronin-Furman discussed the detentions, as well as actions by employees of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, in terms of the Holocaust and genocides in Cambodia and Rwanda, contexts which most Americans would likely dismiss as preposterous.
Her idea is that opponents of the administration should publicly identify and shame low- and mid-level Customs and Border Protection employees who care for migrant children.
Such workers would be dismayed at being publicly shamed because they are "sensitive to social pressure," Cronin-Furman wrote, "which has been shown to have played a huge role in atrocity commission and resistance in the Holocaust, Rwanda and elsewhere. The campaign to stop the abuses at the border should exploit this sensitivity."
"This is not an argument for doxxing," Cronin-Furman continued. "It’s about exposure of their participation in atrocities to audiences whose opinion they care about. The knowledge, for instance, that when you go to church on Sunday, your entire congregation will have seen you on TV ripping a child out of her father’s arms is a serious social cost to bear."
Needless to say, that was a clear argument for doxxing.
Finally, there was Antifa’s recent attack on Andy Ngo, a freelance journalist often associated with the pro-free thought cultural publication Quillette. At a demonstration in Portland, Oregon, Antifa fighters beat up and milkshaked Ngo, apparently because he was there and he was not on their side.
The president is not always at the center of such demonstrations, but Antifa has become an angry and violent fringe force in the Resistance. It has played an ugly role in a number of events, most notably Charlottesville.
Shunning, shaming, doxxing, attacking. As the 2020 campaign reaches full speed, would it surprise anyone to see all of it increase? And all from people who congratulate themselves for standing against hate. Perhaps our politics will cool down at some point in the future. But not now.

Americans should accept that such things will happen.
An apology for doxxing came from The New York Times in a piece by Kate Cronin-Furman, an assistant professor of human rights at University College London. The article focused on the treatment of illegal immigrant children in detention centers near the U.S.-Mexico border.
Cronin-Furman discussed the detentions, as well as actions by employees of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, in terms of the Holocaust and genocides in Cambodia and Rwanda, contexts which most Americans would likely dismiss as preposterous.
Her idea is that opponents of the administration should publicly identify and shame low- and mid-level Customs and Border Protection employees who care for migrant children.
Such workers would be dismayed at being publicly shamed because they are "sensitive to social pressure," Cronin-Furman wrote, "which has been shown to have played a huge role in atrocity commission and resistance in the Holocaust, Rwanda and elsewhere. The campaign to stop the abuses at the border should exploit this sensitivity."
"This is not an argument for doxxing," Cronin-Furman continued. "It’s about exposure of their participation in atrocities to audiences whose opinion they care about. The knowledge, for instance, that when you go to church on Sunday, your entire congregation will have seen you on TV ripping a child out of her father’s arms is a serious social cost to bear."
Needless to say, that was a clear argument for doxxing.
Finally, there was Antifa’s recent attack on Andy Ngo, a freelance journalist often associated with the pro-free thought cultural publication Quillette. At a demonstration in Portland, Oregon, Antifa fighters beat up and milkshaked Ngo, apparently because he was there and he was not on their side.
The president is not always at the center of such demonstrations, but Antifa has become an angry and violent fringe force in the Resistance. It has played an ugly role in a number of events, most notably Charlottesville.
Shunning, shaming, doxxing, attacking. As the 2020 campaign reaches full speed, would it surprise anyone to see all of it increase? And all from people who congratulate themselves for standing against hate. Perhaps our politics will cool down at some point in the future. But not now.

Texto completo: The toxicity of the resistance to President Donald Trump has risen in recent days.
A justification for denying public accommodation came from The Washington Post in an op-ed by Stephanie Wilkinson, the owner of a farm-to-table restaurant in Lexington, Virginia. Wilkinson became famous last year when she refused to serve White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders and told Sanders and her family to leave the restaurant.
Wilkinson later told the press she ejected Sanders because the Trump administration is "inhumane and unethical" and because the Red Hen "has certain standards that I feel it has to uphold, such as honesty, and compassion and cooperation."
In her column, Wilkinson discussed the case of The Aviary, a trendy bar in Chicago where a waitress recently spat on Eric Trump, the president’s son. Wilkinson wrote that the incident, along with her own decision to oust Sanders, shows that in the age of Trump, "new rules apply" in public accommodations: Americans who work for the administration or support the president should stay away.
"If you’re directly complicit in spreading hate or perpetuating suffering, maybe you should consider dining at home," Wilkinson wrote.
Wilkinson noted that "no one in the industry condones the physical assault of a patron," but at the same time declared that Americans should understand that a "frustrated person" -- for example, a restaurant employee -- will "lash out at the representatives of an administration that has made its name trashing norms and breaking backs." Americans should accept that such things will happen.

Texto completo: Un adolescente de 16 años se filmó mientras agredía sexualmente desde atrás a una joven de su misma edad en el transcurso de una fiesta en Nueva Jersey, Estados Unidos. El abuso con penetración se concretó, además, cuando la víctima se encontraba intoxicada, casi inconsciente en un sótano de la casa donde se realizaba la celebración, según las fuentes judiciales.
Luego del aberrante hecho, como si el abuso no fuera suficiente, y según señalaron los investigadores del caso, el joven envió a sus amigos el video junto con la leyenda: “Cuando la primera vez que tuviste relaciones sexuales fue una violación”.
Sin embargo, un juez de la Corte de familia del condado de Monmouth, de Nueva Jersey , llamado James Troiano, solicitó indulgencia para el joven porque “provenía de una buena familia” y que, por las características de su formación, “claramente es un candidato no solo para la universidad, sino para una buena universidad. Sus puntuaciones para ingresar a la universidad fueron muy altas”, aseguró.
La causa y los dichos de Troiano fueron difundidos por el New York Times. El medio estadounidense consigna también que el juez en cuestión, en una audiencia de septiembre de 2017, negó que el acto cometido por el adolescente haya sido una violación, ya que para él solo se considera “violación tradicional” cuando dos o más hombres atacan sexualmente a una mujer a punta de pistola.
Agregó que los fiscales de la causa debieron haber advertido a la víctima de que presentar cargos contra su abusador podría destruir la vida del adolescente. Troiano también cuestionó si el nivel de intoxicación de Mary era tan excesivo como para que no entendiera lo que estaba ocurriendo y no le dio demasiada importancia a los mensajes de texto del acusado porque “los jóvenes dicen muchas estupideces a sus amigos”.
Troinano utilizó todos estos argumentos para negar la moción presentada por los fiscales para que se juzgue al adolescente, como un adulto en un juzgado superior, ya que la ley de Nueva Jersey permite que los menores, a partir de los 15 años, sean juzgados como adultos cuando son acusados de delitos graves.
Pero los argumentos de este juez de 70 años no alcanzaron para evitar que G.M.C. -como fue identificado el imputado- sea tratado como adulto. Troiano fue reprendido severamente por una corte de apelaciones que despejó el camino para que el caso pase de la corte familiar a un tribunal penal de adultos, donde se espera que finalmente se haga justicia.
El caso
El hecho, que llegó esta semana al conocimiento de la opinión púlbica de los Estados Unidos gracias a la decisión de la corte de apelaciones, se remonta a 2017. Siempre según el testimonio de los fiscales del caso, el abuso ocurrió en el contexto de una fiesta en la que había unos 30 adolescentes.
La víctima, identificada como Mary para proteger su identidad, fue llevada, en medio de tropiezos, a un sótano de la casa donde se realizaba la fiesta por un grupo de adolescentes. Allí la sentaron en un sofá, le rociaron la cola con un desodorante de ambientes y la golpearon con tanta fuerza que al otro día tenía marcas en sus nalgas, según rezan los documentos judiciales reproducidos por el New York Times.
Entonces fue cuando se produjo el episodio que grabó G.M.C. donde se lo veía a él penetrando a la menor. Luego de esto, el adolescente salió del sótano y Mary fue encontrada en el piso con vómitos. La llevó hasta su casa la madre de un amigo.
A la mañana siguiente, Mary estaba confundida por su ropa desgarrada y los moretones que tenía en su cuerpo, y le dijo a su mamá que tenía miedo de que “hubieran ocurrido episodios sexuales en la fiesta” sin su consentimiento.

Hot Coffees Of Summer: Cold Brew And Iced

Texto completo: Around this time in July -- when our ever-shortening spring weather takes a sharp right into the damp, hot depths of summer -- coffee drinkers are confronted with a morning-altering decision: switch to iced coffee to combat the oppressive weather, or commit to hot coffee as a kind of bold, unnecessarily masochistic act?
Those who prefer their summer over ice have also grown accustomed to another question: regular or cold brew?
If you're unfamiliar with the difference, think of cold brew as traditional iced coffee's unhurried fraternal twin. Cold brew can't go a day without a long, luxurious bath, while iced coffee can barely swing a quick shower; cold brew has read "The Goldfinch" (and is planning on a reread before the movie is released later this summer), but iced coffee unfortunately never had the time -- what with work and the kids -- though it has seen the trailer on mute.
Once found primarily in the trendiest coffee shops and kitchens of adventurous home baristas, cold brew iced coffee has become a year-round staple. Chains like Starbucks and Dunkin' have added the drink to their permanent menus. Cold brew makers like Rise, High Brew, La Colombe stock cans in major grocery stores. And at-home brewing kit companies have helped popularize D.I.Y. methods.
Rich Nieto, owner of Sweetleaf Coffee Roasters in Greenpoint, said that cold brew has become so popular in recent years that it now outsells iced coffee in all but one of the company's four locations. Still, even the most passionate cold-coffee drinkers have questions about their chosen beverage: Is there really less acid in cold brew? Will drinking it in the afternoon keep me up at night? Should I just make it at home? The good news is, we have answers.
What's the difference between cold brew and iced coffee?
Both drinks are made from the same pair of magical, everyday ingredients -- they're just combined at different temperatures. Water heated to around 200 degrees Fahrenheit (about 93 degrees Celsius) and poured over the grounds will extract all of coffee's most pleasurable essences in a matter of minutes. When cooled and poured over ice, you have a standard iced coffee. If the brewing water is room temperature, it must canoodle with the coffee grounds for much longer, anywhere from 12 to 24 hours, to produce a cup of joe worth sipping, but the resulting beverage contains coffee's most sought after qualities -- flavor and caffeine -- without the bitterness found in one brewed hot.
Does cold brew coffee really have less acid?
My husband recently had an endoscopy that revealed an anomalous patch of stomach tissue on the wall of his esophagus which had been exacerbating his acid reflux. His doctor informed us both that he should try to cut down on spicy food, alcohol and coffee. The first category would be easy, he assured me. The second? Achievable. But the third? Utterly impossible.
Dr. Rabia A. De Latour, a gastroenterologist and assistant professor of medicine at NYU Langone Health, said that it was a common sentiment, and that people who are "exquisitely sensitive" to caffeinated or acidic foods, and those suffering from gastroesophageal reflux disease, or GERD, would benefit from switching to cold brew if they cannot eliminate caffeine from their morning routine. "We recommend they cut out coffee completely," said Dr. De Latour. But for everyone else, the difference between cold brew and iced coffee is negligible.
"I've seen this statistic a lot," she said in reference to a oft-quoted claim that cold brew is 70 percent less acidic than regular iced coffee. "But I don't see any scientific data to support this claim," directing me to a study that shows "comparable" pH values from cold- and hot-brew samples, "ranging from 4.85 to 5.13." For comparison's sake, the stomach's pH hovers somewhere between 1.5 and 3.5.
Does cold-brewed coffee have more caffeine?
Wading through the world of cold brew coffee can be a brutal game of trial and error. Thanks to the wide range of brewing methods, the difference in caffeine content among cold brews is considerably harder to predict than the amount of acid. After brewing for 20 hours, 16 ounces of cold brew at Starbucks contains 200 milligrams of caffeine (12 milligrams per ounce). While that's about 20 percent higher than their iced coffee, which clocks in at 165 milligrams (10 milligrams per ounce), it's considerably lower than the same amount of hot coffee, which has 310 milligrams (20 milligrams per ounce). Coffee from Dunkin' reports similar numbers, with 10.8 milligrams in every ounce of cold brew.
But when you wade into more specialty waters, especially among prepackaged brands, the caffeine content is far from predictable. Canned cold brew brands Rise and High Brew have nearly identical packaging, but grabbing the wrong one could cost you. Rise's original flavor contains 180 milligrams in its 7-ounce can (25 milligrams per ounce), which is anywhere from 30-50 milligrams more caffeine than what's found in High Brew's 8-ounce can. Stumptown, a roaster based in Portland, Ore., sells cold brew in 10.5-ounce bottles that contain a whopping 29.4 milligrams of caffeine per ounce. To a caffeine addict like myself, that number sounds lovely. But to the uninitiated looking to give cold brew a shot, it's a recipe for disaster.
"A lot of people will not tolerate that amount of caffeine," Dr. De Latour said. "Some people's GERD is worsened by coffee because of the caffeine content and its impact on the sphincter muscles," adding that high amounts found in some cold brews can make people feel quite sick, with symptoms like jitters, peristalsis of the bowels, diarrhea or even increased anxiety and stress. She then reminded me that it is, after all, a stimulant.
So that leaves us with cold brew prepared at home, a great option for those looking for more control when it comes to caffeine and acidity. The New York Times's own recipe calls for just 12 hours of brewing. Similar recipes can be found across the internet, and all are easy to adjust in order to find the balance that works for your own stomach and pocketbook. A happy medium can be found in store-bought cold brew concentrates. These brews are meant to be diluted, so if you find it too strong, just add water or milk. Not strong enough? You get the idea.
In January, I approached the counter of Starbucks at an airport after waiting alongside an amorphous line of fellow uncaffeinated travelers for half an hour and, relieved to have made it there without collapsing, ordered a large cold brew iced coffee. I even used "venti" -- the Italian word for 20, as in the number of ounces it contains -- when requesting the large size, even though Italians use the metric system. But my commitment to the chain's conceptually unsound ordering language did not bear fruit, as I was told by the barista that they had just run out of cold brew. All they had left was standard iced coffee, meaning hot brew served over ice. Out of other options and surrounded by more long lines, I grudgingly accepted. It wasn't cold brew, but it was coffee. And that's usually enough.

Texto completo: Kardashian West to relaunch her renamed shapewear line
Bowing to pressure, Kim Kardashian West will change the name of her Kimono Solutionwear line, presumably to something less controversial, the reality star-turned-entrepreneur announced Monday morning.
“When I announced the name of my shapewear line, I did so with the best intentions in mind,” Kardashian West said on social media. “My brands and products are built with inclusivity and diversity at their core and after careful thought and consideration, I will be launching my Solutionwear brand under a new name.”
Kardashian West was quickly accused of cultural appropriation of the name Kimono. In a Thursday statement to the New York Times she defended her understanding and “deep respect” for the meaning of kimono in Japanese culture, and she said she had no plans to change the name.
But on Monday she was singing a different tune.
“I am always listening, learning and growing – I so appreciate the passion and varied perspectives that people bring to me,” she wrote on Instagram.
Cardi B tries to trademark “okurrr” but doesn’t get OK
As far-fetched as it sounded to some, Cardi B really did try to trademark her purported signature phrase “okurrr.”
But the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office said, “oh no.”
According to CNN, the platinum-selling rapper’s attorney Doreen Small filed applications on behalf of Cardi B’s company, Washpoppin, Inc. to trademark the popular catchphrase in March to use it on paper goods, such as cups and posters and clothing.
The patent office refused to register that trademark because it is a “commonplace term, message or expression widely used by a variety of sources that merely conveys an ordinary, familiar, well-recognized concept or sentiment.”
They also noted how the expression is “commonly used in the drag community and by celebrities as an alternate way of saying ‘OK’ or ‘something that is said to affirm when someone is being put in their place.’”

Texto completo: A Fort Collins author may have the chance to see her name on the big screen in the future.
Casey McQuiston's debut novel, "Red, White & Royal Blue" was picked up by Amazon and Berlanti Productions with the end goal of a theatrical film release.
The novel, which she classifies as a new adult romantic comedy, premiered on the New York Times and USA TODAY best-seller lists, as well as a number of lists highlighting the best books for Pride Month.
McQuiston's story focuses on Alex Claremont-Diaz, the first son of the United States, and his rival Prince Henry of Wales. After an incident involving the two, they stage a fake friendship that evolves into romance.
McQuiston optioned her novel in March 2019 — two months before her book went on sale.
Amazon Studios and Berlanti won the rights to the movie over several other competing studios. Berlanti has produced a number of big-name films, including hits "Love, Simon" and "Riverdale."
Wanting to preserve the integrity of the diversity she created in her story, McQuiston said one of the main reasons she selected Amazon and Berlanti was the likeness in mindset for the movie.
"I went with people who I felt could do the vision that we all wanted, which was this big theatrical rom-com, and who had also been very upfront about being very passionate about maintaining the diversity that was in the book and not pulling any punches, making it less gay, white-washing the characters or anything like that," McQuiston said.
The book officially hit the stands mid-May, just weeks before Pride Month. While the timing was not set up specifically to line up with the LGBTQ-celebratory month, McQuiston said it gave readers the chance to read the story and celebrate it throughout the month.
"Pride just means so much to me, I mean, it started as a riot, and I get to go around the country and engage with that in so many different places and also bring my book, which I feel is pretty subversive," McQuiston said. "It does mean so much to me to be able to walk in those footsteps and make my contribution in whatever way that I can."
As someone who identifies as a member of the LGBTQ community, it was important to McQuiston to not only write a story highlighting the community that does not often have a prominent place in mainstream literature, but also weave in bits of LGBTQ history throughout the story. A story created to serve as an escape from reality also serves as a channel to teach readers about a world they may otherwise not be informed about, McQuiston said.
"There were so many things that I put in that I was like, 'This is homework. Y'all are going to read this and I want you to go Google it,'" she said.
The "Red, White and Royal Blue" film is now in the early stages of development, and there is no set timeline for release.
While McQuiston has the option to be as involved or removed from the adaption process as she would like, she said she trusts the team at work to handle her story and make it into the film they envision.
"I just remember when I saw "Love, Simon" in the theaters, I just cried and was like, 'Oh my God, it is just so amazing that this was made, someone green-lit this and gave it a huge budget and it was allowed to be made into a theatrical movie that I can go see,'" McQuiston said. "I want that moment for other people when they go see my movie."

Texto completo: In the early months of the Trump administration, automakers pleaded for -- and appeared set to receive -- some relief from fuel economy standards that they said were too difficult to meet.
But newly released government emails show how a coalition of groups that reject established climate science quickly muscled into the picture, urging the administration to go much further and roll back the rules entirely and characterizing the automakers as their opponents in achieving that goal.
"The automakers are not going to help and may be part of the opposition," wrote Myron Ebell, a senior figure at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a free-market think tank in Washington that disputes that climate change is a problem, in a May 2018 email sent to supporters and an official at the Environmental Protection Agency.
The administration must stick with the rollback, he said in the email, addressed to members of the "Cooler Heads Coalition," a loose-knit group of climate denialists that Mr. Ebell leads.
Automakers have in fact balked at the Trump administration's plan, which in its most extreme scenario proposes to substantially weaken Obama-era standards that would have doubled the fuel economy requirement of new cars by 2025.
Last month, 17 automakers asked Mr. Trump to soften his approach, saying his plan threatened to hurt their profits and produce "untenable" instability given that California and 13 other states, as well as Canada, are expected to stick with the stricter standards -- raising the specter of a national auto market split in two, and a nasty legal battle.

At a congressional panel last week, administration officials gave no sign of easing their stance.
"In my experience, these rules tend to go to the courts regardless," said Heidi King, the deputy administrator for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which is crafting the new standards with the E.P.A. and has taken the lead on the rule-making.
The correspondence, released by the Environmental Protection Agency to the Sierra Club under a public records request, underscores the rising influence of climate denialist groups, which jumped from the fringe to the mainstream in the Trump administration and now hold sway in federal policymaking. Mr. Ebell of the C.E.I. think tank, which challenges "global warming alarmism" and spearheaded the opposition to the Paris Agreement, was chosen to lead Mr. Trump's environmental transition team.
The rules being rolled back were a signature part of the Obama administration's plan to fight climate change. The atmosphere is warming because of greenhouse gas emissions linked to human activity, and climate change is already contributing to extreme weather globally, including stronger storms, more extensive flooding and heat waves.
Assuming the Trump administration's plan is finalized and survives legal challenges, America's cars and trucks would emit as much as an extra 321 million to 931 million metric tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere between now and 2035 as a result of the weaker rules, according to an analysis by the research firm Rhodium Group.
In 2018, Mr. Ebell's group weighed in at a critical juncture in the policymaking process -- one day before auto executives were scheduled to visit the White House to urge Mr. Trump to temper his rollback. "We understand that some in the automaker community have expressed concerns about your current plans to reform the program," Mr. Ebell wrote in a May 10, 2018, letter to Mr. Trump, signed by him along with two other people who assisted with the transition.
"Their main concern is the expected legal battle with California," they wrote. "In fact, what many liberal California politicians really want to do is ban gasoline-powered cars altogether." Their letter went on to say: "You should dismiss this concern. We agree that in an ideal world, California would negotiate with you in good faith, but we all know that is not a reality in this current political climate."
In an interview, Mr. Ebell said his group had succeeded in influencing the rule-making, in particular convincing the Trump administration that forcing automakers to build cleaner cars will lead to more highway accidents and deaths. Auto experts have largely debunked that assertion.
"It's taken a long time but finally the Trump administration has come around. Lighter, smaller cars are less safe than bigger, heavier cars," he said. "The automakers are in a hopeless position," he added. "California is not going to negotiate. A deal that everyone can live with is not going to happen."
The Auto Alliance, which represents some of the country's largest automakers, declined to comment.
The newly released government correspondence also hints at the influence of fossil fuel money in the policymaking process. The New York Times reported in December that Marathon Petroleum, the country's largest refiner, worked with a powerful fuel-industry group, American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers, to run a stealth campaign to roll back car emissions standards.
Mr. Ebell's C.E.I. and other groups have previously received funding from the fuel-manufacturers' organization, though as a nonprofit, the C.E.I. is not required under law to disclose its donors, making it difficult to verify current funding.
Last month, Congress opened an investigation into petroleum companies' involvement in the rollback.
The latest emails also show Trump administration officials in contact with other free market groups like the Heritage Foundation and FreedomWorks, both of which have supported the rollback, as well as the American Legislative Exchange Council, an organization run by mostly Republican state legislators and corporations that work together to write and promote model legislation for the nation's statehouses.
In one email, in June 2018, an ALEC staffer wrote to Michael Abboud, the E.P.A. press secretary, to introduce him to the head of ALEC's task force on energy, environment and agriculture, Grant Kidwell. Mr. Kidwell "would love the connection to the EPA," the staffer wrote.
"Thanks for the introduction!," Mr. Abboud responded. "I would love to get together for coffee and chat?" ALEC, which has said it welcomes debate among its members on climate change and has promoted policies that would lead to more emissions, later adopted a model resolution that "fully supports" a rethinking of the fuel economy standards.
Mr. Kidwell said he and Mr. Abboud did not interact until they ran into each other at a networking event this year. ALEC opposed the Obama-era fuel economy standards, Mr. Kidwell said, because "Americans should be able to buy vehicles they prefer."
Mr. Abboud declined to comment specifically on the email. The "E.P.A. takes time to meet with stakeholders on a variety of regulatory issues," he said in an agency statement. "This is no different."
The denialists' outreach to the administration has taken other forms. American Commitment, another conservative group, helped generate almost 1,600 public comments in support of the rollback, or 13 percent of the 12,000 comments received and posted by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.
Many of the comments shared common language. "I believe the Obama/California scheme was designed with the ultimate goal of banning the internal combustion engine," they said in part. "I fully support President Trump's plan to freeze the fuel economy mandate and stop Sacramento liberals from telling me what kind of car I can drive."
Public comments like these are important because federal rules require their collection, and if a final rule is ever challenged in court (as California has threatened to do) the public comments become part of the body of evidence for a legal case showing public sentiment.
Phil Kerpen, American Commitment's president, said that his staff had worked with the federal agency to make a "large bulk submission" of comments solicited from the group's supporters. "We can't count on the automakers to carry this fight," Mr. Kerpen said.
Some fossil fuel companies have distanced themselves from these efforts.
In a letter sent in June by the oil giant BP to Andrew Wheeler, the E.P.A. administrator, the company sided with automakers (referring to them by the acronym for original-equipment manufacturers) in urging Mr. Wheeler to keep working to improve fuel economy, according to the letter, a copy of which was reviewed by The New York Times.
"We believe -- along with many of the auto OEMs -- that continuous improvement" in engine efficiency is possible, it said. BP declined to comment.

Kamala the cop reiterates promise to take executive action on guns if Congress won't

Texto completo: Kamala Harris reiterated this week that she will take executive action on gun violence if Congress does not send her a bill within the 100 days of her presidency.
“When elected president,” the California senator’s office said Tuesday on social media.
She added, “I will give Congress 100 days to put a gun safety bill on my desk for signature. And if they don’t, I will take executive action. I’ve seen too many autopsy photos and hugged too many mothers of homicide victims to not take action. Enough."Tweet The 2020 Democratic candidate’s tweet comes as a reiteration of a campaign promise she made during a CNN town hall meeting in April.
“[W]hat I will do is put in place a requirement that for anyone who sells more than five guns a year, they are required to do background checks when they sell those guns. I will require that for any gun dealer that breaks the law, the ATF take their license.”
She concluded, “And then — on the third piece … part of what has happened under the current administration is they took fugitives off the list of prohibited people. I'd put them back on the list, meaning that fugitives from justice should not be able to purchase a handgun or any kind of weapon.”
This last bit about fugitives is a lie. First, current law already prohibits fugitives from purchasing firearms. Second, the Trump administration has not removed fugitives from “the list of prohibited people.” The New York Times flunked Harris’ claim earlier, noting that she is referring to the Justice Department’s resolution of a longstanding dispute between the FBI and the ATF:
The F.B.I.’s policy was to deny purchases to people with outstanding warrants if they tried to buy a firearm outside the county or local jurisdiction that issued the warrant, while the A.T.F. did not consider people with warrants “fugitives from justice” if they remained in the same state, the Justice Department’s inspector general explained in a 2016 report that urged the agencies to resolve the issue. The department ultimately agreed with the A.T.F. definition and applied it only to people who had left the state to avoid prosecution or giving testimony, according to a February 2017 memo obtained by The Trace, a news organization that reports on gun violence. David Bowdich, the deputy F.B.I. director, testified to Congress in March 2018 that the decision was made under the Obama administration. Ms. Harris pledges to reverse that definitional change, her spokesman said.
News reports of the settled dispute are what Harris’ team cite as proof of her claim that the Trump administration "removed fugitives" from the list of persons prohibited from purchasing firearms. Lastly, here is the really important part from the Times report:
The background check database declined to 24 fugitives from justice in 2017 from 511,855 in 2016. But Massachusetts alone accounted for about 430,000 names because the state submits outstanding warrant records for both misdemeanors and felonies. Those records instead moved to a different category of prohibited purchasers in the database: banned because of state laws.
In other words, Harris’ claim about fugitives is nonsense, and she definitely knows she's insulting the intelligence of everyone listening when she makes it.
Harris knows full well her executive order pitch is just chum for the Democratic base. Her background is in law. She knows that any attempt to act unilaterally on guns will be met by legal challenges, which may hold up her proposed action indefinitely. She also (probably) knows that executive action is not the route for meaningful, lawful or lasting change. Things enacted by a pen and a phone can be undone just as quickly by a pen and a phone. (Have we learned nothing from former president what's-his-name? You know, the guy before Trump?)
The problem is that Harris’ promise may have the unintended consequence of galvanizing legal gun owners against her. An estimated 43% of Americans own at least one firearm, according to Gallup. How many of that 43% do you think are excited about a candidate promising executive action on guns immediately after taking office?

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump is implementing a lot of changes to the Fourth of July Celebration on the National Mall, which in recent decades has mostly consisted of some fireworks and some music, by adding a presidential address and some military pomp to the mix.
Trump said as part of his planned display of military might, "We're gonna have some tanks stationed outside" during his "Salute to America. " That addition has generated some strong reaction from critics, including from the D. C. City Council, which reacted to the idea by saying, "Tanks, but no tanks. "
Here is what we know about the planned "static display":

Fourth of July TV guide: How to watch fireworks, plus all the best patriotic specials
More: Thunderstorms, searing heat or clear skies? Here's your Fourth of July weather forecast
What kind of tanks will be displayed?
No official announcement has been made about how many tanks there will be or what kind of tanks will be on display.
But news photographers captured images of at least two M1A1 Abrams tanks and two Bradley Fighting Vehicles on flatcars under military guard in a rail yard at the southeastern edge of Washington. The images showed what appears to be a Humvee and an M88 Hercules Recovery Vehicle, but a Defense Department official told USA TODAY those vehicles were sent in support and were not going to be part of the display.
An unnamed official told The Associated Press that the military vehicles to be used in the celebration were stored at the rail yard.
What about the 'brand new Shermans'
Trump told reporters on Monday that "some brand new Sherman tanks" would join the "brand new Abrams tanks. " But the M4 Sherman is no longer being produced having been taken out of service in 1957, according to the Military Times.
It has not been reported that any antique Sherman tanks or other older military equipment will be on display.
How much will it cost?
A preliminary estimate of the cost for transporting and displaying the tanks is about $870,000, according to a congressional aide who was not authorized to speak publicly about the plan.
Will they be part of a parade?
As noted above, the tanks will be on "static display. "
"You’ve got to be pretty careful with the tanks because the roads have a tendency not to like to carry heavy tanks," Trump explained on Monday. "So we have to put them in certain areas. "
In their tweet objecting to the tanks, the D. C. City Council included an image of a March 2018 letter from the Department of Defense that said "no tanks" could be used in a military parade because "consideration must be given to minimize damage to local infrastructure. "
The Washington Post reported that engineers are studying whether the 60-ton tanks could damage the underground rooms that are part of the Lincoln Memorial, even if they remain stationary.
What about damage to bridges?
Some people on social media expressed concern that bridges, particularly the Memorial Bridge leading to Arlington National Cemetery could be damaged by the tanks in response to an article from The New York Times. But the tanks were transported by rail and there do not appear to be any plans for them to travel over any local bridges or to Arlington.
What has the reaction been?
Several pundits and politicians and celebrities objected to the additions of the tanks.
"When I was a child, we saw pictures of military parades in the Soviet Union," tweeted Democratic presidential candidate Marianne Williamson. "We were told we don’t do that, that we’re proud of the fact that we don’t do that because we don’t wish to be a militarized society. Celebrating July 4 with army tanks on the National Mall is repugnant. "
"Trump says there will be military tanks at Fourth of July celebration, tweeted NBC News' Andrea Mitchell. "This is so beyond the spirit of the holiday. "
"Autocrats show off their military weapons to compensate for their inferiority," said Rep. Jackie Speier, D-Calif. "Above all else, this is a waste of $$$. "
Former Rep. Joe Walsh, R-Ill. , said Trump was displaying the tanks to "feed his big fat ego. "
But others supported the idea.
Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga. , told the Times that he liked the idea.
"Other than the fact they have to pay to fix the streets, who cares?" Gingrich said.
Is it unprecedented?
There have been other displays of military equipment on the Mall, including much larger ones than what Trump has planned.
Public Service Recognition Week, which has been commemorated on the first week of May since 1985, often includes military displays, including tanks, on the National Mall. For example in 1991, during the Obama administration, the Army displayed an M1A2 Abrams Main Battle Tank and an M2A3 Bradley Fighting Vehicle as part of the event.
After the U. S. successfully drove Iraqi forces under Saddam Hussein from Kuwait in 1991, President George H. W. Bush celebrated the success of Operation Desert Storm with a massive victory parade that drew 800,000 people to the National Mall. Abrams tanks, along with a wide array of other military vehicles, rolled down Pennsylvania Avenue in the "National Victory Celebration. "

Texto completo: Analysis

WASHINGTON -- With North Korea, President Donald Trump puts on the charm. But with Iran, he cranks up the pressure with economic sanctions and a stronger military presence in the Persian Gulf. He warned its leaders Monday they are "playing with fire."

Nuclear weapons are at the heart of the difficult U.S. relations with both Pyongyang and Tehran. But it's in North Korea where Trump has more leeway -- and perhaps a greater chance of striking a deal.

Kim Jong Un has seemed as willing to meet with Trump as the U.S. president has been to talk and shake hands for the cameras with him. The North Korean leader jumped at the chance to meet Trump at the Demilitarized Zone between the Koreas last weekend.

Trump has made repeated overtures to Iranian leaders, too, but without the same results.

"I think Trump would be equally on a charm offensive with the Iranians if he had a dance partner," said Mark Dubowitz, an Iran nuclear deal skeptic with the Foundation for Defense of Democracies.

Also, Israel, which views Iran as its archenemy, is pressuring Trump to take a hardline approach to Tehran, which has threatened to wipe Israel off the map. There is no big anti-North Korea lobby in the United States pressuring the White House to shun Kim's repressive government.

Trump inherited heavy U.S. sanctions on North Korea and then for months traded fiery rhetoric with Kim, saber rattling that caused jitters across the world.

That has given way to flowery correspondence, meetings between the two and this weekend's historic visit when Trump became the first U.S. president to step into North Korea while in office.

Not that Pyongyang has taken big steps in return. Critics point out that North Korea has not moved to "denuclearize" as Trump has demanded. But the country has refrained from conducting nuclear tests or test-firing long-range missiles.

Trump tweeted late Monday that "our teams will be meeting to work on some solutions to very long term and persistent problems. No rush, but I am sure we will ultimately get there.

Not so smooth with Iran.

Trump campaigned on pulling the United States out of the nuclear agreement that Tehran signed with the U.S. and other world powers in 2015. He complained that the deal, which eased economic sanctions in exchange for Iran curbing its nuclear program, didn't address Iranian ballistic missile capabilities or its support of militant groups.

After failing to adjust what Trump condemned as a fatally flawed deal, the U.S. exited the agreement last year and re-imposed sanctions that had been eased when the deal was finalized under the Obama administration.

The pressure campaign evolved not like the Trump-Kim lovefest, but to what seemed like the brink of war.

With its economy diving, Iran lashed out by shooting down a $100 million, unmanned U.S. surveillance drone and attacking shipping vessels in the Persian Gulf region. Trump said he was "cocked and loaded" to retaliate with limited missile strikes but changed his mind when he learned 150 Iranians could have been killed.

He tweeted last week, "Any attack by Iran on anything American will be met with great and overwhelming force. In some areas, overwhelming will mean obliteration."

On Monday, Iran announced it now has a stockpile of more than 660 pounds (300 kilograms) of low-enriched uranium in violation of the 2015 deal. The U.S. is partly to blame because it failed to renew waivers that allowed Iran to swap its excess to other countries.

But officials say the administration is less concerned about Monday's breach than possible further violations that could reduce the time Iran would need to produce a nuclear weapon. The deal aimed to keep that "breakout time" at one year.

Iran's deputy foreign minister has warned the White House that it's naive to think Iran will wilt under pressure, or that the Iranian people will revolt and throw out its government. He said Iran will not be forced to negotiate by having a knife put to its throat.

As for North Korea, administration officials caution that Trump's charm offensive with Kim does not foreshadow a softening of its insistence that his country must not have nuclear weapons. The New York Times reported Monday that the administration might agree to a nuclear freeze as a first step toward denuclearization.

Under that scenario, which was quickly disputed by U.S. officials, North Korea would not make any new nuclear material, meaning it couldn't expand its arsenal of 20 to 60 nuclear weapons. Under such a deal, North Korea would remain a nuclear power and would still have short and long-term missiles that could threaten U.S. allies like Japan and South Korea as well as the United States.

Stephen Biegun, U.S. special envoy to North Korea, said the report was "far from accurate."

"What is accurate is not new, and what is new is not accurate. No one on our team who knows anything would speak right now anyway," he said in a statement distributed by the State Department.

Trump's hawkish national security adviser John Bolton, who has advocated a tough stance against both North Korea and Iran, also said the administration was not considering a softer approach.

However, Richard Haas, president of the Council on Foreign Relations in New York, said the fact that Bolton was in Mongolia when Trump met Kim at the DMZ suggested there is a "significant split" within the Trump administration.

Democrats have been quick to criticize Trump for his strategy with both Iran and North Korea.

"After three made-for-TV summits, we still don't have a single concrete commitment from North Korea," said former Vice President Joe Biden, who is seeking the Democratic presidential nomination. "Not one missile or nuclear weapon has been destroyed, not one inspector is on the ground. ... North Korea has continued to churn out fissile material and is no longer an isolated pariah on the world stage."

On Iran, Biden said Trump walked away from a deal that was temporarily keeping it from developing a first nuclear bomb and applied economic pressure that has led Tehran to restart its nuclear program and become more, not less aggressive.

"Trump's Iran policy has alienated us from our allies and taken us to the brink of another war in the Middle East," he said.

In its first year, the administration tried to work with Europeans allies to mend what Trump identified as flaws in the nuclear deal, such as its silence on ballistic missiles and Iran's support for destabilizing proxies around the Middle East. The effort to create a separate agreement without Iran's participation ultimately failed.

Michael McFaul, a U.S. ambassador to Russia under President Barack Obama, says that while Trump has said he's open to talks with Iran, he sees little evidence that's the case. He wonders whether complete and verifiable denuclearization is not the goal in Iran or North Korea.

"In Iran, it may be that the real objective is regime change, including the option of U.S. military action," he says.

"In North Korea, it could be that the goal is not complete denuclearization, but an outcome that allows Kim to maintain part of his nuclear arsenal while perhaps dismantling his intercontinental ballistic missile program to reduce the direct threat to U.S. national security.

"This lesser goal could help to explain why Trump is so oddly accommodating toward North Korea."

Texto completo: Peter Orner's new collection of short fiction, "Maggie Brown & Others," is like a window into a writer's mind. It comprises more than 40 works, from one-page vignettes to longer stories, organized in themed sections, plus a novella.
Rather than discard the short shorts - many of which are forgettable - for a stronger, more compact volume, Orner leaves it all on the pages, almost mimicking the memories one accumulates over a lifetime: one story about this person, a fragment of that event, a scrap of the time such-and-such occurred.
His debut, "Esther Stories" (2001), as well as his 2013 collection "Last Car Over the Sagamore Bridge," both featured the same format (although without a novella), and "Maggie Brown" even revisits many characters and locations of the prior volumes, notably Walt and Sarah Kaplan of Fall River, Massachusetts. All this consistency is great news for Orner's fans, but perhaps represents a bit of an Achilles' heel for the author, as there is little that feels new in this new book.
Orner is a skilled writer who can be incredibly moving. Several stories stand out, including those previously published by the New Yorker ("My Dead"), New York Times ("Allston"), and Paris Review ("Ineffectual Tribute to Len"). All three are about young men (possibly the same young man) growing up in the Midwest.
His recurring characters, especially Walt Kaplan in the novella, faintly evoke those of giants like Roth and Bellow, with the result being a sense that Orner's writing, like Walt, is living in the past.
Walt and his friend whisper about the waitress' backside. They refer to "the Chinaman." Walt and Sarah only push their separate beds together for "carnal relations" - which Walt excels at "like a hero." With so much exciting contemporary fiction, do we really want to revisit Fall River?

Federal wealth taxes and the incremental erosion of liberty

Texto completo: A federal wealth tax is seriously being considered in the current presidential campaign.
The concept has been embraced by Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, former Congressman Beto O’Rourke, and Mayor Pete Buttigieg. Further adding to interest in the wealth tax is support announced last week by California philanthropist Eli Broad, and nineteen other American billionaires upon whom the tax would fall. Broad’s letter was published in the New York Times under the remarkable title, “I’m in the 1%. Please, Raise My Taxes.”
Sen. Warren estimates the tax will raise $2.75 trillion dollars in ten years. Economists have split over whether that is a realistic number, especially given the ability of the ultra-wealthy to devise evasion schemes for virtually any tax government ever proposes. However, at 50% compliance, the tax would still increase the annual revenue available for the federal government by almost 5%.
Whether this concept is wise should be analyzed under economic, constitutional, and liberty considerations.
The economics of this proposal depends on two factors. The first is the uses to which this money is put. Not surprisingly, the Democratic presidential candidates all propose spending the wealth tax on new programs; none proposes to pay back federal borrowing to reduce the debt. The economic benefit of each expenditure provides fair ground for debate. Preschool education for children whose parents cannot otherwise afford it may well generate long-term economic benefits. Giving the money to politically favored constituencies is less likely to do so.
The second factor is the dampening effect on economic activity from such a tax. Here, the wealth tax has an advantage over an income tax. People do less of that which is taxed. So, we can expect wealthy people to consume more and save less, given that every year the amount they have saved will be taxed anew. Sen. Warren estimates that only 75,000 families will be subject to her wealth tax. If they save less and consume more, it might actually stimulate economic growth. By contrast, an increase in income tax would, at the margin, depress the process of creating income—a much more damaging result.
A federal wealth tax might run into Constitutional trouble under Article I, section 9, which forbids the federal government from imposing a “direct” tax, except in proportion to each state’s population. A wealth tax is not proportional to population. In 1895, the Supreme Court held the federal income tax unconstitutional as a direct tax, not proportional to population. Proponents then passed the 16th Amendment to the Constitution in 1913, allowing federal taxes on income. However, in 1921, the court ruled the federal tax on inheritance was not a direct tax. One of these two opinions must be wrong.
My prediction is that the court will define a direct tax as one that is imposed without a person choosing to do anything. A sales tax, for instance, is indirect: it is triggered by the act of buying something; but a wealth tax is direct, it requires no action at all.
The most important concern is from the point of view of liberty. Sen. Warren was asked after the debate how the federal government could assess the value of individuals’ shares in private companies, fine art, or jewels. She lit up almost with delight to say that it would be easy to keep tabs on only 75,000 families. She appeared to relish the concept of government agents who would, year in and year out, make an inventory of all that some Americans possess. She evinced no concern at all for this invasion of privacy, the unfairness of taxing the same income multiple times (once when earned, then every year it was kept), or the evisceration of a notion that once we acquire property, we can depend on keeping it.
There may be little sympathy for the 75,000 wealthiest families in America; but that is how liberty is lost — incrementally.

History says 2020 race might get blurry

Texto completo: For two long nights, America watched a stage crowded with 10 lecterns and maybe four recognizable faces.
Some, but not all, of the 24 Democrats who would be president took to that stage and made their case. They stumped and squabbled and occasionally said something so interesting or odd that America leaned in to give that candidate a closer look.
What did we learn?
For starters, we learned that a dozen candidates could drop out of the race tomorrow -- say, everyone NBC pointedly assigned to the three most distant podiums on either side of the stage -- and we'd still have too many people running for president.
Twenty Democrats had something to say Wednesday and Thursday night. They had ideas about how to make health care and college more affordable and how to make immigration policy more humane. They wanted to talk about climate change and tax policy and how to save American farmers teetering on the brink of ruin. They had things to say about race relations and gun violence and election security.
Few of them got more than 5 or 10 minutes to say it.
For candidates such as Kamala Harris or Juli¡n Castro, it was time enough.
"Hey guys, you know what? America does not want to witness a food fight," Harris said, silencing the cross-talk of an auditorium full of big egos and launching her standout performance on a Thursday night stage crowded with bigger names with bigger leads in the polls. "They want to know how we're going to put food on their table."
Castro broke from the back of the pack Wednesday to bring raw grief and urgency to the immigration debate as he blamed the Trump administration's restrictive asylum policies for the deaths of Salvadoran migrant "scar Alberto Mart-nez Ram-rez, who drowned with his 23-month-old daughter in the Rio Grande trying to reach our shore.
"They have been playing games with people who are coming and trying to seek asylum at our ports of entry," Castro said. ""scar and Valeria went to a port of entry, and they were denied the ability to make an asylum claim, so they got frustrated and they tried to cross the river, and they died because of that."
Front-runner Joe Biden spoke for 13 minutes and 19 seconds Thursday, the New York Times reported. By the time Harris finished batting him around like a tetherball -- a tetherball on the wrong side of history and the school desegregation debate -- he probably wished he could have swapped with tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang, who got less than 3 minutes.
Then again, the last time Biden ran for president, he spent most of his 2007 campaign kickoff trying to explain why he'd just described Barack Obama as "articulate and bright and clean." A year later, they were on the same ticket, on their way to the White House.
Everything matters and nothing matters this early in the campaign.
At this point in 2016, Donald Trump had just glided down an escalator to launch his presidential campaign, and to land dead last in one late June poll. A month later, he's the GOP front-runner.
Four years before that, Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann was barnstorming through Iowa on her way to victory in the straw poll.
Hillary Clinton shellacked Obama in the polls all the way through 2007.
So if you heard someone or something you liked on stage last week and you want to hear more, just wait.
We'll get two more nights of Democratic debates next month, and the month after that, and on and on until we either run out of candidates or run out the year.
The Iowa caucuses are seven months away. Minnesota and the rest of the Super Tuesday states won't vote for another eight months.
We're a year from the party nominating conventions and 16 months from Election Day 2020.
That might be just enough time for Democrats to choose someone who is not -- to quote Minnesota contender Amy Klobuchar -- "all foam and no beer."

Texto completo: The Clippers will have to woo Kawhi Leonard without offering him an opportunity to play with Kevin Durant, according to reports Sunday afternoon by a variety of NBA insiders indicating he will be signing with the Brooklyn Nets, where he will team up with fellow free agent Kyrie Irving.
Durant, who suffered a torn Achilles tendon during the NBA Finals, reportedly will sign with the Nets on a four-year $164 million deal while Irving will sign a four-year $141 million max deal, per multiple reports. Durant is scheduled to make an announcement via the Instagram of his sports-owned business channel The Boardroom.
NBA free agency is scheduled to open officially today at 3 p.m., PT.
A pair of players with Clippers connections – veteran center DeAndre Jordan, a pillar of the Lob City era, and guard Garrett Temple, who joined the team last season after the trade deadline – also reportedly are set to sign with the Nets.
The Clippers will wait to learn the truth of reports that Leonard was going to leave the Toronto Raptors only if he could be assured he’d be playing with a “top-flight free agent.”
The Clippers reportedly had their sights on Durant, for months. In Brian Windhorst’s report for ESPN in December, he broached the possibility of the duo teaming up and noted that the Clippers would be able to create two max slots to allow it to happen this summer.
Of course, even with the cap space, Windhorst equated pulling off the feat to “pulling the sword from the stone.”
Durant, a 30-year-old forward who won two titles with Golden State, went on the record earlier this month to make it clear that he would make his decision independent of any of his peers intentions: “I can’t be recruited.”
Not that the New York Knicks, Warriors and Clippers wouldn’t join the Nets in making their best cases.
Reports were that the Warriors were set to offer Kevin Durant a five-year, $221 max contract, $57 million more than any of his other suitors, and Stephen Curry was going to help deliver the pitch.
The Clippers’ pitch also will include people that Durant is known to admire, including Jerry West, whose 2016 call to Durant is said to have helped persuade him to join the Warriors, and owner Steve Ballmer, who appeared on the second episode of “The Boardroom with Kevin Durant,” an ESPN series that debuted in February.
Furthermore, Durant’s familiarity with the Clippers organization extends to general manager Michael Winger and assistant coach Rex Kalamian, whose tenures in Oklahoma City overlapped with Durant’s.
And Durant, remember, raved about several members of the Clippers this past season, including their then-rookie backcourt of Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Landry Shamet.
But, according to reports, the Nets’ offer and the chance for Durant to play alongside his friend Irving proved most enticing.
On Saturday, the New York Times reported Leonard – who also is a target of the Lakers, who cleared cap space this week in order to offer him a chance to play beside LeBron James and Anthony Davis – wants to play with a “top-flight free agent” if he chooses to leave the Toronto Raptors.
The Clippers also are rumored to be among the teams vying for the 76ers’ Jimmy Butler — who also has been linked to the Houston Rockets and reportedly is most interested in playing for the Miami Heat. The 29-year-old wing was mentioned in various reports as another potential option. An excellent two-way player with a drive to win, on paper he seems like a fit for both Leonard and the Clippers.

Texto completo: The Clippers will have to woo Kawhi Leonard without offering him an opportunity to play with Kevin Durant, according to reports Sunday afternoon by a variety of NBA insiders indicating he will be signing with the Brooklyn Nets, where he will team up with fellow free agent Kyrie Irving.
Durant, who suffered a torn Achilles tendon during the NBA Finals, reportedly will sign with the Nets on a four-year $164 million deal while Irving will sign a four-year $141 million max deal, per multiple reports. Durant is scheduled to make an announcement via the Instagram of his sports-owned business channel The Boardroom.
NBA free agency is scheduled to open officially today at 3 p.m., PT.
A pair of players with Clippers connections – veteran center DeAndre Jordan, a pillar of the Lob City era, and guard Garrett Temple, who joined the team last season after the trade deadline – also reportedly are set to sign with the Nets.
The Clippers will wait to learn the truth of reports that Leonard was going to leave the Toronto Raptors only if he could be assured he’d be playing with a “top-flight free agent.”
The Clippers reportedly had their sights on Durant, for months. In Brian Windhorst’s report for ESPN in December, he broached the possibility of the duo teaming up and noted that the Clippers would be able to create two max slots to allow it to happen this summer.
Of course, even with the cap space, Windhorst equated pulling off the feat to “pulling the sword from the stone.”
Durant, a 30-year-old forward who won two titles with Golden State, went on the record earlier this month to make it clear that he would make his decision independent of any of his peers intentions: “I can’t be recruited.”
Not that the New York Knicks, Warriors and Clippers wouldn’t join the Nets in making their best cases.
Reports were that the Warriors were set to offer Kevin Durant a five-year, $221 max contract, $57 million more than any of his other suitors, and Stephen Curry was going to help deliver the pitch.

Creator of Biden parody site accused of spreading 'disinformation'

Texto completo: A consultant who creates digital content for President Trump's reelection campaign is facing criticism for also making a mock campaign website for Democratic front-runner Joe Biden.
Patrick Mauldin launched JoeBiden.info, as well as similar sites for other Democratic candidates, as a way to share information about the presidential hopefuls which would likely not be shared in their official campaign material. He said his intent was to help Democrats "face facts" about Biden and others.
Mauldin states plainly at the bottom of the webpage, "This site is political commentary and parody of Joe Biden's Presidential campaign website. This is not Joe Biden's actual website. It is intended for entertainment and political commentary only and is therefore protected under fair use. It is not paid for by any candidate, committee, organization, or PAC. It is a project BY AN American citizen FOR American citizens. Self-Funded." Despite the disclaimer, some have criticized him, including the New York Times, which asserts that he is spreading disinformation like that "spread by Russian trolls in 2016."
In addition to many awkward photos of the former vice president with women and children, the website features several quotes and voting records of Biden, sourced from his decades in political office. Mauldin's site made headlines in May when it outpaced Biden's official campaign website for traffic, with an average of 390,000 unique visitors over a three-month period. Biden's official site averaged only 310,000.
With his brother, Mauldin also runs Vici Media Group, an Austin-based consulting firm for Republicans. The landing page of their company's website says, "We Kick" in front of a donkey, the symbol of the Democratic Party.
The headline of Mauldin's Biden parody site sets the tone with, "Uncle Joe is back and ready to take a hands-on approach to America’s problems! Joe Biden has a good feel for the American people and knows exactly what they really want deep down. He’s happy to open up and reveal himself to voters and will give a pounding to anybody who gets in his way!"

Trump criticized Kamala Harris at the G20, breaking a silence. Is it a new strategy?

Resumen: Donald Trump has avoided trash-talking California Sen. Kamala Harris, but that may change after her performance in the Democratic presidential debate.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump seldom passes up an opportunity to trash-talk Democratic presidential hopefuls Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders, or, as he calls them, "Sleepy Joe” and “Crazy Bernie. ”
But Kamala Harris has so far been spared the same level of presidential scorn, vitriol and name-calling.
That will probably change following Harris’ solid performance in Thursday night’s Democratic presidential debate. During a press conference in Japan on Saturday, the president took a tentative step toward engaging with Harris, suggesting she got too much credit for her performance during the debate.
In just two hours, Harris not only managed to cast doubt on Biden’s front-runner status, but the California senator also dominated much of the debate and established herself as a formidable contender for the party’s nomination for the presidency.
In doing so, she likely made herself a prime target for a presidential attack.
“Trump has not gone after Harris so far because she has not been polling as well as Biden, Sanders and (Elizabeth) Warren,” said Lauren Wright, who teaches courses on the American presidency and women and politics at Princeton University.
While he has shown no qualms about going on the attack against some women – Hillary Clinton, Nancy Pelosi and Warren are all favorite targets – Harris hasn't been on his list.
Criticizing a woman could be dangerous ground for Trump, given his past treatment of women and his past comments that are widely regarded as sexist, Wright said.
“I would not be surprised if he started criticizing (Harris) now that she is inching forward,” she said.
Steering clear of Harris
At this stage in the 2020 campaign, Trump has steered a wide path around Harris even as he has relentlessly attacked candidates polling better than her – and some who are not polling as well.
He dubbed South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg “Alfred E. Neuman” after the Mad magazine character.
The president has tweeted about Biden nearly two dozen times since last year’s midterm election but has not posted anything about Harris from his main Twitter account.
When the White House slammed Harris on immigration last summer, aides did so from the official @WhiteHouse account rather than the @realDonaldTrump account the president uses most often.
Trump regularly calls out Sanders at his rallies and has gone after former congressman Beto O’Rourke for losing his Texas Senate election last year. But a review of his rally transcripts shows the president has not mentioned Harris once as he speaks to supporters across the country.
In an April interview, Trump told Fox News that Harris has “a little bit of a nasty wit,” but that’s about as far as he’s been willing to go in his criticism. Months earlier, he told the New York Times that Harris might be the “the toughest” candidate in the Democratic field.
“I just think she seemed to have a little better opening act than others,” Trump said.
Following Thursday’s debate, Trump went after Biden and Sanders, tweeting from Japan, where he is attending the G-20 summit, that neither had a good day and that “one is exhausted, the other is nuts. ” He never mentioned Harris.
Responding to a question about the debate while in Japan, Trump said Harris was being given "too much credit" for her debate performance against Joe Biden, explaining that he thought the former vice president was attacked more than he should have been.
Trump went on to say that Harris' response was "straight out of the can, what she said. That thing was right out of a box," and added that Biden "didn't respond great. "
Trump’s campaign, which posted several tweets critical of Harris on Thursday night, did not respond to questions about the president’s strategy on Harris.
Harris was leading Trump 49% to 41% in a Quinnipiac University nationwide poll this month before the debate. Biden and Sanders had only slightly smaller leads over the president.
Commanding the debate stage
In Thursday’s debate in Miami, Harris commanded the stage for much of the night as she and nine other Democratic hopefuls sparred and talked policy for two hours. The event was the second round of a two-part debate.
In one of the debate’s defining moments, Harris ripped into Biden, calling out the former vice president for his nostalgic remarks about working with segregationist senators and for his opposition to school busing in the 1970s.

Earlier, when the debate devolved into a shouting match, Harris tried to restore order, telling her fellow candidates: “America does not want to witness a food fight. They want to know how we're going to put food on their table. ”
Harris “took charge and looked like the leader in several key instances,” Wright said. “Launching an attack on a competitor in the midst of the debate and pulling it off is very difficult. It takes practice, timing, and a degree of confidence and comfort in a high-pressure situation. ”
But there also may be a downside.

Harris’ debate performance not only put the spotlight on her but also will focus greater attention on some of the positions that she and other Democrats have taken. While some of those positions on issues such as health care, immigration and abortion appeal to the Democrats’ left flank, they could be a tougher sell in a general election and could cause problems for Harris in a race against Trump.
Harris’ vulnerabilities “are the same as the rest of the top contenders,” said Scott Jennings, a Republican strategist and political commentator.
Harris and the other Democratic presidential hopefuls have “all endorsed taxpayer-funded health care for illegal immigrants, policies that are effectively open borders, taxpayer-funded abortions (even for transgendered females) and tax increases on working Americans to pay for all of it,” said Jennings, who worked in the White House under President George W. Bush.

Fodder for a Trump attack line
For Trump, Jennings said, the attack line will be simple: “Harris would raise your taxes to pay for illegal immigrants to have a better health care plan than you. ”
Whether the Democratic nominee is Harris or someone else, Trump will probably end up treating them “virtually the same as they’ve all signed on to the same basic agenda,” Jennings said.
“I’m stunned at how unaware these Democrats are in understanding how these positions will play in the Pennsylvania, Michigan, or Wisconsin suburbs,” he said. “There’s no walking any of this back now. It’s all out there for the world to see. ”

Texto completo: On April 5, USA TODAY reporter Paul Davidson wrote a piece on the big gains folks reaped buying starter homes as housing markets rebounded from the long 2006-11 housing crash.
Buying in low-cost suburbs, folks could upgrade to larger "forever" homes in just several years. They used starter-home gains to fund bigger down payments. It was a great financial win for young families. It also supports one of the most controversial things I've ever said here: Owning a home is wonderful, but don't bank on real estate as your chief retirement investment.
People looking to real estate today for retirement riches often point to those big post-crisis gains. Trouble is, you can't buy past performance. And the recent past probably isn't a blueprint for the next 10, 20, 30 years or more.
After the housing bubble popped in 2006, prices tanked for five years, bottoming in 2011. Returns since that time are a near-perfect V-shaped recovery — a point that a chart in Paul Davidson's story shows. As a general but not perfect rule, what gets hammered the hardest on the way down rebounds the strongest. Starter homes were punished most in the crash. So they rallied most in the recovery. But this bounce effect has largely matured.
Like all assets, home prices move on supply and demand. The key to both? Location, location, location. The housing market isn't uniform nationally or even within the same city. Anyone looking to hop onto San Francisco's property ladder or other coastal hot spot knows this. Coloradoans may have scored entry-level homes for roughly $200,000 in 2012, but no such luck for would-be first-time homebuyers in Californian metropolises or New York. The cost of Silicon Valley starter homes can come close to $2 million, depending on style and neighborhood. That's your first clue real estate is a geographically fragmented game.
Even where it's cheaper to buy, eye-popping gains aren't guaranteed. If you buy where new construction is limited and job opportunities are humming, keeping supply low relative to demand, you may do very well. But what if you buy where construction eventually outpaces job creation and population growth? What if a city is focused on one or two industries, and what if they fall from favor and fizzle? What happens to San Jose prices if tech crashes and burns? What of Houston when the energy industry hits the skids? What if your neighborhood school system takes a perceived quality dive relative to nearby communities?
Counting on real estate for your retirement nest egg is a very long-term bet on weak real estate development plus good economic fortune – both in one location. You're betting your town will attract people with good jobs and maintain schools long-term –and that politicians will limit new development. You're betting some hot new suburb won't steal your hamlet's thunder.
Instead, if you see a home purchase as merely guaranteeing a roof over your head and protecting against rising rents, things look different. You don't shun a neighborhood because more housing construction might constrain property values. If all the jobs move, you can too, even if that means having to rent for a few years. You needn't stress about timing your purchase just right or not picking the highest-flying neighborhood. You can simply go where you and your family feel most at home –whether it's a green suburban neighborhood or a hip urban townhouse.
Homes are great. Banking on them for retirement income isn't.

Texto completo: Believe the hype. "Fleishman Is in Trouble" is even better than we were promised. Taffy Brodesser-Akner, a New York Times Magazine writer, brings to her first novel the currency of a hot dating app and the wisdom of a Greek tragedy. The result is a feminist jeremiad nested inside a brilliant comic novel - a book that makes you laugh so hard you don't notice till later that your eyebrows have been singed off.
As the story opens, life sounds like an erotic carnival for Toby Fleishman. A New York doctor newly separated from his wife, Toby has arrived at the age of 41 to discover a city suddenly flush with women who want him. Now. "His phone was aglow from sunup to sundown," the narrator writes, with texts that contained "underboob and sideboob and just straight up boob and all the parts of a woman he never dared dream he would encounter."
Brodesser-Akner demonstrates an anthropologist's thoroughness in her study of contemporary adult dating and its catalog of sexual practices, but her prose, ringing with manic energy, is obscenely funny.
Poor Toby is thrust into a state of constant arousal, punctuated by moments of deep confusion about his impending divorce from a successful talent agent. What should he reveal to his colleagues about the dissolution of his marriage? And most baffling, what should he tell his son and daughter, who find themselves suspended between two homes?
Perhaps every engaged couple should read this book before they tie the knot. With merciless precision, Brodesser-Akner traces the arcing trajectory of doomed affections: the glorious takeoff, the deluded calm, the shrieking descent.
Much of the first section of the novel follows Toby's frantic efforts to sleep with as many women as he can, while locking down a big promotion at the hospital and taking care of his children. You see, Fleishman is in trouble. His estranged wife, Rachel, has stopped returning his calls. She's no longer picking up the kids. Toby doesn't even know where she is. It's just her latest infuriatingly selfish stunt - or at least Toby would have us believe as he recalls one example after another of her lack of affection, her disregard for how much he does to keep their family humming.
So far, so John Updike. But there's something wonderfully contrary going on here.
This entire story is told by Toby's old friend, Libby Epstein. So expansive and intimate is her knowledge of Toby's experience that it's easy to imagine we're hearing the voice of an omniscient narrator. It turns out that, like Brodesser-Akner herself, Libby used to be a writer for a men's magazine, and she's most comfortable expressing herself in expansive profiles of other people. The further we read into this tale of Toby's marital discord, the more we realize that Libby is trying to work out something about her own existential plight.
That becomes more explicit in the novel's final section. Libby's sympathies - and ours - are suddenly unmoored in the conflicting currents of love and resentment. Perhaps Toby is not the long-suffering saint he imagines himself to be. When Libby finally comes out from the margins of this story, she uses Rachel to offer a sustained reflection on the impossible pressures that talented women endure.
I haven't felt this much energy sparking off a novel since Claire Messud's "The Woman Upstairs." Here, in one gut-punching paragraph after another, is the articulate fury of someone who once dared to imagine that her ambition could be expressed and appreciated. Only too late does Rachel realize that "her success made her poison." She's ripped apart by the demands of full-time motherhood and the new requirements of full-time work.
But Brodesser-Akner swings the sword full circle, slicing through the demeaning rules of the patriarchy just as effectively as she slays the fatuous optimism of that "girl-power" propaganda fed to modern girls.
Conveying the full tragedy of that predicament in a story that's often blisteringly funny is the real triumph of this book. Few novels express so clearly that we're all in trouble.

Texto completo: Avery Sophia Daley McNeil and Daniel Zachary Kay were married June 29 at Willow Ridge Farm in Putnam Valley, N.Y. David E. McCraw, the deputy general counsel at The New York Times who became a Universal Life minister for the occasion, officiated.
The couple are each criminal defense lawyers at the Bronx Defenders in the South Bronx, a nonprofit organization that provides free legal representation. She is also the specialist in alternatives to incarceration, and he also supervises and trains new lawyers.
Ms. McNeil, 33, graduated from Columbia and received a law degree from N.Y.U.
She is a daughter of Suzanne Daley of Manhattan and Donald G. McNeil Jr. of Brooklyn. The bride's parents both work at The Times. Her father is a science reporter covering global health. Her mother is the associate managing editor for international print, and from 2005 to 2010 was the national editor.
Mr. Kay, 30, graduated magna cum laude from Amherst College and received a law degree from Vanderbilt.
He is the son of Dr. Marilyn C. Kay and Dr. Jonathan Kay, both of Madison, Wis. The groom's parents both work at the University of Wisconsin Madison School of Medicine and Public Health. His mother, a neuro-ophthalmologist, is an associate professor of ophthalmology. His father, a cardiac anesthesiologist, is an associate professor of anesthesiology.
The couple collided several times rushing about their office, and in spring 2015 stood still long enough and formally met in criminal court just after Mr. Kay defended a client before a judge, and Ms. McNeil was waiting for her case to be called. About two weeks later he stopped by her cubicle to ask her out, and they had their first date at a restaurant in Williamsburg, Brooklyn.

Her Nation Is Divided, But Her Team Isn't

Texto completo: PARIS -- PARIS -- When she scored the first of her two goals in Friday's 2-1 victory over France in the quarterfinals of the Women's World Cup, on a cunning and elusive free kick, Megan Rapinoe ran to the corner of the field and held her arms aloft.
The gesture was not a mere celebration. It seemed to say, this is all of me. Take me for the bold, complex person that I am: big personality; social activist; champion of equal pay; national anthem protester; presidential critic; lavender-haired soccer star of ruthless and creative purpose.
Out, and out front, Rapinoe has perhaps become the representative athlete of our times -- wearing the jersey of a nation that is divided, playing for a team that is not, fearless and unapologetic about demanding excellence from herself and fair and equitable treatment by others.
Many sports teams tend to retreat into a bubble when it comes to difficult topics and moments, to offer bland and insipid "one game at a time" pablum. Not Rapinoe and this United States women's team. It sued U.S. Soccer for gender discrimination before the tournament. And once it arrived in France, Rapinoe (on camera) and her teammate Ali Krieger (on Twitter) jousted with President Trump. Krieger already had made news here, by suggesting that the Americans' depth left the United States not only with the best team in the World Cup, but also with the second-best.
Some may consider their remarks audacious or disrespectful, but a journalist always wants to know what an athlete is truly thinking. Rapinoe and her teammates, then, are refreshingly, wonderfully candid. And Coach Jill Ellis seems uninterested in trying to tamp down any verbal brush fires or worried they will escalate into distracting conflagration. She appears to feel that self-assurance, on the field and off, is a necessary vaccine against wallflower reticence, which could hurt her team -- any team -- in the most demanding moments.
"You can have all the tactics in the world, but that essence of self-belief, that's critical," Ellis said after the United States defeated Spain on Monday, with Rapinoe again delivering both American goals.
Referring to Rapinoe, who will turn 34 on Friday, by her nickname, Ellis added, "Pinoe and other players have lived in these moments. It's fair to say they actually want those moments. When the game is on the line, you want to feel that this is a changing moment that you're in. I think that's part of what they're really good at in terms of embracing that moment."
There are those who rebuke Rapinoe, arguing sports and politics shouldn't mix, but the two have always been inextricable. For better or worse, there are few bigger stages than an international sporting event to make a political statement. That has especially held true at the Olympics, from the Black Power salutes of the Mexico City Games; to the 1972 massacre of 11 Israeli athletes and coaches by Palestinian terrorists in Munich, Germany; to the United States boycott of the 1980 Moscow Games in protest of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.
It would be irresponsible not to use her international platform to try to effect change, Rapinoe has often said. She stands in silent protest during the national anthem, declining to sing or put her hand over her heart. She said she would not visit the White House if the United States won its fourth Women's World Cup, and would encourage her teammates not to go, either.
Her reasoning, she said, is that she did not want the American women's team's decades-long fight for equality and inclusivity to be "co-opted by an administration that doesn't feel the same way and doesn't fight for the same things that we fight for."
Her boldness is nothing new for her, or for members of her team. It can be traced to the mid-1990s among American female soccer stars -- a line that extends from players like Julie Foudy to Abby Wambach and now to Rapinoe -- players willing to risk criticism in order to demand equitable pay, safe playing conditions and social justice. It was Foudy, for instance, who led the way in urging that the 1999 Women's World Cup be played in large football stadiums in the United States. The epic final that year, a penalty-shootout victory over China, drew a Women's World Cup-record crowd of 90,185 to the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, Calif.
"That team laid the foundation for a lot of things," said Jeffrey Gerson, a political science professor at the University of Massachusetts-Lowell who has led a number of panel discussions about the continuing struggle for equality in women's soccer.
He added: "They also had this sense that they were being watched and on stage and carrying the torch for equality and cultural change for girls and women. This conversation has continued. There's a spirit that goes along with the team: anything is possible, don't be limited by the doubts of others."
If anyone does not appear to be limited by the doubts of others, it is Rapinoe, who told The New York Times Magazine before the World Cup that it was important to buttress her activism with her play on the field. It is what she stresses to her younger teammates.
"Everything is more and better," she said then. "I want them to understand that it's better because we earned it. But it's also better because we won. The most important thing is continuing to win."

Texto completo: Libya's internationally recognized government says it seized four pricey U.S.-made weapons from troops loyal to warlord Khalifa Haftar.
The Javelin anti-tank missiles cost more than $170,000 each. Markings indicate they were sold by the U.S. to the United Arab Emirates in 2008, the New York Times reports.
If the Emirati government voluntarily transferred the missiles, the Times reports that may have violated the sales agreement.
Haftar, who has controlled most of eastern Libya since 2014, seeks to end a long-running civil war by conquering the national capital Tripoli. The cache of American-made missiles and Chinese-made weapons were discovered by Tripoli's forces in Gharyan, which is south of Tripoli and was used by forces loyal to Haftar as a base, following a surprise attack.
Critics see Haftar — a former member of Muammar Gaddafi's government, an ex-CIA asset, and a naturalized U.S. citizen — as a would-be dictator. But supporters see him as a crucial bulwark against Islamism in the region.
Haftar has been supported by Egypt, France, and the UAE. His original rivals were Islamists who refused to accept defeat in a parliamentary election. That side was backed by Qatar and Turkey.
In a statement, the State Department said, “We are aware of these reports and are seeking additional information. We expect all recipients of U.S. origin defense equipment to abide by their end-use obligations."
Although the U.S. and the United Nations recognize the Tripoli government, President Trump and Haftar spoke on the phone in April, with Trump praising the general's work "fighting terrorism and securing Libya’s oil resources," according to the White House.
Last month, the Trump administration declared a national emergency citing tensions with Iran to bypass congressional review of more than $8 billion in arms sales to Saudi Arabia, Jordan, and the UAE.

Texto completo: Sen. Kamala Harris supports reinstating school busing to boost school integration and help combat racial animus and inequality that still linger in this country.
But the Democratic presidential candidate has so far not offered any specific details for such a plan regarding a topic that rocketed to the national spotlight when Harris confronted 2020 front-runner Joe Biden on the debate stage this week about his opposition to federal desegregation busing as a senator in the 1970s.
"Yes," was the sole answer Harris national press secretary Ian Sams said Thursday on Twitter in response to whether the California Democrat supports reinstating busing policies for the present day. He further told National Review, "We haven’t put a plan out on that or anything, but she supports desegregation."
Tweet
The New York Times additionally reported the Harris campaign said the candidate "supported busing as a method for school integration" but "the campaign declined to provide additional information."
The Washington Examiner has reached out to Harris's campaign for comment.
Busing came to the forefront of the first 2020 Democratic presidential debate when Harris criticized former Vice President Biden for opposition to busing by the Department of Education decades ago.
"I will direct this at vice president Biden, I do not believe you are a racist and I agree with you when you commit yourself to the importance of finding common ground, but I also believe and it’s personal and it was hurtful to hear you talk about the reputations of two United States senator who is built their reputations and career on the segregation of race in this country," the 54-year-old California senator said Thursday.
"It was not only that, but you also worked with them to oppose busing. There was a little girl in California who was part of the second class to integrate her public schools and she was bused to school every day. That little girl was me," Harris said.
Biden, 76, struggled to defend his anti-busing record, saying he did not oppose court-ordered busing but was against busing ordered by the Department of Education.

Biden came under fire by fellow Democrats after his past comments opposing busing resurfaced and his recent reminiscences about working with pro-segregationist Democratic senators.
After the Thursday debate, several Democratic presidential contenders said they were open to new busing policies.
“I am really concerned about the growing segregation — once again — the resegregation of communities all over this country. We’re seeing more and more schools which are being segregated. And that is something we have to deal with," Sen. Bernie Sanders said. "Busing is one tool,” the 77-year-old Vermont independent added when pressed again if he would use busing to fight segregation in schools.
“I think every child should be able to go to a good public school. And as president I will assure that. If it needs busing, it needs busing,” Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand told reporters.
Support for Biden dropped 10 points, according to one poll, after what was widely viewed as a rough debate performance for him. Harris saw the largest gain in support in the poll, jumping nearly 9 points from 7.9% to 16.6%.

Can a single photograph shift the debate on immigration?

Texto completo: It was painful to look at the photo of the lifeless bodies of a father and his infant daughter face down in the muddy waters of the Rio Grande, their tragic fate sealed after trying to cross the perilous river in search of asylum in America.
Typically news organizations, including The Sun, won't use disturbing photos like this because it can seem sensational or exploitative, and these types of images often do little to add to the narrative and understanding of even the most harrowing stories. Photos of dead bodies at crime scenes, car crashes or accidental drownings rarely make the newspaper pages.
On the contrary, the photos of Oscar Alberto Martinez Ramirez and 23-month-old Valeria have been used widely as the crisis at the border has reached epic levels of inhumanity. Taken by journalist Julia Le Duc and first published by Mexican newspaper La Jornada, the photo became representative of just how far conditions have spiraled out of control under the tough-on-immigrants Trump administration. The New York Times ran the photo on its front page in a testament to the power of the image.
Not everyone agreed with the decision, though, with criticism coming from several fronts, including the leadership of the Association of Hispanic Journalists, who said the photo "dehumanizes" those so desperate to escape their homelands they are willing to risk their lives and those of their families.
As others have pointed out, a big part of the problem was not the image itself, which accurately tells the story of those trying to reach America's borders, but of the way the photo was used and disseminated. It was often displayed by itself with little context, or shared haphazardly on Twitter and Facebook. The shares became as ubiquitous as the trending meme of the day, which in some ways probably diluted the effectiveness of bringing attention to the border crisis.
The journalism association said: "Pushing people to look at a shocking image that isn't in context, is not beneficial for the viewers, it is not beneficial for journalists, and it is absolutely detrimental to the immigrant community."
We agree that images like these are sensitive and should be used sparingly and in the right context. These after all are real human beings with grieving families and their images should not be used like propaganda purely to stir people up.
But there are also times where the right photograph can spur meaningful change. There are times throughout U.S. history when a powerful image like this has led to a turn in the tide of a humanitarian crises, sparking people to rise out of complacency.
Like in 1955 when Mamie Till Mobley held an open casket funeral so that the world could see her son Emmitt Till's face, beaten unrecognizable by racists who accused him of whistling at a white woman. The photos ran in Jet magazine and other newspapers and magazines and some say helped ignite new fire and energy in the Civil Rights movement.
A decade later, brutal media images also brought attention to the fight for voting rights in 1965. The television clips and photos of state troopers brutalizing peaceful demonstrators marching over the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Ala., which became known as "Bloody Sunday," caused public outrage and stirred up many people who had been passively observing the fight for civil rights for African Americans from afar. Within five months, Congress passed the Voting Rights Act, which President Lyndon Johnson signed into law on Aug. 6 of that year.
The way people around the world viewed the Vietnam War also changed after people saw the now iconic photo of a young Kim Phúc screaming and running naked through the streets, in pain from a napalm attack.
Newspapers should have long and careful conversations when using images like this. And they do. One of the concerns some critics have had is that media rarely uses these graphic images when writing about tragedies on American soil, such as Sandy Hook, or when it comes to white victims. This leaves the impression that it is more acceptable to dramatize the tragedies of communities of color. That is fair criticism.
But we don't think these images should be totally ruled out. Once again, it is about context. The follow-up stories further delve into the plight of the young father and his daughter and put a human face on the story that the early reporting often is not able to. These stories are accompanied by touching photos of the pair that further underscores the tragedy of their death.
Unfortunately, President Donald Trump hasn't been swayed. Although, he said he hated the image, we wonder about the sincerity of the comment since Mr. Trump used the incident to attack Democrats on their immigration policies. No surprise there, really.
For others it is a different story. Already the photo of Oscar Ramirez and his young daughter has resulted in more than just the shock value that some people worried about and tugged at the hearts of people around the world, from Pope Francis to quarterback Russell Wilson. It was a topic at the Democratic presidential debates, and both Republicans and Democrats in Congress have said they hope it brings more urgency to the issue.
The House passed a bipartisan border funding bill late Thursday, resulting in blistering criticism by progressives for House Speaker of Nancy Pelosi. But it ends the gridlock over the issue and brings much-needed emergency funding to the deplorable conditions at the border detention areas. Ms. Pelosi said it would get resources to the children the fastest, and we can't help but wonder if the image of little Valeria still clinging to her father was etched in her mind when she made the decision.
Republican Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, the chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, opened a hearing Wednesday saying the photo should propel Congress to act, according to a story in The Washington Post.
"I don't want to see another picture like that on the U.S. border," Johnson said.
Neither do we.

What is the Blue Zones Project?

Texto completo: Salinas residents may find their lifespans lengthened, thanks to a new initiative called the Blue Zones Project that Monterey County is launching Saturday.
The Blue Zones Project is a health initiative backed by Salinas Valley Memorial Healthcare System, Montage Health and Taylor Farms.
The program is based on the travels of National Geographic's explorer Dan Buettner, who identified communities worldwide where people share lifestyle traits and live 100 or years. He wrote a New York Times best-seller about the nine principles of longevity.
The "Power Nine" include moving naturally by being physically active, eating a plant-focused diet, knowing your purpose in life, taking time to relax, having a healthy social network and putting loved ones first. A popular activity is to form walking groups at worksites, which gets people active and engaging with one another.
The philosophy is that making policy and practical changes at businesses, government offices, schools, restaurants and elsewhere that promote healthier choices in daily life will become habit.
Through these principles, Monterey County leaders hope to improve the lives of residents. Sites around the U.S. that participate in the Blue Zones project have seen different effects depending on what they focused on. Some saw a more engaged community or an increase in average lifespan while others experienced drops in childhood obesity.
How do I participate in the Blue Zones Project? Blue Zones asks residents to take a pledge and commit to specific actions they can take to improve their lives and increase their lifespan, such as adopting a dog, gardening or attending a faith-based organization.
Next year, children all over the county will be sent home with one of these pledge forms. "Children are our greatest communicators," said Monterey County Superintendent of Schools Deneen Guss. The county's youngest residents are key to involving adults, she said, after they talk the information over with their parents and guardians at home.
Executive Director of Blue Zones Project Monterey County Tiffany Ditullio added that "walking school buses," or walking groups that took a regular route to school, with chaperones guiding kids to their destination, were a large part of creating buy-in from parents.
"The idea is that you create an environment that's engaging to the parents and safe (for the kids)," said Ditullio. "The parents participate (as chaperones), even."
Furthermore, Guss said, walking school buses could help to alleviate environmental stressors created by school traffic.
"It's a double win," Guss said. "If you have less cars jamming into a school parking lot and you get more kids to bike, walk and skate to school in a healthy way, everyone wins."
To that end, the City of Salinas is looking into making itself more pedestrian-friendly, Ditullio said.
She pointed out the Alisal vibrancy plan and the street connectivity plans put forth by the city. Furthermore, CalTrans and other transit organizations are involved in ensuring public transit is closing the gaps for walkers.
"I've driven all over Salinas. All over," said Ditullio. "But now, when I drive by the food bank, for example, a beautiful building, I think, 'How do people get here?' Is there public transportation? Is there a sidewalk?"
Former President and CEO of NCH Healthcare System of Naples, Fla., Dr. Allen Weiss implemented the Blue Zones Project at NCH in 2015. In that time, he said, the life expectancy for residents of Naples increased by two-tenths of a year (10 weeks) while the average lifespan in the U.S. declined by one-tenth of a year (5 weeks).
In another Blue Zones community, Beach Cities, the rate of childhood obesity dropped by 64%, said Terri Merritt-Worden, vice president of Operations for Blue Zones Project, .
Dealing with diverse populations has its challenges, though. A one-size-fits-all model cannot be applied.
In Fort Worth, Texas, local Blue Zones Director of Community Engagement Ricky Cotto said the engagement and health of the African-American and Latino communities increased, but only after Project workers learned how to accommodate their residents by providing childcare at meetings or including bilingual materials.
The Blue Zones Project kickoff will be held June 29 at 1 p.m. at Sherwood Hall in Salinas, and will last until 4:30 p.m. This is a free community event; all are welcome to attend.

'Betrayal' Returns To Broadway

Texto completo: Tom Hiddleston is going from the Avengers to adultery.
The British actor, best known as the villainous Loki in a slew of Marvel superhero films, is coming to Broadway to star in a revival of Harold Pinter's classic "Betrayal."
The show, directed by Jamie Lloyd, had a successful run earlier this year in the West End. Writing in The New York Times, the critic Matt Wolf said the production "represents a benchmark achievement for everyone involved, and shows Pinter's 1978 play in a revealing, even radical, new light."
Mr. Lloyd, who has emerged as a devoted contemporary interpreter of the playwright's work, called it Pinter's "great masterpiece," and said that it made sense to revisit it now, a decade after his death.
"It absolutely honors his words, but it gets rid of any circumstantial detail -- it's a very stark, stripped-down production," he said.
The play will also star Zawe Ashton ("Velvet Buzzsaw") and Charlie Cox ("Daredevil"). All three are making their Broadway debuts, though Mr. Cox had a well-received Off Broadway run in "Incognito."
This will be the fourth Broadway production of "Betrayal," which originally starred Roy Scheider, Raul Julia and Blythe Danner. The most recent revival opened in 2013 and starred a couple who are married in real life: Daniel Craig and Rachel Weisz.
Mr. Lloyd's production differs from others in the age of its actors -- slightly younger, in keeping with the characters -- and in his decision to keep the three main actors onstage throughout the show.
"The play is about the labyrinthine nature of betrayal -- this never-ending cycle of deceit and the pursuit of power and control -- and there's something exciting about seeing the other person onstage and being aware of that presence," he said.
The 17-week run is to begin performances Aug. 14 and to open Sept. 5 at the Bernard B. Jacobs Theater. The lead producer is Mr. Lloyd's eponymous company, which is backed by the Ambassador Theater Group.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Texto completo: The last thing my murdered husband and I talked about was my birthday cake. Not at all unexpected, considering June 28, 2018 - the now infamous date of the Capital Gazette shootings - was my birthday.
I recall the morning vividly. Warm - but not muggy enough to prevent me from tiptoeing downstairs to make coffee and assume my perch in one of the new Adirondack chairs Rob had assembled the week before.
A high school English teacher about a week into the summer, I enjoyed the quiet as well as the luxury of actually getting to read rather than skim the New York Times. I knew Rob would be sleeping in another half-hour or so. He'd long ago determined that a later start helped him avoid the traffic backups he endured for the commute from Timonium to Annapolis, where he worked as assistant editor at The Capital. That drive took more than an hour - on a good day.
Soon enough Rob appeared on the deck, freshly showered and smelling of Kenneth Cole Reaction cologne with a touch of Johnson's Baby Powder. The 6-foot, 5-inch Norwegian dragged the sliding door to the deck shut and then sashayed in my direction. As anyone who has attended a wedding reception or mitzvah with Rob and Maria Hiaasen knows, Rob was willing to dance, but his ability to do so was questionable. Nonetheless, arms akimbo, he performed a little birthday dance and sang an original birthday tune, a sort of mash-up of the Beatles' "Birthday" and Lord-knows-what.
We shared a laugh. He adjourned for his coffee. And, when he returned to the deck, he got to the day's essential questions.
"What will the birthday girl do today?"
"Eye exam at 10 a.m. Swimming laps later."
"Will you treat yourself to lunch out?"
"Doubtful. But I might pick up Graul's shrimp salad."
"Do you want to open your birthday present now or later?"
"Later. Duh. We'll have more time."
I remember we talked briefly about whether he'd get out of the office that day for a much-needed haircut. Rob's wavy hair had started to protrude above his ears in Bozo the Clown fashion, and I told him I hoped he could get to his 2 p.m. appointment.
"No way that's happening," he said. "Going to cancel it. Too many people out on vacation."
Off to the kitchen we went. I made his turkey sandwich. He gathered his usual snacks: a banana, some strawberry yogurt, pretzels, Nilla Wafers. I walked him to the garage, kissed him good-bye, and said what I always said during those summer days when I was home to see him off.
"I love you. Be safe."
So began what I assumed would be an innocuous birthday. Turning 58 as I was last year was no great shakes. I had even told Rob he should skip ordering a birthday cake. We didn't need the calories. But then as I bought my shrimp salad, I caught sight of Graul's voluptuous buttercream-frosted, yellow cakes. That's why I called Rob around noon - to tell him about my change of heart.
He answered brusquely.
"You're busy. Sorry. Just calling about the possibility of birthday cake."
The conversation probably didn't last a full minute.
"I can't talk right now. Actual news has broken out here. Paddleboarder missing and presumed dead. A veteran. Double amputee."
"No worries! I'll order it for Sunday when we have the kids over."
And I did. Minutes later, Rob emailed from work to apologize for being so curt, but he didn't need to. I totally understood the pressure he felt. A former cop reporter in South Florida, I remember frantic newsrooms vividly.
While it's true that cop reporting and high school English teaching have girded me for all sorts of challenges, nothing prepared me for what I faced in the coming days. Fathoming the heinous crime and the senseless loss of lives. Signing forms authorizing Rob's cremation. Staring at the date Rob was murdered on a death certificate.
How could it be that the same date I came into the world had become the date my loving husband left it? I wanted no part of my birthday - or anyone's, for that matter.
In the midst of all the anguish the day after the shootings, I managed to remember the doggone cake, and I canceled it. Days later, before my daughter Hannah returned to her home in Brooklyn, N.Y., I opened the gift bag Rob had left for me.
Contents: note cards and a pair of coasters bearing scenes of the Chesapeake Bay; a book about Key West, a place we planned a return trip to; and a journal, which I presume Rob figured I'd use to develop some ideas for writing since I had quit advising my high school's student newspaper.
I put all but the journal away and gave myself permission to forget everybody's birthday - forever.
Dodging birthday talk took a little effort. Once school resumed in September, I not only skipped the how-was-your-summer English department meeting, I later ducked out of discussions on how we'd supply sweets to mark each English teacher's birthday.
Months passed. Well-meaning friends and acquaintances presented me with unsolicited suggestions.
"You could have my birthday if you wanted to," one friend offered.
Nope. That's yours.
"You could celebrate 6 months from June 28," someone else said.
Too close to Christmas.
"You could pick a random day."
Just no.
I had more important concerns, such as surviving, ensuring my kids were OK, navigating the holidays, and speaking out about gun violence. And let's get real. It's not as if I'm a kid anticipating sweet 16 or the legal drinking age. My birthday just seemed ridiculously frivolous.
What's more, June - once the sweetest month for me because of my anniversary (June 22) as well as my birthday - now became the cruelest. Instead of counting down the days until the end of the school year, I focused on June's unique challenges - how to accommodate my three adult children's needs on Father's Day and how to appropriately commemorate the passage of a full year since the Capital Gazette shootings.
But those who love me had other concerns this June. It began with a birthday card that arrived Monday from Debby, my dear aunt who is too young to be my aunt (that's always how I introduce her). "While I might not celebrate your birthday on the actual day, I will always celebrate your birth," she wrote. "Thinking of you always."
A few other cards arrived the next day, including one from dear friends in California, a husband and wife Rob introduced to each other back in the '90s during his time at The Baltimore Sun. "Celebrating you," their elegant card said. A noteworthy detail here: Mike, the husband in this duo, is responsible for making this June 28 Read Rob Day.
And then, on Wednesday, during a lunch that followed a shopping mission with my dear friend Patty, in need of an ensemble for her daughter's bridal shower, it happened. I felt joy. I felt loved. And I felt like celebrating. The sauvignon blanc we ordered with oysters probably contributed. Regardless, I declared June 26 my new birthday.
Hours later this Wonder Woman of a friend lured me to a favorite sushi restaurant for dinner with her family and surprised me with a cake.
Yes, I blew out a candle (just one). But no, the cake wasn't buttercream from Graul's. Patty chose a small Wegmans chocolate cake with coconut macaroons on the side, something different for a new birthday.

Texto completo: Women recall how E. Jean Carroll described the alleged assault
Lisa Birnbach planned to take her friend's secret to the grave.
When E. Jean Carroll called more than two decades ago to tell her that she'd just been sexually assaulted by Donald Trump in a Manhattan department store dressing room, Birnbach said she begged Carroll to go to the police. When her friend resisted, Birnbach swore she'd never tell anyone.
Even after more than a dozen women came forward in 2016 to accuse the then-presidential candidate of kissing and groping them without consent, Birnbach said she didn't think about the episode again until Carroll told her last year that she had decided to write about it in a new book.
"I know a lot of women he has hassled," Birnbach said.
Trump has vehemently denied the claim by Carroll, a longtime Elle magazine columnist who went public last week with her description of the alleged assault. She is one of 16 women who have accused him of sexual misconduct, allegations he says are untrue.
Birnbach, a New York-based author, was one of two friends who told The Washington Post that Carroll had described the assault to them shortly after it allegedly happened. They both spoke on the condition of anonymity to protect their privacy.
After Trump and his allies attacked Carroll and her account, Birnbach and the second friend, former New York television anchor Carol Martin, decided to come forward this week, first speaking on the record to the New York Times.
"Apparently my validation makes E. Jean more believable, and my only goal is to be an honest person who tells the truth," Birnbach said. "I told the truth not as a political observer - I told what happened to my friend 23 years ago."
Martin said she was working with Carroll at a cable news station at the time of the alleged incident, which she said Carroll described to her as they sat in Martin's kitchen days later.
"She was dumbstruck," Martin said.
The decision by her two friends to go public comes as Carroll's allegation has stirred little political response, even among the president's critics. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) told reporters Thursday that she had not followed the story closely.
Birnbach, a former correspondent for CBS's "The Early Show" and co-author of "The Official Preppy Handbook," said she wasn't bothered that the Democrats were not focusing on the episode amid the turmoil of the Trump era.
"There will be another scandal breaking by dinner time, so you think, 'Don't go all in on this story, save some energy for the next story,' " she said, adding: "There are so many crises. You have to do triage on your emotions."
Carroll has said that during a chance encounter at a Bergdorf Goodman department store in New York in late 1995 or early 1996, Trump attacked her in a dressing room. Carroll said he knocked her head against a wall, pulled down her tights and briefly penetrated her before she pushed him off and ran out.
Trump has said Carroll is "totally lying" and added that she was "not my type." His allies, such as Fox News host Tucker Carlson, have sought to discredit Carroll's story, questioning why she did not come forward sooner.
Carroll told The Post that, like many women who have been assaulted, she blamed herself.
"It's such a personal decision, when you come forward and when you don't come forward," she said. "It's so personal."

IGUODALA HAS A GOOD FEELING

Texto completo: The body no longer feels as hurt. The frustration no longer feels as strong.
Yes, Andre Iguodala could still use the rest of this summer to heal his 35-year-old body and maximize his sleep. He also still cannot help but wonder if the Warriors would've beaten the Toronto Raptors in the NBA Finals if not for debilitating injuries to Kevin Durant (right Achilles) and Klay Thompson (torn ACL in left knee).
"Even losing Klay and KD, we were one possession away from going to a Game 7. And anything can happen in the Finals," Iguodala said in a wide-ranging interview with Bay Area News Group. "That's not even taken into consideration enough."
And yet, Iguodala still seemed at peace this week. The reasons went beyond promoting his newly released memoir, "The Sixth Man." Or that he is a participant in The Players' Technology Summit in San Francisco. Iguodala also sounded optimistic about the Warriors' uncertain future.
One, Iguodala downplayed concerns about Durant and Thompson. Durant opted out of his $31.5 million player option on Wednesday to become an unrestricted free agent. He could sign a five-year, $221 million deal to stay with the Warriors, but he might find it enticing to agree to a four-year, $164 million deal with the New York Knicks, Brooklyn Nets or Los Angeles Clippers. The Warriors and Thompson expect to keep their partnership since the Warriors plan to give Thompson a max-contract worth around $190 million for the next five seasons. Regardless of Durant's uncertain future, he is expected to miss at least next season because of his surgically repaired right Achilles tendon. Despite Thompson's expected return with the Warriors, he will likely sit out a significant chunk to heal his left knee.
"I feel positive vibes with them. That's a given," Iguodala said. "When we're communicating, it's not just on a teammate level. It's on a friendship level and making sure we're all good in a good place. I got good vibes with the guys."
The Warriors still have Stephen Curry, Draymond Green and Iguodala. If Iguodala's optimism holds true, both Durant and Thompson will remain in a Warriors uniform. And there is an outside chance DeMarcus Cousins could accept the Warriors' one-year, $6.3 million deal. The Warriors were fairly close, after all, in locking up their fourth NBA title in the past five years. Three out of five does not seem bad either.
"I have really good conversations with everyone on our team. We're feeling really positive for next year. We're looking at all the guys and talking to Klay and talking to KD and making sure their spirits are good," Iguodala said. "We truly feel like the run is still going. We're taking this time that this run is getting the best of us right now, but we'll be back."
How the Warriors thrive next season does not just hinge on Curry, Green and the pending free agency to their other three All-Stars. It also depends on Iguodala, who described his health as "pretty good" after dealing with overlapping ailments to his left calf during the NBA playoffs. Iguodala also enters the final year of his contract worth $17.2 million.
The Warriors are expected to negotiate a buyout with Shaun Livingston since only $2 million of his $7.7 million of his contract is guaranteed next season. Livingston has also strongly hinted he will retire to cap off a 15-year NBA career. How Iguodala's future pans out seems uncertain.
Warriors coach Steve Kerr could use Iguodala's unmatched playmaking, defensive versatility and team-oriented leadership either through a playoff run or rebuilding season. Or Warriors general manager Bob Myers might consider it more useful to collect assets on an expiring contract.
"I'm confident I'll be back. If not, there are no hard feelings," Iguodala said. "You want nothing but the best, especially with the way I feel with Steph. Wherever Steph is at, I want him to do well. You know how I feel about Steph."
Iguodala has had an ongoing dialogue with both his Warriors' current teammates and their pending free agents. Iguodala said "you try to have a right balance" on to what extent he has tried to sell Durant on re-signing with the team or leaving him space. Iguodala mostly has tried to have normal conversations about Durant's life, while stressing his support regardless of his future.
"I just hope all the guys are in a good mental space going forward with all the decisions," Iguodala said. "At the end of the day, just enjoy life and enjoy basketball and try to be at peace with whatever decision they make. They're my guys, regardless of what happens."
 We have a Klay Thompson sighting. The Warriors' binge scorer showed up at the "Space Jam 2" movie set Wednesday where he met with LeBron James and Warriors teammate Draymond Green. According to TMZ Sports, Anthony Davis and Damian Lillard were also on the set.
Thompson moved around with the aid of crutches to protect his left knee, which he injured during Game 6 of the NBA Finals. On Monday, Warriors general manager Bob Myers told reporters that Thompson would have surgery this week to repair a torn ACL.
Thompson's visit to the movie set wasn't purely social. The Athletic last week disclosed a partial list of the LeBron James-led cast. Thompson made the cut. The original "Space Jam" featured Michael Jordan.
 It appears the New York Knicks are preparing their own lovely consolation prize in the event they are unable to land Durant. DeMarcus Cousins, come on down.
Marc Stein of the New York Times, citing league sources, is reporting that the Knicks "are weighing the prospect of extending a considerable one-year offer to Warriors free-agent DeMarcus Cousins if they miss out on top target Kevin Durant."
For what it's worth, the Knicks have also been tied to free agents Kyrie Irving and Kawhi Leonard.
And now a word from Andre Iguodala: "Nobody's going to the Knicks. Sorry."
Cousins missed the first half of last season rehabbing a ruptured Achilles. The plan was for the Warriors to use Cousins to help win their third consecutive NBA championship, thereby setting him up to cash in with another team as a free agent. The plan didn't quite come to fruition. Cousins averaged 16.3 points and 8.2 rebounds in 30 regular season games. He missed 14 postseason games after tearing a quad muscle, but returned for Golden State's final eight playoff games the first of his career.

Texto completo: Uno de los dos soldados estadounidenses muertos en combate en Afganistán esta semana era de la región de Finger Lakes, Nueva York.
El Sargento James Gregory Johnston (24) era natural de Trumansburg, una comunidad cerca del lago Cayuga, dijo el Pentágono.
Johnston, técnico en eliminación de explosivos, formaba parte de un equipo de Fuerzas Especiales que participó en un combate con militantes talibanes en la provincia Uruzgan el 25 de junio, según The New York Times.
El otro fallecido fue Micheal Riley (32), un soldado de las Fuerzas Especiales. El ejército está investigando el incidente.
Johnston estaba asignado al 79.º Batallón de Artillería, parte del 71.º Grupo de Artillería, con sede en Fort Hood, Texas.
Riley fue asignado al 2º Batallón, 10º Grupo de Fuerzas Especiales con sede en Fort Carson, Colorado.
El gobernador Andrew Cuomo ordenó que las banderas en los edificios del gobierno estatal fueran izadas a la mitad este 28 de junio, reportó Fox News.
“En nombre de todos los neoyorquinos, extiendo nuestras condolencias a los amigos, familiares y compañeros soldados del Sargento Johnston”, dijo Cuomo en un comunicado. “Su muerte es un recordatorio de los sacrificios que los miembros de los militares hacen para proteger las libertades y los valores sobre los que se fundaron este estado y esta nación”.

Texto completo: What are the must-see shows at the CGI Rochester International Jazz Festival today? Derrick Lucas, music director and midday host at WGMC-FM (Jazz 90.1), offers his eclectic picks.
The Steve Miller Band 8 p.m., Kodak Hall at Eastman Theatre.
What more is there to say about the 2016 Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Famer beyond "Abracadabra," "Take The Money and Run," "Space Cowboy," "Time Keeps On Slippin," "The Joker"? Plenty. I can't wait to see Steve shock and awe his fans with some of his blues and jazz skills.
Jim Snidero 6 and 9 p.m., Kilbourn Hall.
"Mercy Mercy Mercy." The saxophonist with his quintet, featuring trumpeter Eddie Henderson, will be taking you on a "Jive Samba" "Work Song" tour of "Hippodelphia" and "Bohemia After Dark" as he pays tribute to the great Julian "Cannonball" Adderley. It will no doubt be "Something Different."
Sullivan Fortner 6:15 and 10 p.m., Max of Eastman Place.
The latest in a line of New Orleans piano masters stretching back to Jelly Roll Morton over a century ago, Fortner has been hailed by The New York Times as "a wondrous player, vested with fleet, dazzling power." Since winning the prestigious American Pianists Association Competition in 2015, the Louisiana native has been heard around the world performing with Wynton Marsalis, Paul Simon, Roy Hargrove, and, most recently, Cecile McLorin Salvant.
Matthew Whitaker 6 and 10 p.m., Montage Music Hall.
The young artist has already charmed millions through his television performances on "The Ellen DeGeneres Show" and Fox's "Showtime at The Apollo," where he won first place. Just 18 years old and blind since early childhood, Whitaker has achieved worldwide acclaim for his awe-inspiring talent as he performs around the world.
Bill Charlap 5:45 and 7:45 p.m. Hatch Recital Hall.
One of the world's premiere jazz pianists, Charlap, a child of Broadway parents, returns to The Flower City to showcase his interpretations of The Great American Songbook, featuring music from the likes of Hoagy Carmichael, Leonard Bernstein and George Gershwin.
Catherine Russell 7 and 9:15 p.m., Temple Building Theatre.
A perennial Rochester Jazz Fest favorite, the singer, actress and jazz anthropologist continues to breathe new life into songs from the Vintage Black Glamour era, allowing us to journey back in time without leaving the present.
The Steve Miller Band.

Texto completo: SAN FRANCISCO -- Jony Ive, Apple's chief design officer and one of the most influential executives in the history of the Silicon Valley giant, is leaving the company.
Mr. Ive will depart this year to start his own design company, Apple said on Thursday. Through his new firm, LoveFrom, Mr. Ive will continue to work on a wide range of Apple products, the company said.
"Jony is a singular figure in the design world, and his role in Apple's revival cannot be overstated," Tim Cook, Apple's chief executive, said in a statement.
Mr. Ive, who has worked at Apple for nearly three decades, was responsible for the look and feel of many iconic Apple products, including the iPhone and the iMac. He also helped design Apple's new headquarters, a futuristic, flying-saucerlike glass building that has become one of the most distinctive structures in Silicon Valley.
Apple's design team will now be led by Evans Hankey, an industrial designer at the company, and Alan Dye, previously a creative director at Apple. They will report to Jeff Williams, Apple's chief operating officer, who oversaw the creation of the Apple Watch.
Apple's share price was down more than 1 percent in after-hours trading after Mr. Ive's departure was announced.
Apple has struggled in recent quarters with slumping iPhone sales and a significant drop in revenue across the China region. In April, when Apple last reported its quarterly financial results, profit dropped 16.4 from the same quarter a year earlier, and iPhone sales dropped 17.3 percent.
Revenue from online services, including Apple's App Store, was on the rise. But the hardware business that defined Apple -- and the career of Mr. Ive -- has slowed. The Apple Watch has been a modest success, but it has not captured the market or the popular imagination in the way that the iPhone and the iMac did when they were released.
Apple did not make Mr. Ive available for comment Thursday evening.
Born and raised outside London, Mr. Ive joined Apple in 1992, when the company was nearing its lowest ebb. One of his first projects was the Apple Newton, an early hand-held computer that, while innovative, was bulky and too expensive to find a mainstream audience. It was considered a bust.
But Mr. Ive became a key player in the company's revival after its founder Steve Jobs returned in 1997.
Mr. Jobs and Mr. Ive often met for lunch, and at the end of each day, the chief executive would visit Mr. Ive's Apple design studio, according Walter Isaacson's biography "Steve Jobs."
"The difference that Jony has made, not only at Apple but in the world, is huge," Mr. Jobs told Mr. Isaacson. "He understands what we do at out core better than anyone."
As the head of Apple's industrial design team, Mr. Ive helped shape the original iMac, a clear plastic bubble of a personal computer that marked a return to form for the company.
After the iMac, he played a vital role in Apple's breakout products. From the iPod music player to the iPhone to the iPad tablet, Apple redefined personal computing over the next decade or so and became one of the most profitable and valuable companies in the world.
Industrial design -- how the look, feel and behavior of a product are defined by its creators -- has long been a key part of the Apple ethos.
"This is part of Steve's legacy," Mr. Ive told The New York Times in an interview in 2014. "Deep in the culture of Apple is this sense and understanding of design, developing and making. Form and the material and process -- they are beautifully intertwined -- completely connected."
In 2012, after the success of the iPad, Mr. Ive was knighted in Britain. And his voice was a staple of Apple television ads, as he deconstructed the Apple design philosophy for the masses.
This philosophy extended to the Apple Park, the company's $ 5 billion campus in Cupertino, Calif. Before it opened to employees in 2017, Mr. Ive spent a significant portion of his time working on the new headquarters.
In the years since, he has stepped back from his daily role at the company and spent more time on outside projects, including a Christmas tree for the historic Claridge's hotel in London.
Though he and Mr. Jobs came to represent the company's unique approach to design, Mr. Ive always made a point of saying he was just one piece in the puzzle. "Innovation at Apple has always been a team game," he told The Times.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – Rep. Tulsi Gabbard's Twitter account defended her on Wednesday evening during the Democratic presidential debate, saying that MSNBC favored Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass.
"It's clear who MSNBC wants to be president: Elizabeth Warren. They're giving her more time than all the other candidates combined. They aren't giving any time to Tulsi at all. -V (Tulsi's sister)," read the tweet from the Hawaii Democrat's Twitter account.
The tweets appear to be coming from Vrindavan Gabbard, the representative's sister.
The Hawaii State Legislature website of Tulsi's father, State Sen. Mike Gabbard, notes that Tulsi has four other siblings, including Vrindavan Gabbard, who Politico reports plays a role on her campaign. Occasionally tweets from Tulsi's account appear signed "V," and sometimes with the qualifier "Tulsi's sister. " Vrindavan Gabbard, according to New York magazine, has spoken for her sister from the time they were kids.
On Wednesday, social media users noted the connection. Vrindavan Gabbard, according to New York magazine, has spoken for her sister from the time they were kids.
The tweets referred to what she saw as unequal speaking times allotted to every candidate during the debate. According to the New York Times, Gabbard spoke for about 6 minutes and 39 seconds during the debate, putting her in the bottom third of speaking lengths during the debate. Sen. Cory Booker, D-N. J. spoke the longest out of the candidates, speaking for 11 minutes and 6 seconds. Warren spoke for 9 minutes and 31 seconds, the Times said.
Debate recap: First night of Democratic debate: Who were the winners and losers
More: Tim Ryan incorrectly said the Taliban carried out the 9/11 attack. Gabbard quickly responded
More: Tulsi Gabbard was the most searched candidate on Google after the Democratic debate in Miami
Google Trends analysis showed that Gabbard was the most-searched candidate following the debate.
Vrindavan Gabbard appears to have tweeted from Tulsi's account before and has also been a critic of the media in the past while posting from Tulsi Gabbard's Twitter account.
Earlier Wednesday evening, a tweet from Gabbard's account signed "V" criticized Meghan McCain for posting and then deleting a tweet about Tulsi. The tweet said, "Meghan displayed a moment of courage to tweet this out before deleting it. Tulsi's lived a lifetime of courage - and she won't cave to establishment pressure. "
In April, a tweet from Gabbard's account rail against "typical MSM anti-Tulsi policy," a reference to what she saw as "mainstream media" bias against Tulsi.
The New Yorker reported that Tulsi and Vrindavan live together in Washington, D. C. , where Vrindavan reportedly works as a U. S. Marshall.

Durant declines $31 million option

Texto completo: Golden State Warriors superstar Kevin Durant has declined his $31.5 million player option for next season, according to ESPN, meaning he will become an unrestricted free agent once free agency begins Sunday.
While this move was expected, it's still significant, as it means Durant – who tore his Achilles in Game 5 of the NBA Finals and is expected to miss all of next season – won't for sure be with Golden State for the 2019-20 campaign. Despite the injury, the former league MVP will still have his fair share of suitors.
ESPN reported that Durant, 30, is still considering multiple scenarios, including a return to Golden State. He's also considering the New York Knicks, Brooklyn Nets and Los Angeles Clippers, according to the report.
The Warriors can offer Durant a larger contract – an additional year and over $50 million – than any other team. Durant, who signed with Golden State in the summer of 2016, won two championships and two Finals MVPs in his first two seasons with the Warriors.
RAPTORS: Center Marc Gasol will exercise his $25.6 million player option and return to the Toronto Raptors, the team announced Wednesday. Gasol, 34, had the choice to enter free agency, but decided instead to stay with the 2019 NBA champions.
He had played his entire career with the Memphis Grizzlies before he was traded to the Raptors in February. Gasol had less of a scoring role and played fewer minutes on the Raptors than he did in Memphis, but still averaged 9.1 points, 6.6 rebounds and 3.9 rebounds for Toronto during the regular season.
His defense was crucial to the Raptors' championship run and he stepped up in the NBA Finals against the Golden State Warriors, averaging 12 points and 7.3 rebounds on 44.7% shooting. The Raptors will look to re-sign Finals MVP Kawhi Leonard and try to keep their starting lineup complete for a run at a repeat championship. Leonard will be one of the top unrestricted free agents this summer.
SCHEDULE CHANGES? The NBA is considering reducing its 82-game season, ESPN reported Wednesday.
A committee with about a dozen top team basketball and business operations executives had a conference call June 17 to explore alternative scheduling ideas for the 2021-22 season. In addition to shortening the season, executives brainstormed ideas around introducing in-season tournaments and a postseason play-in tournament for what will be the league's 75th season. Commissioner Adam Silver told the New York Times in May that he was interested in both tournament concepts after studying their benefits in European soccer, but this is the first report of those being officially explored.
The committee that met doesn't have governing authority and simply makes recommendations to the NBA's Board of Governors. However, if eventually introduced, the reforms would be implemented as a pilot program, giving the NBA a trial run of sorts.
There are concerns about how reducing games would affect the revenue of teams, which make money from attendance and have commitments to broadcast and advertising partners, but executives hope the tournaments could, over time, make up for such losses.
According to ESPN, the number of games to potentially be reduced varied widely from just a few to trimming the season to 58 games – which would ensure each team could host the other 29 at least once.
Golden State Warriors forward Kevin Durant has declined his $31.5 million player option for next season, according to ESPN.

THE WORLD; Uproar over tragedy on Rio Grande; Image of dead father and daughter points up migrant crisis but also elicits criticism.

Texto completo: Sometimes an image is so powerful, it cuts through almost any noise.
That has happened with a graphic photograph of a dead man and child taken this week along the U.S.-Mexico border by journalist Julia Le Duc.
The photo, which was originally published Monday by the Mexican newspaper La Jornada and went viral on social media, shows a migrant and his daughter, younger than 2, lying facedown in the murky waters on the Mexican side of the Rio Grande. The girl's right arm rests across the back of her father's neck.

The image encapsulated the grim reality of the border amid the growing desperation of migrants fleeing poverty and crime in Central America and elsewhere who are willing to face great dangers -- at times with children -- for a shot at a better life in the United States.
The man in the photo, 25-year-old Oscar Alberto Martinez Ramirez, left El Salvador on April 3 with his 21-year-old wife, Tania Vanessa Avalos, and their toddler, Valeria, according to accounts from relatives reported by several news outlets. The family fled to seek economic opportunity and safety, the relatives said.
The couple first requested asylum in southern Mexico, but later decided to try to reach the U.S. When they arrived at the U.S. border over the weekend, relatives said, they were told that they could not cross -- because of the Trump administration's policy of "metering," which allows only a few dozen migrants to seek asylum at official crossings each day.
According to Le Duc's reporting for La Jornada, the family, frustrated, decided to swim across the river separating the U.S. and Mexico on Sunday and turn themselves in to border authorities.
Martinez swam across with Valeria first and set her down safely on the U.S. side. As he began to cross back for his wife, the girl panicked and threw herself into the river. Martinez tried to rescue his daughter and managed to grab her, but they drowned.
Their bodies were discovered Monday morning near Matamoros, Mexico, across from Brownsville, Texas, less than a mile from an international border bridge.
Hundreds of migrants die while seeking to reach the U.S. each year. They drown in the swift-running Rio Grande, perish in the sweltering Sonoran Desert or suffocate in the back of tractor-trailers driven by migrant smugglers. Most of those deaths go largely unnoticed in the United States.
But Le Duc's photo went viral and was published on the front page of the New York Times on Wednesday, with some saying it points to increasingly inhumane U.S. immigration policies.
Since taking office in 2017, Trump has sought to make it more difficult for all immigrants, including those seeking political asylum, to reach the United States.
Along with metering and a short-lived policy that resulted in thousands of migrant children being separated from their families last year, his administration has in the first six months of this year sent more than 17,000 asylum seekers to Mexico to wait for their cases to be heard.
Several Democratic presidential candidates expressed outrage at the image, with California Sen. Kamala Harris tweeting that it was "a stain on our moral conscience" and former Rep. Beto O'Rourke of Texas tweeting, "Trump is responsible for these deaths."
In Mexico, where polls show that attitudes toward migrants have toughened in recent months, President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said at his morning news conference Tuesday that the deaths were "very regrettable."
As the photograph generated more attention, some observers debated the appropriateness of publishing such a graphic image.
In a statement, the National Assn. of Hispanic Journalists said it was "disturbed and concerned" by a decision by the Associated Press to publish the photo via a tweet.
"Men, women, and children cross the border daily often escaping terror with hopes of a better life, knowing the peril that awaits them as they attempt to make the long journey to America," the statement said. Using the picture "seeks to take advantage of a sensational situation," it said.
Mario Carrillo, Texas director of the immigrant activist group America's Voice, said via Twitter that the use of the photo was too much for him.
"I've been so torn about the benefit of using the image," Carrillo said. "Do we need to see the photo to understand how awful it is? I don't think so."
The practice of publishing graphic photos of dead people -- particularly those not from the U.S. -- has provoked backlash in the past. After the New York Times ran photographs of victims of a terrorist attack in Nairobi, Kenya, in January, for example, some critics said the newspaper and other U.S. news outlets wouldn't publish such graphic photos after an attack in the United States or elsewhere in the West.
For many people, the picture of the deceased father and daughter called to mind a photograph taken in 2015 of the lifeless body of a 3-year-old Syrian refugee lying facedown on the beach. The boy, Aylan Kurdi, died in the Mediterranean Sea after the boat carrying him and his family to Greece capsized.
The photo helped draw considerable attention to the humanitarian crisis in Syria and the struggle of refugees seeking to reach Europe. It also sparked record donations to aid groups working on those issues, according to a study that examined the long-term impact of the photo. But those donations quickly fell off.
"The iconic image of a young Syrian child, lying face-down on a beach, woke the world for a brief time, bringing much-needed attention to the war and the plight of its many victims," the study said. "But this empathic response was short-lived."

Texto completo: How do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? Jeremy Egner, television editor for The Times, discussed the tech he's using.
What tech tools are most important for your work as a television editor?
Most important is the one in my title: a television.
Though the pure tonnage of content dictates that I almost always have a new show going -- on my laptop or a second monitor at work, occasionally my iPad or iPhone -- I still vastly prefer watching TV on TVs. Both of the ones I have at home are attached to Apple TV consoles. With its fourth generation, the system and, more important, the touch pad remote finally advanced to the point where I was willing to commit.
I use a USB-enabled Sony ICD-UX560 to record interviews. It's the best recorder I've ever owned. My iPhone and its apps are also indispensable. I use Rev to transcribe interviews and Otter for voice memos when inspiration strikes; it does passable transcription at the same time. I use Shazam to identify songs played in episodes. Percentagewise, I probably do more writing on Evernote on my phone (including this right now!) than anywhere else.
A lot has changed with TV viewing since you joined The Times in 2008. How has your job writing about TV changed over the last decade?
There is so. Much. More.
When I joined The Times, we still aimed to review every new scripted show. With roughly 500 new scripted shows coming out every year now, that's impossible. So the job has become more curatorial as we sift through everything and decide what is worth covering, and help people negotiate the volume.
Some of our most popular features are just straightforward lists of the best things to stream on Netflix in a given month, and we have a twice-weekly newsletter that helps people wade through the plenty. (Sign up here!)
As TV has gotten more ambitious, we've gotten more granular and diverse with our coverage. While we still do traditional features like reviews and actor profiles, we've added things like showrunner interviews, breakdowns of the visual aesthetics of series, video features about the writing process and so on.
And as viewers have sought deeper engagement with shows, so have we. Our weekly recaps, interviews and other coverage last throughout a show's season -- or as long as people still seem to care, in the case of Netflix, since it drops all the episodes at once -- and not just at the beginning, as we used to. We covered the final season of "Game of Thrones" as if it were a six-week-long Super Bowl, though that was an exceptional situation, given the scale of the "Thrones" phenomenon.
You probably have a sweet home entertainment setup. Tell us about it.
It's not that sweet, but it does the job. I have a couple of Samsung LCDs, one in the living room and another in my home office. The living room one is actually a 3-D set, purchased a few years ago when TV makers were trying to make 3-D a thing again. I've watched exactly one thing in 3-D on it. (That said, it was "Gravity," and it was awesome!) That set is attached to a Bose soundbar, and the other to a Yamaha surround system.
I still have cable TV for a variety of reasons, regrettably -- it's expensive, and the customer service is reliably terrible -- but the biggest overall evolution, in general, has been the shift from linear to app-based television. Most of my watching is now done via network apps on Apple TV, including screeners of new series. It has been a long time since I got a DVD in the mail.
The cable goes only in the living room set. I use a Google Wi-Fi mesh system to make sure I can seamlessly watch stuff for work in the office while my wife and daughter watch whatever in the other room.
Your "Game of Thrones" recaps were always among the most-read articles on the Times website. How did you use tech to produce these recaps, since the show had so many story arcs and characters?
I just watched closely and remembered every detail. Actually, that's a lie. I did take lots of notes, and I did remember quite a bit, after watching the entire series all the way through a couple of times. (Thanks, HBO Go!)
But I relied on wikis to remind me who someone like Yohn Royce was when he randomly showed up in the series finale. The main tool I used was my MacBook Air, which I frenetically clacked away on throughout each episode -- my wife loved watching with me -- and then deep into the night, as I churned out each recap.
Outside of work, what tech product are you currently obsessed with?
This is the part where I admit that I'm, if not exactly a Luddite, somewhat gadget averse. I like to keep life as uncluttered as possible. Honestly, my favorite tech product right now is probably my Instant Pot. It makes exquisite yogurt!

N.R.A. Shuts Down Production of NRATV as Its No. 2 Official Resigns

Texto completo: Moving to clean house amid an organizational crisis, the National Rifle Association cut ties with its second-in-command, Christopher W. Cox; severed its relationship with Ackerman McQueen, its estranged advertising firm; and shut down live production at its online media arm, NRATV.
The steps took place within a brief span on Tuesday night and Wednesday morning.
The resignation of Mr. Cox, the gun group's top lobbyist and the architect of its legislative strategy, was communicated to the N.R.A.'s board and employees on Wednesday. The news comes days after a court filing by the N.R.A. implicated him in a failed plot to oust Wayne LaPierre, the organization's chief executive, an allegation Mr. Cox has disputed. Last week, The New York Times reported that the N.R.A. had suspended Mr. Cox.
Mr. LaPierre, in a message sent Wednesday to employees and board members, said he had accepted Mr. Cox's resignation and wanted "to thank Chris for his service to the N.R.A. and for his efforts to advocate for the Second Amendment." He noted that Mr. Cox had been "placed on administrative leave" pending an investigation into the claims against him, and said, "Naturally, that pursuit will continue in the interest of the N.R.A. and our members."
The development is the latest in an already tumultuous year for the N.R.A. The gun group has struggled to right its finances; faced investigations in Congress and by the New York attorney general; and witnessed a leadership struggle that pitted Oliver North, until recently the N.R.A.'s president, against Mr. LaPierre.
Mr. Cox could not be immediately reached for comment. In a statement last week, he said that "the allegations against me are offensive and patently false. For over 24 years I have been a loyal and effective leader in this organization. My efforts have always been focused on serving the members of the National Rifle Association, and I will continue to focus all of my energy on carrying out our core mission of defending the Second Amendment."
The series of moves leaves the N.R.A., a crucial ally of President Trump, in flux, particularly in the leadership of its legislative agenda. On Twitter in April, Mr. Trump urged the N.R.A. to "stop the internal fighting, & get back to GREATNESS -- FAST!" Mr. LaPierre told the board and employees he would soon name an interim leader for the organization's lobbying arm.
By ending production at NRATV, the N.R.A. is also ceasing its relationship with a number of high-profile representatives of the organization, since its on-air personalities -- Ackerman employees including Dana Loesch -- will no longer be the public faces of the N.R.A. It remained unclear whether the N.R.A. would try to hire some of those employees, but there was no indication it was negotiating to do so.
The move comes amid a flurry of lawsuits between the N.R.A. and Ackerman, and increasing acrimony that surfaced after two prominent N.R.A. board members first criticized NRATV in an article in The Times in March. The separation had become inevitable: The two sides said last month that they were ending their partnership of more than three decades.
"Many members expressed concern about the messaging on NRATV becoming too far removed from our core mission: defending the Second Amendment," Mr. LaPierre wrote in a message to members on Wednesday. "So, after careful consideration, I am announcing that starting today, we are undergoing a significant change in our communications strategy. We are no longer airing 'live TV' programming."
In a notice to Ackerman's chief executive, Revan McQueen, sent Tuesday night, the N.R.A. said it "regrets that a longstanding, formerly productive relationship comes to an end in this fashion."
Ackerman, in its own statement, said it was "not surprised that the N.R.A. is unwilling to honor its agreement to end our contract and our longstanding relationship in an orderly and amicable manner."
"When given the opportunity to do the right thing, the N.R.A. once again has taken action that we believe is intended to harm our company even at the expense of the N.R.A. itself," Ackerman added. It said it would "continue to fight against the N.R.A.'s repeated violations of its agreement with our company with every legal remedy available to us."
A legal filing last week by Ackerman, which is based in Oklahoma City, underscored the dire risk to its business, which derived 41 percent of its gross revenue from the N.R.A. last year. The company accused the N.R.A. of failing to pay $ 1.6 million in invoices and to post a $ 3 million letter of credit that it said it was due, moves that Ackerman said would force it to "terminate or put on unpaid leave" roughly 40 percent of its work force within days, and shutter Mercury Group, its Northern Virginia subsidiary.
On Wednesday, a judge in Virginia denied a motion by Ackerman to immediately force the N.R.A. to make those payments.
N.R.A. officials had grown leery of the cost of creating so much live content for NRATV, which was started in 2016, and wondered whether the return on its investment was worth the effort. The site's web traffic was minuscule, with 49,000 unique visitors in January, according to a report provided by Comscore.
Some N.R.A. board members and officials were also unnerved by the breadth of the channel's content, which strayed far beyond gun rights and encompassed several right-wing talking points, including criticism of immigration and broadsides against the F.B.I. A show hosted by Ms. Loesch that put Ku Klux Klan hoods on talking trains from the popular children's program "Thomas & Friends" drew outrage from some within the organization.
But the dispute between the N.R.A. and Ackerman goes deeper than NRATV. It has its origins in threats last summer by Letitia James, now the New York attorney general, to investigate the N.R.A.'s tax-exempt status. The N.R.A. began an audit of its contractors, and has said that Ackerman, which it paid roughly $ 40 million a year, refused to comply. Ackerman has disputed that allegation.
The advertising firm has assailed the role of the N.R.A.'s outside lawyer, William A. Brewer III, over the size of his legal fees, and has seen him as its chief antagonist. The contention has a bitter family twist because Mr. Brewer is the brother-in-law of Mr. McQueen, Ackerman's chief executive.
The schism between the organizations has been shocking. They had a closely intertwined partnership going back to the "I'm the N.R.A." campaign in the 1980s, and Ackerman came to be known as the voice of the N.R.A.
But by Tuesday night, splitting up was seen as inevitable.
"This is just an affirmation of what we've known is going to happen," Joel Friedman, an N.R.A. board member, said in an interview.

Marcus Smart, now something of an elder statesman for the Celtics, is eager to help reboot the franchise

Texto completo: WALTHAM — The Celtics' roster has undergone multiple facelifts in recent years, but amid all the trading, signing, drafting, and reshuffling, Marcus Smart has remained the one constant. And while free agency will not open until Sunday evening, Smart has been around long enough to understand that big alterations could be coming once again.
“I expected things to change [this summer]," Smart said during a break at his annual kids basketball camp at Brandeis on Tuesday. “I wasn't expecting big or little, I just knew something was going to change. I think everyone kind of knew that. Now, what that is, we have no clue. Like I said, you can't really focus on that. You have to let the guys whose jobs it is to focus on that. You focus on what you can."
Smart, like everyone else, has seen the reports that Kyrie Irving and Al Horford are likely to sign elsewhere this summer. He said he has spoken to Irving since the season ended in May, but only about his family, not his basketball future. He was asked Tuesday whether it surprised him to hear that there is a good chance both players will be leaving the Celtics.
“A little bit, it did," he said. “But, those guys are grown and they have every right to do what they feel is best for not only them and their families and their careers. Regardless of if those guys stay or leave, I have nothing but love for them. Always will. I wish nothing but the best luck for them, whatever they do."
There was a good chance that if the Celtics had acquired Anthony Davis from the Pelicans earlier this month, Smart would have been sent to New Orleans. But Davis is a Laker now, of course, and some of the frustration caused by Boston's failure to land Davis was tempered by the fact that Smart is now back.
There will be more clarity in the coming weeks, but Smart does not yet know what the roster will look like. For that matter, neither do the Celtics. But Smart is eager to help reboot the franchise.
“I'm excited," he said. “We're excited. As competitors, you have a season like we did last year and it leaves a funny taste in your mouth. We use that as our motivation and to keep going. We're very excited. Whatever team or whatever people or whoever is on the board or whoever is on this roster with us, we're excited to have them to go out there and fight."
The Celtics drafted four players last Thursday, and Smart called them “great pickups" and thinks they will be able to help the team next season. Even though Smart is still just 25 years old, he is now something of an elder statesman on this team. Of the players under contract for next season, only Gordon Hayward is older.
“I see my role as bigger than ever now," Smart said. “Just because, once again, being that longest-tenured Celtic, going into my sixth season and really understanding Brad [Stevens] and this organization, and the system that he likes to run, and just, that's who I am. And I've got to be that times 10 now, because we are going through some things. We did have a bad year. We've just got to keep everybody on the same track."
There will be reinforcements coming in some form, however. The New York Times reported on Tuesday that the Celtics could pursue the All-Star free agent point guard Kemba Walker. Even if they do not, they could create about $35 million in salary cap space to find some more help for Smart and this young core. Smart said he had not been asked to provide any free agency assistance just yet.
“Just letting the front office, people who run those situations, take care of it," he said. “Whatever I have to do on my part to help this team, if that is get involved in the recruiting process [I will]."
It may seem that given these imminent and high-profile departures, the Celtics are essentially resetting. But Smart views the situation through a different prism.
“The thing is, the Raptors just won the championship, right?" he said. “But they've got to start back over from the beginning just like we do. So we all start back over at the starting line, we all start at zero, and we all get a chance to do it.
“So everybody's starting over, regardless if they have the same team or not, they've all got to start from the beginning. That's how we take it. We take it as we come in, and we have an opportunity to do something special."

Texto completo: A Salisbury-based poultry company has been unexpectedly thrown in the middle of a celebrity spat between pop stars Nicki Minaj and Miley Cyrus.
In a new episode of her "Queen Radio" show Friday, Minaj dismissed her fellow music star as a "Perdue chicken" as part of a back-and-forth feud that goes back to 2015.
"Perdue chickens can never talk (expletive) about queens," Minaj says, referring to herself as royalty. "But I do notice a lot of Perdue chickens have been trying to say the queen's name for clout. And that's always been happening. And that's what (Cyrus) did in the first place. And the white girl cry and made the black girl seem like she was a bad guy... She disrespected me in a magazine article for no reason."
In the process, Minaj also threw a crude accusation at Cyrus.
On Saturday, Perdue, a primary producer of chicken headquartered on Maryland's Eastern Shore, tweeted at Minaj in a tongue-in-cheek manner about the mention.
"Thanks for the mention @NICKIMINAJ, but we don't know nothing about beef," Perdue tweeted out.
Minaj retweeted the posted with the "crying laughing" emoji.
Minaj's slam comes a few weeks after fans questioned whether Cyrus was throwing shade in her new song "Cattitude," with the lyric: "I love you Nicki, but I listen to Cardi." (Minaj and rap rival Cardi B got into an infamous brawl at a New York Fashion Week party in September.)
Cyrus clarified the lyrics on Roman Kemp's Capital Breakfast radio show, saying there is no beef anymore, according to complex.com.
"They're both queens. And anytime you want to feel powerful and strong, that's my go-to: Cardi and Nicki," Cyrus said on the radio show, according to People.com.
Nevertheless, fans looked back to the start of the beef between Cyrus and Minaj in 2015, which opened with Cyrus taking Taylor Swift's side vs. Minaj in a New York Times interview, according to billboard.com.
Minaj responded tartly in person days later at the VMA Awards, saying host Cyrus "had a lot to say about me the other day in the press. Miley, what's good?"
Nicki Minaj dismissed her rival as a "Perdue chicken" on her "Queen Radio" show.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – Controversy has swirled around the Trump administration's treatment of migrants in detention, following Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's accusation that the Trump administration was running "concentration camps" on the border.
Alex Azar, who runs the Department of Health and Human Services, the federal agency that oversees the care of unaccompanied migrant children after they are released from Border Patrol, discussed the issue on Fox News' "Outnumbered Overtime" on Monday afternoon, saying that the way migrant detention had been discussed was "outrageous. "
"Well, I think some of this verbiage is just really outrageous. We've got professional men and women at the Department of Homeland Security here doing their best to try to deal with a catastrophic border crisis, " Azar said, referring to criticism of migrant detention centers.
Though, he acknowledged earlier in the interview, "these are not good conditions for kids to be in. "

Azar, added, however, that his department was attempting to provide a "safe, secure environment" for migrant children.
"Now, the Department of Health and Human Services, what I actually run, we are providing shelter for these kids. These kids are in a safe, secure environment. They've got – they get three square meals a day. They get two – they get two snacks. They're getting education services. They get recreation when we get funding from Congress when we're actually funded. We're paying $220 to $1,200 a day per kid. So these kids are in a – are in good, safe, healthy environments.
Azar was responding to recent reports about conditions in migrant detention facilities. The New York Times and the Associated Press had reported on squalid conditions at a migrant detention facility near El Paso, Texas after a legal team visited the facility and interviewed over 60 children.
“In my 22 years of doing visits with children in detention, I have never heard of this level of inhumanity,” said Holly Cooper, who co-directs the University of California, Davis’ Immigration Law Clinic and represents detained youth, to the Associated Press.
On Monday afternoon, the Associated Press reported that most of the children had been moved out of the facility.

The Gazelle of San Quentin

Texto completo: Headnote COVER STORY
Seven years into a life sentence, Markelle Taylor was 36 and realized continued survival at San Quentin State Prison would require some spiritual help.
"Prison can be too much to bear," Taylor said, describing a desperate place that fosters fear and loathing over self-reflection and rehabilitation. "I didn't have a lot of hope."
Parole wasn't an option for at least 15 years on his second-degree murder conviction. And meeting a sympathetic parole board could take many more years. Taylor's friend took his own life after being denied release four times.
"When you don't have the strength to hang in there, you can either act out and hurt others or kill yourself," Taylor said. "Finding a spiritual purpose for my life is what saved me."
Taylor became one of Jehovah's Witnesses in 2009. But the religious conversion alone wasn't enough to deal with the daily trauma of prison.
"Even with the spiritual assistance, I was still stressing," he said. "I didn't want to end up like my friend."
A member of Taylor's Bible group suggested some physical activity could supplement his scriptural studies and clear his mind. Taylor joined the 1,000 Mile Club, a running program led by volunteer coaches from the outside. Inmates train on a makeshift, quarter-mile track that circles the prison yard.
"Once I started running, it relieved a lot of stress. I felt more mentally balanced. I was able to make better decisions," Taylor said. "I felt free."
THE GAZELLE OF SAN QUENTIN
Taylor admits he isn't the best Bible student, though he tries. But running is a natural talent that had been dormant since his time on the track team at San Mateo High School in the early 1990s.
Taylor was able run 105 non-stop loops around the prison track - or 26.2 miles, the equivalent of a marathon.
"The guys are all over the map ability-wise," said lead coach Frank Ruona, who trains up to 50 inmates at a time. "But Markelle is the exception."
By age 46, Taylor had run four prison marathons. He was dubbed "the Gazelle of San Quentin."
The national media noticed when Taylor ran fast enough in the prison yard to qualify for the Boston Marathon - a feat for elite runners. A profile in GQ magazine led to articles in USA Today and and a New York Times interview. Now, a documentary film featuring Taylor is being made called "26.2 to Life: The San Quentin Prison Marathon."
Director Christine Yoo thought she was done filming when Taylor was unexpectedly granted parole after 17 years. He was released in March, six weeks before the Boston Marathon. Taylor's first act as a free man was to travel from his transitional housing in San Francisco to cross the finish line in Boston. Yoo was able to capture the moment for her film.
"This was too amazing not to happen," Yoo said. "Making the film was full of surprises. I had no vision of what rehabilitation looked like when I started. But I learned a lot from guys like Markelle who decided to become better people and not let prison be the place that teaches them how to be better criminals."
RESTORATIVE JUSTICE
When Frank Ruona started coaching the San Quentin running club in 2005, he had run 78 marathons. He was an expert in running but knew little about prisons or criminal justice reform.
"At first, I just saw the group as inmates," Ruona said. "Then I saw them as people trying to improve themselves. They seemed like really good guys and I'd shake my head, thinking, 'How in the hell did you end up in here?' Now I can appreciate why the war on drugs didn't make sense."
Ruona, 73, became more than a running coach. He also fills the role of father figure, psychologist and diplomat for team members confronting their complex life histories for the first time. The club meets for 90-minute workouts and they spend the first half hour talking. Mostly, Ruona listens.
"These guys made big mistakes and they're in the process of examining their lives and what they did to become incarcerated," Ruona said.
For Taylor, it was assaulting his pregnant girlfriend, which led to the premature birth and eventual death of the child.
"I'm not my crime," Taylor said. "I love myself today and I didn't back then, which is why I damaged other people. I can't change the past. But I held myself accountable and took responsibility."
Ruona said running is just "one piece of the puzzle" when it comes to rehabilitation.
Many of Ruona's runners have completed their GED or a college degree. Then there's the two-year restorative justice curriculum that teaches accountability and responsibility. Three runners are currently enrolled in it.
Jim Maloney is a restorative justice facilitator who also volunteers as one of Ruona's assistant coaches.
"There is a parallel to running and the deep work needed to connect the dots to explain your criminal behavior, heal and transform," said Maloney, who has run six marathons. "You have to run your own race. And you need to press through when it gets uncomfortable."
Maloney noted that California's recidivism rate is 64 percent within three years. Yet the graduates of his rehabilitation program return to prison only two percent of the time.
"Some people need a time out in prison, but a lot of people are in prison for much longer than they should be," Maloney said. "These programs offer a different narrative and a blueprint for another way."
KEEPING THE FAITH
Four months into his freedom, Taylor is planning to run the San Francisco Marathon in July and the California International Marathon in December. He has already qualified for next year's Boston Marathon with an impressive time of three hours, three minutes and 52 seconds. But Taylor's goal is to run his upcoming races in less than three hours.
He must also handle the pressures of completing classes required by parole, not to mention the popularity a documentary film will bring. He hopes the faith he found in San Quentin will keep him grounded.
"I pray to Jehovah every day," Taylor said. "I'm following God's principles the best I can and that's keeping me out of trouble. God gave me the ability to run and I can talk to Him through my running. They go hand-in-hand."

Marc Thiessen: Biden’s problem with Democrats is that he doesn’t hate Republicans

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — Let’s get this straight: Joe Biden is leading in the polls for the Democratic presidential nomination because he’s the most “electable” candidate in the Democratic field? A guy who doesn’t realize that I worked with segregationists isn’t a winning message with Democrats in 2020?
<img class="size-medium wp-image-2657222" src="https://i0.wp.com/multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2019/02/Marc-Thiessen-color-2018.jpg?resize=300%2C235&ssl=1" alt="" width="300" height="235" data-recalc-dims="1" />
This is what you get when you turn to a candidate who has been in Washington for 46 years. Biden was first elected to the Senate in 1972, when the Democratic Party was very different than it is today. As a freshman senator, he had to get along with the senior leadership of his party — which included segregationists James Eastland of Mississippi and Herman Talmadge of Georgia.
You may be thinking: Who in the world are James Eastland and Herman Talmadge? You’re not alone. Ninety-nine-point-nine percent of living Americans had either forgotten their names or never heard of them in the first place, until Biden decided to dredge them up from the fever swamps of the Democratic Party’s sordid racial past.
Why, you ask, would he do such a thing? Because that’s what Joe Biden does. He is a walking, talking gaffe machine. His point didn’t even make sense. He was trying to argue that he can work across the aisle with people with whom he fundamentally disagrees. But Eastland and Talmadge sat on the same side of the aisle as Biden in the Senate; they were Democrats.
So now his younger, less popular Democratic opponents are pouncing on Biden’s mistake. California Sen. Kamala Harris (averaging 7.1% in the polls) declared that for Biden “to coddle the reputations of segregationists, of people who if they had their way I would literally not be standing here as a member of the United States Senate, is, I think, it’s just misinformed and it’s wrong.” New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker (2.3%) declared, “Vice President Biden’s relationships with proud segregationists are not the model for how we make America a safer and more inclusive place for black people, and for everyone.” New York Mayor Bill de Blasio (0.3%) tweeted, “It’s 2019 & @JoeBiden is longing for the good old days of ‘civility’ typified by James Eastland. Eastland thought my multiracial family should be illegal.”
Give me a break. No reasonable person thinks that Biden was defending or even sympathetic to segregation. What Biden was trying to do — in his own, Bideny way — was to defend not segregation but civility and compromise. But sadly, in today’s Democratic Party, those ideas are just as controversial.
Recall that in February, Biden was forced to apologize for declaring — brace yourself — that Vice President Pence was a “decent guy.” Then, a few months later, Biden had to backtrack on his effort to craft a middle-ground approach to climate change that would be embraced by both environmentalists and blue-collar voters. After Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., thundered, “There is no ‘middle ground’ when it comes to climate policy,” Biden soon embraced the Green New Deal.
And this month, Biden was forced to flip-flop and abandon his four-decade-long support for the Hyde amendment — bipartisan legislation that bars public funding for abortions — after his Democratic opponents attacked him for reaffirming what he once proudly called his “middle-of-the-road” policy on abortion. Biden has also been forced to apologize for his support for the bipartisan 1994 crime bill, which was signed into law by Democrat Bill Clinton but which Democrats now blame for the mass incarceration of African Americans. “I haven’t always been right” on criminal justice, he declared earlier this year.
In today’s Democratic Party, “compromise” and “consensus” are dirty words. Biden’s problem is not that he is a closet racist; it’s that he does not hate Republicans and other political opponents. As he put it on Tuesday, “Today, you look at the other side and you’re the enemy. Not the opposition, the enemy. We don’t talk to each other anymore.” That is the point he was trying to make in his ham-handed way. And that is what his Democratic opponents are really upset about.
In a January speech, Biden said, “I read in The New York Times today that one of my problems if I were to run for president, I like Republicans. Okay, well, bless me, Father, for I have sinned.” Apparently, for many on the left, that sin is unforgivable.

Texto completo: Not getting into Harvard is not the end of Kyle Kashuv's life.
Kashuv is the Parkland, Florida, school shooting survivor who was admitted to Harvard University. His offer was revoked after leaked documents showed him using anti-Semitic and racist slurs, including the N-word, and saying all Jewish people should be killed, in texts, Skype conversations and Google documents when he was 16.
He apologized to the admissions dean, William Fitzsimmons. He distanced himself from the language. "I see the world through different eyes and am embarrassed by the petty, flippant kid represented in those screenshots," he wrote in an apology, which he posted on Twitter.
When Harvard rescinded his admission anyway, many people were outraged, arguing that youthful mistakes shouldn't follow us into adulthood. In The Washington Examiner, Tom Rogan says the decision "illustrates Harvard's intellectual rot." In The New York Times, David Brooks says Harvard's decision reflects "a misunderstanding of how moral character develops."
"In a sin-drenched world it's precisely through the sins and the ensuing repentance that moral formation happens," Brooks writes. "That's why we try not to judge people by what they did in their worst moment, but rather by how they respond to their worst moment. That's why we are forgiving of 16-year-olds, because they haven't disgraced themselves enough to have earned maturity."
Here is where I hope we can pause and have an honest discussion. We live in a country where young people of color are threatened with death, or killed, for their mistakes, even perceived mistakes.
Maybe you saw the video this month of Phoenix police officers drawing their guns on a family whose 4-year-old daughter allegedly took a doll from a Family Dollar Store.
You probably know the story of Trayvon Martin, the unarmed 17-year-old who was fatally shot in Florida by neighborhood watch captain George Zimmerman. Whispers of Martin's past indiscretions -- he skipped school, he had a trace amount of THC, the chemical linked to pot, in his system -- started to circulate, as if his death would be justified had he made a few mistakes. "Trayvon was the victim in this case," his father, Tracy Martin, said to NPR. "They tried to make him the villain in this case."
Maybe you remember Brennan Walker, the 14-year-old black boy from Michigan who was chased and shot at by a man whose door he knocked on, asking for directions. Brennan's mistake? He overslept and missed his school bus, and he didn't know his way to school.
By now you know the story of Laquan McDonald, 17, shot 16 times and killed while walking away from Chicago police after failing to respond to their commands.
Kashuv will likely grow into a successful, productive, thoughtful adult. Even without a Harvard education. I hope, for his sake and ours, he does. The world doesn't need another person whose intellectual and moral maturity peaked in high school.
But if we're going to use his life as a conversation starter, if we're going to talk about forgiving children for their youthful indiscretions, about allowing moral formation to happen, about leaving space and time for maturity to develop, we need to talk about the role that race plays in our collective willingness to offer that grace. We need to include Trayvon Martin in those conversations. We need to include Laquan McDonald in those conversations. We need to include Brennan Walker in those conversations.
Otherwise they're disingenuous. Otherwise the outrage is lopsided and riddled with blind spots. And that gets us nowhere.

Amid a measles outbreak that's revived concerns about parents who fail to immunize their children, the New York Times mined a little-known database that offers insight into the safety of the shots. Over roughly the past dozen years in the United States, the newspaper reported, people received 126 million doses of the vaccine against measles, and just 284 people filed claims of harm with the federal government. About half were dismissed, and 143 were compensated through the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program. Measles once infected millions of children and killed 400 to 500 people per year.

Texto completo: In June 1969, the police raided the Stonewall Inn, a gay bar in Greenwich Village, as they had done before. This time, though, the patrons pushed back. As the anniversary of that uprising approached, The New York Times asked people who were there -- and many who grew up in the years since -- to share their life experiences, reflect on the episode's impact on the global L.G.B.T.Q. community and to look to the promises and challenges of the future. We begin with a playwright, an author and a poet.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration said on Saturday that it hoped to raise more than $ 50 billion to improve the lot of the Palestinians and their Arab neighbors, releasing an economic plan titled, "Peace to Prosperity," that reverses the actual sequence of its peacemaking efforts in the Middle East.
The blueprint sets the stage for a two-day economic workshop next week to be convened by the White House in the Persian Gulf state of Bahrain. That gathering is meant to lay the groundwork for a subsequent diplomatic proposal to end decades of conflict between Israel and the Palestinians.
But the political component of the plan has been repeatedly delayed, most recently by the call for new elections in Israel after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu failed to assemble a governing coalition. Some experts question whether President Trump will ever put a peace proposal on the table, given the Palestinians' vow to reject his efforts and his looming re-election campaign in the United States.
The 38-page plan sets ambitious goals, like doubling the amount of drinkable water in the Palestinian territories and nearly tripling exports as a percentage of the Palestinian economy. With slick graphics and the promotional tone of a real estate prospectus, the plan envisions a variety of funding sources, like grants and private equity.
But there are no concrete dollar commitments from the United States; the bulk of the money is to come from countries in the Persian Gulf. It was not clear how the United States planned to entice these governments or private investors to ante up so much capital without confronting thorny issues like the aspiration of the Palestinian people for their own state or the political status of Jerusalem.
The Palestinians swiftly rejected the plan, as they had for all of Mr. Trump's peacemaking efforts since he announced in 2017 that he was recognizing Jerusalem as the Israeli capital.
"First lift the siege of Gaza, stop the Israeli theft of our land, resources and funds, give us our freedom of movement and control over our borders, airspace, territorial waters etc.," Hanan Ashrawi, a senior Palestinian negotiator, declared on Twitter. "Then watch us build a vibrant prosperous economy as a free and sovereign people."
Israeli officials reacted more mildly, with some noting that the plan seemed calculated to turn the Palestinians against their entrenched leaders. The officials expressed skepticism that the Arab countries would foot the bill and noted that the plan sidestepped the difficult political issues.
Yair Lapid, a former finance minister of Israel, described the report as a "very serious document which there is no reason to oppose, especially as it does not say a word about the foolish notion of annexation, which will lead to a binational state that will put an end to the Jewish state."
During his recent campaign, Mr. Netanyahu raised the prospect of Israel annexing some Jewish settlements in the West Bank, a proposal that contradicted decades of American policy toward the Middle East but is viewed sympathetically by at least some members of the Trump administration.
The American ambassador to Israel, David M. Friedman, said in a recent interview with The New York Times that, "Under certain circumstances, I think Israel has the right to retain some, but unlikely all, of the West Bank."
Mr. Friedman is one of three officials -- along with Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser, and Jason D. Greenblatt, his special envoy to the Middle East -- who have spearheaded the effort to broker a peace accord.
The economic plan bears the imprint of Mr. Kushner, the scion of a real-estate family. He has tended to view the peacemaking process through an economic prism, speaking often of how the Palestinian people can improve their fortunes if they find a way to coexist peacefully with their Israeli neighbors.
"I laugh when they attack this as the 'deal of the century,' " Mr. Kushner said in an interview with Reuters, referring to the lofty nickname that Mr. Trump's peace plan has assumed over the last two years. "This is going to be the 'opportunity of the century' if they have the courage to pursue it."
The White House provided Reuters with an advance copy of the plan.
The blueprint contains ambitious proposals to transform the Palestinian economy, like a transportation corridor that would link the West Bank with the Palestinian enclave of Gaza. It would earmark up to $ 900 million for new cargo terminals and other facilities to make border crossings more efficient.
But other elements seem more far-fetched. It talks about turning the West Bank and Gaza into tourism destinations, not taking into account the continual threat of violence from clashes between Israeli security forces and militants.
And other proposals seem at odds with the administration's recent actions. The report calls for up to $ 900 million to build hospitals and clinics in the Palestinian territories. But the United States last year cut $ 25 million in aid to six hospitals in East Jerusalem that serve Palestinians.
More than half of the $ 50 billion would be allocated to the Palestinians; the rest would go to Egypt, Lebanon and Jordan. That is calculated to build support among other Arab donors, but the Gulf countries have been noncommittal, and their record of investment is not encouraging.
Even the Bahrain conference is convening under a shadow because of growing tensions between Iran and the United States. On Thursday night, Mr. Trump ordered, and then canceled, a strike on Iranian targets with missiles to retaliate after Iran shot down an American surveillance drone.
Still, former diplomats said that the bigger hurdle to the plan was the lack of hope for a genuine breakthrough between the Israelis and the Palestinians.
"It's the kind of highly stylized detailed and glossy presentation that a commercial real-estate entrepreneur might make to potential investors," said Aaron David Miller, a diplomat who negotiated between the two sides. "If it led with a serious and balanced effort to address Palestinian national aspirations, it might even get a serious hearing and investors."

Texto completo: Someone recently gave me a book of photos taken on the Lower East Side of Manhattan in the 1890s. The conditions were horrible: homeless, malnourished children sleeping in a clump, barefoot in a doorway. There was a block, on Bayard Street, with 39 tenement houses, and 2,781 people squeezed into them. There were only 264 toilets on that entire block and no showers or baths. There were 441 rooms on that block with no ventilation, where people lived in the shadows, catching tuberculosis and diphtheria.
My grandfather, Bernard Levy, grew up there, off Bayard Street, a few years later. He went to a public high school and a public college and rose to become a lawyer. He spent his evenings writing letters to the editor that he hoped would be printed in The New York Times. He didn't live to see me get a job here, but I am living out his dream. Our family life, from the Lower East Side upward, is a social mobility miracle.
When you grow up with this background, you have a deep sense of the goodness and purpose of America. America is the land of milk and honey. Lincoln could go from a log cabin to the White House. A Jewish boy from the Bronx named Ralph Lifshitz could grow up to become Ralph Lauren and redefine American preppy. You could be born on the fringes and assimilate into this new thing called an American.
I used to think we could revive that story for the 21st century, but we probably can't. Too many people feel left out of it. Plus, there is no longer a single American mainstream to serve as the structural spine of the nation. Mainline Protestantism is no longer the dominant religion and cultural force. The WASP establishment no longer rules the roost. There is no white majority in our kindergartens, and soon there will be no white majority in our society.
The big three TV networks no longer dominate the culture the way they did. There is no one dominant musical genre. The national ruling class has lost legitimacy. Social trust is strongest at the local levels, which grow more polarized from one another. Politically, we're in an age of extremes.
The reality and challenge is that America has become radically pluralistic. We used to be unipolar - one dominant majority culture and a lot of minority groups that defined themselves against it. Now we're multipolar. We're all minorities now.
That could blow us to smithereens. But who knows? We could learn to be minorities together, to be what Rabbi Jonathan Sacks calls creative minorities. In a brilliant 2013 lecture, Sacks noted that when Solomon's temple was destroyed and the Jews were cast into exile, the prophet Jeremiah had a surprising message: Go to new lands. Build houses. Plant gardens. Seek the peace and prosperity of the cities in which you settle.
Jeremiah was saying you don't need to assimilate into the new place. Nor do you need to withdraw into a culturally pure enclave. Instead, don't be afraid to be a distinct, orthodox version of yourself within a larger society. Build a rich moral community. Just don't try to universalize your faith or even become a dominant minority. Interact with the world around you, confident in your own particularity, but realize that every time you seek to dominate others, you will wind up dominated.
This stance - aggressive interaction without an attempt to be hegemonic - made the Jews creative in three ways, Sacks argues.
First, the encounter with other cultures led to great flowerings of Jewish thought. Jews wrestled with the best ideas they encountered from outside. Second, Jews were often bridges between different civilizations. Through trade, they linked China and the West during the Middle Ages. Third, Jews emerged from their secure base and made great contributions to the wider world: Spinoza, Freud, Einstein, etc.
In a world of radical pluralism, we are all Jews. We have no choice but to build a mass multicultural democracy, a society that has no dominant center but is a collection of creative minorities.
Nearly 200 years ago, Tocqueville wrote that democracy was creating a new sort of man. Pluralism today is creating a new sort of person, especially among the young. They don't just relish diversity; they embody it. Many have mixed roots - say, half-French/half-Dominican. Many are border stalkers; they live between cultures, switch back and forth, and work hard to build a multiplicity of influences into a single coherent life. They're Whitmanesque, containing multitudes, holding opposite ideas in their minds at the same time.
Radical pluralism also necessitates retelling the nation's history. We've always been a universal nation, a crossroads nation, a nation whose very identity is defined by the fact that it is a hub for a dense network of minorities and subgroups, and the distinct way of life they fashion to interact and flourish together.
I used to think that America had to find a new unifying national narrative. Now I wonder if not having a single national narrative will become our national narrative.

The 10% bonus that Trump needs

Texto completo: True, polls have very limited value at this stage of a presidential campaign. Yes, Democrats are far from choosing their nominee to oppose President Donald Trump. Of course, a great deal can change between now and Election Day.
Or maybe not.
Since Trump’s victory, the political balance has remained remarkably stable, and that’s both good and bad news for a president who formally launched his re-election campaign this week with a raucous rally in Florida.
On the plus side for Trump, his base shows no signs of cracking. When the president mused on Twitter recently that his supporters "would demand" he stay in office after eight years — a totally unconstitutional idea — he was accurately reflecting their unswerving devotion. "To too many people, he’s not a human being. He’s a demigod," said conservative radio host Michael Savage to The New York Times.
But the downside of this frozen landscape is equally obvious. Trump’s core base of support hovers between 35% and 37% of the electorate, and despite their fervid loyalty, that base is simply not large enough to guarantee him a second term. Trump won 46.4% of the vote in 2016, and he needs at least a 10% margin above and beyond his base — call it the 10% bonus — to have a realistic chance at a second term.
Recent polls clearly reveal the president’s peril. Two surveys in Michigan, one of three states that gave Trump his margin of victory in 2016, show Trump trailing former Vice President Joe Biden by double digits. In Pennsylvania, a Quinnipiac poll had Biden beating Trump by 11 points. A national survey conducted by Fox News put Biden ahead by a similar margin.
"Mr. Trump has never expanded his support beyond the people who elected him — and never really tried," writes Peter Baker in the Times. "He has remained focused intently on retaining the support of his base to the exclusion of reaching out to those who have opposed him."
A careful reading of survey data supports this analysis. An average of all national polls puts Trump’s favorable rating at 43.3%. As Baker points out, "He is the only president in the history of polling who has never once, not for a single day, earned the support of a majority of Americans surveyed by Gallup."
Trump’s real base is actually even smaller. In 2016, only 38% of voters told exit polls he was qualified to be president, 35% said he had the proper temperament, and 33% described him as honest and trustworthy. Those responses average out to 35.3% — the loyalists who truly believe in him.
In the latest NBC/Wall Street Journal poll, which asks voters to rate their feelings about public figures, 23% said they were "enthusiastic" about Trump, and 14% called themselves "comfortable" with the president. The two answers come to 37%, almost exactly the same number that strongly supported Trump more than 31 months ago.
The president enters the race with many strengths. The unemployment rate of 3.6% in May was the lowest in 50 years, and in the latest CNN poll, 56% approved of his economic policies, a new high. Trump, who never really stopped campaigning, enjoys a huge lead over the Democrats in building a national organization and raising money.
Democrats seem to be lurching leftward on issues like abortion and impeachment, and while those policies are highly popular in liberal coastal enclaves, they could pose a real danger to the national ticket in more moderate precincts of the Midwest.
Above all, the Democrats are far from producing a candidate who can generate the sort of energy and excitement that powered the campaigns of Barack Obama and Bill Clinton, the only successful Democrats in more than 40 years. In the NBC/Wall Street Journal poll, only 13% describe themselves as "enthusiastic" about Biden, a clear warning that the leading Democrat has some serious flaws.
For all the turmoil generated by the Trump presidency, not much has changed politically since his election. His base remains just about the same. He won in 2016 because about 1 in 10 voters who were not part of that base, and who had serious doubts about his character and qualifications, disliked Hillary Clinton enough to vote for him anyway.
Can Trump win over that 10% again? The election could well hinge on the answer.

Texto completo: If you want to keep a secret from the general public, a blog post about accelerating gender parity in globalization is probably a good place to hide it. Even a nerd like me recognizes that it can be hard to turn a new analysis of gender data into clickbait.
I'm going to try anyway, though, because in a blog post this week, the World Economic Forum released a new projection that demands our attention.
Based on data from its widely-respected Global Gender Gap Index, WEF estimates that it will take the United States another 208 years to reach gender equality. You read that right. At the current pace of change, gender equality won't arrive in the U.S. until the year 2227.
Underneath triumphant headlines about women running for office in record numbers, changing the face of Congress and breaking glass ceilings are trend lines that tell a much more somber story about the pace of progress for women in our country.
Although women now earn college and graduate degrees at higher rates than men, they remain concentrated in certain majors and, early in their careers, they are often channeled into less lucrative jobs. Men are 70% more likely to be executives than women their same age. In 2018, there were more Fortune 500 CEOs named James than there were women.
On the political front, women are 51% of the U.S. population, but hold only 24% of seats in Congress. And unlike 59 other countries – including India, Israel, Liberia, Slovakia, Mali, and Malawi – the U.S. has yet to have a female head of state.
WEF's projection also reflects the grim reality that the U.S. is the only industrialized nation where maternal mortality rates are actually getting worse. The risks are especially high for African American women, who are three to four times more likely to die during or after delivery than white women.
While 208 is a damning, daunting number, it is not destiny. The projection is based on the assumption that the rate of change will remain constant. If we can accelerate the pace of progress, that number will start to go down. And therein lies our call to action.
I know from experience that a startling statistic can be an animating force. About 25 years ago, Bill and I learned from a New York Times article that in developing countries, hundreds of thousands of children were dying of diarrhea each year. Bill and I had already decided that we wanted to give the majority of the wealth from Microsoft away, but until that article, we weren't sure how. That data point gave us direction and ultimately led us to start our foundation.
As it turned out, we were far from alone in wanting to do something about the unconscionable number of children dying preventable deaths. Our foundation was quickly connected to a wide range of partners eager to play a role in driving progress. Together, we created a new organization – Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance – which has spurred a 40% decrease in the number of children in low-and-middle-income nations who die before their fifth birthday.
Once again, we find ourselves facing an urgent challenge that calls for new investment and collaboration. Shrinking the number 208 is going to require many people across many sectors. But progress is possible, and as a philanthropist, I'm particularly interested in the role that philanthropy can play in accelerating it.
When it comes to the fight for gender equality, one of the most important assets we have is the huge array of people who are already activated – from the thousands of organizations that worki on these issues to the more than 4 million women who joined women's marches across 600 cities. That's why I think there's a lot of potential in new efforts to channel existing energies and expertise more effectively into one broad-based assault on systemic inequality. My company, Pivotal Ventures, recently invested in two of these efforts – Time's Up and The Collaborative Fund for Women's Safety and Dignity. Both are creating new partnerships to tackle harassment, discrimination and inequality at scale.
The gender gaps in our country are real, and they aren't going away on their own – at least, not any time in the next 200 years. If we want to see them close in our lifetimes, we will need to come together to insist in one voice that equality can't wait. Over two decades ago, a statistic in a newspaper called me to action. I hope the statistic WEF published this week does the same for others. If we commit to being part of the solution, the number 208 is ours to reject.

They won't have Sanders to kick around any more

Texto completo: New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo played into President Donald Trump' s hands when he signed legislation granting illegal immigrants driver's licenses.

And he did it on the eve of Trump announcing his candidacy for re-election at a raucus rally in Orlando, Florida Tuesday night.

Now Trump, who has promised to begin the deportation of millions of illegal immigrants beginning next week, knows where to start.

And that would be at the numerous motor-vehicle registration offices in New York where the granting of driver's licenses will be given out to thousands of illegal immigrants. Will they be voting, too?

For ICE the situation is almost too good to be true. Instead of rounding up illegal immigrants in dangerous neighborhoods, Cuomo will be rounding them up for ICE in advance.

All agents of ICE will have to do is show up. Of course, the agents will have to make sure that the back doors of the offices are closed.

That way they can be certain that no one will slip out the back door the way one did recently at the Newton District Court, when Judge Shelley Joseph allowed a wanted illegal immigrant to avoid ICE agents waiting in the hallway and go free.

Now the judge is in trouble. She has been suspended and indicted, and soon could be sharing a cell with Jose Medina-Perez, the illegal immigrant who has been recaptured.

It's too bad. In New York, Cuomo would have promoted her to the Supreme Court.

The progressives who cheered Cuomo are the same leftists who jeered White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders.

Just look at the nasty sendoff her peers and colleagues gave her as she prepared to leave her job at the end of the month. Progresives treat illegal immigrants better.

White House reporters may be happy that they won't have Sanders to kick around any more.

But they must be careful about what they wish for. They may not have any press secretary to kick around if Trump decides not to fill the job.

Then all those ego-driven White House reporters who thrived on thrashing Sanders, might have to do real reporting, instead of waiting to be spoon-fed at the daily briefings and then bite the hand that just fed them.

The White House daily briefings may be a thing of the past anyway. Sanders has not held one in more than three months and there is no sign that any will be held in the future.

Trump in many ways is his own press secretary, and probably impossible to work for since he acts like he knows more than you do whatever your profession.

And while the briefings have been curtailed, Trump is more available to the press more than ever, especially when he pauses for questions on the White House lawn.

While The New York Times and others charge that Sanders "killed" the frequently contentious White House briefing, it was reporters behaving badly that really did it in.

Led by the obnoxious and scene-stealing Jim Acosta of CNN, the reporters on many occasions sought confrontation, not information.

Acosta, who acted as though he was starring in a White House movie about himself, was an expert at it. The story was always about him.

For television reporters like him, the White House assignment can be a glamorous job. But for most reporters -- especially print reporters — it can be a dreary assignment. You are confined to your space and dependent on the press briefing as your main source of information.

The briefings can be an out for them though. Little-known reporters get television time asking controversial questions. That leads to paid television appearances, or fees on the lecture circuit. Do it often enough you can get a book out of it, the way Acosta did.

So, the same reporters who worshiped Barack Obama, who they loved and voted for — and for whom they went in the tank for — took all their frustration out on Trump, who they hate.

In the middle of this weekly Trump hate-fest was Sanders, 36, the married mother of three, who remarkably showed more resolve and professionalism than the reporters. She stood up for the guy she worked for.

That is what good press secretaries do. And Sanders was a good White House press secretary, probably the best. She deserves cheers, not jeers.

Now she returns to Arkansas and maybe runs for governor, as her father Mike Huckabee did.

She leaves with her dignity intact.

NRA sues ex-president Oliver North, saying he harmed the NRA

Texto completo: NEW YORK - The National Rifle Association has sued its former president, Oliver North, for what it called "conduct harmful to the NRA as turmoil that was exposed publicly when North resigned two months ago continued Thursday when the organization also turned against its longtime chief lobbyist.
The lawsuit filed Wednesday in New York sought a judge's declaration that the NRA isn't required to pay North's legal bills.
North stepped down from the post in April after serving for a year. The lawsuit said he "departed office after a widely publicized, failed coup attempt.
The suit also accused top NRA official Chris W. Cox of conspiring with North to oust the organization's chief executive, Wayne LaPierre.
The New York Times reported that the NRA has suspended Cox, who said the allegations were "offensive and patently false.
A message left for North through his website wasn't immediately returned. An NRA spokesman did not return multiple messages.
Cox has been the executive director of the NRA Institute for Legislative Action, the NRA's political and lobbying arm, since 2002.
Its website boasts that Cox has "achieved some of its most significant political and legislative victories.
Yet, the lawsuit said, "another errant NRA fiduciary, Chris Cox - once thought by some to be a likely successor for Mr. LaPierre - participated in North's conspiracy to enable the NRA's longtime advertising agency, Ackerman McQueen Inc., which employed North, to gain control of its largest client.
"As became widely publicized, Mr. LaPierre prevailed - and the attempted coup by Ackerman, spearheaded by North, failed, the lawsuit said.
"North has acted in the best interests of himself and Ackerman and at the expense of the interests of the NRA, engaged in conduct harmful to the NRA, and persistently failed to provide to the NRA important details related to his lucrative contract with Ackerman, the lawsuit said.
Jennifer Baker, a spokeswoman for NRA's lobbying arm who was quoted by the Times saying that "any notion Chris participated in a coup is absurd, responded to a message seeking comment Thursday with an email saying she is not authorized to discuss personnel matters.
Last month, the NRA and Ackerman sued each other. The NRA said Ackerman had soiled its reputation and breached confidentiality agreements while Ackerman maintained the NRA had damaged its business.
North, 75, was a military aide to the National Security Council in the 1980s when his role arranging the secret sale of weapons to Iran and the diversion of the proceeds to the anti-communist Contra rebels in Nicaragua was revealed.
In 1989, he was convicted of obstructing Congress during its investigation, destroying government documents and accepting an illegal gratuity. Two years later, the convictions were reversed.

Iran downs U.S. drone Circumstances in dispute as tensions rise

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — The downing of a U.S. surveillance drone by Iran was a "very big mistake," President Donald Trump said in a tweet Thursday. But as some Republicans pressed for new steps against the country, Trump played down the incident, noting that the aircraft was not carrying any Americans.
The attack on the Navy RQ-4 drone heightened fears that the U.S. and Iran are on a course toward a military conflict as each side blamed the other. The New York Times reported Thursday night that Trump approved a retaliatory strike to take place this morning but abruptly pulled back, according to senior administration officials.
Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps said in a statement that it targeted the drone inside Iranian airspace over the southern province of Hormozgan, next to the strategic Strait of Hormuz.
But U.S. Central Command, which oversees U.S. forces in the Middle East, denied that the aircraft had entered Iranian airspace, characterizing the incident as an "unprovoked attack" over one of the world’s most important commercial waterways.
Trump suggested that the attack on the RQ-4 Global Hawk, which has the wingspan of a commercial airliner, may have been carried out without the knowledge of Iranian leaders.
"I’m not just talking about the country made a mistake. I’m talking about somebody under the command of that country made a mistake," Trump said at the White House alongside visiting Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. "I find it hard to believe it was intentional" on the part of Iran’s top officials, the president said.
Trump was noncommittal about a U.S. counterattack. "Let’s see what happens," he said. "This is a new fly in the ointment — what happened, shooting down the drone — and this country will not stand for it."
The White House invited a bipartisan group of top congressional leaders to a meeting Thursday afternoon to discuss the situation. Among those invited were Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., and the chairmen and ranking minority party members of the House and Senate intelligence and armed services committees.
"We had a good briefing," McConnell said, adding that he could confirm that an unmanned aerial vehicle "was fired on from Iranian soil and it was in international waters. And beyond that I think the administration is engaged in what I would call measured responses."
Schumer said he cautioned that "these conflicts have a way of escalating."
"The president may not intend to go to war here, but we’re worried that he and the administration may bumble into a war," he said. "One of the best ways to avoid bumbling into war, a war that nobody wants, is to have a robust open debate and for Congress to have a real say. We learned that lesson in the run-up to Iraq" in 2003.
After the White House meeting, Pelosi held a closed-door session with Democratic lawmakers to brief them on the developments. "We know that the high-tension wires are up there, and we must do everything we can not to escalate the situation, but also to make sure that our personnel in the region are safe," she said.
Thursday’s strike capped a number of recent incidents, including attacks on oil tankers, that American officials have depicted as part of an Iranian effort to hurt the United States and its allies in the region. The attack on the drone comes as the United States continues its "maximum pressure" campaign against a country the Trump administration has identified as its main adversary in the Middle East.
Tehran has responded with defiance to the initiative, which was launched after Trump withdrew the United States from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal and has included designating the Revolutionary Guard as a terrorist group and taking steps to cut off Iranian oil sales.
On Thursday, the European Union said officials from Germany, Britain, France, Russia, China and Iran would meet next week to discuss strategies to salvage the nuclear pact despite renewed U.S. sanctions and Tehran’s threat to exceed limits on its uranium stockpiles.
The Revolutionary Guard’s top commander, Maj. Gen. Hossein Salami, called the downing of the drone "a clear message to America."
"Our borders are Iran’s red line, and we will react strongly against any aggression," Salami said in remarks carried by Iranian state television. "Iran is not seeking war with any country, but we are fully prepared to defend Iran."
Nearly a quarter of the world’s oil passes through the Strait of Hormuz, which connects Middle East energy producers to markets around the globe.
Lt. Gen. Joseph Guastella, head of U.S. air forces in the Middle East, told reporters at the Pentagon that the Global Hawk was flying at high altitude in the vicinity of recent tanker attacks and was not at any time closer than 21 miles to the nearest point on Iran’s coast.
Guastella said the aircraft did not leave international airspace and was brought down by an IRGC surface-to-air missile fired from an area close to Goruk, Iran. "This dangerous and escalatory attack was irresponsible and occurred in the vicinity of established air corridors between Dubai, UAE, and Muscat, Oman, possibly endangering innocent civilians," he said. Guastella did not take questions.
The Global Hawk incident occurs the week after two tankers, a Japanese and a Norwegian, were attacked in the area of the Gulf of Oman. The Trump administration has blamed Iran for both incidents, at least one of which is said to have been carried out by use of a limpet mine similar to devices previously displayed at Iranian military parades.

Texto completo: To say that Elton John is unmasked in the biopic "Rocketman" would be a grave understatement. He's dehorned, his wings cut off, feathers plucked and rhinestones popped off, until, at the end of this musical romp through the rock star's early career, we're left looking at a man in a simple black Puma tracksuit and wire-rimmed glasses -- the antithesis of the bejeweled mad hatter that was his stage persona in the 1970s.
In flashbacks, the director Dexter Fletcher deconstructs the rise of Reginald Dwight, the shy, neglected schoolboy, into Elton John, the addict millionaire (played by Taron Egerton). At the same time, Julian Day, the movie's costume designer, is building John's wardrobe, his looks growing more elaborate with each success. At John's zenith in that era, the screen becomes almost a frenzy of platform shoes, silk kimonos, feather-trimmed lamé jackets and rhinestone-covered headdresses, accompanied, of course, by outrageous glasses. And almost all of it was built from scratch for the film.
"Julian was just brilliant," Elton John (the real one) told Melena Ryzik in an interview with The New York Times. "They weren't copies, but they were so like the things I wore, not just onstage. He observed my life during the '70s very closely and he got it right, without being imitative to a boring degree."
[Read the interview with Elton John and Bernie Taupin .]
The pop star reviewed the costumes and "could have passed on anything at anytime," Day said by phone from Nice, France. "But he just let us get on with our jobs."
Here's a closer study of several looks from the film:
Dealing With the Devil
Egerton is first shown walking into a rehab session, sweat pouring from under a flame-embroidered yellow-orange Lycra jumpsuit, topped by a rhinestone cap with black horns and balancing a shoulder harness attached to red-and-black-feathered wings so big they'd make the most experienced Mardi Gras queen swoon. The sweat was real, Day said of the often two-hour process of getting Egerton into costume.
Elton has turned into a drug- and sex-addicted devil, but his wings are heart-shaped and so are his glasses in a nod to his quest for love, Day continued. "He hasn't really been loved properly by anyone at this point in his life, save for his grandma, and his journey to rock bottom is the result of that."
Cowboy and Conductor
Poring over Elton John's personal archives, Day came across a picture of John as a child, dressed as a cowboy. That inspired him to create a custom western-wear suit for Egerton, and though we see hints of the cowboy in many looks, that outfit didn't actually make it into the movie. Still, the image was an important starting point for the designer and a reminder of the importance of costume in the star's life, Day said.
"Elton's mother was a dressmaker, so from a very early age he had a strong interest in clothing," as reflected in an early flashback in which a young Reggie (Matthew Illesley) fantasizes that he's conducting an orchestra. Standing on his bed, swinging his arms, he's in striped pajamas, then a tuxedo jacket and pajama bottoms, then, as the music swells, a full tuxedo and oversized bow tie. It's "a sign of what's to come, the larger-than-life personality that was to emerge."
Graphic Prints
The star's sexual awakening in the movie coincides with his first booking in the United States, at the Troubadour in Los Angeles. Egerton enters in a vintage-inspired T-shirt printed with a giant tube of lipstick. Shortly after, he's wearing another T-shirt with giant red lips surrounding a large cherry.
The designs reflect the liberated, graphic era of the sexual-revolution '70s, Day said, adding, "The lipstick is meant to be phallic. And, well, Elton had popped his cherry." Inspired by pop artists like Roy Lichtenstein, Day had the shirts custom printed by a graphic designer. "We're getting away from subtlety, away from England. This is American fashion and Elton is really coming out."
Those Glasses
Egerton wears more than 70 pairs of glasses in the movie, and almost half were custom-built by Day and other designers. Gucci, a label that had always factored heavily in John's personal wardrobe, even contributed a few. (Gucci's spring 2018 clothing line was also influenced by John's stage looks.) Several of the most memorable glasses, Day said, came from the eyewear specialist David Cox, one of Britain's last handmade-frame makers and the man behind Dame Edna Everage's (Barry Humphries) fancy spectacles. "When I first called him, he wasn't sure he was up to the challenge," Day said of Cox. "He didn't think it was his style, that he could do it. Then he ended up making several pairs."
Inspired by Goddesses
Because he's an extravagant dresser in everyday life, Egerton's "stage gear," as he calls it in the movie, had to be "taken up a notch," Day said, to give them contrast onscreen. The designer Bob Mackie, who created many of John's looks on and offstage, was a big influence.
"Mackie and others were designing for people like Cher and Diana Ross -- living goddesses. And maybe that applied here as well," Day said.
A pair of gold-winged platform boots (à la the Greek god Hermes), also get a decent amount of screen time. In the '70s, John wore similar pairs made by Mr Freedom, a clothing and lifestyle brand of the decade that mixed bohemian style with theatrical costumes into over-the-top streetwear. The real boots were more rounded, "so I sharpened these up a bit, made them a bit more 21st century," Day said. John loved them so much, Day had a second pair made as a gift.
Two Looks That Rocked His World
There were only two outfits that Day felt had to stay true to the time and place they were originally worn: a silver-starred shirt under white bell-bottom overalls with star patches, which John wore for his first concert at the Troubadour, and, arguably the star's most recognized get-up, the super-sparkly Los Angeles Dodgers uniform designed by Bob Mackie that he wore for two sold-out 1975 shows at Dodgers Stadium.
Both were seminal to his career, and his life, Day said. "The stars and dungarees weren't quite as big as some of the looks to come, but this was the show that started his career."
The Dodgers uniform represented a darker time, just after the singer had tried to commit suicide. "It's a crucial moment in his life," Day said. "Here he is at his lowest, playing to this giant audience."
Mackie used sequins to glamorize the original uniform, but for the movie Day chose Swarovski crystals, more than 260,000.
"There were thousands of flash bulbs going off in the stadium and we wanted to create that effect on the costume, a sort of mirror image," he said. "When Swarovski first created the crystal, it was for women who couldn't afford a diamond. So that's what they're meant to represent: his climb to success and wealth, all of it reflected off his body."

The 'Wife Guys' in the race for 2020

Texto completo: When asked recently to name his personal hero, Beto O'Rourke responded with "my wife" - and he probably thought he'd nailed it. A noncontroversial answer, endearingly personal, good for the women's vote. Plus, since O'Rourke got in hot water this spring for shirking his parenting responsibilities while pursuing higher office (his spouse, Amy, raises the kids "sometimes with my help," he clumsily said), here was a chance to show how much he appreciated her, and he also cited his kids and parents.
Former congressman John Delaney must have had a similar thought process, because he, too, told the New York Times that his wife was his hero when he answered the same questionnaire, which was distributed to all Democratic presidential candidates. And so did Seth Moulton. And so did Jay Inslee. And so did Steve Bullock.
All of them: "Personal hero: My wife."
No names. No description of who she is or why he finds her heroic, just my wife. (In videos that accompany the text, some candidates do elaborate on their admiration.)
If you've knocked around the Internet enough recently, you might have stumbled on a "Wife Guy," one of the many savvy gentlemen whose personal brand is defined and propelled by his heart-on-sleeve proclamations of love for his wife. Behold how much he loves her curves, as evidenced by his many Instagram posts about loving her curves. Behold how he helps with housework, and then publicly announces he has helped with housework. Behold all of his wifely love, and then behold him, loving her.
There's a refreshing element to this: Who doesn't like seeing spouses love each other? There's also an element that is, eeeugh , just a little bit much. Does anyone really need so much credit for upholding basic marriage vows?
At any rate. Who knew the Democratic primaries would turn into a bunch of Wife Guys, trying to stand out in a field packed with female candidates by assuring everyone that they, too, support women. Or, one woman, at least. Wife!
It would be mean-spirited to poke at these men who surely do admire their wives. But all the responses, en masse, start to make you think.
Being a candidate's spouse can be a thankless job, defined by either holding down the fort at home or vamping as the warm-up act on the trail. It's a supporting, subservient role. It's a role defined by putting your own plans on hold: Michelle Obama had a thing or two to say about this in her 2018 memoir, and Ted Cruz's wife, Heidi, once recalled her young daughter warning her that Cruz's campaign was "a bad deal for you."
No female candidates who completed the questionnaire named their husbands as their heroes, by the way. (And Pete Buttigieg did not mention his husband.) Make of that what you will. What I make of it is that the women worried that doing so would make them look too retro and potentially weak - which is a whole other column. The men, however, hoped that wife-adoration would help package them as sensitive feminists.
Did it? I don't know! I keep thinking of this scene in "The Wife," in which Glenn Close begs her novelist husband, who is about to accept his latest big literary prize, not to thank her, as he usually does, for being so supportive. It doesn't elevate her, she insists. It panders to her and to his audience. It only reinforces the perception that she's the laundry-doing helpmate and he's the benevolent genius.
A candidate declaring that his wife is his hero has the unintended consequence of making it look like the person he admires most is the person who makes his own life easier, by handling the drudgery that his important dream requires.
A candidate insisting that his wife is more heroic than him has the unintended consequence of making one wonder why he never suggested that she should be on the ticket instead.
To be fair, "my wife," is a much better answer than many other possible answers. There's nothing wrong with it. Along with "my parents," which other candidates offered, it's pretty standard and benign; there's no reason to read too much into it.
Here is something that I noticed, though. The New York Times, when offering the questionnaire, included space for two kinds of heroes: "Personal hero" and "Political hero." None of the candidates who listed their wives as personal heroes listed women as political heroes.
O'Rourke, of Texas, didn't think to mention his state's esteemed former governor Ann Richards. Climate-change crusader Inslee said his political hero was "the American voter" - but if he was going to punt by not naming an elected official, then he might as well have name checked pioneering activist Rachel Carson, whose work launched the whole environmental movement.
As a matter of fact, most of the male candidates - Bernie Sanders, Pete Buttigieg, Michael Bennet, Bill de Blasio - neglected to mention female political heroes. Some female candidates did: They mentioned Shirley Chisholm and Harriet Tubman, and Julián Castro referenced Dolores Huerta and discussed how his mother's political activism inspired his own. But most of the male candidates had little to say about women they admired specifically for their leadership, intelligence or political acumen.
"My wife" is a fine answer. But maybe next time candidates are queried about heroes, they can also look beyond their own living rooms.

Here's what you need to know about US-Iran tensions after a US drone was shot down Thursday

Texto completo: Tension is rising between the United States and Iran. Here's a briefing, compiled from Globe wire services, on what you need to know:
Thursday's developments Iran shot down a jetliner-sized US surveillance drone near the Strait of Hormuz. Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps said Thursday that the RQ-4 Global Hawk was inside Iranian airspace over the southern province of Hormozgan, next to the strategic strait. The US Central Command confirmed the incident but denied that the aircraft was intruding on Iranian airspace. It was the first direct Iranian-claimed attack on the United States amid the current crisis.
President Trump said Thursday the attack on the drone might have been a mistake, but he also said “you'll soon find out" whether the United States will strike back.
Tensions were already on the rise The latest news came after weeks of rising tension. When a Japanese and a Norwegian tanker were attacked last week near the Strait of Hormuz, the Trump administration blamed Iran. Iran denied involvement. In May, the United States tightened sanctions on Iranian oil sales. It has also recently deployed 1,000 additional troops to the region and sent an aircraft carrier there ahead of schedule. Iran, for its part, has threatened to resume stockpiling low-enriched uranium.
It goes back to pulling out of the nuclear deal President Trump pulled the United States out of the nuclear deal with Iran a year ago. The agreement was meant to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons. Washington quit the accord, put pressure on other countries remaining in the accord to quit, and reimposed crippling sanctions on Iran. Trump said he wanted to negotiate a new deal that would force Iran to rein in Iranian-allied militias in the region and Iran's weapons program.
Trump's signals are mixed on war Trump's national security adviser, John Bolton, and secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, are hardliners on Iran, and some have raised concerns they will push Trump into conflict. But Trump campaigned on not getting the United States involved in foreign wars. And his remarks that the Thursday attack on the drone might have been a mistake seemed intended to ease tensions. He said as recently as Monday he considered attacks attributed to Iran at that point as “very minor." Pompeo also said as recently as Tuesday, “President Trump does not want war."
Still, observers fear a miscalculation or further escalation could lead to armed conflict.
It's a risky, high-stakes standoff Iran is under severe sanctions that are strangling its economy and cutting off its vital oil revenues. Experts told the New York Times that Iran may be causing trouble in the region in an effort to get the nations who remain in the Iran nuclear deal to convince the United States to let up the pressure. “Creating a sense of urgency among the Europeans, as well as Chinese and Russians" is meant to compel those governments to rein in the United States on Iran's behalf, said Ellie Geranmayeh, an Iran expert at the European Council on Foreign Relations. The Iranians may also be hoping that the prospect of disruptions to oil tanker traffic in the Persian Gulf could persuade the Emiratis and Saudis to press the United States “to cool down its strategy," she said.
“Iran lashing out is a way for it to show the rest of the world, 'Look, we've been acting in a relatively restrained manner in the year since Trump pulled out of the deal. But now we can't,' " said Dina Esfandiary, a Harvard University expert on Middle Eastern security issues.

NYT reporter flagged Jared Kushner meetings with Russians to FBI

Texto completo: A New York Times reporter fed information about Jared Kushner meeting with Russians to the FBI, newly released emails show.
Journalist Michael Schmidt sent an email on March 24, 2017, to FBI Assistant Director for Public Affairs Michael Kortan, stating that his colleagues were reporting on the FBI's Russia investigation and had stumbled onto some information about President Trump's son-in-law and top adviser.
"Wanted to flag you on something. Three of my colleagues are working on a story about the Russia investigation. They’re told that Jared Kushner is among the individuals who the F.B.I. is scrutinizing for their meetings with Russians," Schmidt said. "My colleagues were told that Ambassador Kislyak, after meeting Kushner and General Flynn in early December at Trump Tower, set up a meeting with Kushner and a Russian banker. Kushner ultimately met with the Russian banker. The banker worked for Alpha Bank. Thanks. Mike."
Kortan forwarded the email to FBI special agent Peter Strzok, who was leading the bureau's Russia investigation, and Jonathan Moffa, an FBI counterintelligence officer.
The Washington Examiner has reached out to Schmidt for comment.
The email was obtained by conservative watchdog group Judicial Watch, released in response to a May 21 court order by U.S. District Judge Reggie Walton to the FBI to process 13,000 pages of records. Thursday's release by Judicial Watch, which it claimed to show "FBI-media collusion," also revealed interactions between the FBI and other media outlets, including ProPublica asking for a fact check for an upcoming report.
An email exchange on April 10, 2017, involving Strzok, former FBI lawyer Lisa Page, and other bureau officials, appears to be about getting a preview of an upcoming Times report. "The editing is nearing completion and we have one last shot to hear what the end result is. Do you have time later today or tomorrow that is convenient for a listening session? Likely by phone in Mike’s office," said an email that was part of the thread with the subject line "NYT Last Shot."
Special counsel Robert Mueller’s team focused on two meetings Kushner and his top aide Avi Berkowitz held with then-Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak and with Sergey Gorkov, the head of a state-owned Russian development bank VEB.
Mueller's report, released this year, found no evidence that Kushner received Russian funding to cover a troubled New York City real estate loan, a press scandal that dogged the top presidential adviser despite his denials. Mueller's team also was unable to find sufficient evidence of any criminal conspiracy between the Trump team and the Kremlin.
In July 2017, Kushner sent a statement to Congress before he was to testify before the House and Senate intelligence panels that said he had just four meetings with Russian officials during and after the 2016 campaign. Kushner stressed he was never close to the Russians, and insisted there was no improper collusion with Russia in these contacts as Democrats had charged. "I did not collude, nor know of anyone else in the campaign who colluded, with any foreign government," Kushner said. "I had no improper contacts."

Texto completo: Un jurado de una corte federal de Nueva York halló este miércoles culpable de todos los cargos a Keith Raniere , fundador de la organización de supuesta autoayuda Nxivm, con sede en Albany, que resultó ser una secta de esclavas y trata sexual.
Tras cinco horas de deliberación, los 12 miembros del jurado establecieron un veredicto condenatorio contra el acusado en el juicio que se extendió por un mes.
Raniere, de 58 años, que está en prisión desde su arresto en México en marzo de 2018, enfrentó juicio por varios delitos, entre ellos tráfico sexual con adultos y menores, posesión de pornografía infantil, explotación sexual de un menor y chantaje. Se enfrenta a una posible cadena perpetua.
Pero, si algo llamó la atención de este caso fueron los detalles bizarros y de índole sexual que trascendieron en la Corte del Distrito Este de Brooklyn. A continuación, te presentamos un resumen:
Tres hermanas mexicanas embarazadas y abortos
Tres hermanas mexicanas abortaron a pedido del líder de la secta Nxivm, Keith Raniere, quien las embarazó mientras eran sus esclavas sexuales.
Una de las víctimas, identificadas como Daniela, narró el martirio que tanto ella como sus hermanas vivieron bajo el abuso de Raniere camuflado en el supuesto grupo de autoayuda.
La joven, quien llegó de México junto a otros seis miembros de su familia cuanto tenía 16 años, además relató que la prepararon durante semanas antes de que cumpliera los 18, para que Raniere tomara su virginidad.
“Nunca me habían besado y no había tenido ningún contacto sexual”, dijo Daniela en el tribunal, según citada por medios como The Daily Beast.
Marcadas como “ganado”
Videos muestran cómo las esclavas sexuales eran marcadas a fuego vivo con un cauterizador como una especie de rito de iniciación.
En una grabación se ve el procedimiento mediante el que “tatuaban” a las mujeres con las iniciales del líder de la secta.
En el clip, presentado en exclusiva en el noticiero de Loret de Mola de Televisa, se aprecia a un grupo de cuatro féminas desnudas en una de estas ceremonias.
Una de ellas está acostada mientras la “tatúan”; se trata de Sarah Edmondson, quien denunció en 2017 las prácticas del grupo a The New York Times.
A Raniere, que camuflaba los abusos como cursos de “autoayuda” bajo “Programas de Éxito Ejecutivo”, se le ve en el video pronunciando una especie de juramento que las mujeres a su vez deben repetir.

La “Semana de la vanguardia”
Otro detalle atroz que trascendió en el proceso judicial fue la celebración conocida como “Semana de la vanguardia”, en reconocimiento a Raniere, evento que supuestamente congregaba a miembros de varias ciudades de Estados Unidos y Canadá.
El encuentro, relacionado con el cumpleaños de Raniere el 26 de agosto, reflejaba la idolatría de los participantes de la organización a su líder y estaba dirigido a la satisfacción de las demandas de éste.
El agente especial del FBI Michael Lever dijo en una declaración jurada que Raniere tenía una rotación de 15 a 20 mujeres con las que mantenía relaciones sexuales como parte de las actividades.
Manipulación y soborno con material sexual
La sociedad secreta piramidal llamada “DOS” o el “Voto” a Nxivm era otra humillación a las víctimas en beneficio del líder.
Raniere, el único miembro masculino del grupo, ocupaba el nivel más alto, en su papel de “maestro superior”. A su vez, las primeras esclavas reclutaban a otras.
Para unirse, las mujeres se veían obligadas a dar garantías de fidelidad a sus amos: material sería comprometedor para la mujer que se exponía a este trueque.
Podría tratarse de fotografías y videos sexualmente explícitos de las esclavas.
“Las esclavas entendían que si abandonaban el DOS, hablaban públicamente sobre el DOS o repetidamente incumplían las obligaciones o asignaciones del DOS, sus garantías podían ser publicadas”, expuso Lever.
.
Sexo grupal
Lauren Salzman, una de las mujeres que pertenecía al círculo cercano de Keith Raniere y la actriz de Smallville Allison Mack, confesaron haber aceptado participar – como dos de las siete “esclavas de primera línea”- en una ceremonia de compromiso que incluía sexo oral grupal.
Poco antes de que comenzara la ceremonia en marzo del 2018, los agentes mexicanos rodearon la propiedad de Raniere en una villa en las afueras de Puerto Vallarta (Jalisco) y lo arrestaron . En dicho país se extendieron las redes de este grupo con vínculos con altos líderes como Emiliano Salinas, hijo del expresidente Carlos Salinas.

Massachusetts newspaper bucks layoff trend

Texto completo: PITTSFIELD, Mass. - These days, the news about local news seems relentlessly bad:
Newsroom employment, down by nearly half over the past 15 years. Waves of layoffs continuing to hit both traditional newspaper chains and digital news startups. Cities and towns so denuded of coverage that they're described as "news deserts.
But then, there's The Berkshire Eagle.
The western Massachusetts daily has an expanded investigative team. There's a new 12-page lifestyle section for the Eagle's Sunday editions. There's a new monthly magazine focusing on the area's culinary and natural charms. There's an advisory board that includes cellist Yo-Yo Ma and Pulitzer-winning writer Elizabeth Kolbert.
The newspaper is wider, its paper thicker. There's even a second daily crossword puzzle.
The Eagle's revival started three years ago, when four investors with deep pockets and ties to the Berkshires took a leap of faith. They bought it and its three sister Vermont publications from a hedge fund-backed media chain with a reputation for cost-cutting tactics that squeeze profits from struggling newspapers while leaving a diminished staff; the chain has defended its strategy as a way to ensure that local newspapers can survive financially.
Since the purchase, a hiring flurry has brought more than 50 new jobs to the Eagle and its sister papers.
It's easy to get carried away - the Eagle is still struggling, and its survival is far from assured. Readers are trickling, not flocking, back.
But if it does fail, it won't be for lack of effort. The Eagle's owners, editors and staff are waging an all-out campaign to revitalize local journalism in the Berkshires and southern Vermont.
"I want our newspaper to love its readers. And I want its readers to love the newspapers back, said executive editor Kevin Moran, before resorting to a journalist's black humor: "Because if they don't have an emotional connection to the newspaper, they are not going to cry when you are gone.
Fredric Rutberg has always had that kind of connection to the Eagle - which is why he has put his body, soul and cash into its rescue.
Rutberg, a local district judge who was looking for a second act as he neared retirement, pulled together the group of investors who bought the Eagle in the spring of 2016 from Digital First Media, also knowns as MNG Enterprises.
Rutberg, 73, relishes his role as newspaper owner, publisher and president. He hosts intimate gatherings with readers called "Coffee with the President, promoting the newspaper's triumphs, including award-winning investigative coverage of the Berkshire Museum's controversial sale of artworks, the decaying state of the region's bridges and the struggle to bring broadband internet to rural communities.
From his office at Eagle headquarters, he fields phone calls from readers complaining if the newspaper is delivered late or too far from the driveway.
"They are always shocked when I answer the phone, said Rutberg, who finally decided to ride along one night with a delivery truck driver and write a column to explain the demands of the job.
Another time, he ended up being the highlight of a chatty Eagle story on favorite kitchen gadgets, posing for a photo with onion glasses and a slightly sheepish grin.
All the while, he regularly travels to Vermont to visit the sister newspapers. He pursues strategies for revenue diversification: The newspaper is developing an in-house ad agency and hosts paid events, including high school sports galas and a "Conversation Series that bring experts to discuss topics from faith in politics to the confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.
For Moran, this level of involvement is a thrilling contrast to the Eagle's former corporate owners. During a rare visit from them in 2015, the agenda was mostly budget cuts.
Shortly afterward, Moran said, he oversaw the layoffs of 19 people at the four newspapers, one of his lowest moments in a two-decade career spent rising through the ranks of the Eagle and its affiliated newspapers. The year before, 18 positions had already been cut.
"You see this foundation, this whole pillar of your community, start to break apart, Moran said.
"""
Rutberg and his three partners seized a short window of opportunity when Alden Global Capital was putting several of its newspapers up for sale following failed negotiations to sell off the company's media properties, known as Digital First Media, to a private equity firm. The sale returned The Berkshire Eagle to local ownership for the first time since 1995, when the debt-saddled Miller family that had run it for more than a century first sold it to a media chain.
Today, Rutberg and co-owner Hans Morris, a former president of Visa, are forging ahead without two of their original partners. Stanford Lipsey, a longtime newspaper publisher, died in November 2016, with his share passing to his wife, Judi Lipsey. Former M&T Bank CEO Robert Wilmers died in December 2017.
The year before, Wilmers had declared the goal of building "the finest group of community newspapers in the country. And the new owners swiftly made changes that reflected their frustrations as Eagle readers, down to replacing thin newsprint that curled in humid weather and was unbecoming of a newspaper that won a Pulitzer for editorial writing in 1973.
Moran was suddenly scrambling to add staff.
Rutberg and his partners wanted a "world-class arts and culture section worthy of a region that boasts the Jacob's Pillow dance center, a theater scene that lures Hollywood stars and Tanglewood, the summer home of the Boston Symphony Orchestra.
Under the corporate owners, the features staff had been whittled down to two editors, who relied on syndicated stories on food and gardening to fill out pages that were shared with the Vermont papers.
Now, features editor Lindsey Hollenbaugh oversees a staff of seven. She launched Landscapes, the 12-page lifestyle section that includes only local stories, aside from The New York Times best-seller list. Landscapes has taken readers to a theater rehearsal with actor Jon Hamm, followed around a pizza delivery driver on the coldest night of the year and explained how on-duty firefighters weave grocery shopping into their shifts.
"Suddenly, I had all the freedom in the world with very few constraints, said Hollenbaugh, who first joined The Berkshire Eagle in 2010. "We feel like we won the lottery.
The expanded investigative team gives voice to overlooked communities in the Berkshires, the hilly, westernmost region of Massachusetts, where 130,000 people are scattered across 30-plus towns and villages.
Geographic differences make the Berkshires a challenge to cover. Some towns are New England charmers that draw artists and New York City tourists, including Rutberg's town of Stockbridge, home to the Norman Rockwell Museum. Others, such as the main city of Pittsfield, are still struggling with the ripple effects of losing thousands of jobs when major employer General Electric gradually packed up and left in the 1980s and 90s, hastening a population loss that shows no signs of slowing.
The Eagle strives to be indispensable to all those communities, and its reporters say that effort is being reflected in the story requests they get from readers.
Exasperated residents from rural Sandisfield led reporter Heather Bellow to investigate a pipeline company's failure to live up to a 2-year-old promise to fix a rural road , so damaged that tar stuck to the feet of dogs and people. Text messages from anguished neighbors prodded her to keep pushing for answers about a fire that killed a family of five in the town of Sheffield, long after the tragedy faded from national headlines.
The hard part is persuading the people of the Berkshires to pay for this type of in-depth coverage.
"Our business plan was simply to increase the quality of the content and attract new readers, Rutberg said. "We've made more than a bona fide effort at the first part. We are in the second right now, and the jury's out.
"""
The Berkshire Eagle's overall paid circulation fell more than 20 percent during the first year under new ownership, before key initiatives such as Landscapes were launched. Rutberg counts it as an achievement that circulation remained mostly stable the second year, at more than 15,000 on weekdays and nearly 18,000 on Sundays, still half what it was a decade ago.
On the bright side, digital subscriptions are finally ticking up.
"In our industry, flat is the new black, Rutberg says cheerfully, his go-to catchphrase when anyone asks about circulation.
Like many newspapers, The Berkshire Eagle increasingly relies on revenue from paid subscriptions, as major advertisers migrate to online giants such as Facebook and Google. Rutberg said the Eagle has suffered from the decline of the Berkshire Mall, which saw key retailers J.C. Penney, Macy's and Best Buy leave over the past four years, taking their ad dollars with them.
One thing Rutberg said he can't do is pass the cost of his heftier newspaper onto readers because of a price hike by the previous owner. Digital First Media raised the cost of home delivery service by 60 percent in 2014 to $300 a year, even as the paper grew thinner.
Through a spokeswoman, Molly Curry, Digital First declined to comment for this story. In the past, Digital First has countered criticism of its tactics, saying it runs "newspapers profitably and sustainably so that they can continue to serve their local communities.
In a letter earlier this year to U.S. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, the company's chairman noted that advertising and circulation declines were threatening the newspaper industry generally. But he said Digital First, also known as MNG Enterprises, believes in the industry "and we know how to operate successful newspaper businesses over the long term.
It remains to be seen how sustainable the expanded Eagle will be under its new owners.
The newspaper charges $13 a month for a digital-only subscription, letting people read three articles online before hitting the pay wall. Social media drives a third of the newspaper's digital traffic, a double-edged sword because many readers bristle at being asked to pay for content they see on Facebook.
"I just don't have time to sit down and read an entire newspaper. I'm on Facebook 10 minutes a day; I'm not going to get $13 worth of news, said Jenna Lanphear, a 40-year-old Pittsfield beauty salon owner, applying lemon nail polish for Amy Sinico, a day care center director who also does not subscribe.
"It's very frustrating, Sinico chimed in. "When they put a link on Facebook and then you click on it to read more about it, but you can't because you have to buy the subscription. Don't put the link on Facebook then.
A recent Pew Research Center study found this to be typical. Only 14 percent of American adults said they had paid for local news within the past year, via subscription, donation or membership.
Half the respondents noted that free content is available to them. In the Berkshires, Lanphear and Sinico pointed out, people can get news for free from television, radio and two digital news sites, the Berkshire Edge and iBerkshires.com.
Lanphear did sign up her 13-year-old daughter for a summit of high school journalists organized by The Berkshire Eagle's education reporter, Jenn Smith - one of many efforts the Eagle is making to re-establish itself as the center of civic life and deepen its interaction with readers.
Smith, for example, takes nominations from parents and teachers for a "Classroom of the Week column. She visits each class for the story then drives back to deliver a frameable poster of her column and a gift certificate for teaching materials.
And earlier this year, the Eagle invited high schoolers to organize and moderate one of its "Conversation Series.
The idea came from Marie Butler and Jordan Bradford, two Pittsfield High School juniors who attended a "Conversation on faith and politics last fall only to be disappointed by the lack of diversity among the panelists (three white men) and the audience (mostly white and older).
Bradford and Butler say most of their classmates are preoccupied with the news, which they follow on the smartphones they never part with. On Twitter, they follow NPR, President Donald Trump, social activists and a few of the 2020 Democratic presidential candidates. Last year, hundreds of Pittsfield High School students walked out of class after the shooting that killed 17 people in Parkland, Florida.
"Since our generation has a lot of access to the internet, the politics that happens in our government is kind of right in our faces, Bradford said.
That kind of enthusiasm doesn't automatically translate into new readers for a local paper like the Eagle.
Bradford's parents don't subscribe, although they pick up the paper when their star swimmer daughter makes the sports pages. Butler regularly reads the newspaper because her parents get it delivered, but she doesn't know anyone else who does.
"I'm definitely alone in that arena, she said.
"""
The newspaper is experimenting with ways to promote itself as a source of unique stories about the Berkshires.
Its online editor, Noah Hoffenberg, found that traffic from Facebook to the Eagle's digital site increased when he posted fewer stories and opinion pieces about national politics, which had been triggering negative comments and accusations of bias.
Rick Edmonds, a media business analyst for the Poynter Institute, said it's good practice for a local newspaper to market itself as a refuge from the divisiveness of national politics. But he said people invariably turn to television and radio for basic information, eroding the perception that newspapers are indispensable.
"Weather and traffic - some people find that is the only news they care about it. If they are getting that, they may not be revved up to pay for a local newspaper, Edmonds said.
Some people might also take their local newspaper for granted: The Pew poll found that 71 percent of Americans believe their local news outlets are doing very or somewhat well financially, when in fact many newspapers are struggling to survive.
Moran said it is not lost on anyone at The Berkshire Eagle that "we are trying to swim upstream.
Independently owned newspapers are becoming a thing of the past. Of the 1,200 newspapers that have been sold in the last five years, most were owned by families or small private chains, according to a study by Penelope Muse Abernathy, a University of North Carolina professor whose research on the subject gave rise to the term "news desert.
In May, New York Times executive editor Dean Baquet bleakly predicted the demise of "most local newspapers in America within five years, except for ones bought by billionaires. The Washington Post and Los Angeles Times, both national publications, are thriving after being bought by billionaires. The Boston Globe, Minneapolis Star-Tribune and Las Vegas Review-Journal are among other major American newspapers that appear to have steadied themselves after being sold to local wealthy individuals.
For many other newspapers, especially smaller ones, the future prospects are uncertain.
In January, Rutberg wrote a column in the Eagle appealing for several hundred new subscribers.
He made the same appeal at a trendy cafe in Pittsfield during a recent "Coffee with the President, his second in a week. His audience was mostly middle age and older, not surprising in a place like the Berkshires, which has struggled to hold on to its working-age population.
A few younger customers poked their heads in while Rutberg spoke, then backed away, coffees in hand.
The older audience promptly brought up newspaper delivery. One man approvingly noted his paper has been arriving on time and launched into a discussion about tipping drivers. Another worried about how the city's new ban on single-use plastic bags would affect the bundling of the papers.
Rutberg patiently assured them that the newspaper would visit their homes to install green plastic tubes where the paper can be inserted, something he said the old owners had stopped doing.
Days earlier, he was still glowing after a trip to Boston to accept the JFK Commonwealth Award from the Massachusetts Cultural Council, which The Berkshire Eagle won for its commitment to community journalism, a vindication of his late partner Bob Wilmer's dream.
"We are going to stick with this, Rutberg said. "This is our commitment as long as humanly possible.

Texto completo: Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
Taffy Brodesser-Akner, a writer for The New York Times Magazine, is best known for her celebrity profiles. But the subjects she tackles are broad and varied. Last year, she profiled Gwyneth Paltrow and helped to explain why Goop had become such a controversial brand in the wellness industry. She unpacked Ethan Hawke at a time when he was finally being embraced by critics. And in April, she published an investigation into unequal pay and sexual harassment at Kay Jewelers. Now, she's written her first novel, "Fleishman Is in Trouble," on divorce, a topic that, she said, in her own life always felt like the bogeyman. Ms. Brodesser-Akner discussed what she's learned from writing profiles, how that has influenced her fiction writing, and what's next.
When did you decide you wanted to write a novel?
I went to film school. I wanted to be someone who told stories. I thought maybe I would write screenplays and then one day I would write a novel, but nothing I ever did was great. And then I had to get a job.
I got a job at a soap opera magazine, which led to a career in journalism (as it rarely does). One thing I learned over all those years was that people are moved by the truth, and by the contradiction of the truth -- when people act against their own best interests, when people are not exactly what you would expect.
I realize now that all the fiction and screenwriting I was doing before I started in journalism were things that did not contain the truth. They might have contained good stories, and maybe some lively writing, but they did not contain the emotional core of what people respond to in the best writing I read.
Once I understood that people prefer the truth, even when it's messy, and that people aren't just looking for an easy story that makes sense, that's when I felt like I was able to write my novel.
I sat down and started writing this book in the summer of 2016. I've been doing revisions for a year. The thing that was hard for me is that there was no opportunity for observation, which is what I'm good at in journalism. You couldn't observe people you made up. So I had to cultivate an active imagination.
How has your journalistic experience influenced your fiction writing?
I knew how to tell a story. Studying screenwriting taught me that. But journalism freed me up to understand that people will just want to read the truth, and that the truth is something you have to work very hard for.
What have you learned from doing profiles?
They've taught me how to listen in a way that isn't self-interested, and they've taught me how to relate to nearly anyone. The latter -- being able to relate to nearly everyone and still being able to observe them -- is a very, very hard thing to cultivate.
I find that you can't really write about somebody unless you have listened to their side of the story. That takes putting yourself aside, and putting aside what you think is most important -- which is your ability to be smart or funny at their expense -- and learning instead to try to be smart and funny in the service of explaining them.
When did you write this book? How did you physically do it?
I opened up a Word document and never closed it. I kept it open in the background at all times and turned to it when I was frustrated, or when I found the thing I was doing tedious.
I worked on it one sentence at a time. Sometimes I would get on an airplane and say, "I'm not doing anything but this," and I would write 10 pages. I'm a very fast writer, and I have a kind of quick metabolism for story.
I was very lucky to have people around me who knew what I was capable of, and who pushed me to do my best. That's the way my journalism paid off most of all: I had so many people whom I could ask for help from, and they knew that I would be relentless about getting it right.
Why were you drawn to the subject of divorce?
It's the thing that is most taboo, and the thing that is most shocking, and the thing that's a bogeyman in my life. My parents got divorced when I was young, and a lot of my friends started coming to me and telling me they were getting divorced.
I was endlessly fascinated by the fact that we were a generation who did not have dating apps. Looking at dating apps through the eyes of someone who had never had them, who had to show up in their human form and hope that people could love them -- that was very hard for me to understand. It was also the most exciting thing for me to understand.
I thought my book was a dating book. Then I realized it was a marriage book. Then I realized it was a divorce book. Then I finished writing it.
What do you say to readers who don't quite understand how a journalist can become a novelist, and that the novelist is still a journalist?
They are separate skills. I became a good reporter. I was always interested in writing. The work, for me, was becoming a good reporter. It wasn't the other way around. So, it makes a little bit more sense in the context of where I started from. I'm still always working to get better at reporting. I'm very lucky to sit in the Culture section, where I get to listen to my fellow reporters do all manner of excellent reporting and good following up and hard question-asking. You should hear Jenny Schuessler when someone tries to give her the runaround. I sat behind Michael Cooper as he patiently and quietly and smartly wrote a story that took down the biggest figure in classical music last year. That was an amazing experience for me. I hope he's not mad that I'm breaching the pretend wall we think exists between us in the office. I'm an eavesdropper. Let's not pretend we're not all eavesdroppers.
What's next?
I'm on the hook for a second novel. It's called "Long Island Compromise." It's due next year. I hope I can pull it off because part of the magic of writing this first book was just seeing if I could get to the end. I have that Word document up again on my computer and it's there and it's going to stay there. I don't know how I'm going to manage it. I'm pretty fast. I hope I remain fast.
How do you balance being a full-time reporter, being a novelist and having two kids?
My trick is that I don't think about balance. I'm not trying to get better at balance. That's not a goal of mine. My goal is to "be where I am" more often: to not be dreaming of my children when I'm working, and to not be dreaming of my work when I'm children-ing.
You're also pretty strict about your priorities.
It's very easy for me to say "no" to things because I have a list of what my priorities are. Work and family are on the same tier because my work helps support my family. Anytime I'm not working, my children get the time. It's like, work, spend time with your children, see your friends. That's the order. I am hoping that very soon I start making extraordinary efforts toward being better with preparing food for myself and exercising.
These are hard things to do.
Yes. These are hard things to do. They are the dream.

Texto completo: Boston's tourism industry works hard to accommodate Chinese tourists, and with good reason: They're the largest source of overseas visitors to the city.
For instance, some businesses have adopted WeChat Pay and Alipay, payment apps that are ubiquitous in China; Boston Duck Tours offers tours translated into Chinese languages; and the Mandarin Oriental Hotel hired Mandarin-speaking employees and rearranged its floor plan according to the principles of feng shui.
But as trade tensions between China and the United States remain unresolved, some people who count on Chinese spending here are starting to worry.
The festering dispute is “kind of . . . the elephant in the room," said David O'Donnell, a spokesman for the Greater Boston Convention & Visitors Bureau. “We're all concerned that if it continues to escalate, it will hit the travel trade."
In the past, visitors from the United Kingdom ranked number one in Boston. But in 2016, Chinese tourists topped the list for the first time — an estimated 249,000 came that year. By 2017, the latest year for which numbers specific to Boston are available, the number had swelled to 301,000.
Among the factors that have contributed to the growth is the emergence of a robust middle class in China. According to a report by the analytics firm Oxford Economics, the number of Chinese households making enough to comfortably afford international travel ballooned from about 6 million in 2003 to 27 million in 2013. That figure is expected to grow by an additional 61 million by 2023.
According to federal data, roughly 3 million Chinese tourists visited the United States in 2018, and an estimated 3.2 million visited in 2017.
“The volume is something that's unparalleled and unprecedented in the history of the travel trade," O'Donnell said.
In addition, Boston has become increasingly accessible, thanks to a new 10-year tourist visa and nonstop flights to China from Logan International Airport.
China's Hainan Airlines began offering direct flights to Beijing in June 2014, and a year later, it launched a route between Boston and Shanghai. That May, Cathay Pacific Airways began offering direct flights to Hong Kong.
The Massachusetts Port Authority, which runs Logan, estimates those flights contribute about $600 million to the local economy every year.
O'Donnell said the Convention & Visitors Bureau had launched a Chinese-language website and a marketing campaign on the Chinese social media platform Weibo in 2014, and prior to that created a committee focused on increasing travel from China.
But now, with the United States and China at odds over trade policy, some businesses say the feud already is affecting the economy.
Daniel Andrew, the chief executive of Trademark Tours — which offers student-led tours of Harvard University, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Boston, as well as college campus summer programs that are popular with Chinese students — said in an e-mail that the company is “seeing a slowdown in Chinese visits."
Andrew estimated that Chinese tourists account for 5 percent of the company's customers, but 15 percent of its revenue.
Andrew didn't say how much business Trademark Tours has lost, but offered that the decline was “likely due to the political tensions between the two countries."
“America still has great appeal to the Chinese visitor," he said, “but the so-called trade war is making our marketing efforts in China more difficult than in previous years."
Bob Schwartz, a spokesman for Boston Duck Tours, said that an advisory issued last year by China about travel to the United States hasn't helped. In that statement, the Chinese Embassy in Washington, D.C., described the United States as unsafe.
“Public security in the United States is not good," it said. “Cases of shootings, robberies, and theft are frequent."
“I've never heard of another country trying to dissuade people from coming here, but I wouldn't put it past the Chinese government to double-down on their messaging to not come here if things heated up," Schwartz said.
The Wall Street Journal recently reported that several Chinese agencies had issued additional advisories cautioning its citizens on travel to the United States, and last week The New York Times reported that tourism industry officials fear a nationwide decline in the number of Chinese visitors resulting from the trade dispute.
President Trump has threatened to raise tariffs on more than $300 billion worth of Chinese goods on top of tariffs already imposed on that country. Meanwhile, China has raised tariffs on $60 billion worth of US goods.
But O'Donnell said that a decrease in the number of visitors from China wouldn't be catastrophic for the Boston-area tourism industry.
“I don't think anyone has become so dependent [on Chinese tourism] that they would have to drastically revisit their entire business plan if this fell off," he said.
“It definitely would hurt, but I don't think it would necessitate a complete overhaul of how these people are marketing themselves."

Texto completo: Del Taco will begin serving meat-free Beyond Burritos on Thursday, June 20, two months after the successful launch of its Beyond Tacos.
The new burritos expand Del Taco’s partnership with Beyond Meat, a Los Angeles-based company out to revolutionize meat substitutes with plant-based products that look and taste like beef.
The two new menu items are:
Beyond 8 Layer Burrito: Made with seasoned plant-based crumbles, slow-cooked beans, guacamole, diced tomatoes, lettuce, cheddar cheese, sauce and sour cream wrapped in a flour tortilla.
Epic Beyond Cali Burrito: Beyond Meat plant-based crumbles wrapped with crinkle-cut french fries, sour cream, guacamole and handmade pico de gallo in a flour tortilla.
The two Beyond Tacos on the menu are among Del Taco’s most successful launches. It has sold about 2 million of them since they were added to the menu in mid-April, according to a news release from the Lake Forest-based chain.
Plant-based protein is a hot trend in fast food and fast casual restaurants. Beyond Meat and its main competitor, Impossible Foods, have an expanding list of partners serving their products in burgers, Mexican foods and pizzas. The New York Times reported this week that Red Robin and White Castle are struggling to keep up with demand for Impossible Burgers.
Peas are a key ingredient in the Beyond Burger, while the Impossible Burger is made with soy, but both products are engineered to grill and even bleed like real beef.
Burger King began testing an Impossible Whopper in St. Louis on April 1 and three weeks later announced it would roll out the burger to the entire chain. Bay Area restaurants began serving it last week.

SO, IF YOU COULD, WOULD YOU SCRAP OUR CONSTITUTION?; EDITOR'S NOTE

Texto completo: If left up to you, would you discard the U.S. Constitution and start over? That question underpins the hit Broadway play "What the Constitution Means to Me."
At the end of each performance and after a debate a random audience member votes on whether to keep our nation's foundational document. At the performance I attended with my wife and daughter last month, the audience member chose to keep it, apparently less from reverence for the original than for fear of what in Donald Trump's America might replace it.
The New York play is primarily a one-woman show performed by Heidi Schreck, who also wrote it. She brings a sunshiny charisma that seems incongruous with her sharp criticisms of the Founding Fathers, but that makes the show even more compelling.
It begins with Schreck playing her 15-year-old self competing as she actually did as a teen in an American Legion Oratorical Contest about the Constitution. Her tone is naïve and upbeat.
But the contest provides a framework for her to become her adult self and talk about how generations of women in her family endured a galling lack of legal rights and suffered physical abuse from men. She goes back four generations to her great-great grandmother, a mail-order bride bought for $75 who died of "melancholia" in a mental institution at age 36.
Schreck's play attacks the privilege of the rich, white, straight men who wrote the Constitution and the mostly rich, white, straight men who currently defend and interpret it.
New York Times reviewer Jesse Green called it "nothing less than a chronicle of the legal subjugation of women by men, as experienced in the day-to-day injustices of living while female." In hailing it as the best play of the season, Green called it a "tragedy told as a comedy, a work of inspired protest, a slyly crafted piece of persuasion and a tangible contribution to the change it seeks."
(Not everyone is as enthusiastic about the play. My family members were more taken by "Hadestown," the blockbuster musical built on Greek mythology we saw the night before. Hadestown won eight Tony awards; Schreck was nominated for best performance by an actress and her show as best new play, but neither won.) Still, I preferred the modest-by-comparison Constitution play in the tiny Helen Hayes Theater. I mean, how many shows do you leave with a 52page pocket-guide version of the Constitution as a souvenir?
It occurred to me that Schreck's play may get audiences to ponder the Constitution in the way the musical "Hamilton" prompted people to see Alexander Hamilton as responsible for the American banking system and as the most consequential among second-tier Founding Fathers.
Howard Schweber says hurrah to that literally.
He is an expert in constitutional law, judicial politics and American democratic theory as a University of Wisconsin-Madison professor. I called him to talk about the play.
Schweber agreed that elevating the Constitution through popular culture is a good thing. "I love anything that can garner popular attention to issues of constitutionalism," he told me. "So as a project I'm all for it almost by definition no matter what it would say, so hurrah."
As for the dominance of rich white male interests from our country's beginning, Schweber said: "In my mind, wealth and race are much more explicitly and structurally protected in the Constitution than are any particular privileges of gender and have been from the very beginning."
He added: "Explicit constitutional protections for women's political rights came very late, but nothing in the Constitution specifically prevents granting rights to women or prevents states from protecting women." (Wisconsin just celebrated being the first state to ratify the amendment giving women the right to vote.) The Constitution, he said, set up explicit structures creating "discrimination based on race and income." He added, "By contrast, the repression and the disenfranchisement both literal and figurative of women have been carried out largely by politics."
He said a law like the recent one essentially forbidding abortion in Alabama is "explicitly written to create a constitutional controversy. They want to use this to challenge Roe (v. Wade) and they want the (U.S.) Supreme Court to weigh in on it. That's the point of passing what they know is an unconstitutional law. So it's very calculated."
I told Schweber, who has not seen "What the Constitution Means to Me," that the audience seemed reluctant to scrap the Constitution because, in the current political climate, we might get something worse. "That's really a very smart observation, especially if you apply it historically," he said.
Was the Constitution as originally drafted as good as it could have been? "That's an unfair question," he said. "The fairer question is 'Was the Constitution as good as they were likely to be able to adopt?' "There was profound Southern resistance to issues of race. There was profound merchant and bank-based concern about protecting property rights. A law is always and by its nature conservative in the sense it exists to preserve the functioning of existing institutions. It's not really designed as a way to uproot things and engage a revolutionary change, so none of this is deeply surprising."
Schweber said his acquaintance Sanford Levinson, a University of Texas law professor, has for years asked audiences whether they would sign the original Constitution. So inspired, Schweber held a workshop a year ago titled, "Is it time to rewrite the Constitution?"
"The reaction among experts was really quite similar to what you're describing as the reaction of the audience," he said, "which is, 'Wow, there are a lot of problems, but wow, do we not trust the current political system that we have to write a better one.' " Schweber recalled what he described as a "lovely exchange of letters" between Abigail Adams and her husband, future president John Adams, in which she complained that he was "agitating" only for the rights of men in writing the Constitution. "What about women?" she wrote.
"His answer is basically, 'For heaven's sake, we can't take that on now.' " Schweber concluded by pointing out how women's concerns have been slighted in laws and politics through time, and that people might react by assuming a new Constitution is the answer.
That's not his hope.
"As you say, the audiences seems to have a healthy caution about that. But hopefully, the next sentence is, 'But boy, do we need to reform some of our laws.' If that's the reaction, then that's, to me, entirely salutary." CREDIT: By Paul Fanlund ; Paul Fanlund is editor and publisher of The Capital Times

Texto completo: Today is Wednesday, June 19, the 170th day of 2019. There are 195 days left in the year.
Today's Highlight in History:
On June 19, 1865, Union troops arrived in Galveston, Texas, with news that the Civil War was over, and that all remaining slaves in Texas were free - an event celebrated to this day as "Juneteenth.
On this date:
In 1775, George Washington was commissioned by the Continental Congress as commander in chief of the Continental Army.
In 1917, during World War I, King George V ordered the British royal family to dispense with German titles and surnames; the family took the name "Windsor.
In 1934, the Federal Communications Commission was created; it replaced the Federal Radio Commission.
In 1938, 47 people were killed when a railroad bridge in Montana collapsed, sending a train known as the Olympian hurtling into Custer Creek.
In 1944, during World War II, the two-day Battle of the Philippine Sea began, resulting in a decisive victory for the U.S. over the Japanese.
In 1952, the U.S. Army Special Forces, the elite unit of fighters known as the Green Berets, was established at Fort Bragg, North Carolina.
In 1953, Julius Rosenberg, 35, and his wife, Ethel, 37, were convicted of conspiring to pass U.S. atomic secrets to the Soviet Union, were executed at Sing Sing Prison in Ossining, New York.
In 1964, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was approved by the U.S. Senate, 73-27, after surviving a lengthy filibuster.
In 1987, the Supreme Court struck down a Louisiana law requiring any public school teaching evolution to teach creation science as well.
In 2006, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice warned North Korea it would face consequences if it test-fired a missile thought to be powerful enough to reach the West Coast of the U.S.
In 2017, Otto Warmbier, a 22-year-old U.S. college student, died in a Cincinnati hospital after being released by North Korea in a coma after over a year in captivity.
Ten years ago: New York Times reporter David S. Rohde and Afghan reporter Tahir Ludin escaped from militant captors after more than seven months in captivity in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Texas billionaire R. Allen Stanford was indicted and jailed on charges his international banking empire was really just a Ponzi scheme built on lies, bluster and bribery. Stanford was sentenced to 110 years in prison after being convicted of bilking investors in a $7.2 billion scheme that involved the sale of fraudulent certificates of deposits.
Five years ago: President Barack Obama announced he was dispatching 300 U.S. military advisers to Iraq to help quell a rising insurgency. Rep. Kevin McCarthy of California won election as House majority leader as Republicans shuffled their leadership in the wake of Rep. Eric Cantor's primary defeat in Virginia. Gerry Goffin, 75, a prolific and multi-dimensional lyricist who with his then-wife and songwriter partner Carole King wrote such hits as "Will You Love Me Tomorrow, '(You Make Me Feel Like) a Natural Woman, 'Up On The Roof, and "The Loco-Motion, died in Los Angeles.
One year ago: The U.S. said it was pulling out of the United Nations' Human Rights Council, a day after the U.N. human rights chief denounced the Trump administration for separating migrant children from their parents; U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley cited longstanding U.S. complaints that the council was biased against Israel. Koko, a western lowland gorilla who was taught sign language at an early age as a scientific test subject and eventually learned more than 1,000 words, died at the Gorilla Foundation's preserve in California's Santa Cruz mountains at the age of 46.

Texto completo: MOSCOW - The Kremlin warned on Monday that reported U.S. hacking into Russia's electric power grid could escalate into a cyberwar with the United States, but insisted that it was confident in the system's ability to repel electronic attacks.
Dmitri S. Peskov, President Vladimir Putin's spokesman also raised concerns that President Donald Trump was reportedly not informed about the effort, which was the subject of a New York Times report on Saturday that detailed an elaborate system of cyber-tools deployed by the United States inside Russia's energy system and other targets.
The program, as described by current and former unidentified U.S. officials, would enable an attack on the Russia power grid in the event of major conflict between Moscow and Washington.
It was deployed, the Times reported, after years of public warnings from U.S. security agencies about similar aggressive actions conducted by Russia. This information means that there is a hypothetican possibility" of cyberwar fare against Russia, Peskov said.
It is under how deeply the so-called software implants have penetrated into the Russia power grid. Russia's Energy Ministry said in a statement that it had receive no information about attacks against its system, which is defended separately by various companies that manage it.
"The Russian energy power grid has a high level of security," the ministry said in a statement, noting that most of the critically important facilities are connected to the state defense system. "Systemic and successful work is being carried out to use Russian technology and equipment to eliminate such risks."
Peskov echoed that statement, but also said that "vitally important spheres of our economy have been targeted with cyberattacks from abroad."
"We have said it many times that our relevant agencies are constantly fighting against them in order to make sure these attacks inflict no damage on our economy and sensitive spheres," he said.
Putin has tried repeatedly "to initiate international cooperation in order to jointly counter all forms of cybercrime," Peskov added, but the United States has not responded.

Resumen: Writer and lawyer Emily Bazelon argues that the election of more reform-minded prosecutors could help reduce America’s soaring incarceration rates.

Texto completo: Not long after his 2017 election as Brooklyn’s district attorney, Eric Gonzalez gave a speech in which he declared that “The real cultural shift I’m going to be asking prosecutors in my office to make is considering jail as the last option.” In most American cities that would be an extraordinary statement coming from a prosecutor. In this case, however, it followed a campaign during which one commentator tweeted that it was “stunning to see Brooklyn DA candidates competing to go softer on crime.” 
According to Emily Bazelon, the country is in dire need of prosecutors who think like Gonzalez. In her rigorous, compassionate, and vital book, Charged: The New Movement to Transform American Prosecution and End Mass Incarceration , she shines light on a critical but under-examined feature of the criminal justice system: the role of prosecutors in America’s crisis-level incarceration rates. People like Gonzalez, she contends, who are thinking differently about fairness and mercy, represent “the most promising means of reform … on the political landscape.”
A staff writer for the New York Times Magazine who’s also a lawyer, Bazelon argues that the explosion in America’s prison population (currently around 2.2 million people, a number the author believes could be safely cut in half) has largely resulted from the imbalance in our justice system, which gives the upper hand to the prosecution. Most district attorneys in this country are elected and commonly strive to present themselves to constituents as tough on crime; Bazelon laments that DAs often appear more concerned with notching wins than with serving justice.
Bazelon methodically demonstrates that prosecutors, at every step of the process, have outsize power, whether it’s in deciding how a defendant will be charged, in influencing how bail is set, even in choosing to punish black defendants more severely than white ones. 
The author is particularly strong in arguing for the elimination of cash bail, which, in effect, punishes defendants for being poor. Those in jail who can’t afford bail often feel pressured into accepting a plea deal rather than languishing in pretrial detention, especially when prosecutors threaten them with stiff sentences if they risk a trial and lose. (It’s disturbing, but not terribly surprising, that “about 18 percent of exonerations – DNA and non-DNA, death sentences and other penalties – involve defendants who pleaded guilty.”) The overwhelming majority of criminal convictions result not from trials but from guilty pleas – the rate is as high as 95% in many states.  
Bazelon gives these processes a human face by following two young people through the system and alternating their stories throughout the book. One is 20-year-old Kevin (not his real name), a Brooklynite from the housing projects of Brownsville who’s arrested on a gun charge. The other is Noura Jackson, a Tennessee teenager convicted of the brutal 2005 murder of her mother; she spent nearly a decade in prison before the state’s supreme court, citing prosecutorial misconduct, overturned her conviction.
In tracking the two cases, Bazelon deftly shows how different approaches to prosecution can produce vastly different outcomes. Jackson was the victim of an overzealous prosecutor determined to win a conviction despite glaring weaknesses in the case. In Brooklyn, on the other hand, Kevin, after pleading guilty to criminal possession of a weapon, was allowed to enter a year-long diversion program that offered him the opportunity to stay out of prison and have his conviction erased from his record if he followed a strict set of rules (random drug testing, nightly curfew, visits with a social worker).
The two cases highlight the difference between prosecutors who use their power primarily to lock people up and those who believe that the public interest is better served by offering, where appropriate, social services and second chances. Bazelon urges us to consider, too, what we want our criminal justice system to accomplish. Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who spent five years as a prosecutor in the Manhattan DA’s office, looked back on the experience and said, “We think we’re keeping people safe from criminals. We’re just making worse criminals.”
Mass incarceration is such an intractable American problem, but one gets the feeling that “Charged” could be a game-changer, giving voice and momentum to a growing desire for reform. (The lengthy appendix, which lays out concrete steps to fix the broken system, will surely help.) There are 2,400 prosecutors in elected office across the country. While reform-minded DAs are still in the minority, they’ve won races in cities and counties nationwide, including Philadelphia, Houston, and Kansas City, Kansas. “Local prosecutors handle more than 95 percent of the nation’s criminal docket,” Bazelon observes, meaning that change, if it is to come, will come from the grassroots. To ensure that meaningful criminal justice reform is enacted, as this important and powerful book urges, citizens must begin by paying attention.

Texto completo: One of the areas of the newspaper that I get the most questions about is the editorial cartoons on the Opinion page.
Often, those conversations include a reader demanding to know if I really think the opinion expressed in the cartoon is funny.
That answer is simple: No, generally, I do not.
While there is a humorous tone to some cartoons, the panels are much more about conveying a message - on politics, society or whatever the subject - than making us laugh. There's a reason they are published on the Opinion page and not the Comics page.
While I don't find them "funny," typically, I do find them thought-provoking, layered and often scorching with satire. Sometimes I agree with the sentiment conveyed, and sometimes I do not. That's because the editorial page is intended to encompass a vast array of perspectives on various topics.
Examples of controversial editorial cartoons exist throughout history, going back to the days of Benjamin Franklin, who published cartoons about the "dis-united state" of the colonies. The cartoon "Join or Die" is credited with helping stir public support for a unified country.
But in recent years in particular, a backlash against the medium has some newspapers panicked about public reaction.
That concern prompted The New York Times last week to stop publishing the work of editorial cartoonists in its international print edition and on its website. This follows The Times' decision to discontinue its weekly roundup of syndicated cartoons, similar to the TH's "Drawing Conclusions" each Saturday.
The Times employs two cartoonists, and I think losing their voices on the editorial page is a shame.
Papers our size don't employ editorial cartoonists but instead purchase cartoons by artists from bigger publications or freelancers. As more papers go the route of the Times and fire their cartoonists, the world will see their profession continue to shrink. That's a loss.
TH readers don't have to agree with every editorial cartoon. In fact, they can't because we publish cartoons expressing diametrically opposing viewpoints. That's intentional. We make a calculated effort to publish cartoons expressing opinions on both sides of issues.
Most readers who complain about our cartoons do so because of the way the president is depicted, and indeed, President Trump is often satirized.
But this has been the trend regarding cartoons and presidents long before Trump took office. (Even Abraham Lincoln was not spared.)
Just as late-night comedians tend to pick on whoever occupies the White House, Republican or Democrat, so do editorial cartoonists. That trend has picked up for Trump, whose non-stop tweets and actions breaking the "presidential mold" provide plenty of fodder for cartoonists.
We'll keep seeking to find balance on our editorial page. But I hope readers will try to appreciate the artistic value and incisive opinions that editorial cartoons bring.

Texto completo: Would you trust Facebook with your money?
On Tuesday, Facebook confirmed it would launch a digital global currency similar to Bitcoin, called Libra, aimed at users around the world who don't have bank accounts.
But there's another reason Facebook is introducing Libra, said Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter: It's an opportunity to get some of its more than 2 billion users to shop through the platform.
"Facebook is merely trying to facilitate commercial activity for its customers, and the endgame is to offer links to brands they care about," he said.
The currency is managed by the Libra network, co-founded by several companies in both the payments and tech industries, including Facebook, eBay, Uber, Lyft, PayPal and Visa.
"Moving money around the world should be as easy and cheap as sending a text message," reads a description on Libra's website, noting more than 1. 7 billion people worldwide don't have a bank account.
With Facebook's massive user base, even a small portion of that audience jumping to cryptocurrency gives Libra a boost, said Pachter. "Even 1% is 20 million people. That’s enough," he said.
However, Libra could magnify privacy issues such as its stewardship over user data that have landed Facebook in hot water. Last month, a co-founder of Facebook wrote a New York Times op-ed calling for a breakup of the tech giant, which CEO Mark Zuckerberg has said would make its effort to resolve privacy issues more difficult.
Meanwhile, Litan said people concerned with Facebook's response to privacy issues have likely left the platform, while the users who stay and decide to use Libra will give up even more data.
"You’ll end up with bigger privacy issues going forward, frankly," said Litan.

Trump’s troubling trade tirades

Texto completo: President Donald Trump has declared victory in his confrontation with Mexico. After he threatened to impose crippling tariffs on $350 billion worth of goods Mexico exports annually to the U.S., that country’s leaders agreed to measures aimed at impeding asylum-seekers from Central America that flow through Mexico headed for the American border.
"If we didn’t have tariffs, we wouldn’t have made a deal with Mexico," Trump trumpeted. "We got everything we wanted."
The short-term headlines were certainly favorable to the president, who has made hostility toward immigrants a core component of his political appeal. But the long-term cost to Trump could be very damaging. The president’s strongest argument for a second term is a vibrant economy, and his actions are jeopardizing fiscal stability and his own re-election chances.
The clash with Mexico is part of a much larger pattern in which the president blusters and bullies his way around the world, threatening trading partners from China and Japan to France and Canada if they don’t knuckle under to his demands. And the backlash is already blossoming.
The U.S. economy added only 75,000 new jobs last month, one of the lowest monthly totals since the last recession ended 10 years ago, and those results reflect a global economic slowdown that many economists blame at least in part on Trump’s trade tirades.
The World Bank cited "rising trade protectionism" as a prime cause of weakening economic growth in 2018. James Bullard, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, said recently that the U.S. "faces an economy that is expected to grow more slowly going forward, with some risk that the slowdown could be sharper than expected due to ongoing global trade regime uncertainty."
Republican senators were so alarmed at Trump’s bellicose threats toward Mexico that they were preparing to block new tariffs before the president canceled them. "We are going to have a lot of our members who are very concerned about where this is headed," said Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, the second-ranking Republican, to The New York Times. Since a healthy economy remains a prime GOP campaign issue, he added, "I don’t know why we would want to step on that."
The Wall Street Journal warned in an editorial that "the effects of trade uncertainty are rippling out," and that the May jobs report was "a flashing yellow light that Mr. Trump needs to settle his trade wars and get back to promoting growth."
The economic slowdown is not the only thing signaling danger for the president. For one thing, the new steps designed to halt asylum-seekers, such as the deployment of Mexican National Guard troops, probably won’t work. The basic reasons these migrants take so many risks to reach the U.S. — declining opportunities and rising violence back home — have not changed.
Moreover, a key element of the new agreement, under which asylum-seekers would be returned to Mexico and not allowed to remain in the U.S., is under legal assault. One federal judge has already ruled against the policy, and while his decision has been stayed by a higher court, many immigration lawyers say Trump’s approach violates well-established international principles protecting vulnerable migrants.
Judge William Fletcher has predicted that when the issue is fully briefed and argued, the government’s positions will be revealed "for what they are: baseless arguments in support of an illegal policy."
A third risk involves the politics of trade and immigration. Yes, Trump’s base is cheering him on. But when Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other Democrats accuse the president of governing by "tantrum," they are poking at one of his greatest liabilities: the fear among swing voters, mainly educated women, that an erratic and undisciplined president jeopardizes the security and well-being of their families.
The brightest warning light, however, foreshadows the impact of Trump’s policies on the economy. Businesses detest chaos and confusion, but the president firmly believes that he thrives in precisely those conditions. And after his encounter with Mexico, he seems more emboldened than ever to raise tensions with trading partners by threatening new penalties.
"Protectionism shows no signs of abating; rather, it is intensifying," Joshua Shapiro, chief U.S. economist at MFR Inc., told the Times.
Myron Brilliant, head of international affairs at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, added on CNBC: "The weaponization of tariffs — the increase of threats on our economy, and on our farmers, our manufacturers, our consumers — is going to hurt our country."
Those farmers, manufacturers and consumers also vote. And Trump’s tariff tirades risk undermining economic growth, and alienating those voters, just as his re-election campaign is accelerating.

Along the way, she learned to say what people wanted to hear and do what her coaches told her to do, and that wasn't a bad way to live.
It led the Los Angeles native to six Olympic gold medals and nine Olympic medals overall, tied for the most won by a female track and field athlete, and earned her universal admiration for competing cleanly in a sport where an unusual result triggers immediate suspicion of cheating.
Not until she gave birth to her daughter, Camryn, in November via cesarean section and kept vigil at the neonatal intensive care unit for a month while her premature baby gained strength did Felix make a vital discovery: She had to speak her own truths, even if that means she can't be everything to everyone else.

"I'm a people-pleaser by nature. And so I want to make sure I have all the boxes ticked and everybody's happy. It's just, that's not realistic. It's just not. And that's all right," said Felix, who resumed training on the track in March with a goal of competing at the U.S. championships in July and at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.
"For me, it's definitely been a journey to get to this place," she said. "I've never been one to speak out on things or shake things up, but I do think becoming a mother has refined my voice, especially on issues that I feel like I can't remain silent."
Felix, 33, recently spoke out in support of Alysia Montano, Kara Goucher and other female athletes who said they weren't guaranteed salaries by sponsor Nike during and after pregnancy. Montano and Goucher also told the New York Times that they lost their health insurance from the U.S. Olympic Committee and USA Track and Field while having their children.
The USOC said it's working on reforms to prevent pregnant athletes from losing health insurance coverage; a Nike spokeswoman said in a statement that the company created a policy in 2018 that standardized its approach "so no female athlete is penalized financially for pregnancy."
The statement also said Nike was waiving performance-pay reductions for 12 months for those athletes who decide to have a baby and will include terms of that policy in its contracts with athletes.
Felix doesn't plan to have another child while under contract to Nike and wouldn't benefit from policy changes but felt compelled to speak.
"Something about being a mother that it's bigger than yourself. It's not about you any longer. Where it's like, OK, I can take some heat. I'm not doing this for myself," she said. "It is crazy that it's 2019 and these are still things that we're fighting for and even crazier Nike didn't do anything illegal. They were within their rights. And I think that's even the bigger conversation to be had. Should that be the case?
"I think it's important to keep these brands accountable. I don't hate Nike. I'm proud of the things that we've done over the past decade together, so it's not about that. It's about the industry as a whole and how can we change this and how can we make it right for women. ... It's shown me the power in our voices. They came out, they spoke and things happened. It's scary to come out. It's risky. There's consequences. But there sometimes is action that's involved with that."
While she gets accustomed to her new voice, she's adjusting to a new normal.
Her husband, former runner Kenneth Ferguson, works for Chrysler, and she alternates training at UCLA with training in Michigan. At least her longtime coach, Bob Kersee, travels to work with her.
"I think I put in my time following him around. It's my turn," she said, smiling. Her mother, Marlean, and father, Paul, pastor at Fairview Heights Baptist Church in Inglewood, help with Camryn and sometimes bring her to the track.
Camryn, now past 6 months old, enjoys being a wriggly, giggly exercise tool. "She thinks it's very funny to be lifted all over the place and do squats with mom and that kind of stuff," Felix said.
Felix tries to make her workouts more efficient to minimize her time away from Camryn but doesn't want to cheat her training, and she's several months behind where her fitness level would usually be.
She plans to compete in the 400-meter run, the event in which Shaunae Miller of the Bahamas edged her for gold with a finish-line dive at the 2016 Rio Olympics, though she might run some 200s, her favorite race and the distance of her memorable gold-medal triumph at London in 2012.
Her competitiveness hasn't vanished, but there's now a tug on her heart. "There are times I'm checking my phone. Does she need anything? Is everything good? It's just getting the balance right," she said. "I'm still trying to figure it out. I have days where I feel like, 'Am I doing enough as a mom? Am I doing enough as an athlete? Am I doing enough as a wife?' Like, how do I get it all straight?"
Few people do. "That's what I've learned," she said, "that it's OK not to have it all figured out." That includes being patient with herself and coping with less sleep. "It's different coming back from pregnancy because things that were once really easy for you are now difficult," she said.
Like what? "Running," she said. "Endurance. I might have a workout where I run a 600 and that might be typically relatively easy for me, but now it's more challenging because my body is different now and I'm getting back into lifting. It's kind of like, 'OK, what does my new body feel like? And how much can I push it?' I'm getting back to myself, but I'm not there yet."
Competing in Tokyo remains her ambition, but she's approaching her quest with a different context. It took her time to understand why, after she triumphed in the 200 at London in 2012 following runner-up finishes at Athens and Beijing, she didn't feel as complete as she'd imagined she would. It was because she had put more importance on the medal than on the journey.
"It was about the ups and downs and everything that happened along the way that allowed me to grow to a place where I was ready for all that," she said. "It's not just about the one gold medal. I think about all the different things that have happened to me leading up to Tokyo, that have made me stronger, that have tested my character. It's about those things, and it would be amazing to have it culminate with a gold medal, but I don't think that's going to change me as a person, adding that."
She spoke in a voice that was sure and clear. Her own truths, her own eloquence, her own triumph.

Texto completo: HONG KONG -- The Chinese government on Monday voiced strong support for Hong Kong's embattled chief executive, Carrie Lam, a day after yet another vast street protest against her government rattled the leadership in Beijing and the local political establishment.
The Foreign Ministry issued a forceful endorsement of Mrs. Lam on Monday. Beijing's representatives in Hong Kong called in dozens of local politicians and business leaders to urge them to support her. And the Chinese state media began praising Mrs. Lam even as government censors assiduously tried to block word of the Hong Kong protests from reaching the public in mainland China.
But after three huge demonstrations over eight days, and her retreat on a proposal that would have allowed Hong Kong residents to be prosecuted in China's opaque judicial system, it was unclear how long she would continue to govern.
The latest protest, on Sunday, was the largest yet, with a crowd that organizers estimated at almost two million in a city of seven million people. While Mrs. Lam had indefinitely suspended her push for the Beijing-backed extradition bill the day before, protesters still filled the streets, calling for her to withdraw the legislation instead of suspending it, and demanding that she resign.
While Mrs. Lam, a lifelong veteran of Hong Kong's fractious politics who was appointed chief executive two years ago, has refused to bow to the protesters' jeering calls for her to quit, democracy advocates in Hong Kong vowed to press on.
"Carrie Lam must step down," said Joshua Wong, a student leader who, coincidentally, was released from prison on Monday after serving a two-month sentence for refusing to leave a protest site in 2014 during a democracy push known as the Umbrella Movement.
"More and more Hong Kong people -- not only one million, two million people -- will come to join our fight until we get back our basic human rights and freedom," he said.
In addition to calling for Mrs. Lam to step down and fully withdraw the bill, the protesters -- emboldened and angered after her partial concession on Saturday -- have called for an impartial investigation into the police use of force against demonstrators and for a rescinding of the official description of clashes with the police on Wednesday as an illegal riot.
On Monday night, the territory's top police official tried to address the last demand, saying that only five people had been charged with rioting and that the police did not consider those who participated peacefully in the protest to be rioters. But he brushed aside accusations that officers had used excessive force.
Any resignation by Mrs. Lam would prompt strong demands by democracy activists for her successor to be chosen in free and open elections. But the Communist Party leadership in Beijing, loath to allow any steps that might jeopardize one-party control on the mainland, is unlikely to let them be held.
The political sensitivities over the events in Hong Kong were evident as the Chinese authorities worked around the clock to keep most of the mainland in the dark about the demonstrations.
On Monday, online censors continued to delete reports and images from the protests. While the terms "Hong Kong" and "against extradition to China" were among the most popular queries on the microblogging platform Sina Weibo, according to freeweibo.com, which tracks censorship on the site, searches turned up only limited results, some describing protesters as thugs.
Searches for the term "Hong Kong protests" returned mostly state-approved news, often portraying the demonstrations as instigated by foreign forces, while queries of "Fight on, Hong Kong" were blocked altogether by reason of "relevant laws and regulations." There was no mention of Hong Kong on the Monday evening news on CCTV, the main state broadcaster.
Some on the mainland were able to circumvent censors by posting inverted or distorted images of the protests. Others appeared to make more oblique references to the protests, posting Cantonese songs like Lo Ta-Yu's "Queen's Road East" and "Boundless Oceans, Vast Skies" by the Hong Kong rock band Beyond.
Hu Jia, a prominent dissident in Beijing, said he had learned about what was happening in Hong Kong only on Thursday, four days after the first protest, which organizers said drew more than one million people.
Like many other activists, Mr. Hu said he had been under increased scrutiny by the authorities recently because of the 30th anniversary of the June 4, 1989, crackdown in Tiananmen Square. With China now blocking many virtual private networks, or VPNs, which some Chinese surreptitiously use to connect to the outside world, he struggled for days to find information.
When he was finally able to connect and see the events in Hong Kong, he said, he was "moved to tears."
"After the Umbrella Movement was suppressed in 2014, I thought there would be no way that Hong Kong could have this kind of democratic expression again," Mr. Hu said in a telephone interview.
"But what happened in the last week was like magic," he added. "I suddenly felt as if Hong Kong's flower of freedom had opened again, and it was very bright."
In Beijing, there were signs of political uncertainty. The Foreign Ministry's English-language translation of the news conference where the government endorsed Mrs. Lam omitted any reference to her. And 10 academics in Beijing who focus on Hong Kong, some of whom were eager to speak about the issue last week, turned down requests for comment on Monday. Several said it was an inconvenient time.
That caution set in as the Chinese government made clear that, at least temporarily, it would come to Mrs. Lam's political rescue.
The Central Liaison Office, which represents the Chinese government and the Communist Party in Hong Kong, gathered dozens of business leaders and pro-Beijing local politicians on Sunday at its offices to ask that they maintain their support for Mrs. Lam.
Those in attendance then vied on Sunday and Monday to show who could show the most loyalty to Mrs. Lam. Chan Wing-kee, a pro-Beijing lawmaker, used an enthusiastic local Cantonese term to say that he "very much supported" Mrs. Lam.
While Beijing may be reluctant to be seen as conceding to public pressure and sacrificing Mrs. Lam immediately, there was intense speculation in Hong Kong about whether she would be allowed to serve out the remaining three years of her five-year term as chief executive. All three of her predecessors as chief executive since the handover of the territory by Britain in 1997 left under a cloud.
The leading candidate to succeed her is not her deputy, Chief Secretary Matthew Cheung, who turns 69 this year and has shown no interest in elective politics.
The top candidate instead is the territory's third-ranking official, Paul Chan, who serves as financial secretary. Mr. Chan is the political protégé of Leung Chun-ying, a former Hong Kong chief executive who defeated the 2014 Umbrella Movement, and he is part of a clique of business professionals with strong ties to Beijing.
If Mrs. Lam steps down, the most likely rival for Mr. Chan to be appointed by Beijing as the chief executive is Regina Ip, a lawmaker and former security minister who played a key role in unsuccessful national security legislation in 2003.
Mrs. Ip now leads a local political party that emphasizes law and order and is fairly popular, but she is deeply distrusted by democracy advocates.
President Xi Jinping returned to Beijing on Sunday night from a four-day trip for previously scheduled meetings in Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. By Monday afternoon, he had not yet made a public appearance, and on Monday night the Chinese government announced that Mr. Xi would make a trip in the coming days to North Korea, his first as the country's leader.
Wang Yang and Han Zheng -- the two of the seven Politburo Standing Committee members who had expressed support for the extradition bill -- also laid low on Monday.
Mrs. Lam began an energetic effort to rebuild public support. She gathered presidents and principals from the city's universities, high schools and elementary schools, as well as local religious leaders, for a large meeting at her official residence.

Britain bans ads with gender stereotypes, derogatory body image messages

Texto completo: The question was plastered throughout London's subway system, and so was the model doing the asking. Clad in a tiny yellow bikini, her rib cage clearly visible, the woman squinted her eyes, pursed her lips and mused, "Are you beach body ready?"
The ad peddling a weight-loss product got a huge response, although probably not the one its creators had hoped to receive. More than 70,000 people signed an online petition insisting the advertisements be taken down. The campaign also helped kick-start a review by the United Kingdom's Advertising Standards Authority.
The result: No more gender stereotypes - including bone-thin models in scant bikinis - in British commercials, social media campaigns or online ads.
The new guidelines prohibit ads that play up roles deemed more feminine or male, as well as derogatory messages around body image. That would include a TV spot, for example, that shows children making a mess while a man props up his feet and a woman cleans up, or ads showing a man who can't change a diaper or a woman who can't park a car.
Advertising that links physique and body image to a successful romantic or social life is also prohibited, as are ads that belittle men for doing stereotypical "female" tasks.
Gender stereotypes "can contribute to inequality in society, with costs for all of us," Guy Parker, chief executive of the Advertising Standards Authority, said in a statement.
"Put simply, we found that some portrayals in ads can, over time, play a part in limiting people's potential," he said. "It's in the interests of women and men, our economy and society that advertisers steer clear of these outdated portrayals."
The guidelines were approved in December, but the advertising industry was given six months to comply. Regulators will review any ads that could break the rules individually. And the guidelines don't cover everything: They wouldn't necessarily block ads that are targeted at one gender or simply show a woman shopping, for example.
The rules mimic ones adopted in Belgium, France, Norway, South Africa, India and elsewhere. A 1978 law, for example, bans sexism in Norwegian ads. Spain won't allow ads depicting gender violence, according to the New York Times. In the United States, advertising campaigns geared toward children have their own restrictions to ensure that content is appropriate and safe.
Yet Britain's guidelines raise questions about enforceability and practicality, said Beth Egan, an associate professor of advertising at Syracuse University.
Until the ban is tested, Egan said, it's hard to predict where the line will be drawn "between what's a gender stereotype and what's a representation of real life in the real world."
Plus, Egan said, Americans shouldn't assume that similar guidelines are around the corner here. The United States and Britain have significantly different standards and cultural expectations around privacy and regulation, even as they apply to ads promoting gender stereotypes.
"Our history is more about consumer backlash and self-regulation than allowing a voice from on high to come down and just say, 'you can't,' " Egan said.

Donald Trump doesn't need to worry about polls because he beat them before

Texto completo: President Trump should realize that he sounds dumb complaining about polls, given that he beat them all just two years ago.
“The polls” say the exact same thing now that they did then: that Trump’s set to lose the election.
On Election Day in 2016, Nate Silver was giving Hillary Clinton a 71% chance of becoming the next president. The New York Times was estimating that there was a 90% chance.
Those odds were based on the same polls that now show Trump losing in a matchup with Joe Biden, should be he become the Democratic nominee.
Trump on Monday tweeted that it’s only the “Fake Polls” showing him behind. What’s the opposite of “very stable genius”?
What he should be saying about the polls is, So what? I beat them in 2016 and I’ll beat them again.
It’s still unclear why polling was so off during the 2016 election. Some of it surely has to do with polling methods, which still largely rely on phone calls to landlines, excluding thousands, if not millions of people who no longer even use landlines. There were also scores of people who came out to vote when they were expected not to, given that they sat out past elections.
But there’s one factor when it comes to Trump that no poll will ever be able to register: the tendency of a substantial number of his supporters to lie.
The American Psychological Association released a study in May of 1,000 American voters who said after the 2016 election that they voted for a different candidate than the one they had publicly said they would. Among the study’s participants, 27% secretly voted for Clinton, but an astounding 54% voted for Trump.
The authors of the study said that there were three reasons for people to lie about the candidate they ended up voting for: First, a desire to maintain their reputation among those close to them; second, fear of being ostracized from social circles; and third, aversion to potential conflict with others who might disapprove.
Who can blame anyone for keeping their intention to vote for Trump a secret? Since 2015, he’s been constantly called a racist by the national media. The Democratic Party’s nominee in 2016 called his supporters "irredeemable." Who wants to upset their friends and family, let alone strangers, by being associated with that? Most people don’t like spending their time in disagreement, argument, and conflict. It's easier to lie and keep things nice.
Nobody knows if polls right now are an accurate reading of the electorate. What we do know is that when the question on the poll is about supporting Trump, they have been very wrong before.

Texto completo: Toby Fleishman is a catch. He’s a respected Manhattan doctor just north of 40 with two bright kids and “don’t forget, still with his hair. ” He’s recently split from his wife, Rachel, but a line of affluent, athleisure-clad women on dating apps seem to find him charming, ravenous to “set his weary heart afire with double entendre. ” What’s not to like?
Well. Taffy Brodesser-Akner’s assured and spiky novel about a busted marriage, “Fleishman Is in Trouble” (Random House, 384 pp. , ★★★½ out of four) is an assault on misleading surfaces. In most domestic novels, that means revelations of an affair, a hidden trauma or a long-buried family crisis. But Brodesser-Akner is after something more common yet more subtle: the inability of two members of a couple to simply hear each other, and how that miscommunication is often gendered.
“Anyone who has ever been to just one session of couples therapy could tell you that beyond your point of view lies an abyss with a bubbling cauldron of fire, and that just beyond that abyss lies your spouse’s point of view,” she writes.
At first, the chasm between Toby and Rachel seems straightforward. Toby is minding the kids and his career, pursuing a much-craved promotion. Meanwhile, Rachel, a high-powered agent — her biggest client is the creator of a “Hamilton”-esque musical about Woodrow Wilson’s wife — has gone AWOL since the split, unresponsive to days of calls and texts. That’s enough time for Toby to doom Rachel as a Bad Mom, nurse slights and get drunk on dating-app profiles.
Caught in the middle is Toby’s friend and the novel’s narrator, Elizabeth, who’s learned a few lessons about gender roles while working at a men’s magazine. For her, Rachel’s vanishing act is a problem for sure, but Toby’s I’m-the-victim keening about how Rachel “went for his masculinity like it was an artery” blows matters out of proportion at Rachel’s expense. As Elizabeth puts it: “Whatever kind of woman you are, even when you’re a lot of kinds of women, you’re still always just a woman, which is to say you’re always a little bit less than a man. ”
Brodesser-Akner, who like Elizabeth toiled at men’s mags before her current post at the New York Times, is a top-notch feature writer thanks to her hyper-observant sensibility, which serves her well as a novelist. Equally important, she’s a master of structure, knowing what to withhold to keep a reader’s interest. For most of “Fleishman Is in Trouble,” she conceals details of Rachel’s disappearance: What kind of woman would vaporize on her husband, kids, job, just like that?
Well. The final third of the novel cannily upends our understanding of the Fleishmans’ relationship, exposing what kind of labor in a marriage is valued, what culturally qualifies as good parenting, why the bar for being considered a good dad is so low and why the one for being deemed an unfit mother is even lower. “Fleishman” is a highly entertaining novel about 40-something foibles, but it also delivers a piercing message about just how much within a relationship is prone to misinterpretation.

Texto completo: In 2010, Kinect for Microsoft's Xbox gaming system, in which users played with gestures and spoken commands rather than a controller, was ready to go to market.
But just before it did, a woman who worked for the company took the game home to play with her family, and a funny thing happened. The motion-sensing devices worked just fine for her husband, but not so much for her or her children.
That's because the system had been tested on men ages 18 to 35 and didn't recognize as well the body motions of women and children, said Peggy Johnson, executive vice president of business development at Microsoft.
And that, Ms. Johnson told an audience at the New Rules Summit, is what happens when teams aren't diverse.
"You want diverse teams because it's good to have diverse teams, but that could have had a real business impact," she said. "It could have been disastrous."
[Video: Peggy Johnson of Microsoft and Meredith Whittaker of the AI Now Institute, in conversation with Nellie Bowles, technology reporter for The New York Times, at the New Rules Summit. Watch on YouTube.]
Women and people of color are fighting many battles in the tech world and in the fast-growing world of artificial intelligence. The other panel member, Meredith Whittaker, a founder and a director of the AI Now Institute at New York University, noted that voice recognition tools that rely on A.I. often don't recognize higher-pitched voices.
And, she said, it has been well publicized that facial recognition is far more accurate with lighter-skin men than with women and, especially, with darker-skin people.
That's because if white men are used much more frequently to train A.I. software, it will much more easily recognize their voices and faces.
"This is a classic example of A.I. bias," said Ms. Whittaker, who also works at Google. "It's almost never white men who are discriminated against by these systems. They replicate historical marginalization."
Other examples: A Microsoft customer was testing a financial-services algorithm that did risk scoring for loans. "As they were training the data set, the data was of previously approved loans that largely were for men," Ms. Johnson said. "The algorithm clearly said men are a better risk."
And the "canonical example," Ms. Whittaker said, was Amazon's efforts to use A.I. for hiring; the computer models were being trained using résumés submitted over the past 10 years, and most came from men. Therefore it was "taught" that men were better job candidates.
"It was penalizing résumés that had the word 'women' in it, such as if you went to a women's college," she said. "Your résumé was spit out."
Not only does this show how easily algorithms can reflect society's bias, but it also "exposed years and years of discriminatory hiring practices at Amazon," she said, "showcasing very starkly the lack of diversity."
Amazon tried to change the algorithm, but eventually abandoned it.
Ms. Whittaker said the aim should not just be about creating good algorithms, because they would still reflect structural biases in society in how they are used, such as "replicating discriminatory policing practices or amplifying surveillance or worker control."
For example, she said, tenants in Brooklyn are fighting a landlord who wants to replace a lock and key entry system with facial recognition. In a letter opposing that, the AI Now institute supported the tenants' fear of increased surveillance and that the inaccuracy in facial recognition, especially of nonwhites, would lead them to be locked out.
"Let's not just talk about statistical parity within a given A.I. system, but just and equitable uses of A.I. systems," she said.
The bad news, Ms. Whittaker said, is that as tech companies become more powerful, they also become less diverse.
"The people at the top look more and more the same," she said. And fewer, not more, women are getting bachelor's degrees in computer science. According to the National Center for Education Statistics, 28 percent of bachelor's degrees in computer and information science went to women in the year 2000; in 2016 it was 18 percent.
Ms. Whittaker helped organize an international walkout at Google last year to protest the company's handling of sexual harassment, an event that she said was the culmination of years of frustration.
"A lot of people who had worked within Google in good faith for a long time said we need new forms of pushback," she said. "We can't keep showing up to your panels and keep serving on your diversity committees. We need to achieve structural change.
"The problems are not simply that we're not getting promotions, or opportunity inequity or pay inequity or that women and people of color are more often slotted into contract roles instead of hired full time, but it is also affecting the world beyond. The products that are created in these environments reflect these cultures, and that's having an impact on billions of people."
Ms. Whittaker said she and her co-organizer of the walkout, Claire Stapleton, faced retaliation for their political activism; Ms. Stapleton left Google this month.
"It's so discouraging to think this is still going on," said Ms. Johnson, who is an engineer and has been in the technology field for over 30 years. "But what I always think the way to turn anything around is to shine a light on it. You keep the light on there until the data surfaces, and then you have to find a way to fix it. It's not a 'check the box and move on, everyone take unconscious bias training and we're all good now.' You have to keep at it, keep at it, keep at it."

Texto completo: What's Streaming
DAS BOOT (2018) Stream on Hulu. Like the 1981 film of the same name, the TV series is adapted from Lothar-Günther Buchheim's 1973 book "Das Boot." When the show opens, it's 1942. France has been occupied, the Americans have cracked the Enigma code (but the Germans don't know this yet) and German soldiers stationed in La Rochelle, France, are preparing for the U-612 submarine's maiden voyage. But with an inexperienced captain (Rick Okon) and 40 young men in an enclosed space bound for war, tensions arise and loyalties falter. Back in La Rochelle, Simone Strasser (Vicky Krieps), a Nazi translator with a French background, grows increasingly torn between her loyalty to her employer and the draw of the French resistance.
YARDIE (2018) Stream on Amazon. Idris Elba's directorial debut, "Yardie," centers on D, an aspiring rapper living in Kingston, Jamaica, in the 1970s. Involved in the drug trade, D gets sent to London in the '80s, where he reunites with his childhood girlfriend and their daughter. But when D encounters the man who killed his brother 10 years earlier, he decides to seek revenge. The Amazon Original film is based off Victor Headley's 1992 novel of the same name. In The New York Times review, Jeannette Catsoulis wrote: "'Yardie' (the title is Jamaican patois for a gang member) has something to say about the way immigrants can become trapped in the loyalties and vendettas of their homelands."
PENELOPE KEITH'S VILLAGE OF THE YEAR Stream on Acorn TV. Actress Penelope Keith hosts a competition show that likely wouldn't be made anywhere but Britain: Keith, along with her team of three judges (an archaeologist, craft expert and garden designer), travel from village to village soaking in each destination's charm and beauty. They partake in local events like custard pie-throwing contests, observe villagers who carry barrels through the mountains and visit surfing communities, all with the mission of finding the best village in Britain.
What's on TV
GRAND HOTEL 10 p.m. on ABC. Based on a telenovela and with Eva Longoria as executive producer, this new show revolves around the last family-owned hotel in Miami Beach. On the surface, Santiago Mendoza (Demián Bichir), the owner, his second wife Gigi (Roselyn Sanchez) and their children have the perfect life. But secrets and scandals lurk behind the facade. The drama is told as an upstairs/downstairs narrative: The story follow the lives of the staff of the Grand Hotel, including Ingrid (Anne Winters) and Jason (Chris Warren), as well as of those in charge.
2019 MTV MOVIE & TV AWARDS 9 p.m. on MTV. Zachary Levi hosts this year's award show. Presenters include Aubrey Plaza, Daniel Levy, Jameela Jamil and Shameik Moore, and there will be performances by, among others, Lizzo and Bazzi. The films and shows that racked up the most nominations this year went to "RBG," "Game of Thrones" and "Avengers: Endgame."

Texto completo: "I've been the first woman to do a lot of things, and I'm really proud, but I also think it's absolutely pathetic," Marin Alsop, the first woman to lead a major American orchestra, the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra, said in a conversation with Michael Cooper, the classical music reporter for The New York Times.
Her point? Such ground should have been broken long before.
"The thing about trying to work as a woman 30 years ago, 35 years ago, is there were no opportunities," said Ms. Alsop, who will soon be taking over the Vienna Radio Symphony Orchestra.
[Video: Marin Alsop in conversation with Michael Cooper of The New York Times at the New Rules Summit. Watch on YouTube.]
But she was not deterred in those early days, and instead got her friends together and created her own orchestra. "If you enable your friends to give you constructive criticism, it's really empowering," she said. That orchestra was possible because of Tomio Taki, who at the time owned Anne Klein. Ms. Alsop called him a "nonmusical mentor." She had played the violin at his wedding. And he had supported the Concordia Orchestra for 18 years, Ms. Alsop said, even though he did not care for classical music.
In 2002, she started a fellowship for women conductors called the Taki Concordia Conducting Fellowship as a thank-you to Mr. Taki.
On Wednesday, Ms. Alsop also addressed how she had been emboldened by the recent conversation around gender equality to take on the open misogyny that occurs in her industry. "The great thing about the last two years is I feel empowered to speak out even further," she said. "Now I feel at least I have company, and that there's a safety net."
About a colleague of hers, who once made a disparaging comment about female conductors, Ms. Alsop said, tongue in cheek, "I try to take the position that I have some compassion for people who don't think before they speak."
Despite the progress made in recent years, she said, female conductors were still judged differently from their male counterparts while on the podium. "The thing about conducting is it's all body language," she said, and "our society interprets gesture very differently from men or from women."
A delicate touch from a woman, for example, is often seen as weakness, when the same gesture from a man is seen as sensitive, she said. Unlike men, women conductors are "required to think twice about gesture because it's not just the gesture, it's how the musicians interpret the gesture."
Another issue dear to her is how orchestras often do not reflect the communities in which they are based, particularly in Baltimore, where, she said, there was only one black musician in its orchestra when she started. And it is because children in underserved communities do not have the same opportunities to learn these instruments, Ms. Alsop said.
As a way to pave that road for these children, she and the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra started an after-school music program about 10 years ago. Back then, it had 30 students. Now, it has about 1,500.
"They're going to change the face of classical music," Ms. Alsop said of the students.
"They love classical music," she said. "It's a haven for them and a refuge, and a way to be themselves and see possibility."

Oberlin College's day in court

Texto completo: For those who despair that the rule of law in America is being crushed by liberal fake news, we have encouraging news out of Ohio.
A jury has ruled that Oberlin College, one of the nation's most left-wing institutions of higher learning, must pay the proprietors of Gibson's Bakery in Oberlin, Ohio, $11.2 million in damages for libel, slander and other disruptions that the college caused in the business by encouraging false charges of racism.
The day after the 2016 presidential election, an Oberlin student entered Gibson's Bakery, near the college campus, and slipped a bottle of wine into his coat.
Allyn Gibson, whose great-great-grandfather founded the business, told the young man that he was going to call the police. When he took out his phone to photograph him, the youth slapped the phone out of Gibson's hand and ran out of the store, with Gibson in pursuit.
When the police arrived on the scene, Gibson, who is white, was on his back being beaten by the youth and two of his friends, all of whom are black.
Nine months later, the three youths pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges and read a statement saying that Gibson's behavior was justified and not racially motivated.
But in the interim, student protests were held outside Gibson's store, and pamphlets were distributed accusing the store of racism.
The school's dean of students was present at these protests. She claims she was there to supervise, not to protest. However, it was reported that she, too, distributed the pamphlet.
The school canceled business with the bakery, resuming again later.
The college administration claims that it cannot control the free speech of its students and that damages caused by students cannot be ascribed to the college.
The New York Times quotes famed First Amendment lawyer Floyd Abrams saying, "The notion that uninhibited student speech can lead to vast financial liability for the universities at which it occurs threatens both the viability of educational institutions and ultimately the free speech of their students ..."
The college administration wants us to believe it was doing what so many schools on the left have been criticized for not doing: protecting free speech.
But is this really what was going on?
After the incident occurred and the perpetrators charged and arrested, Oberlin's president and its dean of students sent out an email to the student body saying: "This has been a difficult few days for our community, not simply because of the events at Gibson's bakery, but because of the fears and concerns that many are feeling in response to the outcome of the presidential election. We write foremost to acknowledge the pain and sadness that many of you are experiencing. We want you to know that the administration, faculty, and staff are here to support you as we work through this moment together."
Clearly, the college administration has a political agenda that it is not afraid to convey to its students.
This agenda encourages, explicitly or implicitly, student behavior - inspired by this left-wing agenda - to which school administrators clearly are sympathetic.
When students initiate acts consistent with this, is this called protecting free speech?
A real environment in which free speech is encouraged is an environment of neutrality and intellectual humility, in which there is conviction that there is truth to be discovered, and that it is vital to hear all points of view in order to approach that truth.
This is not what is going on at Oberlin or at other similar highly politicized left-wing colleges and universities.
They indoctrinate rather than teach, and they inspire intolerance rather than understanding.
And thus, people get hurt. Like the proprietors of Gibson's Bakery.
Oberlin College is paying the price now, as it should.
Maybe, hopefully, this will encourage the real thought, intellectual responsibility and free speech so woefully absent there and at other colleges and universities.

Texto completo: NAIROBI, Kenya - A Kenyan lawmaker was charged with assault Friday, accused of hitting a female colleague who told police he struck her for failing to give money to his constituency, Kenyan officials and local news reports said.
The male lawmaker, Rashid Amin, a member of Parliament from Wajir East in northeast Kenya, was arrested late Thursday night after Rep. Fatuma Gedi reported that she had been hit in the face so hard that she bled from the mouth, Kenya's Daily Nation newspaper reported.
Gedi is a member of the budget and appropriation committee. The episode occurred in the parking lot of the Parliament buildings, she told police.
In court Friday in Milimani, Amin denied the charge and was freed after posting bail of 50,000 shillings, or about $487. He could not be reached for comment.
The lawmaker was questioned for two hours about the encounter, The Daily Nation reported. The attacker "allegedly punched Ms. Gedi in her face twice, leaving her bleeding, before he was held back" by a fellow lawmaker, the newspaper added.
Another lawmaker posted an image on Twitter of Gedi with tears running down her cheeks and blood trickling from her mouth.
The slap has set off angry reactions from a cross-section of Kenyans.
When word of the slap got out, female members of Parliament chanted in Parliament, "Arrest, Rashid," and walked out during a budget meeting this week in protest, according to video footage shared on social media.
Some male colleagues could be seen laughing. A member of Parliament, Sabina Wanjiru Chege, later told BBC Focus on Africa that male colleagues had made fun of their female counterparts in Parliament over the attack.
"Some of our male colleagues started mocking us and saying it was slapping day," she was quoted as saying.
The episode comes amid a rise in gender-based violence in Kenya, according to Wangechi L. Wachira, the executive director of the Center for Rights Education and Awareness. In recent months, she said, up to 52 cases have been reported in the news media, "including the violence meted out to women leaders."
The authorities in Kenya have pointed to the creation of a national commission on gender and equality as an example of a stated policy to deal with gender-based violence.
"In terms of national laws, the laws are there," Wachira said. "What remains is the full implementation of such laws."
In a statement, the country's National Gender and Equality Commission condemned the attack "in the strongest terms possible."
"We urge relevant law enforcement arms of government to move with speed and ensure justice is served and guarantee the safety and security of Ms. Gedi," the commission said.
Joyce Mutinda, the commission's chairwoman, said, "This is the height of intolerance that reeks of sheer arrogance punctuated by total disrespect for women and venerated public spaces of honor."
She said in a statement that Amin "must be told that he cannot use his elevated office to assault honorable or ordinary members of the public, especially when they are pursuing legitimate issues of public interest."
Many Kenyans also took to Twitter to condemn the attack.
"I feel so upset that a male Member of Parliament could attack a female colleague within the precincts of parliament," said Fiona Kirimi, a 21-year-old student, adding, "It portrays a bad example in the society, where women should be protected."

Texto completo: On a sunny March afternoon in 1966, a crowd of students from Park School (now Park Tudor School) in Indianapolis — sporting Roman-like togas and handmade helmets — gathered at the Cold Spring Road campus to witness an event like no other: the launching of a boulder from a catapult.
Cameras from "NBC Nightly News" were rolling; newspaper photographers were at the ready. While a band from nearby Marian College played, the school's Latin students loaded the Mars 1 bow-powered catapult with a 100-pound rock.
The countdown for launch began: Tribus, Duo, Unus ...
The catapult let loose and the rock landed 97 yards short of the goal of 100 yards. "Plop" as the former Park School Latin teacher Bernard Barcio describes it.
The silence from the crowd was deafening until a single laugh prompted an eruption of laughter. "It was a total disaster, but we had a goal and decided to work on it and tweak it," Barcio said.
During a recent interview, Barcio was dressed in a grey sweatshirt with the words, "Si hoc legere scis nimium eruditionis habes," or "If you can read this, you have too much erudition."
Barcio, who also taught in Wayne Township and at Carmel High School, is referred to by his former students as Magnus Magister or "the great teacher." He also happens to be the father-in-law of vice president Mike Pence, who married his stepdaughter, Karen.
Officials of the Park School had tasked the then-28-year-old Barcio with finding creative ways to teach.
"The educational rationale behind this is contextual orientation. If you study Spanish, you can go to Mexico or Spain and you can see the context in which the language is being used. For ancient Latin, the context doesn't exist anymore and for an effective Latin teacher, you've got to help recreate the context in which it was used," Barcio said.
The beginning Student David Leve came up with the idea of a building a catapult. With no workable blueprints for weapons of siege warfare, the students studied small models and photos.
And so, in the middle of winter, the Mars 1 catapult was built in a sub-basement of the school, using hand tools, drills and axes.
"These things weren't engineered off-site and brought in. We ran to the hardware store five times a week buying bolts and lumber," noted former competitor Lee Alig.
When NBC got wind of the program, they pressed Barcio for a date for the launch.
"I decided on the Ides of March," Barcio said. "March 15, it's a good Roman date."
Park School issued a challenge to the legions of Culver Military Academy in northern Indiana to participate in interscholastic competition in 1970. Park students re-enacted the slaying of Julius Caesar on his way back to the Forum and Culver's Black Horse Troop demonstrated Roman riding — by standing atop their horses.
The National Catapult Contest begins Barcio left Park School to teach Latin at North Central High School and by 1972, the first National Catapult Contest was held at Culver Military Academy in Culver, Indiana.
Park, North Central and Culver, along with several Indiana, Wisconsin and Connecticut high schools, brought their catapults for the competition, which received nationwide coverage from NBC News, The New York Times and Sports Illustrated.
What started as a challenge sparked the imaginations of students around the country and amateur catapult builders locally. It seemed as though the catapult bug had caught on throughout Indianapolis.
"There were stories of five-pound bags of flour flying into people's backyards. Everyone was building catapults," Barcio laughed.
Park student David Dortch, who studied Spanish, not Latin, entered as an independent and won the contest multiple years.
"We were flying by the seat of our pants," he now admits.
His reward for winning was a trip to New York City to appear on the syndicated NBC program, To Tell the Truth. "I'm 17-year-old in the Plaza Hotel with my Mom drinking a carafe of wine and taking a carriage ride around Central Park," he laughs. Dortch believes his life has come full circle: from building catapults back then to working in the hardware department of a Lowe's in Colorado.
When the Pentagon calls, you answer While at North Central, Barcio even received a call from the Pentagon.
"The Viet Cong are using catapults and they're catapulting logs up into the air and fouling the propellers of our helicopters and we need a crash course in how catapults work. Can we work with you?" the Pentagon told Barcio. "We will provide you with men, equipment and trucks. The Army is joining you."
"They worked with the kids, as they designed the catapults and hauled them to competitions," Barcio said.
It took North Central students three years to perfect their four-story, counter-weight or trebuchet catapult named the Zephyrus.
The hard work paid off.
In 1976, as senior Mary Hyde loaded a 100-pound rock, all eyes were on the projectile as it arced across a field and landed 576 feet away.
It was a new world record!
"I think more important to me than the sweetness of victory or the excitement of national publicity was the lesson Zephyrus taught me about life. The only way to reach the stars — any dream or goal you have — is by passing through difficulties," said Mary Hyde Hood, who to this day credits her team and her father for the victory.
"It was the fulfillment of three years of big dreams, hard work, repeated failure, and obsessive dedication," she said. After graduation from Earlham College, she taught Latin at Arlington and Howe high schools.
Barcio founded Pompeiiana to sponsor the national competition when schools became concerned about the liability. Guinness World Records wanted no part of it, either.
"Basically, you're building war weapons," Barcio said.
The final contest was held in 1977, but the competitors still stay in touch and created the YouTube documentary, "Support Your Local Catapult" based on the competition.
"It grew beyond us and Culver and quite a network across the country, and it was very exciting to see it grow," Alig said.
"It was a moment in time and all in the name of Latin, and that was the common denominator for everybody competing."

HOW A DESCENDENT OF PEASANTS AND PROSTITUTES BECAME A POET AN ACCLAIMED POET'S DEBUT NOVEL IS A VIRTUOSIC GEM

Texto completo: According to Soren Kierkegaard, "Life can only be understood backwards; but it must be lived forwards." In Ocean Vuong's debut novel, "On Earth We're Briefly Gorgeous," we are treated to such an understanding in the extraordinarily capable hands of a rather amazing virtuoso.
Ocean Vuong took the poetry world by storm in 2016. His first and only collection of poems, "Night Sky With Exit Wounds," won both the T. S. Eliot Prize and Whiting Award. That would be an amazing accomplishment for any debut poet, but for it to come from a 28-year-old Vietnamese immigrant who could barely read until he was 16, written in an adopted language as a college undergrad, borders on the preposterous.
Consider that until he received the advance for his novel, Mr. Vuong was cleaning toilets at Panera Bread for $8 an hour. In a recent interview with Kevin Nguyen of The New York Times, Vuong admits that when he is asked about his next poetry collection, he responds, "For what? There's nothing left."
While I rest assured that this now 30-year-old bard will find plenty of material to mine as he lives his life forward, it is this moving and intimate look backward that has created a novel both unique and endearing.
Vuong writes what he knows. It is the story of Little Dog, a young, gay immigrant poet from Vietnam who was raised by a single mother and grandmother - just like Vuong. Little Dog is writing for an audience of one, in the form of letters to his illiterate mother. What better way to explore all your deepest secrets, humiliations and insecurities than in correspondence to a safe and beloved figure who will never read it?
Their lives are sparse and difficult, but they are not to be pitied. Theirs is simply a life lived, and they are grateful in knowing that many others like them were not afforded such a gift. Everything they do is to survive. They are not defined by the memories of what happened to them, even if all that has happened to them has made them who they are.
Little Dog is the name given to him by Lan, his manic grandmother. "What made a woman who named herself and her daughter after flowers call her grandson a dog? A woman who watches out for her own, that's who .. To love something . is to name it after something so worthless it might be left untouched - and alive." Survivors.
Lan plays a starring role as the feral presence of the family roots. A sex worker during the war who gave birth to a daughter fathered by an anonymous G.I., her role as part psychotic PTSD maniac and part protective "big sister" to Little Dog is the glue that bonds this family.
If I had any complaint, it would be that Little Dog's mother, Rose, is rather flat and colorless in the retelling. Her only modes seem to be hard work, exhaustion and physical abuse of her son. But that is the tradeoff for immigration. You flee one type of slavery only to volunteer for slavery to long hours of underpaid, body-mangling labor in the unsafe conditions of a nail salon. Engaging personality traits and deep, meaningful conversation are luxuries afforded to other people.
To call this a story is a bit of a stretch. There is no plot, no protagonist or antagonist, and no conflict-driven three-act structure to grasp the hero's prize. That is not to say that nothing happens. There is life and death, hateful adversity, sexual discovery, and the heartbreaking realities of living in a town besieged by opioid addiction.
But what keeps the pages turning are the honest moments indelibly burned into the memory. Dinner of jasmine tea over rice ("true peasant food") with your grandmother. Caring for your mother's broken body after work because that is a son's job. The awkward naivete of forbidden first love.
When I began the book, I wondered if I would be able to relate to the tale of a gay Vietnamese immigrant. But within a few pages, it became clear that the story of family and of discovering yourself as you come of age, is universal. It is a story that has been played out over and over by German steelworkers, Mexican migrant farm workers, Irish high-rise beam-walkers, and Iranian bellhops.
This immigrant's life is as deeply an American story as George Washington's truth-telling or Benjamin Franklin's kite, but this one is much more expertly told.

Texto completo: HUCKA-BYEEEE
Fib-prone White House press secretary  Sarah Huckabee Sanders announced plans to vacate her perch at the podium by the end of the month, though the details of how she'd leave remain unclear (Cloud of bats? Oozing through a floor drain? Bursting into spores?). “The most important job I'll ever have is being a mom to my kids and it's time for us to go home," she tweeted — which sure sounds convincing. But as The New York Times's James Poniewozik tweeted, “I'm not going to believe that Sarah Huckabee Sanders is leaving as White House press secretary until she denies it herself." Who, or what, will replace her? Twitter's candidates are mostly unprintable, but if I were a betting man I'd say get ready for a lot more Kid Rock in your life.
JACKIE NO
In a perfectly normal birthday morning interview with Fox News (which also by carefully constructed coincidence happened to coincide with the first ever #JohnMcCainDay) President Trump defended his decision to repaint Air Force One red, white, and blue (a bold departure from the baby blue hue first selected by former first lady Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis) by dragging his wife into it with the weirdest compliment ever: “It was Jackie O and that's good. But we have our own Jackie O today, it's called Melania. Melania. We'll call it Melania T , OK?" Twitter spent the day wrestling with which aspect of the answer was worse, the “our own Jackie O" part or the double dispatch of “it" to refer to the current first lady. Truth be told, I really don't care (do U?), but this kinda feels like saying we have a new Chanel No. 5 and it's called Febreze. 
NEW YELLER
Enough of these foolish mortals and this lousy present! Gather 'round my crystal ball, everyone, and behold as I grant you a glimpse into a strange and distant future! Just kidding, it's actually just a terrifying clip of Spot, a Boston Robotics dog, violently malfunctioning on an expo stage and writhing around in simulated pain before unceremoniously tipping over. WAIT! If you're about to make the “he sure knows how to play dead" joke, I regret to inform you that everyone already has. Turns out humans are way more reliable than robot dogs. Who knew? 
SMALL TALK
Speaking of dad jokes, in honor of Father's Day, I am pleased to present to you this year's Winning Internet Dad, DJ Pryor of Tennessee, who was recorded by his wife, Shanieke, chilling on the couch and deeply engaged in a just-as-deeply meaningless conversation with their 18-month-old son Kingston, who appears to be making some valid points. “We think a lot alike, huh?," says Pryor in the objectively cutest moment of the clip, which has been shared over a million times. If this kid is as smart as he looks, he'll put whatever he asked for in writing as soon as he figures that out.

Texto completo: There has always been a difference to one degree or another between the two major parties in this country. The differences were fairly small in nature, but over the last 20 years or so that has changed.
The role of the parties should have the best interests of the country as a goal instead of the furtherance of the party itself. But that is not the case. This has never been more in evidence that the present state of the political war now plaguing our country.
No longer is the well-being of the United States at the forefront of political discourse. We have instead a constant attack upon this presidency for no good reason save for the Democratic Party trying to salve its wounds from the last election.
And now, in the far reaches of political reasoning, we are blessed with the appearance of the new left. They will ride in this political disaster and save the day for the American system.

Surely brainwashed If you are someone who has always believed that brainwashing was a myth, all you have to do is read some of the letter writers that have become victims of it. From the beginning, Donald Trump has sought to discredit anyone who disagrees, or challenges him.
Trump's mantra has always been, "just say it and they will believe you" and his repeated "fake news" on a daily basis is his attempt at discrediting the news media. So those that are searching for confirmation of their choice rather than information regarding the "stable genius" (who calls themself that?) continues to enable Trump and aid Fox, which is mostly fake news when it comes to Trump.
Anyone that would believe that CNN, MSNBC, The Washington Post and the New York Times, are part of a conspiracy to dethrone Trump, are surely brainwashed. All of those renowned news agencies and more than half of the U.S. public aren't just embarrassed that Donald Trump is our president, they're concerned about the poorly thought-out policies and the divisiveness of his rhetoric.
Roger W. Quagliano, Fort Myers
Tortured choice There's much angst among congressional Democrats because Attorney General Barr won't release the entire confidential Trump/Russia election conspiracy report to the House of Representatives – unredacted and with underlying evidence.
Barr is facing contempt charges, and it matters little that he's probably prohibited by law from releasing the requested information; and then there's a problem with legitimate claims of executive privilege. In contrast, these zealous anti-Trumpers strenuously object to Trump giving Barr authority to declassify information relative to the original basis and justification for the Russian election tampering probe. They don't want a cover-up ... until they do.
And, it seems standards of proof change for investigations of Trump. Sen. Feinstein (along with others) stated: "Not a single revelation in the Steele dossier has been refuted." In this case, presumed innocence has morphed into: "allegations are true until proven false." Similarly, Mueller tried to represent his job was to exonerate Trump of obstruction (not a prosecutor's role) rather than to discover evidence of guilt.
Mueller is a person who avoids the spotlight. Yet, his tortured choice of words for explaining his "inability to exonerate," guarantees unwanted publicity and pressure to testify further.
Obviously, things aren't what they're represented to be.

Texto completo: Enjoy the Rays while you can

For Tampa Bay Rays fans, these are the golden days, when you can go to the ballpark and see your heroes do amazing things. We see rookies who we had never heard of in April hit balls over the outfield wall. We see players discarded by other teams resuscitated into stars who hit in the clutch and win improbable ballgames. Rarely have I had so much fun watching the hometown Rays under the brilliant leadership of Kevin Cash.

I have a season ticket. Ray Arsenault, esteemed USF professor, and I sit next to each other in Section 205, and every game we look out onto the beautiful vista that is the Trop and we pinch ourselves how lucky we are to be able to watch major league baseball in this little southern town we love so much.

If there is a low note in this sea of wonderment, it is that no one comes to the games anymore. Except for contests against the Yankees and the Red Sox, when the Trop fills with the exuberant enemy, the Trop is like a morgue. Where is everyone? From what Ive been told, they are home in large numbers watching the games on their 50-inch TVs. The spectacular Rays players deserve support, and they are not getting it. If you dont want the team to move, it is incumbent upon you to attend just one game a month. If each Rays fan sitting at home watching TV would show up for just one game a month, attendance would be high enough that Rays owner Stu Sternberg could stop singing the attendance blues. Do the math. Youll understand what I am saying. The clock is ticking, Rays fans. Dont give Sternberg reason to leave us. Ask any St. Louis Browns or Brooklyn Dodger fan. Or the Montreal Expo fans, if youre younger. The heartbreak is awful.

Ban hurts, doesnt help

I agree with John Hills editorial notebook on how the Cuban sanctions will not benefit anyone. Like him, I also visited Cuba two years ago and found the poor people there clearly benefiting from U.S. tourism from the small shops selling art, the taxi drivers, the university professor-turned-tour-guide or the waiters at the busy restaurants. Our interactions with them just showed us how desperately they want to improve their lives but also how warm and charming they are under such deplorable conditions. Sen. Rick Scott posted that he was glad that the Trump administration finally imposed the sanctions. He said that Cuba was a supporter of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and was sending money there. What money? Due to sanctions, all they can do is trade doctors for oil with them. Cuba does not have the resources to be a destabilizing role in the Western hemisphere. You would think that our two senators, representing such a vast Hispanic population, would do the right thing to help the Cuban people through economic prosperity.

Peter Hough, Palm Harbor

Dont tell me what to do

The Trump administrations recent crackdown on travel to Cuba is a polarizing issue especially for someone  like myself  born in Cuba but so proud and grateful to be an American citizen. As someone who has witnessed the hardships of exiles as well as Cuban citizens who are continually oppressed by a communist state, I am well in favor of the embargo in order to not continually empower the regime to spread its ideology through the Americas and to suppress freedom in my native country. As an American citizen, I am not in favor of the government suppressing my right to travel wherever I want. The government can simply tell me, You go there at your own risk. Then I can choose what I want to do. There are many legal avenues I can use to help any of my family members in need when they request something from me  mostly money and medicine. What I refuse to accept is the opinions of apologists for the Cuban government who blame the ills in Cuba on American policy. Although I am a social liberal, I am a Republican because I am a fiscal conservative who believes in less government in my life. But my GOP needs to learn that you cannot preach less government and at the same time legislate behavior and basic freedoms. Dont tell us whom we can marry or where we can travel.

Honor my clear wishes

I have a type of cancer that can end in an extremely difficult death process. The thought of having to go through the pain and suffering that goes with dying is terrifying. By having a living will, where my wishes have been extensively documented, as well as long discussions with my husband about what I want, I was able to come to peace with dying.

Every time I have been admitted to a hospital I have been asked if I have a living will. What is the point of asking this if they are going to refuse to honor it? As an atheist, I do support the right of someone to be able to die on their own terms but thats not even what we are talking about here. As stated in the living will form provided by the Florida Agency for Health Care Administration, I can make known my desire that my dying not be artificially prolonged under the circumstances I choose, and I want to be allowed to die naturally. But this new conscience rule allows anyone at the hospital to object to my wishes because their religion forbids it.

This rule applies to many situations far less dramatic than dying. Why do a few extremists get to control the lives of people not part of their belief system? Should a child who is raped and becomes pregnant be forced to endure a pregnancy because a doctor refuses to perform an abortion and refuses to refer her to a doctor who will?

Your freedom of religion does not pre-empt my freedom of religion or my freedom from religion. If you work in a publicly funded facility, or work in or own a business that is open to the public, you do not have the right to control a customers life.

OUR LEADERS KNOW SHOCKINGLY LITTLE ABOUT FOREIGN POLICY NEW DOVES ON THE LEFT AND AMERICA FIRSTERS ON THE RIGHT DON'T UNDERSTAND AMERICA'S ROLE IN MAKING THE WORLD A BETTER PLACE

Texto completo: Most of human history has been marked by war. Between 1500 and 1945, scarcely a year went by without some great power fighting another great power. Then, in 1945 that stopped. The number of battlefield deaths has plummeted to the lowest levels in history. The world has experienced the greatest reduction in poverty in history, as well as the greatest spread of democracy and freedom. br data-css-regions-fragment-of="99">
Why did this happen? Mostly it was because the United States decided to lead a community of nations to create a democratic world order. That order consisted of institutions such as NATO, the United Nations and the World Bank. But it was also enforced by the pervasive presence of American power - military, economic and cultural power as well as the magnetic power of the democratic idea, which inspired dissidents worldwide.
Building any community requires exercising power. America's leaders made some terrible mistakes (Vietnam, Iraq). The nation never got to enjoy the self-righteous sense of innocence that the powerless and reclusive enjoy.
But with the U.S. having been dragged into two world wars, leaders from Harry Truman to Barack Obama felt they had no choice but to widen America's circle of concern across the whole world. This was abnormal. As Robert Kagan writes in "The Jungle Grows Back," "Very few nations in history have ever felt any responsibility for anything but themselves."
Over all, this history should be a source of pride for all Americans, but it is not. Researchers from the Center for American Progress recently completed a survey of American foreign policy views. They write: "When asked what the phrase 'maintaining the liberal international order' indicated to them, all but one of the participants in our focus groups drew a blank. Voters across educational lines simply did not understand what any of these phrases . meant or implied."
br data-css-regions-fragment-of="104">
That by itself is not a problem. The liberal order was built by foreign policy elites, from George Marshall to Madeleine Albright. The problem is that voters are now actively hostile to the project. Instead of widening the circle of concern, most Americans want the U.S. to simply look after itself.
The CAP researchers asked 2,000 registered voters what America's foreign policy priorities should be. The top priorities were protecting against terrorist threats, protecting jobs for American workers and reducing illegal immigration. These are all negative aspirations: preventing bad things from hostile outsiders.
The lowest priorities were promoting democracy, taking on Chinese aggression, promoting trade, fighting global poverty and defending human rights. The things Americans care least about are the core activities of building a civilized global community.
After Iraq and other debacles, many Americans are exhausted by the global leadership role. Many have lost faith in the nation's leadership class. They say correctly that we have a lot of problems here at home.
But a big part of the shift is caused by the fact that many Americans have lost faith in human nature and human possibility.
br data-css-regions-fragment-of="110">
Even after the horrors of World War II, most Americans said that people can be trusted. Building a community of nations seemed like a doable proposition because most people are basically good. Even today, people who express high social trust are much more likely to see America as an indispensable nation, much more likely to believe American values are universal values and much more likely to support the policies that preserve the liberal world order.
But social trust has collapsed over the decades, especially among the young. Distrustful, alienated people don't want to get involved in the strange, hostile, outside world.
There are two types of low-trust voters. On the right there are the Trumpian America Firsters, who want to cut immigration and break alliances. On the left there are the New Doves. These are young people who express high interest in human rights, but having grown up in the Iraq era, they don't want the U.S. to get involved in protecting them. A survey of American voters by the Eurasia Group Foundation reported, "People under 30 years old were the most likely to want the United States to abstain from intervening in human rights abuses."
The America Firsters and the New Doves may think of themselves as opposites, but they wind up in the same place. America should not be abroad preserving the liberal world order.
The CAP study estimates that less than a fifth of voters are traditional internationalists. The Eurasia Group study estimates that only 9.5% are.
America is withdrawing from the world; the results are there for all to see. China is cracking down on democratic rights in Hong Kong. Russia launches cyberattacks everywhere. Iran is destabilizing the Middle East. The era of great power rivalry is coming back.
We're in a dark spiral. Americans take a dark view of human nature and withdraw from the world. Wolves like Russia's Vladimir Putin and China's Xi Jinping fill the void and make bad things happen, confirming the dark view and causing even more withdrawal.
br data-css-regions-fragment-of="118">
We need a leader who can grapple with failures like Iraq, build a younger, credible leadership class and embody an optimism that pulls us out of the dark spiral.

Berlin's Troubled Museum Delays Its Opening

Texto completo: BERLIN -- The Humboldt Forum, the problem-plagued museum housed in a reconstructed palace in the center of this city, has pushed back its opening date to 2020 because of technical reasons, officials announced this week. They added that "it was not realistic for the building to be ready for use by the end of 2019 as had been planned."
The announcement, in a news release on Wednesday, followed an inspection of the building by the head of construction for the project and the president of the Federal Office for Construction and Regional Planning. A new timeline for the opening will be presented to the board of the museum's foundation on June 26.
The museum, one of Europe's most ambitious and expensive current cultural projects, has been burdened by construction problems and by accusations from academics and activists that it hasn't done enough to determine the provenance of its objects that were acquired during the colonial era or to address whether it is appropriate to hold onto them. The opening of the permanent exhibition had already been delayed to 2020; the Forum was slated to open in stages, beginning with a temporary exhibition of ivory objects in November.
The exhibition was to include items lent from other museums, including the Museum of Modern Art in New York, the Victoria and Albert Museum in London and the Louvre in Paris. Last week, the German newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung reported that delays in the activation of the climate control system of the new building had led the other museums to decide not to send their ivory items for the opening exhibition.
Officials confirmed Wednesday that the "central cooling system would not be able to be activated until late July," leaving little time for it to be certified in time for the fall opening. Representatives of the other museums did not respond to requests for comment.
It is the latest setback for a project that has been dogged by controversy since its conception. The Humboldt Forum is on the site of the Palast der Republik, the former East German Parliament, which was torn down after German reunification, to the outrage of many East Germans. The Forum is to open within a facsimile of the Berliner Schloss, the Berlin Palace, which was built by the Hohenzollern dynasty. The Schloss was badly damaged in the Allied bombing of Berlin in World War II, and demolished in 1950 by the government of Communist East Germany. Some see the decision to rebuild the Schloss as an attempt to erase Germany's turbulent 20th-century history.
The Forum has also been the target of complaints from activists and academics who have said the new museum's leaders have not done enough to explore the collection's ties to colonial exploitation. Once complete, the $ 700 million Forum is to unite the collections of Berlin's Asian Art Museum and Ethnological Museum, as well as exhibitions from the City Museum of Berlin and a project overseen by Humboldt University.
The debate has also drawn new scrutiny of Germany's own troubled colonial past, which some scholars say has been largely overshadowed by the country's postwar reckoning with the Nazis' crimes.
Among numerous items from outside Germany, the Forum's collection includes several hundred spectacular sculptures, known as Benin Bronzes, that originated in an area that is now part of Nigeria. The sculptures, which are actually made of brass, were bought on the open market after being looted by British troops. Scholars and activists have described the sculptures as "stolen art" and have called for them to be returned to Nigeria.
In an interview with The New York Times last year, Mnyaka Sururu Mboro, an anticolonial activist in Berlin, called on the museum to return to Africa the skulls of ancestors who he said were executed by Germans in Tanzania. "The people there are still in sorrow," he said.
Jürgen Zimmerer, a historian specializing in colonialism at the University of Hamburg, who has been critical of the project, said in a phone interview that the museum "has a problem in that it has yet to figure out how to deal with objects looted during the colonial period." Mr. Zimmerer argued that a "large social debate" was necessary in Germany about what the new building should be used for.
Initiators of the project have countered that the Forum is a positive symbol of Germany's history of scientific enlightenment and exploration. In an interview with the Berliner Zeitung last year, the head of the Humboldt Forum, Hartmut Dorgerloh, acknowledged that "the discussion about provenance research has shown that social developments are changing the work of the institutions."
The Forum announced plans for joint projects with Namibia as well as efforts to involve curatorial voices from the countries where these objects originated. Mr. Dorgerloh has said that where a claim for restitution has been made, it would be noted along with any object on display. He told the Berliner Zeitung that "while restitution is an option" for objects with colonial histories, "alternative" approaches would also be explored, such as loaning them out.
The Forum is one of several high-profile projects in Germany that have been dogged by delays in recent years, leading to public hand-wringing about whether German officials are capable of successfully carrying out large public construction projects. Berlin's new airport, which was slated to open in 2011, is now scheduled to open nine years behind schedule, in the fall of 2020.
Some critics have argued that the delay in the Forum's opening should be seen as a boon. "This is an opportunity," Mr. Zimmerer said. "They should leave the building closed for another two years and invite everyone to participate in a competition about what to do with it."

Texto completo: U.S. coach Jill Ellis gave her players the day off Thursday, the team's first full day in Paris.
When the team arrived in France last week for the Women's World Cup, it went directly to Reims, about 85 miles outside Paris, where it played its opening game Tuesday.
The Americans traveled to the capital Wednesday afternoon and were scheduled to practice Thursday, but Ellis canceled the session.

Midfielder Samantha Mewis said it hasn't been hard to find ways to fill the downtime.
"A lot of us read or watch shows," she said. "But it is pretty busy, the team environment. We have a lot of meetings and meals. So we're just like eating and resting and having coffee."
Many players spent time Wednesday with family or teammates. Mewis did both, making sure to stay close to midfielder Lindsey Horan, who speaks French. Horan played four seasons with Paris Saint-Germain and has become the team's translator and tour guide.
"She's definitely guiding us around," Mewis said. "She gives us little French tips when we have questions. My parents and I followed behind her and her parents last night, like 10 feet away, when we went to dinner because I had no idea where to go. So we were just like little ducklings following behind."
Horan is one of three players on the U.S. roster who played at PSG, although she was with the club longer than either Tobin Heath or Allie Long.
Morgan Brian, Alex Morgan and Megan Rapinoe all played previously at Lyon and are hoping they'll get to have a homecoming later in the tournament. Lyon is the site of the tournament semifinals and final.

Dogging it
She's been called the most famous dog in soccer, but right now Rose Lavelle's 6-year-old English bulldog Wilma Jean Wrinkles is lonely because her best friend is away for five weeks playing in the Women's World Cup.
But that doesn't mean the two aren't communicating.
"I actually have this little pet cam, it's an app," Lavelle said. "And I just go on it and I can shoot out treats to Wilma any time I want. I get on that a lot."
The Twitter page of Lavelle, who has two World Cup goals, features pictures of her dog. She paused when asked if she was planning to FaceTime with Wilma.
"She sleeps a lot," Lavelle said. "I don't want to interrupt her sleeping."

Lloyd scores again
Carli Lloyd's goal in stoppage time, which capped the U.S. team's 13-0 win over Thailand, seemed an unnecessary bit of embarrassment for the Thais and their goalkeeper Sukanya Chor Charoenying.
But while Lloyd has been widely criticized for publicly pouring it on, her private moment with Charoenying after the game has gotten much less attention.
Lloyd, a two-time world player of the year, approached Charoenying after the final whistle, put her arm around the keeper and offered support.
Lloyd told the New York Times she praised Charoenying and encouraged her to hold her head high and keep fighting in her team's next two games. Charoenying tweeted her thanks to Lloyd.
"Thanks so much, Lloyd," she wrote. "Your words that you told me make me strong. Keep going for this tournament and so on. Firstly, I felt disappointment in worst situation but this is the biggest experience in my life."

That other football
With the Philadelphia Eagles' mandatory mini- camp ending, tight end Zach Ertz was scheduled to leave Friday for Paris to watch his wife, Julie, roam the midfield for the U.S., which faces Chile on Sunday in its second game.
He'll be the second NFL receiver in France to cheer on a family member. Jordan Matthews of the San Francisco 49ers is married to Jamaican forward Cheyna Matthews, whose team plays Italy in its second game Friday.
Jordan Matthews previously played alongside Ertz in Philadelphia.

Texto completo: Our guide to plays and musicals coming to New York stages and a few last-chance picks of shows that are about to close. Our reviews of open shows are at nytimes.com/reviews/theater.
Previews & Openings
'DROPPING GUMBALLS ON LUKE WILSON' at A.R.T./New York Theaters (in previews; opens on June 18). The playwright Rob Ackerman ("Tabletop") also works as a property master, and this new comedy, adapted from a true story, recalls a time on an AT&T commercial when he demonstrated something less than mastery. For the Working Theater, Theresa Rebeck directs a cast that includes Ann Harada and Dean Nolen.
866-811-4111, theworkingtheater.org
'LIFE SUCKS' at the Acorn Theater at Theater Row (in previews; opens on June 16). A sort of adaptation of Anton Chekhov's "Uncle Vanya" is definitely back for an encore run. In April, when reviewing this comedy of dreams deferred, Elisabeth Vincentelli praised the playwright Aaron Posner as understanding "full well that there is no date stamp on feeling stranded between regrets and hopes, between fancy dreams and the banality of existence."
wheelhousetheater.org
PRIDE PLAYS at Rattlestick Playwrights Theater (performances start on June 20). To celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall uprising, Doug Nevin and Michael Urie, in association with Rattlestick, present a festival of play readings honoring the diversity of the queer experience. Highlights include original works by Trans Lab, an evening of L.G.B.T.Q. musicals and a reading of "Our Town" with a cast of transgender, nonbinary and gender-fluid actors.
866-811-4111, rattlestick.org
'ROCK OF AGES' at New World Stages (performances start on June 19). Come on, feel the noise. After closing in 2015, this put-another-dime-in-the-jukebox musical, which The New York Times called "seriously silly, absurdly enjoyable," is spending the summer Off Broadway. A story of a guy, a girl and too much spandex, the 10th-anniversary revival stars Mitchell Jarvis.
212-239-6200, rockofagesmusical.com
[Read about the events that our other critics have chosen for the week ahead.]
'THE ROLLING STONE' at the Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater at Lincoln Center Theater (previews start on June 20; opens on July 15). Chris Urch's play explores the catastrophic effects of anti-gay rhetoric and policy on one Ugandan family. Under Saheem Ali's direction, Ato Blankson-Wood stars as Dembe, a man in a committed relationship with an Irish-born doctor, with James Udom as Dembe's brother, a church pastor.
212-239-6200, lct.org
'A STRANGE LOOP' at Playwrights Horizons (in previews; opens on June 17). The playwright Michael R. Jackson (yeah, the middle initial is important) offers a semi-autobiographical musical about the search for selfhood. Larry Owens stars as Usher, a young man also trying to write a semi-autobiographical musical while working his day job: ushering for "The Lion King." Stephen Brackett directs with choreography by Raja Feather Kelly.
212-279-4200, playwrightshorizons.org
'TONI STONE' at the Laura Pels Theater at the Harold and Miriam Steinberg Center for Theater (in previews; opens on June 20). "A woman can do many things," Marcenia Lyle Stone told a reporter. Now Stone, the first woman to play in the Negro leagues, has inspired a new play, by Lydia R. Diamond, which explores gender, race and batting averages. The invaluable April Matthis stars. Pam MacKinnon directs.
212-719-1300, roundabouttheatre.org
'[VEIL WIDOW CONSPIRACY]' at Next Door at NYTW (in previews; opens on June 15). A meditation on truth, fiction and DVD extras, Gordon Dahlquist's new play revisits a century-old murder in western China through a blockbuster movie, DVD interviews and, years from now in a future Brooklyn, one hushed, imperfect recap. Aneesha Kudtarkar directs for National Asian American Theater Company.
212-460-5475, nytw.org
Last Chance
'ALL MY SONS' at the American Airlines Theater (closes on June 30). Nominated for three Tony Awards, this wrenching revival of Arthur Miller's tragedy of a corrupted American family ends its run. Jesse Green praised Annette Bening's Kate, "the show's emotional center and endless mystery," though he felt that Jack O'Brien's production "does not make a resonant case for the drama today."
212-719-1300, roundabouttheatre.org
'GARY: A SEQUEL TO TITUS ANDRONICUS' at the Booth Theater (closes on June 16). Taylor Mac's filthy, feculent salute to Shakespeare's Roman tragedy closes its bloodstained curtains. Jesse Green described George C. Wolfe's production, which stars Nathan Lane, Kristine Nielsen and Julie White, as "fabulous and bedraggled: a defiant and beautiful mess." See the penile chorus line while you still can.
212-239-6200, garyonbroadway.com
THE SEAN O'CASEY SEASON at the Irish Repertory Theater (closes on June 22). The Irish Repertory's production of O'Casey's Dublin trilogy -- "The Shadow of a Gunman," "Juno and the Paycock" and "The Plough and the Stars" -- leaves the tenement. Reviewing "The Plough," Elisabeth Vincentelli wrote that it "illustrates the company's approach at its most successful: It's hard not to be swept away by such a good yarn."

THIS IS NO WHINE; Former Team Canada players bash U.S. women for celebrations

Texto completo: How exactly could the USWNT have satisfied these whining Canadians?
One answer to that question, "score fewer than 13 goals," can be dismissed immediately.
Even if the other groups shake out in a way that the U.S. ultimately wants - to get second in Group F for a better draw in the knockout stage (basically to avoid a quarterfinal showdown with host France) - no team wants to surrender control of where it's headed this early.
The first two tiebreakers are goals scored and goal differential, and Tuesday's 13-0 win over Thailand gave Sweden a tall task if it wants to hold tiebreakers against the U.S. women. Stopping at some arbitrary acceptable number of goals - what exactly is OK about nine goals that isn't about 13? - would have been giving an opponent an unnecessary advantage in an elimination tournament and is obviously the wrong thing to do.
That brings us to the celebrations critscism by former Team Canada players and current commentators (Clare Rustad, Kaylyn Kyle and Diana Matheson) that leads with "If you're going to blow away a team, do it with humility, and they did not," and only gets more unbearable from there.
The TSN commentators helpfully laid out the rules: someone scoring their first World Cup goal, like Mallory Pugh, can celebrate, but a veteran scorer like Alex Morgan (who had exactly three non-penalty goals in her three prior World Cups) can't. Actually, Morgan can celebrate, but not like that, counting out the goals on her fingers, which Clare Rustad called "disgraceful."
ESPN's Bomani Jones has said for years that "Sportsmanship is people trying to stop somebody from hurting their own feelings;" I've always felt that big shows of respect on the field, whether fans doing a pity clap for a last-place runner or athletes silently putting their heads down after a goal, are incredibly condescending to the opponent.
One group of people who agree: fans of Thailand. A Thai television commentator told the New York Times that "This is a game of teamwork. Once you score a goal, of course you have to celebrate."
Members of the U.S. team are making no apologies.
"I think in the moment, every time we score a goal in a World Cup - you've dreamt of it. I dreamt of it since I was a little girl," said Morgan. "You know, winning a World Cup and being back there for the third time, we want that fourth star. So tonight we knew that any goal could matter in this group-stage game. And when it comes to celebrations, I think this was a really good team performance and I think it was important for us to celebrate together."
Those celebrations drew ire on social media, some of it directed at veteran Megan Rapinoe for twirling and turf-sliding after her goal - which made it 9-0. A World Cup-record seven U.S. players scored in the game.
Morgan was rebuked for holding up four fingers after her fourth goal, which made it 10-0.
"A lot of this is about building momentum and so as a coach I don't find it my job to rein my players in," coach Jill Ellis said. "This is what they've dreamt about. This is for them. This is a world championship"
Rapinoe, interviewed on Fox Sports on Wednesday, also addressed the criticism.
"If anyone wants to come at our team for not doing the right thing, not playing the right way, not being a good ambassador, they can come at us. It was an explosion of joy," she said. "If our crime is joy, then we will take that."
If a 13-0 scoreline really bothers you - and as a television product, that's hard to argue with - there are plenty of people to blame. Start with FIFA, which has created a tournament that is both too swollen to maintain quality but not big enough to maintain drama before the knockout stage.
A 24-team group stage means that 36 games will be played to eliminate just eight teams; some fluff is inevitable there. A 13-0 blowout is more entertaining than two teams dribbling around with advancement assured.
And if there aren't 23 teams in the world capable of staying within two touchdowns of the United States, FIFA and federations like Thailand's deserve blame for that, too, for failing to fund and develop the sport.

USWNT hopes rout keys funding; Foreign foes often fight losing financial battle; Women's World Cup

Texto completo: REIMS, France - After a 13-0 win at the World Cup, there's a lot of questions. Should the United States have continued to bring on attacking players against Thailand? Should those players have continued to score? Should they have celebrated after those goals?
A record margin of victory turns heads and makes people wonder, "How does that happen?"
One of the reasons is a difference in funding for women's soccer across federations. The teams with the most investment and support typically find more success. U.S. players highlighted that issue Tuesday night after dismantling Thailand and said they hope the lopsided result pushes other federations to invest more in the sport.
"I think expanding the last World Cup to 24 teams is great, and I hope soon enough we expand to 32 and keep it at that number," said striker Alex Morgan, who scored five goals against Thailand. "I think that will incentivize federations to put more financial efforts into their women's programs, and I hope that we continue to see the development."
The 2019 Women's World Cup marks Thailand's second appearance in the tournament. American-born Thailand forward Miranda Nild said in a teary postgame interview "Thailand did the best they knew how to do. We're a developing program."
When asked whether the difference in funding between the U.S. and Thailand soccer federations impacts the game, Thailand coach Nuengrutai Srathongvian said through a translator, "Of course, if football association of Thailand will support the female team. ... We have limited resources in terms of players and selection. We have to improve on this aspect."
Thailand's press officer did not immediately respond to a request asking how much money the Football Association of Thailand invests in women's soccer each year.
U.S. Soccer invested well into seven figures for the USWNT's World Cup preparation the past six months, according to U.S. Soccer chief communications officer Neil Buethe.
"I'm sure they can mandate that in some way, like you don't get money for anything else until you give more money to the women and make sure it's fully staffed," U.S. veteran Megan Rapinoe said when asked whether she thinks FIFA can step in to make sure federations don't discard their women's teams after embarrassing results and instead invest more heavily to improve them. "I think there's some teams here, ya know, since last world cup they've only played a handful of games or only the qualifiers. I mean, it's embarrassing, not only for the federations, but for FIFA as well. Ya just mandate it. They mandate all kinds of things."
There is also a massive pay discrepancy between the countries' national team players. Eight Thai players reported to the New York Times making anywhere between $159-$6,345 playing soccer this year.
The only U.S. player to share her earnings with the paper was backup goalkeeper Ashlyn Harris, who said she made between $300,000-$400,000. U.S. Soccer pays a guaranteed base salary to its national team players, plus bonuses and tournament winnings. Many players also have endorsement deals and other sources of income, and they are continuing to lead a fight for more equitable play.
The USWNT was unapologetic following its overwhelming victory against Thailand despite some criticism for effusive celebrations after all 13 goals.
The general consensus among the U.S. players and coach was that it's a World Cup, goal differential matters, camaraderie matters, building confidence matters and it's all part of growing the game and the competition.
"I hope that what I'm doing is inspiring women and girls around the world," Morgan said. "I hope that I'm putting pressure on developmental academies and federations and people in powerful positions who have the opportunity to put more money into women's programs [and] do so in the future."

Confusion abounds as Trump's July 4 plans remain a mystery

Texto completo: For five decades, Bernie Sanders has embraced the label of democratic socialism.
On Wednesday, he issued a robust defense of his core political beliefs, delivering a formal address on democratic socialism in what will amount to the most aggressive attempt yet to diffuse voter concerns about his electability.
Sanders — an independent senator who has not joined the Democratic Party but is running for the Democratic nomination — presented his vision of democratic socialism not as a set of extreme principles but in terms of “economic rights," invoking the accomplishments of Franklin D. Roosevelt and the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. And he argued that his ideology is embodied by longstanding popular programs, including Social Security and Medicare, that opponents often label as socialist.
Saying that the United States must reject a path of hatred and divisiveness, he said the nation must “instead find the moral conviction to choose a different path, a higher path, a path of compassion, justice, and love. And that is the path that I call democratic socialism."
President Trump has repeatedly called Sanders “crazy" and extrapolated the senator's brand of socialism to all Democrats, seizing on proposals such as “Medicare for All" to portray them as far out of the mainstream and signaling clearly that this will be a major line of attack in the general election.
Sanders delivered his speech in a small theater at George Washington University, a dozen flags behind him.
New York Times
Confusion abounds over plans for July 4 in D.C.WASHINGTON — With three weeks to go, exactly what's going to happen in Washington on the Fourth of July remains a subject of intense confusion because of President Trump's plans to reshape the nation's premier celebration.
Will Independence Day festivities be centered around the Washington Monument or shift to the Lincoln Memorial, as the White House has reportedly requested? Will Trump follow through on his plans to give a speech? And, if he does, will the speech be open to anyone, including protesters, or will the White House restrict his audience to supporters at the traditionally nonpolitical event?
The White House hasn't revealed its plans. The National Park Service, which is primarily responsible for the event, has also gone silent. That leaves the city government, which helps with security, in the dark.
Eleanor Holmes Norton, the District of Columbia's delegate in Congress, said interdepartmental planning meetings for July 4 usually begin up to three months in advance. But to her knowledge, no meetings have happened.
"The city is scrambling to figure out what to do, because all they have is the outline of what [the White House] wants," Norton said. She said she approached the National Park Service for details but "They wouldn't tell us a thing. You know why? Because they don't know a thing."
Mayor Muriel Bowser declined repeated requests for comment.
Independence Day normally draws tens of thousands of people to the National Mall for a celebration capped by fireworks. A major security overhaul was implemented following the Sept. 11 attacks, but the occasion has run smoothly for years.
The first sign that 2019's celebration may be different came in a February tweet from Trump announcing a special "Salute to America" on July 4 that would feature "an address by your favorite President, me!"
Last week, a National Park Service official was quoted in The Washington Post saying the White House was planning a Trump speech on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial during the event.
But since that report, the White House and the National Park Service have refused to comment. Park Service spokesman Mike Litterst released a terse statement saying only that "We continue to work with the White House on creating a Salute to America program that will bring Americans from all over the country together in celebration of our great nation."

House panel split over criticism for arms sales
WASHINGTON — The House Foreign Affairs Committee split along partisan lines Wednesday over how sharply to criticize the State Department for finalizing 22 arms sales despite congressional objections, as Democrats accused the Trump administration of creating a "phony" emergency to funnel weapons to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.
"Here's the reality: there is no emergency," said panel chairman Reprentative Eliot Engel, of New York one of several Democrats furious with the administration's moves. "It's made up. And it's an abuse of the law."
R. Clarke Cooper, the assistant secretary of state for political-military affairs, told the panel that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had been responding to a "significant increase" in threats from Iran, coupled with "the clear, provocative, damaging actions taken by Iran's government" when he announced the Trump administration would use its emergency authority to advance the arms deals worth about $8 billion.
"It was a measured response which promotes regional stability and security," Cooper said.
But Democrats weren't having it — and Republicans were clearly uncomfortable with having been circumvented, though their rebukes were more measured.
"The recent use of this emergency authority, in my judgment, was unfortunate," said the panel's ranking member, Republican Representative Michael McCaulof Texas. "Consulting with Congress is always the better route."
Members of the House committee are preparing four disapproval resolutions to try to block the arms deals.

BEING 'PRO-LIFE' IS MEANINGLESS IF IT DOESN'T EXTEND PAST BIRTH; PLAIN TALK

Texto completo: In many ways, the current fad in red states to pass unconstitutional laws banning abortion, even for rape and incest victims and the threat to a pregnant woman's life, is nothing short of disgusting.
Making it even more disgusting is that these laws in Alabama, Georgia, Missouri, Louisiana and elsewhere have been spearheaded mostly by men who, despite the myriad of unique circumstances involved in pregnancies, feel they have the right to force a woman to bear a child for which members of their gender are 50 percent responsible, but bear no consequences.
For sure, there are many abortion foes who sincerely believe that to abort a fetus is an intolerable sin. But, also for sure, there's a vast swath of so-called "prolife" advocates and lawmakers who are nothing but hypocrites.
They feel they should be able to force their views and religious beliefs on every one of us. But their concern for life stops there. While they piously insist that all babies need to be born, for too many of them, their "respect" for that new life ends right there.
How many of these "pro-life" grandstanders turn their backs when many of those unwanted children live in poverty or their families need help to buy enough food to keep them nourished? Just here in Wisconsin, you could fill a book with the names of legislators who insist a fetus is a human being and then oppose antipoverty or children's health programs for those many of them unwanted who are?
A former strident anti-abortion activist, Rev. Rob Schenck, made that point in a recent op-ed in the New York Times.
Explaining how he had organized thousands of protests in front of abortion clinics and was even arrested in 1992 by the Secret Service for thrusting an aborted fetus at then-presidential candidate Bill Clinton the evangelical minister described how his views on Roe v. Wade have changed dramatically.
"I've come to believe that overturning Roe would not be 'pro-life'; rather, it would be destructive of life," he wrote. "I have witnessed firsthand and now appreciate the full significance of the terrible poverty, social marginalization and bald-faced racism that persists in many of the states whose legislators are now essentially banning abortion. If Roe is overturned, middle- and upper-class white women will still secure access to abortions by traveling to states where abortion is not banned, but members of minorities and poor whites will too often find themselves forced to bear children for whom they cannot adequately care."
"What is 'pro-life' about putting a woman in a situation where she must risk pregnancy without proper medical, social and emotional support?," he asked. "What is 'pro-life' about forcing the birth of a child if that child will enter a world of rejection, deprivation and insecurity, to say nothing of the fear, anxiety and danger that comes with poverty, crime and a lack of educational opportunities?"
These kind of questions are cavalierly dismissed by the anti-abortion zealots who keep insisting that abortion is nothing less than murder and needs to be punished.
"This is what Christian rule looks like in America," countered Debra Nussbaum Cohen in the Jewish online newspaper Haaretz. "The evangelical crusade making its way from Alabama to the Supreme Court will force American Jews to submit to their distinctly Christian anti-abortion dogma."
The Alabama law refers to an "unborn child," a distinctively evangelical Christian description of a fetus, she points out while other religions, including Judaism, legally consider a developing fetus an appendage of the woman.
Besides, as Annie Reneau points out on Scary Mommy, abortion bans don't work, and in fact, in countries where it's illegal, abortion rates tend to be higher. The data show that the only things consistently proven to reduce abortion rates are good health care for women, comprehensive reproductive education and easy access to affordable contraception.
Ironically, a significant number of pro-lifers oppose those programs, too. If they're so concerned about bringing unwanted kids into the world, why don"t we see them marching, demonstrating and advocating for anti-poverty programs and initiatives? Where are their favorite politicians on these pro-life issues?
Unfortunately, I'm afraid, they're really not pro-life at all. CREDIT: By Dave Zweifel ; Dave Zweifel is editor emeritus of The Capital Times. dzweifel@madison.com, 608-252-6410 and on Twitter @DaveZweifel.

Taylor Mac's 'Gary' Ending Broadway Run

Texto completo: Taylor Mac's first Broadway play, "Gary: A Sequel to Titus Andronicus," will close on Sunday, seven weeks earlier than scheduled.
The play is an experimental comedy that imagines a conversation between a maid and a clown left to clean up the dead bodies after the bloodshed that roils the ruling class in Shakespeare's gory tragedy.
An unusual project for Broadway, it marked the arrival of Mr. Mac to the commercial stage. His previous works, in which he often starred, were produced in nonprofit spaces. His best-known project, "A 24-Decade History of Popular Music," has been presented to acclaim around the world.
"Mess is both the aesthetic and the subject of 'Gary,' " The New York Times theater critic Jesse Green wrote in praising the show. And "Gary" was nominated for seven Tony Awards, including best play.
But it was shut out at the Sunday ceremony, and is the first show to announce a closing afterward.

Directed by George C. Wolfe, "Gary" had a cast of Broadway favorites: the Tony winners Nathan Lane and Julie White, along with multiple nominee Kristine Nielsen.
Yet the show's box office has been dwindling since opening. Last week it grossed $ 211,093, which is just 24 percent of its box office potential, and had a very low (for Broadway) average paid admission of $ 41.64.
The play, one of five to open last season with Scott Rudin as the lead producer, was capitalized for $ 4.9 million, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and has not recouped those costs.
Upon closing, it will have played 45 previews and 65 regular performances.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Trump's intent is to deceive, divide

Texto completo: Contrary to what some North Dakotans believe, President Trump's sole intent is to deceive and divide us. His latest scheme is to accuse his opponents of committing "treason." Trump is abusing a power he doesn't have, to create the illusion that his rivals are un-American.
Article 3, Section 3 of the Constitution states: "Treason against the United States, shall consist only in levying war against them, or in adhering to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort."
"Levying war" means assembling a body of people to forcibly take over our country. "Aid and comfort" refers to help given by someone to an American enemy.
It is only possible to commit treason "during a war that is declared by Congress;" the last time that happened, was World War II, thus "Trump cannot declare someone treasonous."
Korea, Vietnam, the Persian Gulf, Afghanistan and Iraq were not wars declared by Congress. They were considered "Extended Military Engagements" undertaken by the presidents at the time.
Our president showed a fake video on Twitter that spliced together several verbal stumbles of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi at various news conferences. He was questioning her judgment and mental fitness. Note: Trump's lawyer "fixer" Michael Cohen is currently in prison.
The New York Times reported that "five anti-money laundering specialists" at Germany's, Deutsche Bank discovered multiple transactions involving Trump, from 2016-2017. A U.S. district judge ruled that Deutsche Bank turn over Trump's financial documents to Congress.
By attacking our constitutional institutions, Trump is trying to weaken America's moral decency until we just wearily give up. Allowing him to do whatever grotesque lawless things pop into his unstable mind. We cannot allow that to happen!
In the 1920s, because of a horrible tyrant, the German people allowed what Trump wants to do to us. Resulting in World War II.

In regards to impeachment, Pelosi needs to look in a mirror

Texto completo: If House Speaker Nancy Pelosi believes President Trump is a criminal, she should have the U.S. Capitol Police arrest him.

"I don't want to see him impeached," the Democrat leader said, "I want to see him in prison."

If so, she should order the Capitol cops, who guard Congress and who are under her control, to immediately take Trump into custody. The charges for the crimes he did not commit would be filed later.

It's her duty. Besides, where it is written in the U.S. Constitution that a president is above the law and cannot be arrested? It isn't.

As a matter of fact, at least two (that we know of) presidents have been arrested for bad behavior. And no president, according to Democrats, behaves more badly than Trump. Trump disagrees.

"She's a nasty, vindictive, horrible person," Trump said of Pelosi.

With Trump behind bars, Pelosi could then arrest Vice President Mike Pence, an obvious co-conspirator of the crimes that did not happen.

After taking both men down, Pelosi, third in the line of succession, would become president. The country and world would once again be safe for democracy. It would be a victory, like what happened when we stormed the beaches of Normandy and saved western civilization.

European and other leaders around the world would love to see a Trump takedown. With Nancy in charge it would be like having Barack Obama back in the White House along with his Make America Mediocre Again program.

Secret flights of planes loaded with cash for the mullahs in Iran would resume; deadbeat NATO members would once again pocket their dues, and the U.S Border Patrol would be abolished.

Illegal immigrants would automatically be declared American citizens with the right to vote — Democrat, of course—before they lined up for food stamps, free housing, free health care, free college and other free stuff.

The New York Times, Washington Post and the rest of the corrupt establishment media would also love it. It would be a replay of their attempt, along with dirty FBI agents, to destroy Trump with the phony Russian collusion hoax that was partially financed by the Hillary Clinton campaign.

It won't be easy to dump Trump. though. Trump is a fighter, a counter puncher who will not easily go down.

And while Pelosi has some 2,300 cops of the U.S. Capitol Police force, who protect Congress at her command, Trump has the Secret Service which protects him.

The agents of the Secret Service are not only better trained and armed than the Capitol Police, they dress better and sport scary sunglasses. And there are more of them.

The Capitol Police would have to go against at least 3,200 special Secret Service agents, backed by 1,300 uniformed agents as well as another 2000 support personnel.

While the Constitution protects members of Congress from arrest when they are performing their duties, there is no such provision for the president.

Still, even a brave, or foolish, Capitol cop might find it difficult to get close enough to the president to make an arrest, even though theoretically the president is not above the law.

But there is precedent for arresting a president.

President Ulysses Grant, a great Civil War general, who had a battle with the bottle, was arrested for what we today call distracted driving. Grant, according to the Washington Post, was speeding in his horse-drawn carriage in Washington in 1872 when he was stopped by a cop.

Since it was his second offense Grant was arrested and forced to pay a $20 fine.

Years earlier President Franklin Pierce, the 14th president of the United States, who also drank a bit, was arrested for running down an elderly woman while on horseback in 1853. The case was dropped because of insufficient evidence.

In neither case was there any evidence of collusion with the Russians or obstruction of justice.

All of this would be a bit of a summer smile if the problems the country faces were not so serious, and the country not so divided. There is plenty of blame to go around.

Nasty politics and nasty politicians are killing the country.

Americans 75 years ago launched the historic Normandy invasion, defeated the Nazis and set Europe free. Today politicians cannot even deal with thousands of homeless people defecating in the streets of L.A., San Francisco and Seattle. And they want to spend trillions on climate change.

Pelosi should impeach herself.

Texto completo: A version of this column ran Feb. 5, 2012. This is the first of two parts.
I was 14 when I first stepped off an airplane at Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport, the July heat baking me inside my skin like a potato.
The daughter of a Marine, I had lived all over, moving every two years or so, even to my mother's native New Zealand when my dad went overseas.
This time, my dad had retired from the military. Phoenix was our last stop. Everywhere else we lived had been temporary; here, there was family. I could put down roots, real ones, that wouldn't need to be dug up anytime soon.
As I stumbled toward the doors of Terminal 1 that day, feeling like a goldfish that had fallen out of its bowl and onto the tarmac, I could only wonder if my parents had moved us to hell.
But once I discovered that our new house had a swimming pool and that air-conditioning was everywhere, I began to fall in love with Arizona.
I learned to drive and packed my friends into Mom's silver station wagon to cruise Metrocenter mall. We tubed down the Salt River in cutoffs and built bonfires in the desert after Friday-night football games.
My dad offered to send me anywhere for college. I didn't want to leave. I had never been in one place for so long; I liked how solid it felt.
I went to Glendale Community College and to Arizona State University, where I worked on the State Press.
I spent spring breaks in Rocky Point, Mexico, and wore flip-flops to classes in January. I discovered waterskiing, rock climbing, mountain biking and the beauty of glowing pink-and-orange sunsets.
I applied for jobs in places you would expect — the Los Angeles Times, Washington Post, New York Times — and I would have been thrilled if hired by any of those. But I was secretly pleased when their rejection letters arrived and I was hired by the Mesa Tribune.
Because I could stay.
I am still here.
Wednesday: Why I've stayed.

Texto completo: Raptors' NBA title rests in Kawhi Leonard's large hands
It’s safe to say the Toronto Raptors are in massively good hands with star forward Kawhi Leonard (a. k. a. The Klaw), who won the Finals MVP award in 2014 with the San Antonio Spurs. It’s almost within his grip again with the Raptors leading the Golden State Warriors 3-1 heading into Game 5 Monday (9 p. m. ET, ABC). Leonard is averaging 30. 8 points and 10. 3 rebounds per game. A Raptors victory would give TV viewers another chance to see the MVP trophy engulfed by Leonard’s hands, which measure 9. 75 inches long. They are a shade smaller than Michael Jordan’s.
No Monday tariffs for Mexico, Trump says
President Donald Trump gave Mexico an ultimatum, demanding that it take stronger action to limit the flow of Central American migrants or he would impose an escalating series of tariffs on the country beginning Monday. But Friday, Trump said he was "indefinitely" suspending the threat because of an agreement reached with Mexico. The New York Times reported Saturday that the steps outlined in the deal were ones Mexico had already agreed to in previous rounds of negotiations, but Trump said the next day that there were some agreements Mexico made that were "not mentioned" in the official declaration.
Sexual abuse crisis didn't skip Southern Baptist churches
On Monday, the Southern Baptist Convention's Executive Committee will consider changes to hold churches accountable for sexual abuse. If approved, they will be taken up Tuesday and Wednesday when representatives from the more than 50,000 Southern Baptist congregations gather for the denomination's annual meeting in Birmingham, Alabama. Leaders in the largest Protestant denomination in the U. S. have spent the past year owning up to abuse in the denomination while trying to position their network of evangelical churches to better prevent sexual abuse in the future.
Mexican man faces federal charges in deadly Texas crash
The alleged driver in a crash that left six people dead near Corpus Christi, Texas, is set to appear before a federal magistrate in Houston on Monday. Ivan Dario Puga-Moreno of Montemorelos, Mexico, is accused of driving a vehicle that was found in a ditch near Robstown on Wednesday. Six people were found dead at the scene and nine were taken to the hospital with injuries, according to the U. S. Attorney's office. A court document states Puga-Moreno was trying to smuggle more than a dozen undocumented immigrants.
Month of rain in a day: Southeast faces massive rains
Rains that rolled into the Southeast will linger at least until Monday, with areas possibly getting a foot of rain, double or even triple the normal rainfall for June, AccuWeather said. Roads became rivers, high-water rescues were underway, and states of emergency were being declared in parts of the Southeast on Sunday after more than a month of rain fell in a day with more on the way. Flooding that brought havoc to Oklahoma, Arkansas and other states over the past two weeks was sweeping east, threatening metro areas such as Atlanta and Nashville, Tennessee, according to AccuWeather.

It's all rooted in white panic in losing numerical advantage

Texto completo: Every so often it's important to step back from the freak show of the moment so that you can see the whole circle. That has never been more important than at this moment and under this administration.
Everything that has happened during recent years is all about one thing: fear by white people that they will inevitably lose their numerical advantage in this country; and with that loss comes an alteration of American culture and shifting of power away from white dominance and white control. White people don't want to become one of many minority groups in America and have others - possibly from Asia, Latin America, Africa or the Middle East - holding the reins of power and dictating inclusion and equity.
This is manifested in every issue you can imagine: the Confederate monuments fight, opposition to Black Lives Matter, intransigence on gun control, voter suppression laws, the Muslim ban, the hard line on asylum-seekers coming across the southern border, calls to abolish the visa lottery, the defaming of majority Black countries, efforts to overturn Roe v. Wade, the addition of a census question that could cause an undercount of Hispanics, the stacking of the courts with far-right judges (the vast majority of whom are white men). You name it, each issue is laced the white panic about displacement.
One manifestation of this panic, on the fringes, is a growing domestic terrorism problem largely driven by white nationalists and white supremacists. As ABC News reported about congressional testimony given in May by the assistant director of the FBI's counterterrorism division, Michael McGarrity:
"He said that of the 850 domestic terrorism investigations currently underway inside the United States, about 40 percent target subjects who adhere to racist ideologies, and 'a significant majority' of them are white nationalists or white supremacists. The vast majority of the other cases involve subjects who promote anti-government or anti-authority sentiments, McGarrity testified."
Other groups, like the Southern Poverty Law Center and the Anti-Defamation League, have also been tracking and documenting this rise.
And yet Donald Trump has played down this crisis, saying that he didn't really think the rise of white nationalism was really a problem but that the threat was just "a small group of people that have very, very serious problems."
Just as Trump saw fine people among the Nazis in Charlottesville, he is unable to see - or more precisely, to admit and address - white nationalism and white supremacy because he is at this moment these causes' greatest champion.
The president won't condemn white nationalism because this presidency is white nationalism.
Instead, Trump and many others try to reduce white nationalism and white supremacy to terrorist plots and murderous rampages. They otherize the white militant while not acknowledging that their goals are the same, even if their tactics diverge.
The violent white nationalists are simply the leading edge, the violent vanguard, of the teeming massive of "soft" white nationalists and white supremacists, those who use stigmas and statutes as their weapons, those who have convinced themselves that their motivations have nothing to do with American racism and everything to do with American culture.

Mondale IN DEMAND

Texto completo: Walter Mondale swirls in his chair to review the long list of scheduling requests rolling into his downtown Minneapolis office. One group hopes to honor him for his work preserving the scenic St. Croix River. Another wants him to say a few words at a gala. Still another request comes from a middle-school student in Chaska, hoping to ask him about the Superfund program.
Flights to New York and Washington, D.C., need booking. Journalists coast to coast call or e-mail seeking interviews. Birthday brunches, business lunches, casual coffees and formal dinners are on the table, too.
Even at 91, the demands on a former U.S. vice president's time don't stop. Mondale grants as many requests as he reasonably can -- even from students. Even from middle schoolers. "Especially middle schoolers," he says, his face brightening into his signature beaming smile. "They teach us a lot."
Three-and-a-half decades removed from a run as the Democratic nominee for the U.S. presidency, Minnesota's highest-profile statesman is still giving back, his political power gracefully given way to influence and public service.
While the grind of an election campaign is well behind him and his hair is now white, he's still politically engaged and operating at an ample pace, reading two newspapers every morning, plowing through 900-page books, debating national policy questions with friends and colleagues, co-teaching a graduate-level class and providing guidance to politicians who seek his counsel.
"Mondale is a very good example of how you can be purposeful after retirement," says former Republican Gov. Arne Carlson, a fellow retiree who counts Mondale among his friends even though they were on opposite sides of the political aisle. "You want to wake up in the morning and be able to have some value. I think too many senior citizens put their value in their golf game or fishing or whatever it may be. I kind of admire Walter for staying active in areas of public service, public life."
U.S. Sen. Tina Smith, a fellow Democrat, still consults Mondale before making big career decisions. The two met, she recalls, in 1989 during a campaign door-knocking event when she was a relative unknown, and they've been friends ever since.
"Everybody wants to ask his advice, wants to get his approval, wants to know what he thinks about things," she says. "He has so much insight."
Avid learner
From the moment he wakes in his downtown Minneapolis condo overlooking the Mississippi River, Mondale works hard to stay current. Sitting in his favorite green velvet armchair, he pores over both the New York Times and the "Minneapolis Tribune," as he calls it, referring to the newspaper's old name.
To his left, bookshelves are filled with tomes on World War II, civil rights and, of course, U.S. politics, including a few where the name "Mondale" figures prominently. He loves reading history books because he learns so much from them, he says. He doesn't apologize for steering clear of fiction.
"I once said I don't read it because its not true," he recalls. "And I got a very nasty note from Garrison Keillor. … He thought that was ridiculous, but there I go."
An aide arrives at 7 a.m. on weekdays to cook and handle household chores. He'll almost always eat breakfast from pottery thrown by his late wife, Joan. Photos of her and their late daughter, Eleanor, and many other family members form a gallery taped to the kitchen cupboards.
By midmorning, the aide drives Mondale, wearing loose khakis and a sports coat, to his downtown office at the law firm of Dorsey & Whitney. On the 20th floor, he is greeted by Lynda Pedersen, his hyper-organized executive assistant who he calls his "not-so-secret weapon." She often hands him a cup of coffee right as he walks in, eliciting a dry joke: "Why do I always have to wait so long for this?"
In his modest corner office overlooking Target Field, Mondale makes calls, writes e-mails, and reads news on his desktop and smartphone.
"I'll show you how to do it if you haven't done it, he says to a visitor, pulling out his iPhone and clicking on a New York Times app. "It's fun. … This, you can catch anytime and get the news. See it?"
It's no wonder, then, that curveballs don't faze him. When a journalist from a local radio station interviewed him recently about a civil rights figure, she couldn't resist lobbing a few extra queries on different topics before she left:
What are Sen. Amy Klobuchar's chances of winning the nomination for president?
And what about news on Robert Mueller's investigation of the last presidential campaign?
Mondale didn't hesitate.
A longtime Klobuchar supporter, he says he believes she will "wear well" in the campaign, but with so many candidates it was too early to tell.
As for the Mueller investigation: "This was a horrible moment in American history where a foreign country had a deep influence in an American election," he says. "That should offend everybody, regardless of the foreign country. So we've gotta look hard at that."
Satisfied, the reporter turned off her recorder and Mondale gave her a friendly smile. "I cleared my hurdle here with you, huh?" he says. He then turned the tables, asking her questions about her work. "Whadda ya got for the rest of the day?"
'A Minnesota treasure'
Those who personally know "Fritz" Mondale use similar adjectives to describe him. Humble. Genuine. Decent.
In today's hyper-divisive world of politics, Mondale is a throwback to an earlier era, when politicians such as Hubert Humphrey, Wendy Anderson and Karl Rolvaag "had contacts across the aisle" and were more open to compromise, says Norman Sherman, a friend and onetime aide to Humphrey.
"He is partisan, but he's not rigid," Sherman says.
While politics and campaigns have changed, Mondale's "politics of civility and just his good-government view is more important than ever," Klobuchar says. On the campaign trail, she often quotes him reflecting on his time as vice president: " 'We told the truth, we obeyed the law, we kept the peace.' I always say that is the minimum that we should expect in a president," Klobuchar says.
Larry Jacobs, a professor at the University of Minnesota's Humphrey School of Public Affairs who co-teaches a course with Mondale, says some students may be surprised to find that Mondale criticizes both Democratic and Republican leaders for running afoul of the country's fundamental principles.
For instance, during their nonpartisan class on presidential power and the U.S. Constitution, Mondale has pointed out "that the Obama administration and previous recent administrations had bypassed Congress in pursuing unilateral presidential action," Jacobs recalls. "His commitment to the Constitution remains. His mastery of history and contemporary events is undiminished."
"He's a Minnesota treasure," adds Carlson, the former Republican governor. "I mean that. He's always represented competence, thoughtfulness and fairness."
Mondale has always been known to gather opinions and reach consensus, Carlson says.
"If people were to be critical of him, they'd say 'well, he's not quick in making decisions.' That's correct," Carlson says. "He is confident. He is self-assured. But he also understands that he doesn't know everything and seeks out the best in everybody else."
Smith sees Mondale's humility when she meets him for chicken wings at the Monte Carlo in the North Loop. He asks a lot about her and her family, she says.
"A lot of politicians spend most of their time talking about themselves," Smith says. "He can be annoyingly difficult … when you're trying to get him to talk about himself, he's very elusive."
He's had the spotlight plenty over the years -- state attorney general, U.S. senator, vice president, presidential candidate, U.S. ambassador to Japan. He's been a victor, and also suffered massive defeats. In 1984, during his presidential run, he lost 49 states to Ronald Reagan.
The campaign loss was a blow that he could see coming, he says, but he doesn't think there was anything he could have done to produce a different outcome. The public didn't want a Democrat at that time, he says, and not a guy who had served as vice president under Jimmy Carter.
Still, recovering from the sting took a while.
"I had a stack of books next to my bed and I'd read sometimes all night because I couldn't sleep, and Joan used to get mad at me and I said, 'you know, I think this is the best way to do it.' Then finally I was only reading half the night, and then a third of the night," he says. "But it took me some time to be normal. I mean, it hurt."
Politics is a rough game, and at times he's had some rough edges.
"When I went to Washington, I was so insecure I was sort of pushing my staff too hard in an unfair way," Mondale recalls. "Then my staff director Mike Berman pulled me aside: 'Look, you're a big ass. You've gotta stop this. You've gotta be kind to people or they're not gonna work for you.' So under that wise advice, I changed."
Nowadays, Mondale, who grew up modestly as the son of a minister in tiny Elmore, Minn., doesn't ask to be the center of attention or drive an agenda, colleagues say. But he's still motivated by a sense of responsibility for the future and he's happy to lend support when people request it.
He says he's not getting as many calls as he used to, but son-in-law Chan Poling, who spends time with the Mondale family every winter at a rented house in Captiva, Fla., says it's not unusual to walk by Mondale and hear him on the phone with the likes of Madeleine Albright or Joe Biden.
"He's definitely keeping his hand in it," Poling says. "The guy has no ego. … I see his drive into trying to make things right."
Understated celebrity
On a drizzly spring evening, Mondale's grandson drives him in a white Chevy sedan to the Humphrey School, where Mondale emerges gingerly from the passenger seat and walks into a gala alone -- no Secret Service agent, no personal assistants following.
At the check-in table, cane in hand, Mondale asks young staffers about their work. When the school's dean introduces him, the crowd rises and delivers a standing ovation. Mondale, standing at his table, launches into a seemingly extemporaneous five-minute speech laden with sincerity, effusive with praise and laced with humor.
Recognizing a member of Gov. Tim Walz's administration among the guests, Mondale recites a lighthearted anecdote from earlier in the day revealing that, like everyone else, he gets robocalls.
"Do you get calls with no name on it and you don't know whether to take it or not?" he asks the crowd, as if he were chatting with a friend. "Well, I got a call like that today … it had a Rochester [507] area code … I wasn't gonna take it, but my secretary said you better take it. So I took it."
Then came the kicker: "It was the governor on the line," he says to laughter from the crowd. "I said, 'I'm glad to talk to you.' He's doing a great job. You're all doing a great job." Later, his dinner sat half-eaten as Mondale indulged a steady stream of well-wishers seeking handshakes and photos.
Forward-looking
The gala was held in the building's atrium, now named the Joan and Walter Mondale Commons, and the master of ceremonies paid tribute to Joan Mondale's promotion of the arts.
Joan Mondale's death in 2014 still aches. "He was very, very close to his wife," Carlson says.
Through 58 years of marriage (they were engaged 53 days after their first date) they supported each other in everything, including the loss of their daughter, Eleanor, to brain cancer 7 ½ years ago.
"Awful," Mondale says, quietly exhaling a guttural groan as he looks at photographs of them in his condo. "Very hard."
If he gets sad or discouraged, it never lasts long. Often, he calls on the strength of both women for inspiration, he says. "If I continued to dwell on the negative, my wife would bong me on the head in some way to tell me get over it," he says. "So I try to stay positive and forward-looking."
As the first presidential nominee from a major party to select a woman as a running mate -- something Joan pushed, he says -- Mondale broke down a barrier and he's still hearing how it inspired people.
Women leaders sometimes tell him that Geraldine Ferraro's nomination propelled them in their careers.
"I've heard comments like that all over. … I never thought of that as being important, but it was," he says. "We had a whole generation of women that felt they were boxed in, couldn't move, a lot of times knew they had the talent, but didn't think they'd be considered because they were a woman. I think that's changed a lot, don't you? … That's progress."
He will help Klobuchar's presidential campaign in any way he can, he says. And he will continue to support Smith and many others. "I've worked for a long time in trying to get more women in government, break up that stag party."
It's part of Mondale's history-changing track record pushing for a litany of issues that may have seemed radical at the time but now are standard: Title IX for girls' and women's sports, the Fair Housing Act to end discrimination in housing in the 1960s, and leading the domestic spying inquiry for the Church Committee, which spurred limits on national intelligence agencies.
Decades later, Mondale continues to support other public fairness causes. He is consulting with Minnesota leaders who are re-examining redistricting practices, for instance.
"I think it's important that the public be fairly represented," he says. "When you rig districts, you usually tilt the process so that you get the result that you want. It's like the politician picking his people rather than the people picking the politician, and I think the latter idea is the American idea, so I try every way I can to get decent and open and honest redistricting."
Another big concern: the environment. A lifelong fisherman who still casts his line in remote places, including Alaska and the Canadian wilderness, Mondale worked to preserve natural spaces even before the rise of environmental politics.
"He will make a claim that he's one of the world's greatest fishermen. All I'm gonna say is he's still working on it," quips St. Louis County Sheriff Ross Litman, whose remote and rustic family cabin has hosted the Mondales for years. "He's still working on his walleye-catching skills."
In the 1960s, Mondale and Wisconsin Democratic Sen. Gaylord Nelson co-sponsored legislation to protect the St. Croix and other rivers from development under the federal Wild and Scenic Rivers Act -- one of the most satisfying moments of his career, he has said. He also worked on legislation to protect other rivers and create Voyageurs National Park.
For a period of time this spring, legislators from both parties pushed to rename a state park along the St. Croix after Mondale. Then someone pointed out a Minnesota law preventing naming entities after a living person.
Mondale was honored at the thought and poked fun at the complication. "If I'll croak, maybe they can get it done," he says. In the meantime, he'll continue to enjoy the natural beauty that he worked to preserve.
He and several friends gather for lunch at the Swede Hollow Cafe in St. Paul to plan their annual summer fishing trips.
"We discuss the problems of the world and settle most of them," says buddy George Millard. "He's always interested. He's got a good sense of humor and it carries him through and he's doing pretty well. Quite well, in fact. Every time I talk to him, he wants to know when we're going to go fishing." ï‚«

Texto completo: No han pasado dos días desde que se llego a un acuerdo entre México y Estados Unidos para suspender la imposición de los aranceles a los productos mexicanos para que el presidente Donald Trump volviera a amenzar a López Obrador.
“Sin embargo, si por alguna razón desconocida no hay (cooperación por parte de México), siempre podemos volver a nuestra posición anterior, y muy lucrativa, de (amenazar con) Aranceles; pero no creo que eso vaya a ser necesario” , dijo Trump en Twitter al defender el acuerdo pero sin dejar sus amenazas contra el gobierno de AMLO.
En una serie de tuits, Trump defendió el pacto migratorio logrado este viernes con México, por el que él accedió a suspender los aranceles que planeaba imponer a todas las importaciones mexicanas, después de que el diario The New York Times afirmara que algunos puntos se acordaron hace meses.
“Antes, México no estaba cooperando en la frontera, y ahora tengo una confianza completa, especialmente después de hablar ayer con su presidente (Andrés Manuel López Obrador), en que cooperarán mucho y en que quieren hacer bien el trabajo”, escribió Trump.
El mandatario aseguró que “se acordaron algunas cosas que no se anunciaron en el comunicado” del viernes, “una en particular”, y que eso “se anunciará en el momento adecuado”.
La Casa Blanca no dio más detalles sobre cuál podría ser ese acuerdo inédito, y el secretario en funciones de seguridad nacional, Kevin McAleenan, se limitó a recordar que, como se anunció el viernes, está previsto que siga habiendo negociaciones durante los próximos 90 días.
“Hay un mecanismo para asegurarnos de que ellos (México) hacen lo que prometieron hacer, de que hay un resultado y vemos una reducción grande en los números” de inmigrantes que llegan a EEUU, dijo este domingo McAleenan a la cadena de televisión Fox News.
La embajadora de México en Estados Unidos, Martha Bárcena, precisó después que las conversaciones entre los equipos técnicos continuarán “casi semanalmente”, por lo que en el plazo de 90 días podría haber nuevos anuncios.
“(Lo anunciado el viernes) es una declaración conjunta de principios, que nos da una base para la hoja de ruta que tenemos que seguir en los próximos meses en cuanto a migración” , explicó Bárcena en una entrevista con la cadena televisiva CBS News.
Bárcena apuntó que el objetivo es devolver las cifras de migrantes que llegan a EEUU a los niveles de 2018, y pronosticó que habrá “resultados en un plazo relativamente corto, de un mes o mes y medio”, gracias al despliegue de unos 6.000 efectivos de la Guardia Nacional de México en la frontera de ese país con Guatemala.
Pero la embajadora no confirmó que, como parte del acuerdo alcanzado el viernes, México haya “accedido a empezar inmediatamente a comprar grandes cantidades de productos agrícolas” a EE.UU., como aseguró Trump en un tuit este sábado.
“Estoy absolutamente segura de que el comercio en bienes agrícolas podría aumentar drásticamente en los próximos meses”, debido a la combinación de la suspensión de los aranceles y “la ratificación del (acuerdo comercial) T-MEC” en EE.UU., México y Canadá, subrayó Bárcena.
Su entrevistadora le pidió entonces aclarar si estaba hablando de un acuerdo paralelo logrado durante las negociaciones de esta semana, o si simplemente se refería a tendencias comerciales, y Bárcena respondió: “Estoy hablando sobre comercio”.
El pacto anunciado el viernes permitirá la ampliación a toda la frontera común de un programa que el Gobierno ha aplicado hasta ahora solo en tres puntos de entrada en la zona limítrofe, y que obliga a los solicitantes de asilo a esperar en el país vecino mientras se tramitan sus casos en territorio estadounidense.
Ese proceso puede durar meses o incluso años, y este año ya se ha enviado a México a 10,393 solicitantes de asilo en EEUU, según fuentes oficiales mexicanas.
La oposición demócrata ha criticado a Trump por usar la amenaza de aranceles para extraer compromisos de México sobre inmigración, y dos aspirantes presidenciales, Bernie Sanders y Beto O’Rourke, arremetieron este domingo contra el mandatario por su aviso de que, si no hay avances migratorios, volverá a amenazar con aranceles.
“Necesitamos una relación decente con México. Son nuestros aliados, como Canadá. No deberíamos estar enfrentándonos a ellos cada día”, dijo Sanders a la cadena CNN.

The book that Harper Lee never published

Texto completo: A series of bizarre murders that were never really solved and the beloved American novelist who never quite figured out how to write about them - it doesn't sound like the formula for a compelling book.
But in the hands of journalist Casey Cep, it adds up to a most fascinating read. "Furious Hours: Murder, Fraud, and the Last Trial of Harper Lee" combines true crime of the Southern gothic variety, complete with elements of race and rumors of dark magic, with an insightful biography of Harper Lee, whose 1960 novel, "To Kill a Mockingbird," became a classic of 20th century American literature and indelibly shaped the image of the South. It's also, as far as we know, the last book Lee ever completed.
"Furious Hours" is Cep's first book, but her articles have appeared in The New Yorker, The New York Times and elsewhere, and often Lee has been her subject. Cep extensively covered the odd circumstances around the 2015 publication of Lee's novel "Go Set a Watchman" (written before "Mockingbird," published 55 years after) and, in 2016, the author's death.
The first section of "Furious Hours," "The Reverend," tells the story that so captured Lee's imagination that she spent a year researching the case and many more years trying to write about it. It happened in and around Alexander City, Ala., northeast of Lee's hometown of Monroeville, the inspiration for the Maycomb of "To Kill a Mockingbird."
A local man named Willie Maxwell returned to the area after serving in World War II and went to work in the textile mills and pulpwood operations. He also became a preacher for Baptist churches with black congregations (churches, and most everything else, being strictly segregated).
Maxwell married and built a reputation as a hard and reliable worker. Tall, handsome and always elegantly dressed, he was a popular preacher. Then, in 1970, Mary Lou Maxwell, his wife of 21 years, was found beaten to death in her car on the side of a road near their home. Within days, Rev. Maxwell filed to collect a $15,000 life insurance policy he had bought "for twenty-five cents shortly before his wife's death," Cep writes, "shortly enough, in fact, that he never had to pay the twelve dollars required to renew it."
He was also charged with murdering her, but he was found not guilty after his neighbor, Dorcas Anderson, changed her testimony about what happened the night Mary Lou died. Within a few months, Maxwell married Dorcas. She was dead a year later, and Maxwell's brother and nephew also died under mysterious circumstances. Maxwell had life insurance policies - often multiple ones - on all of them. In two years, he collected almost $100,000; insurance companies began canceling his policies and refusing to sell him new ones.
Police investigated the deaths but never came up with enough evidence to charge him. Improbably enough, he married a third time, to Ophelia Burns, who had been charged with abetting Mary Lou's death but not convicted.
Then, in the summer of 1977, 16-year-old Shirley Ann Ellington, a niece of Ophelia's whom the Maxwells had adopted, was found dead at an obviously faked accident scene. At her funeral, Robert Burns, a relative and a law-abiding truck driver, stood up and shot Maxwell in the head, three times.
In the next wild twist, Burns hired lawyer Tom Radney. The second section of the book, "The Lawyer," dives into Radney's background and Southern politics. A white liberal who had campaigned for Robert Kennedy - which made him utterly exotic in rural Alabama - Radney had for years been Maxwell's attorney, in the case of Mary Lou's death and in civil suits against the insurance companies. Radney had profited from those insurance policies, but he cheerfully set about defending the man who killed his former client (in front of about 300) with a highly risky insanity defense.
In "The Writer," the third section of "Furious Hours," Cep analyzes the reasons for Lee's interest in the trial by looking at her entire life. Lee had cut her teeth in courtrooms; the daughter of an esteemed lawyer, A.C. Lee (the model for Atticus Finch), she dropped out of law school just weeks shy of graduating to pursue writing.
Cep recounts her struggles in New York City to write a novel and describes the steps that led to 'Mockingbird' and its phenomenal success. As Lee awaited its publication, she undertook another task that later helped spark her interest in the Maxwell case: She signed on as Truman Capote's researcher for a New Yorker article that would become "In Cold Blood," a true-crime classic.
Lee and Capote had been childhood friends in Monroeville, and their long relationship was a fractious combination of love and competition. The epigraph of "Furious Hours" is something Lee said about Capote: "We are bound by a common anguish."
Cep doesn't directly address the claims that it was Lee who wrote "In Cold Blood," but she makes clear what an enormous amount of work Lee put into the research - and what reservations she had about Capote's loose interpretation of "nonfiction." Their differences over "In Cold Blood" might have had as much to do with their later estrangement as Capote's reported resentment of Lee's celebrity (and Pulitzer Prize).
Lee herself came to detest celebrity, and she floundered for years over a second book. Then, 17 years after "Mockingbird" was published came the trail of Robert Burns, and Lee headed for Alexander City.
Cep describes how the Maxwell case appealed to Lee on many levels (not just Tom Radney's notion that he was a latter-day Atticus) - its roots in race and class in a small Southern town, its intimate but mysterious murders, its stark act of revenge. And it was an opportunity to write a true crime book whose accuracy and adherence to the truth she could control.
"But," Cep writes, "when it came to the story of the Reverend Maxwell, those were hard to come by and harder still to verify."
For years, the book was rumored to be imminent.
Cep wraps the story of the book that never came to light into an account of the strange last days of Lee's life, with all its legal entanglements and questions about the publication of 'Go Set a Watchman,' which she had long declared would never see print. In her last years, Cep writes, Lee no longer talked about the book she called "The Reverend."
That is the most tantalizing mystery Cep leaves us to contemplate: "Nelle Harper Lee's estate is sealed. The entirety of her literary assets, including whatever else exists of "The Reverend," remains unpublished and unknown."

U.S. envoy's comments roil West Bank controversy
The U.S. ambassador in Jerusalem says Israel has the right to retain parts, but not all, of the West Bank.
David Friedman's remarks in an interview with The New York Times published Saturday comes about two months after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to begin annexing parts of the West Bank.
It's unclear if the ambassador was revealing a component of the long-awaited Trump administration Mideast peace plan.
The Palestinians want statehood in the West Bank and Gaza, with a capital in east Jerusalem. Last year, Washington announced it recognized the city as Israel's capital.
Most of the world considers Israeli settlements in the West Bank and east Jerusalem illegal.
The Palestinians condemned Friedman's remarks, and Israeli group Peace Now said he was "a Trojan horse on behalf of the settler right," calling on Trump to fire him.
SOFIA, Bulgaria
Officials arrest boy, 16, averting suspected attack
A 16-year-old was arrested after Bulgarian police found explosive devices, an Islamic State group flag and other items in the boy's home that could have been used in a mass attack, a prosecutor said Saturday.
Police in Bulgaria's second-biggest city, Plovdiv, conducted a search after the high school student's relatives reported finding handmade bomb components, Deputy Prosecutor-General Ivan Geshev said.
Geshev said investigators think the case involved only the teen and not an extremist cell or network in Bulgaria. The teen received instructions about explosive devices through the Telegram messaging app, as well as how to convert to Islam, the prosecutor said.
Psychologists were questioning the youth to establish his motives, but the initial investigation has not established any specific bombing targets for a possible attack.

Heisler: Basketball gods tire of full-of-themselves Warriors

Texto completo: The party isn’t over for the Warriors but the fun is.
You know this thing has gone off the tracks if you’re the wife of the owner, sitting courtside next to the ultimate rapper power couple, when you lean across Beyoncé to ask Jay-Z if you can get him a lime in his vodka and soda … and are vilified globally.
That’s what happened to Nicole Curran, the wife of Warriors owner Joe Lacob, in Game 3 of the Finals when fans of Beyoncé – known as the Beyhive – decided the video showed their idol’s space being invaded, setting off a viral maelstrom, which, a tearful Curran said, included death threats.
In fact, nothing bad had happened, as confirmed by Beyoncé’s spokesperson who asked fans to “spread love, not hate.”
Unfortunately, all that was spreading that night for the Warriors was pain. Minority owner Mark Stevens, also sitting courtside, pushed away Toronto’s Kyle Lowry, who was chasing a loose ball, then, when Lowry protested, cursed at him.
The NBA barred Stevens for a year, fined him $500,000 and may force him to sell his 7% of the team.
Nor did Game 3 go so hot for the team. The injury-plagued Warriors were totally outclassed by the Raptors, a heretofore little-known crew that had avoided overtime in Game 7 of the second round with the stumbling 76ers on Kawhi Leonard’s shot that bounced four times on the rim … then was thought to be toast after trailing the Bucks 2-0 in the Eastern Conference Finals.
The Raptors led Game 3 for 46:35 of 48 minutes, winning 123-109 as Warriors Coach Steve Kerr took out his starters with 1:37 left, a surrender rarely seen in the Finals.
Remember when the Warriors were the adorable dynasty with cute Steph Curry and his band of merry marksmen?
Remember when they seemed invincible … like last week?
Then, out of nowhere, came this unexpected death struggle, capping a four-year glory run in which the Warriors once posted a record 73-9 finish and then landed Kevin Durant … won three titles, blowing a fourth in 2016 after leading 3-1 … then for the maraschino cherry atop the sundae of their magnificence, got DeMarcus Cousins on a one-year, $5.3 million deal.
Unfortunately for them, or fortunately for fans who tired of their domination and self-inflation, it seemed as if the gods had also had enough of the Warriors, whose starters began disappearing even as they went 12-4 in the West draw.
April 15: Cousins goes out in Game 2 in the opening round against the Clippers.
May 8: Durant is lost in Game 5 in the second round against the Rockets.
June 2: Klay Thompson and Kevin Looney go down in Game 2 of the Finals.
June 5: Raptors go up 2-1 as Curran offers Jay-Z a lime and Stevens reaches out and touches someone. Warriors haters just wish it had involved Lacob, the majority owner, who tipped off his self-importance after winning his first title, telling the New York Times his team was “light years” ahead of the others.
Not that a merely 2-1 deficit discouraged the Warriors. With Thompson returning for Game 4, they expected to lock this up in six games … with them as champions, of course.
“We just gotta continue to battle and win the next game, go back to Toronto, win Game 5, come back to Oracle, win Game 6, and celebrate,” said Draymond Green, team braggart. “Fun times ahead.”
Oops.
June 7: Klay goes for 28 points in Game 4 but they fall again. Once again, it isn’t close, with the Raptors winning 105-92.
With KD hoping to make it back for Game 5, the Warriors now expect to pull this one out in seven.
Win or lose, they’re going into a new arena in San Francisco next season, in which their fans, known for enthusiastically backing the team in the bad times, will have to pay tens of thousands of dollars in personal seat licenses as well as the standard exorbitant ticket prices.
So they may have already played their last game in friendly little Oracle Arena … which their loyal fans commemorated by fleeing up the aisles before it was over.
To give them their due, the Warriors really have been special.
They haven’t just been good but entertaining, sparking a revolution in offense. Curry is surely the greatest shooter in NBA history. Steph and Klay are surely the best shooting backcourt. The Steph-Klay-KD combination is one of the NBA’s greatest.
They’re also nice people. Kerr is a great quote and a super-nice man. Curry is said to be as wonderful a person as he is a player. For all KD’s whining, he’s considered a nice guy. For all Green’s braggadocio, he’s an unfailing stand-up guy who never uses the dodge of blaming his latest outrage on the press.
Lacob deserves his share of credit. It was his idea to hire Jerry West as a consultant, making the Warriors the first team to pay over $1 million for a part-timer … which turned out to be a bargain. If Jeanie Buss had been as savvy as Lacob when West was looking to rejoin her team, the Lakers might be in far better shape.
In the biggest “unfortunately” for the Warriors, more is at stake than one title.
The season has been played under the shadow of Durant’s ambition after he turned down a $150 million extension for a one-year deal to become a free agent this summer.
Insiders have paired Durant and Boston’s Kyrie Irving all season. Now with reports that Kyrie is leaning toward signing with the Nets … and Brooklyn trading salary to get a second maximum slot … the KD Leaves scenario looks ever more real.
It’s not over yet for the Warriors, but we’re about to see how many light years ahead they are now.

Texto completo: Nadie escapa a los precios exorbitante de la ciudad y el estado más caros de EEUU. Ni siquiera los profesionales. Irónicamente, muchos abogados que tratan de ayudar a quienes no tienen dinero, deben buscar un segundo ingreso para poder costear el trabajo que donan y/o cubrir sus deudas universitarias.
Según Jared Trujillo, presidente de la Asociación de Abogados de Ayuda Legal (The Legal Aid Society) , al menos un tercio de sus colegas allí a tiempo completo, tienen empleos adicionales las noches o los fines de semana. Y dos tercios deben una deuda de préstamos estudiantiles de al menos $200 mil dólares.
Danielle, por ejemplo, entrega comida para Grubhub y UberEats, y ayuda a personas con sus declaraciones de impuestos. Su colega Julia Boms acude a los tribunales en los días hábiles, y los fines de semana trabaja atendiendo una barra, como en sus tiempos de estudiante.
“Fui a la escuela para hacer esto”, comentó irónicamente la joven de 28 años a The New York Times. A pesar de tener además una maestría en psicología forense, vive en un apartamento compartido con dos personas más en Murray Hill, en Manhattan.
Otros colegas suyos son meseros, pasean perros o conducen autos para Uber.
Según un documento interno, The Legal Aid Society, la organización de servicios legales sin fines de lucro más antigua del país , ofrece a los recién graduados salarios iniciales de $53,582 dólares, que aumentan a $62,730 al aprobar el examen estatal del colegio de abogados.
En contraste, el salario promedio de los abogados de primer año en firmas privadas fue $135 mil dólares en 2017, según la asociación NALP.
Los ejecutivos de The Legal Aid reconocen que los salarios relativamente bajos son un obstáculo para reclutar y retener a abogados fuertes, especialmente en Nueva York.
No buscan competir con los salarios del sector privado. Su objetivo es alcanzar la paridad con los abogados en el Departamento Legal de la ciudad, que paga aproximadamente $108 mil dólares a profesionales con 10 años de experiencia. Los de The Legal Aid con experiencia similar ganan alrededor de $90 mil.
En una audiencia reciente en el Concejo Municipal, funcionarios de The Legal Aid destacaron la disparidad salarial ante los líderes que han propuesto otorgar a las organizaciones de servicios legales financiados por la ciudad $15 millones de dólares adicionales en el presupuesto 2019-20 para ayudar a cerrar la brecha salarial. Los abogados dicen que deberían ser $50 millones de dólares.
“El trabajo es difícil porque estás viendo mucha tristeza, mucho dolor”, dijo Janet Sabel, directora ejecutiva y abogada en The Legal Aid. “Ves a personas que están presas, ves a clientes cuyas casas están cubiertas de moho, simplemente estás viendo cosas muy, muy tristes. Queremos que la gente tenga tiempo libre”.
El tema de la baja remuneración para los defensores públicos ha llamado incluso la atención de la senadora Kamala Harris de California, quien busca la nominación Demócrata para presidente.
Harris dijo el mes pasado que presentaría un proyecto de ley que establecería la paridad salarial entre los defensores públicos y los fiscales de todo el país en un plazo de cinco años.
El alcalde Bill de Blasio, un Demócrata que también se está postulando a la presidencia, no se ha comprometido con el posible aumento a los abogados de The Legal Aid. Un portavoz de la alcaldía, Raúl Contreras, dijo que “las conversaciones con el Concejo sobre este tema están en curso”.
Mientras, en NYC los alquileres de vivienda han alcanzado precios históricos.

It was always the right place, never the wrong time, to hear Dr. John

Texto completo: There may never have been a more oddly mesmerizing musical stage presence than Dr. John. The outlandish, stunningly talented New Orleans music legend died June 6 at age 77, more than 60 years after his first professional gigs. To watch him on stage was to understand how genius and a form of madness can easily coincide.
Dr. John, born Malcolm "Mac" Rebennack, was flamboyantly funky with a stage voodoo persona complete with walking stick featuring what I thought was a snake’s head, but what the New York Times identified as “voodoo beads, a yak bone, an alligator tooth and key rings from Narcotics Anonymous.” His musicianship owed much to the unique New Orleans melding of R&B, boogie-woogie, and percussive funk, with occasional hints of his early psychedelic rock phase. But his sensibilities inhabited a bizarro world: Imagine, perhaps, Warren Zevon and Louis Armstrong somehow melding into one.
You had to see it and hear it to believe it.
This has been a tough three weeks for New Orleans. Dr. John’s death comes on the heels of the passing of famed chef, civil rights icon, and arts patron Leah Chase, which came just a fortnight after the demise of New Orleans media favorite Ronnie Virgets.
Virgets and Rebennack were childhood running buddies. Virgets once wrote a markedly endearing column about how he and his buddy Rebennack once happened into a downtown music instrument store and started fiddling with the piano keys. Virgets thought they were just cutting up, the way young boys do. Rebennack, whose father sold records as a side business, had other ideas.
For Rebennack, despite his later top-10 hit “Right Place, Wrong Time,” this was the right place and time together. Thus did Rebennack start on the path to becoming Dr. John, while Virgets had to be satisfied with becoming a storyteller and racetrack railbird.
Only New Orleans produces such characters in such wild abundance. Only in New Orleans do their potholed paths cross and recross with quite such frequent randomness. Or with such humor.
Listen, if you will, to Dr. John singing “How come my dog don’t bark when you come around?” Listen, and chuckle, and marvel. There always was a sly, engaging drollery behind Dr. John’s staged barking madness.

Texto completo: The picture in The News-Press recently of children pressing against a border fence was very sad, but after two years of this battle I have questions: did these children and their families really walk thousands of miles? If not, how did they end up at our border? Why now? Who is paying the bill and why? Do their countries of origin have no responsibility?
We, the American people, give millions in foreign aid to some of these countries, don't our employees in Washington, D.C., have a fiduciary responsibility to project our country and our tax dollars?
To me the biggest crime is all of the entities involved in the immigration catastrophe, using these poor unfortunate people as pawns in a vicious game of politics. Why are the media agencies not investigating where the foreign aid is going and who is financing this terrible crime?
Pat Tobiasen, Fort Myers
Not today Your story on D-Day was excellent; glad you took time to write this story. Thank your staff and the people who put this story together for your readers.
However I must say good thing this happened 75years ago and not today with the Democrats we have in Washington, the left-wing people like Pelosi and the Clintons, or the rest we would be speaking German instead of English.
Also with people that CNN and MSNBC have as reporters, and the Times and Washington Post, could not be trusted to tell a real story from the fake news they are putting out today. It is so sad that we can't trust our media to even get to the truth of a story that they have to work for Democrats and lie and and make up facts that are not true.
Hope thing change and we get the whole story, not lies we are told about Benghazi and emails that just went away and no one can tell the truth or be held accountable.

Warms heart? Trump's tax plan — following are quotes made by him on Sept. 27, 2017: "My plan is for the working people, and my plan is for jobs" When asked "you wouldn't benefit under your tax plan?" His reply, "No, I don't benefit, I don't benefit. In fact, very very strongly , as you see, I think there's very little benefit for people of wealth." He also said "I'm doing the right thing and it's not good for me, believe me."
Since those remarks, an analysis by the New York Times, a tax expert at Marcum L.L.P., three nonpartisan watchdog sites, and politifact.com have each arrived, independently, indicating that he would save more than $1.1 billion through 2027. That amounts to over $100 million per year.
Now let's suppose that you net $5,000 or $10,000 per year for the next 10 years, doesn't it just warm your heart that he was looking out for us little people and not himself?
Norm Singley, Cape Coral
Positive actions In a recent Mailbag a writer claims that the Democratic-led House is using impeachment as a diversion from working on issues, and says nothing else is happening. Actually the House has taken up 51 bills, resolutions, and suspensions since January – 49 of which they've passed. They passed a bill to lower prescription drug prices, and another one to protect preexisting conditions. The House also passed nine bills on veterans issues. Recently, Democrats tried to present Trump their infrastructure plan before he walked out of their meeting.
But Mitch McConnell has called himself "The Grim Reaper," saying he will kill any bills passed by the Democrats when they reach the Senate. He is following in the footsteps of John Boehner, who had said about Obama's agenda "We're going to do everything — and I mean everything we can do — to kill it, stop it, slow it down, whatever we can."
Your news source apparently doesn't want you to know about the positive actions of the Democrats.

Automakers to Trump: 1 mileage standard

Texto completo: Automakers, including two from Detroit, sent a direct letter to President Donald Trump pleading that he set one national standard for fuel economy and greenhouse gas emissions.
In the letter provided by the Alliance of Automobile Manufactures, 17 automakers, including General Motors and Ford Motor Co., said they want improved fuel economy and emissions standards. But they warn that if Trump changes the standards without broad support from states, particularly California, it could lead to an extended period of litigation and regulatory uncertainty.
But one standard would "preserve vehicle affordability and help advance our shared national interest in America's manufacturing and innovation leadership. Striking the proper balance will not be easy, but we know with your leadership it can happen."
Best for consumers Fiat Chrysler Automobiles did not sign the letter, which was first referenced by the New York Times.
Ford deferred comment to industry spokespeople. GM issued a statement:
"We continue to prioritize the need for one national program and remain hopeful that the parties can find a solution to achieve this goal. Regardless of the standards, we are committed to a future of zero crashes, zero emissions, and zero congestion. The pathway to that vision includes continually improving fuel economy and our commitment to an all-electric future."
FCA says it supports improved fuel economy but says regulations need to be based on market realities, such as the fact that many consumers have shifted their purchases from cars to SUVs.
A statement issued by FCA said: "Our position on one national program and the mid-term evaluation remains unchanged. It was made clear when we were one of just two automakers to testify last September at hearings held by the EPA and NHTSA."
Until the Trump administration froze fuel economy standards, the U.S. government had expected carmakers to achieve an estimated fuel economy average of 54.5 mpg by 2025. Those rules could return under a Democratic administration. "What works best for consumers, communities, and the millions of U.S. employees that work in the auto industry is one national standard that is practical, achievable, and consistent across the 50 states," the letter stated. "In addition, our customers expect continuous improvements in safety, efficiency, and capability. For these reasons, we support a unified standard that both achieves year-over-year improvements in fuel economy and facilitates the adoption of vehicles with alternative powertrains."
The automakers urge Trump to reopen negotiations on the planned rollback saying that market conditions have changed "materially since 2011. Relative to expectations, fuel prices are far lower, consumers are buying more SUVs and pickups, and the adoption rate of alternative powertrain vehicles has been slower than anticipated."
Contested issue The letter is the industry's most vocal rally to date against Trump's effort to weaken the rules set by President Barack Obama as part of his fight against climate change.
White House spokesman Judd Deere said, "As we acknowledged earlier this year, (California Air Resources Board) failed to put forward a productive alternative, and we are moving forward to finalize a rule with the goal of promoting safer, cleaner, and more affordable vehicles."
Asked about the letter, industry analyst Jeremy Acevedo of Edmunds said automakers may have "bit off more than they could chew" when they asked Trump to reconsider the Obama-era CAFE standards. "This letter in some ways represents ceding defeat to California and the CARB states, but it proves how desperate automakers are to avoid having two different fuel economy standards," he said by email. "While automakers may not want to meet these aggressive targets, at least it's something they can plan for, as opposed to years of uncertainty waiting out a lengthy court battle."
The automakers sent a similar letter to California Gov. Gavin Newson urging the state and the federal government to resume discussions on the issue. The California attorney general has reportedly said the state will sue Trump over the weakening of the car pollution rules.
Meanwhile, last month, 18 large institutional investors in GM told the carmaker to take aggressive action to protect federal fuel economy standards. The investors said GM's position calling for one national standard will weaken the current standards and undermine California's authority to set strict standards.
"By claiming a commitment to climate action publicly while lobbying against strong federal standards, GM exposes itself, and investors, to significant reputational and legal risks, regulatory uncertainty and delay, and systemic economic risks," said Rob Fohr, director of Faith-Based Investing and Corporate Engagement for the Presbyterian Church U.S.A., an investor named in the letter. Fohr said GM stock is currently held by the Foundation of the Presbyterian Church U.S.A.

Texto completo: George Conway, White House counselor Kellyanne Conway's husband, began criticizing President Trump on Twitter at the behest of his law firm, according to author Michael Wolff.
Siege: Trump Under Fire, which hit bookshelves Tuesday, says Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, a prominent Wall Street firm where Conway is a partner, placed "enormous pressure" on him to "distance himself from Trump and his lies."
Wolff wrote that Conway accomplished this by tweeting barbs at Trump.
This year, the conservative lawyer has repeatedly ensnared headlines by questioning the president's mental health and condemning his actions and comments.
Trump swung back at George Conway in March. "George Conway, often referred to as Mr. Kellyanne Conway by those who know him, is VERY jealous of his wife’s success & angry that I, with her help, didn’t give him the job he so desperately wanted. I barely know him but just take a look, a stone cold LOSER & husband from hell!" he tweeted.
Although Trump and his associates have suggested George Conway was either fired, quit, or rejected from a job at the Justice Department, he claims that he turned down a position at the agency heading the civil division. Conway contends he declined over Trump’s attacks on agency leaders and the firing of FBI Director James Comey in May 2017.
Kellyanne Conway led Trump to victory in the 2016 election as his campaign manager. She's since been one of his most outspoken supporters, frequently tangling with reporters over Trump administration coverage.
Wolff wrote that a friend of the couple said both George and Kellyanne Conway "hate" Trump, although Kellyanne only expresses her dismay in private. The Conways, who live in the Kalorama neighborhood in Washington, D.C., keep the neighbors "happy" in the liberal-leaning enclave with George's public diatribes against the president, according to the book.
Wolff wrote that Trump calls Kellyanne Conway “the poor man’s Ann Coulter," referring to the outspoken conservative author who has backed the president for his hardline approach to immigration and criticized him when he has strayed away from it.
Wolff’s last book, Fire and Fury, was riddled with unsubstantiated allegations, several of which were denounced as false. His new book is already facing accusations of falsehoods, and in an interview with The New York Times the author admitted he does not check his stories with his subjects.

Opinion: Green chile, coffee, sunshine and the 5G apocalypse

Texto completo: Author's views are theirs alone.
We live in an era of disinformation and bad actors assaulting our national security with impunity. The deployment of 5G is considered by some national governments to be not an evolutionary, but a revolutionary step for humankind. The bad actors seek to prevent us from participating in that by sowing fear through social media channels like Facebook, YouTube and the RT network (Russian television, aka "Putin's paw"). The goal is to stifle the deployment of 5G in the United States, making us less competitive on the world stage. Read the May 12 New York Times article "Your 5G Phone Won't Hurt You. But Russia Wants You to Think Otherwise." My hope is that I live long enough to enjoy a 5G world.
Taos is a haven for pseudoscience, which is the act of substituting beliefs for facts. It walks hand in hand with the parroting of disinformation and conspiracy theories. It commonly includes paranoia, the denial of known science, the cherry-picking of data and the discrediting of reliable sources of information. Typical pseudoscience cults include windmill cancer, climate change denial, vaccines and autism, gluten danger, chemtrails and, more recently, the 5G apocalypse.
It is important to understand the scientific method. One video rant, report or anecdote does not form a conclusion. Several qualified institutions must repeat an experiment, review it with scientists having similar skills and achieve the same results. Over the last 50 years, government and university laboratories have performed tens of thousands of studies on exposures to broad ranges of radio frequency (RF) and electromagnetic fields (EMF). These studies have not attributed one death to RF/EMF exposure.
In a May 9 Taos News opinion piece ("Radiation - are you out there?"), the author Tara Somerville uses talking points right out of the cherry-picking playbook. The author states that "The World Health Organization has classified Radio Frequency Electromagnetic Fields as Class 2B carcinogenic to humans" without explaining what that means. Class 2B defines a "possible carcinogen," meaning tests have presented inconclusive results. Other substances earning the WHO Class 2B label are: pickled vegetables, caffeic acid (found in coffee, green chile, many herbs), grilled meats and many common household chemicals. The WHO Class 2 identifies a probable carcinogen; Class 1 defines a proven carcinogen, making Class 2B a third-tier threat. Read the WHO article ( who.int ) "Electromagnetic Fields and Public Health: Mobile Phones."
The author conveys another blatantly false claim that "Hundreds of peer-reviewed studies (written by and reviewed by experts) link wireless radiation to several types of cancer, DNA damage, anxiety and depression, among other ailments, with heightened risks for children." You will not find this claim supported in any reliable scientific publication.
Another misleading assertion is that [wireless industry] "executives stated that $0 have been allocated for safety testing." The safety and dangers of RF/EMF exposure have already been documented for decades by thousands of studies. It is not the responsibility of the industry, nor is it necessary, to spend decades and millions of dollars to repeat those studies.
The author uses an unsubstantiated and simplistic assumption that with 5G "whatever dangers 1-4G pose are expected to be heightened and disease incubation periods shortened." Neither 4G nor 5G are new mysterious alien technologies. They are marketing labels for radio frequencies which have existed since the beginning of time, and have served other beneficial purposes for decades.
The FCC regulates how they are used and is reassigning the following frequencies for commercial applications:
•700 mHz was previously used for broadcasting UHF television. It is now used for public safety radio, i.e. police, EMT, civil alert. It will be used for large-scale, short-distance communications such as stadium events and vehicle communications;
•3.4-3.8 gHz was previously assigned for use in amateur radio, amateur satellite and aircraft to ground communication. It will be used for "smart city" and "smart grid" applications, such as managing power grid efficiency (smart meters), traffic management and other municipal infrastructure;
•26-28 gHz is used for satellite to earth communication, such as GPS, weather and scientific satellites including the Space Station. It will be used to increase personal cellphone data speeds by 10 times and signal distance to that of a powerful FM radio station.
We have long had a thorough understanding of which frequencies are a danger to humans. They are indeed "invisible rays," but their qualities are by no means mysterious. We know that the higher frequencies associated with 5G are less able to penetrate the skin. Overexposure to penetrating frequencies like X-rays, ultraviolet, and microwaves are well understood and used to our benefit.
By far the most dangerous source of radiation to humans is our sun. Over four million cases of skin cancer are diagnosed in the U.S. each year, of which 90% are caused by ultraviolet radiation from the sun. Almost a half-million Americans die annually from tobacco use. Over 7 million Americans die annually from airborne pollution from coal-fired power plants and auto exhaust. Today, I'm not concerned about a radio wave that's been understood and used for decades.
I encourage everyone to research thoroughly their chosen subjects, searching for multiple articles with concurring claims from known scientific institutions and reliable news outlets. Ignore everything from the RT and Fox networks, and especially flyers handed out at a grocery store.

Colts drafted Okereke despite sexual assault allegation

Texto completo: INDIANAPOLIS -- Indianapolis Colts general manager Chris Ballard did his homework on Bobby Okereke. A sexual assault allegation from 2015 didn't scare him off.

Just hours after Okereke's name surfaced publicly for the first time in the case, Ballard told reporters on a conference call he took a hard look at Okereke's past and made others in the organization aware of the accusation before selecting the Stanford linebacker in April's NFL draft.

"When we looked at it and talked to him, it was an incident from four years ago. He was never charged with a crime, he was never disciplined by the university," Ballard said. "He was a team captain, up for the Lott IMPACT award, he graduated with a degree in management and engineering and he's working on a master's. From everything we gathered, we felt it was appropriate to take him."

Okereke has not spoken about the incident since it was first reported by The Fountain Hopper, an independent student-run website at Stanford. The New York Times initially reported on the case in December 2016, without naming the parties involved, and said a university board twice voted 3-2 in favor of the accuser but that no punishment was assessed because Stanford policy required a vote of at least 4-1. The Times also reported the university denied the accuser's request for a third hearing.

Ballard said he learned of the allegation when Okereke addressed it during their first meeting at the Senior Bowl in January.

The Colts, Ballard said, then spoke multiple times with Okereke, contacted Stanford officials and reached out to others close to Okereke to create a more complete picture of the NFL prospect. Ballard said nobody spoke to the accuser or her attorney.

Ballard also made Colts owner Jim Irsay aware of the accusation prior to taking the 6-foot-1, 239-pound linebacker with a third-round pick, No. 89 overall.

"I don't want to sit here and act like we don't have sympathy for both sides," Ballard said, noting that he has three daughters. "It happened four years ago, and because there were no charges and no disciplinary action taken by the university, and because of his track record since, we felt comfortable drafting him."

Okereke recorded 96 tackles for the Cardinal in 2017 and 2018 and was named to the Butkus Award and Bednarik Award watch lists. He also was a quarterfinalist for the Lott Trophy, which is awarded annually to the nation's top defensive player for his performance on and off the field.

The Colts believe Okereke can add depth to an improving linebacker group and perhaps may emerge as a future starter.

"He was very honest about his side of the story and what occurred and how he had to move forward," Ballard said. "It's a very sensitive subject and it's hard, I get that.

Ballard added: "We talked it through and at the end of the day it falls on me."

'GREASE' IS THE WORD TODAY'S HIGH SCHOOL MUSICALS WERE BUILT ON THE NOSTALGIC HIT

Texto completo: Remember when "Grease" was the word for high school musicals? It was a show that hit at the heart of nostalgia for the days when the cool kids wore leather, had a cigarette tucked behind one ear and drove fast cars.
With "Grease" set to open Pittsburgh CLO's 72nd summer season, here's a look at the show's place in the evolution of high school musicals - from "Grease's" 1950s nostalgia-fest to today's Broadway teen revolution.
It was 1971 when "greased lightning" hit Broadway and stayed for six years, then four more from 1984-88 and again for five months in 2007.
The 1978 movie only boosted the popularity and added a few songs that have since been adapted to some onstage versions of the musical - "Grease," written by Barry Gibb and sung by Jersey boy Frankie Valli; and two John Farrar songs, the Oscar-nominated "Hopelessly Devoted to You" and "You're the One That I Want," sung by stars Olivia Newton-John and John Travolta. The latter became one of the best-selling singles ever, with more than 15 million purchased worldwide.
"Grease" isn't just about the good ol' days. It deals with peer pressure, boys pressuring girls for sex, promiscuity, teen pregnancy . although they all generally take a back seat to a coming-of-age story about the loves and friendships made in high school.
Today, the things that made these kids cool are not so cool anymore. Travolta and Newton-John don't sing "You're the One That I Want" until she makes a complete transformation to suit his ideal. In the movie, he tries to meet her halfway until he sees how far she'll go for him, and then all bets are off.
It would be cringeworthy if not for the fact that it represents a moment in time that holds great nostalgia for some baby boomers.
Without "Grease," it is possible there would be no "High School Musical" movie series. Made for a more diverse audience and squeaky clean, it introduced Zac Efron, Vanessa Hudgens and Corbin Bleu, among others. The first, in 2006, was the Disney Channel's most commercially successful original movie, and it spawned four sequels.
For many millennials, it was their introduction to non-animated musicals.
Also in 2006, Broadway was introduced to the coming-of-age musical "Spring Awakening," based on a banned German play, circa 1906, but with modern music and lyrics. Teen sex, incest, abortion, suicide . all were explicit topics, and "Spring Awakening" went on to win the best musical Tony Award.
Today on Broadway, high school musicals are all the rage and deal with topics from same-sex dating ("The Prom") to girl power ("Wicked" and "Frozen"). Led by Tony winner "Dear Evan Hansen," there's also "Mean Girls," "Be More Chill," "Harry Potter and the Cursed Child" and more that introduce or include characters in their teen years, often played by teenagers.
All are hits and attract young and older audiences at high Broadway prices.
Initially, it didn't look so good for "Grease."
The musical earned seven Tony nominations, winning none. Legendary critic Clive Barnes was not impressed. He wrote for The New York Times, circa 1972, that he recalled 1959 as a very good year for Burgundy, and probably for Coca-Cola, too.
The musical, he said, was "perhaps most successful in its suggestion of attitude and period, and there are times when 'Grease' catches the flavor to its time [and] the shy emergence of the new morality that made the summer of '59 different for teenagers from the summer of '42. The story is about the guy who should have been Elvis Presley getting his girl after a certain degree of misunderstanding. Not even Elvis Presley himself could ever have thought it interesting."
Audiences begged to differ, with their wallets. "Grease" went on to what was then Broadway history - in 1979, its 3,243rd performance displaced "Fiddler on the Roof" as the longest-running show to grace the Great White Way.
Now it's back in Pittsburgh, with a Broadway-caliber cast that includes Clay Aiken as Teen Angel, whose dated advice to "Beauty School Dropout" is: "If you go for your diploma you could join the steno pool / Turn in your teasin' comb and go back to high school!"
Ah, the bad ol' days that once looked so good, when the best a girl could hope for was romance with the most popular guy in school, or the steno pool, or both.
Makes you wonder what they will be saying about today's high school musicals in 50 years.

Texto completo: En el Congreso avanzan las voces en contra la decisión del presidente Donald Trump de imponer aranceles del 5% al 25% a productos mexicanos, al grado que senadores advirtieron que se oponían a sus planes.
Esto luego de que el presidente Trump afirmara desde Inglaterra –donde fue a visita de Estado– que los representantes serían “unos tontos” si intentaran bloquear la medida contra México, a partir del 10 de junio.
Aunque defienden la seguridad en la frontera –la principal razón por la que el mandatario impone las tarifas– rechazan que los impuestos se conviertan en una medida de presión, porque afectaría a productores estadounidenses.
El respaldo incluso llegó de senadores que abiertamente defienden al mandatario en casi todas sus medidas, como Ted Cruz , de Texas, reportó The New York Times.
“No me rendiré a nadie con pasión, seriedad y compromiso para asegurar la frontera” , dijo Cruz. “Pero no hay ninguna razón para que los granjeros, ganaderos, fabricantes y pequeñas empresas de Texas paguen el precio de nuevos impuestos masivos” .
Para otro republicano de Texas, John Cornyn , la medida del mandatario es como un suicidio comercial.
“Estamos apuntando un arma a nuestras propias cabezas” , expresó.
La determinación del presidente Trump incluso causó la reacción del titular de la Reserva Federal, Jerome H. Powell , quien insinuó que el Banco Central podría reducir las tasas de interés si la guerra comercial comenzara a dañar la economía.
Los 10 estados que podrían ser más afectados por esta “guerra” serían Arizona, Nuevo México, Texas, Michigan, Rhode Island, Missouri, Nebraska, Dakota del Sur, Iowa y Utah.
En Washington, D.C. hay una delegación mexicana, liderada por el canciller Marcelo Ebrard , para reunirse con su contraparte estadounidense, liderada por el vicepresidente Mike Pence y el secretario de Estado, Mike Pompeo .

Texto completo: YouTube anunció este miércoles planes para eliminar miles de videos y canales que promueven el neonazismo, la supremacía blanca y otras ideologías intolerantes en un intento por limpiar el extremismo y el discurso de odio.
“Los videos que alegan que un grupo es superior para justificar la discriminación, la segregación o la exclusión (serán prohibidos)” , dijo la compañía en un comunicado.
La prohibición también borrará aquellas teorías de conspiración que afirmen que no ocurrieron hechos como el tiroteo en masa en la Escuela Primaria Sandy Hook en Connecticut.
“Es nuestra responsabilidad proteger eso y evitar que nuestra plataforma se use para incitar al odio, el hostigamiento, la discriminación y la violencia” , dijo la compañía en información primero reportada por The New York Times.
La decisión de YouTube, que es propiedad de Google, se suma las acciones de Facebook para rechazar mensajes de ese tipo y vetó a a siete de sus usuarios más controvertidos, incluido Alex Jones , el teórico de la conspiración y fundador de InfoWars, quien también fue vetado en Twitter.
El presidente Donald Trump ha defendido a quienes publican mensajes que abonan a la discriminación, asegurando que las compañías tecnológicas han sido injustas y apoyan a los izquierdistas.
Incluso la Casa Blanca tiene una iniciativa para evitar que eso siga ocurriendo, pero algunas redes sociales y plataformas avanzan en el desecho de mensajes, fotos, videos y otros productos que inciten al odio y cualquier tipo de discriminación.
La comunidad hispana ha sido una de las más afectadas por el incremento de estos grupos de odio, incluso una de esas organizaciones, “Identity Evropa” , organizó una protesta en el Consulado de México en Nueva York en contra de los inmigrantes el 30 de julio de 2018.

To impeach or not to impeach? That may be the wrong question.

Resumen: Congressional Democrats have options other than impeachment when it comes to dealing with perceived presidential offenses – including censure.

Texto completo: Yes or no: Do you favor impeaching President Donald Trump? That’s the question Democratic politicians around the country are being battered with – at town halls, in fundraisers, during TV interviews. Support for impeachment has been slowly rising among Democrats in Congress, within the large Democratic presidential field, and among the American people.
Now that retired special counsel Robert Mueller has spoken publicly about his Trump-Russia investigation, effectively leaving next steps to Congress, the question has gained fresh urgency.
But “impeachment, up or down” may not be the right question. Indeed, in responding to a president who defies subpoenas and whom a significant portion of Americans view as unfit for office, Congress is not facing a binary choice. The options are many, including another form of sanction for perceived wrongdoing: censure, a formal reprimand in the form of a majority resolution by one or both houses of Congress.
“It’s a symbolic gesture that would please no one, but it might be the best alternative,” says a Democratic strategist, speaking on background.
Unlike impeachment, which is the constitutional procedure for expelling a president before the end of his term, censure is not mentioned in the U.S. Constitution. But it’s an option – rarely used – that would at least convey moral outrage over certain presidential actions, for those who feel it. The Mueller report found no provable conspiracy between Trump associates and Russia in the 2016 election, but it detailed 10 examples of potential obstruction of justice by the president.
Democratic pollster Mark Penn, a critic of the Mueller investigation, agrees that “censure makes sense” – in part because holding such a vote against the president in the Democratic-controlled House would put “a lot of Republicans in a bind.” Mr. Trump enjoys 90 percent support among Republican voters, which makes it politically dangerous for GOP members to vote against him. So far, the only Republican in either chamber to come out in favor of impeachment is the libertarian-leaning Rep. Justin Amash of Michigan.
A House censure vote against Mr. Trump could hold some political peril for Democrats. As with impeachment, Mr. Trump could wear a censure resolution as a badge of honor. And the party’s liberal base would likely perceive it as a mere slap on the wrist in the face of what many Democrats see as egregious or even illegal presidential behavior. But would it lead them to stay home in the 2020 election? Mr. Penn is doubtful.
“It’s pretty unlikely activists will pass on an opportunity to vote against Trump,” the pollster says.
For now, though, debate among Democrats centers squarely on impeachment – or more precisely, whether to launch a formal impeachment inquiry. The hope is that such an inquiry would unearth further evidence of presidential wrongdoing, either in matters related to the Mueller investigation or elsewhere, including Mr. Trump’s financial dealings.
In effect, a preliminary impeachment inquiry is already starting, though not in name. The warm-up act comes Monday, when former Nixon White House counsel John Dean testifies before the House Judiciary Committee on obstruction of justice, along with former U.S. attorneys and other legal experts. Mr. Dean was the star witness against President Richard Nixon in the 1973 Watergate hearings that eventually led to the 37th president’s resignation.
House Judiciary Chairman Jerrold Nadler has announced additional hearings in coming weeks that will focus on “other important aspects of the Mueller report.”
On another track, the full House is scheduled to vote Tuesday on whether to hold Attorney General William Barr and former Trump White House counsel Don McGahn in contempt for failing to deliver subpoenaed documents and, in Mr. McGahn’s case, for defying a subpoena to testify. The contempt resolution is expected to contain language that boosts Democrats’ efforts to obtain Trump tax returns.
So far, no key witnesses in the Trump-Russia inquiry, including Mr. Mueller himself, have agreed to testify in Congress. In a rare public statement last week, Mr. Mueller said “the report is my testimony.” But Democrats still want him to appear before Congress, if only to give voice to key points from his report, based on the assumption that few Americans will read the 448-page tome. Democrats have yet to subpoena Mr. Mueller.
Meanwhile, the list of House Democrats supporting an impeachment inquiry is growing – now at 59 (out of 235), according to a New York Times count. Among the two dozen Democrats running for president, 11 now support an inquiry. Overall public support for impeachment is also growing, though still not a majority. Mr. Penn’s latest Harvard-Harris poll shows support for impeachment and removal from office at 37 percent, up from 28 percent in April; support for “no action” is at 42 percent, and 20 percent favor censure. Among polled Democrats, 60 percent favor impeachment; among independents, it’s 36 percent.
Time is not on the pro-impeachment side, barring an explosive revelation. With each passing day, the November 2020 election takes up more oxygen and boosts the argument that the voters should decide Mr. Trump’s fate. Democrats are keenly aware that, based on what’s known, the Republican-controlled Senate would not come close to convicting and removing the president even if he were impeached by the House.
So the calendar, in effect, is House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s friend, as she tries to fend off pro-impeachment forces within her caucus. Speaker Pelosi maintains impeachment is still on the table, but only in the event of a major new revelation.
Here the argument becomes circular: The likeliest path to explosive new information, if it exists, would come via a formal impeachment inquiry, congressional Democrats say. They believe it would boost their case in court as they seek access to grand jury testimony and documents underlying the Mueller report. But most House Democrats fear a formal House move toward impeachment could boost Mr. Trump politically, as it did President Bill Clinton in 1998.
“Right now, if the House impeached Trump, the Senate wouldn’t convict. That inoculates him,” says Rick Tyler, an anti-Trump Republican commentator. “He’ll say he was exonerated. He’ll say it was all a witch hunt.”
Centrist House Democrats are also advising caution.
“I think people now are just all about the contempt vote next week,” a leading House moderate told reporters on background Tuesday. “Hopefully that will let off enough steam to avoid the impeachment vote. I think people still think – like me – oversight, oversight, oversight, you know? And use the courts.”
Whether there’s potential for a modern-day John Dean to step forward is another question. Historian Ken Hughes has his doubts.
Mr. Dean had agreed to become a key witness in exchange for a lighter sentence, stemming from his involvement in the Watergate scandal. But “it’s not clear now that the Democrats in the House have that kind of leverage over any current members of the Trump administration,” says Mr. Hughes, a research specialist and expert on Watergate at the University of Virginia’s Miller Center.
With former administration officials, there are major disincentives to cooperating with Congress. Some may be motivated by continuing loyalty to the president. There are also professional reasons to avoid testifying, Mr. Hughes says.
“Former Trump administration officials can fear being ostracized and fear losing job opportunities,” he says. “They can fear losing access to their former colleagues in the administration, which makes them less useful as lobbyists.”

People my age shouldn't run for president

Texto completo: This month, presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren and I will both turn 70. Warren will be the fourth septuagenarian officially in the race, joining Joe Biden (76), Bernie Sanders (77) and Donald Trump, who turns 73 on June 14. Personally, I am amazed to have chronologically made it this far. Those candidates and I were all born during the 1940s, which means we went though the 1980s as young adults.
That fact alone should disqualify all of us from running for president.
The '80s were exhilarating and then exhausting. As my crowd was coming of age and into positions of leadership, we had nearly limitless possibilities to define and achieve success. The war in Vietnam was over. We were allowed to take risks. We were unsupervised and unchecked, our privacy protected by analog obscurity. Boomers and our Warholian older brothers and sisters, were posing, positioning and philandering. We had loads of time to land on our feet and reinvent ourselves. Love was free. Cocaine was ubiquitous. Decadence had no consequences. We had only begun to hear about a blood disease that was affecting gay men.
I cast no aspersions on the emerging elderly for their youthful transgressions. My generation of geezers, through no fault of our own, lived our lives during the great social experiment that was the second half of the 20th century.
Growing up in the analogue era In my 20s, I made countless poor choices that regularly led to spectacular failures. As buffer to my habit of making impulsive decisions, I was absurdly lucky. I survived to my 30s and, by 1978, landed in post-Watergate Washington, D.C., with a grown-up career.
President Richard Nixon had resigned, and both the American government and I were getting a new start.
It turned out the times were an imperfect proving ground for noble intentions. The Reagan years were culturally flat, but politically stable and economically opportune. To quote Tom Petty, for the ambitious and energetic, "the sky was the limit."
Fast-forward to 2019. The past didn't go anywhere. Archival time capsules are everywhere, and they highlight our midcentury midlife decision-making — when we were developing character.
While not everyone's history is as colorful as these senior citizen contenders for 2020, for today's spry 70-somethings, it can be terribly uncomfortable that our hard copy records have been transcribed, digitized, cataloged and made keyword-searchable. Seemingly anyone can unearth acts and interpret motivations of our younger selves and upload them to the internet.
Back while I was learning about politics in Washington, D.C., in Burlington, Vermont, Sanders was fulfilling his civic duty as mayor. Coincidentally, both of us wrote down our interior thoughts on yellow legal pads. Mine are safely in my office closet stacked in a box full of self-recriminating scolds and personal pep talks in my handwriting about my work (challenging), friendships (mostly transactional) or parenting skills (lacking).
Awkwardly, Mayor Sanders' similarly toned, excruciatingly personal midlife existential doubts ended up among his official mayoral records sent to storage at the University of Vermont after he left office, along with, Mother Jones reports, "bank statements, an overdue gas bill, and a letter from an acquaintance asking Sanders to pay back $250 he had borrowed seven years earlier."
This month, more than three decades later, the now three-term senator and eight-term congressman's humanizing but hardly helpful notes-to-self ended up published. Mother Jones reported that the frustrated municipal chief, approaching middle age, complained to himself that he was losing his radical touch and maintaining a socialist "vision is extremely difficult when one is confronted on every corner with the ... suffocating force of the status quo."
Business values of the 1980s Meanwhile Trump, a self-styled mogul and beneficiary of the equivalent of $4.5 million a year from his father's clever generosity, was on a debt-fueled spending spree in the mid-1980s to build his own real estate and gambling empire in New York and Atlantic City.
Any interior thoughts during the mid-80s that media darling Donald Trump might have had have so far been shielded from snoopy reporters (and congresspersons) by nondisclosure agreements, sealed lawsuits and, perhaps, his early passion for "getting even."
Some light has recently been shed, however, on his business acumen. The New York Times obtained printouts from his official IRS tax transcripts, from 1985 through 1994. The Times calculated that Trump claimed $1.17 billion in losses for the period. Claiming these losses allowed Trump to avoid paying income tax for eight of the 10 years.
In response to this public peek into his early approach to playing the system, the 72-year-old first-term president said real estate developers were "entitled to massive write-offs," and "you always wanted to show losses for tax purposes." Apparently, loading up on loopholes was a common "sport" among real estate developers.
Thanks to my generation's harrowing histories, our compromised conditions and our diminished drive, the field of members competent to sit in the Oval Office has narrowed. That's as it should be. We are admittedly not as fresh as we once were.
The future might rest on electing a sufficiently "woke" candidate who can connect with a gender-fluid generation, plus set a deadline to save the planet and also develop policies to protect Americans from violence.
Boomers and the truly elderly added much to the culture of our era, but in these troubled times it seems right to me that we elect a candidate who will make appropriate choices for his or her contemporaries, and the ones who will follow. As I blow out my many birthday candles, I'll wish for an election that features fresh ideas.
For the long term, maybe we should consider an age limit to bookend the constitutional provision making 35 years old the minimum threshold for presidential authority. A reasonable maximum might be 70 (or possibly 75 to accommodate the many geezers who would want to be grandfathered in).

There are seemingly endless reasons to boil water. But how to most efficiently achieve the task has long been up for debate.
Tom Murphy, a physicist at the University of California San Diego put the various theories to the test in 2012. "I thought the microwave would be quite good," he said in a recent interview. He thought the same of electric kettles, but was more skeptical of the stovetop option, though he decided to test that, too.
Dr. Murphy focused on boiling water, but stovetops and appliances are used for heating up all sorts of things -- and they can use significant household energy -- so his experiment helps underscore how small changes might boost efficiency.
Taking readings from his electric meter, and rigging a laser to monitor his gas usage, he calculated how much of the energy actually went to heating the water, versus dissipating along the way. "You have all these loss channels," he said. Minimizing that loss means using fewer resources and likely emitting fewer climate-changing emissions.
As Dr. Murphy expected, the gas stovetop was not very efficient. With the largest burner on full-blast and no lid on the pot, he found that only about 15 percent of the natural gas being burned was converted to heat in the water. If you add a lid and use a small burner (which takes longer), you can potentially double that number but, he said, "the gas stove tops out at about 30 percent."
While Dr. Murphy did not test an electric stovetop, other estimates tend to rate their efficiency considerably higher than gas ones. But Dr. Murphy said that electric stoves are also conditional on a host of factors -- from burner geometry to the cleanliness of any reflective plates.
The microwave was a bit better; it clocked in at about 43 percent efficiency. But the figure was still about half of what Dr. Murphy had hypothesized. The kettle came the closest to matching its pre-experiment hype.
Most kettles, Dr. Murphy said, locate the heating coil directly in the water and have at least somewhat insulated sides, which both reduce energy loss. This enabled his setup to hit 70 percent efficiency. But those findings come with a few major caveats.
Foremost is that efficiency largely depends on your energy source. By the time electricity from fossil-fuel-powered plants has reached your home, Dr. Murphy notes, it's already lost about 60 percent of its energy (some estimates have that number higher). That scenario, he said, could drastically hinder the performance electric stovetops and microwaves.
Kettles suffer from the same electricity issue -- but also come with additional drawbacks that Dr. Murphy says can cause their efficiency to vary widely. The auto-stop function, for instance, often runs much longer than is necessary, which wastes energy. And people tend to overfill kettles. "Habitually, you're just heating a lot more water than you need to be," he said. "In practice, you're not likely getting any better than a microwave."
To get the most out of your kettle, Dr. Murphy says you should only boil as much water as you need and monitor the boiling point, so you can manually shut it off.
Dr. Murphy also looked into starting with hot water from your tap as a way to improve results (the myth that cold water boils faster has been thoroughly debunked). He found that it can probably help, because hot water systems are relatively efficient. But because a certain amount of the hot water will inevitably get left behind in your pipes, unused, the benefits of starting hot are greater when you're boiling large pots of water.
Dr. Murphy didn't test methods such as induction cooktops, which others have since found to be quite efficient. Technology is always changing (scientists in Oregon, for example, have developed new surfaces that could improve boiling efficiency) but he doesn't see any breakthroughs on the horizon that will make boiling water miraculously less energy intensive. The biggest thing individuals can do, he said, is be vigilant about our own habits.
"You just have to care about it," he said. "You have to pay attention."

Young Voters' Views on Climate Change
By John Schwartz
Younger Americans aren't happy with the Trump administration's handling of climate change, according to a new survey from researchers at the University of Chicago.
The report found that 82 percent of Americans 18 to 36 care "a great deal" or "some" about climate change; among Republicans in the survey, that figure was 73 percent. By comparison, a 2018 survey from the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication and George Mason University asked a similar question to a group representing the general population and found that 61 percent of Americans say they are "worried" about global warming.
The GenForward Project conducts regular polls of the generations known as Millennials and Generation Z. By focusing on age and building a relatively large survey population of 3,257 people, the researchers could measure differences in opinion by race, ethnicity and political affiliation, said Cathy J. Cohen, chair of the department of political science at the university and principal investigator for the project.
With so much concern about climate change from this younger group, it's not surprising that 70 percent of those surveyed said they disapprove of the way President Trump is handling the issue. Among Republicans, that figure is 44 percent; but when Mr. Trump is not mentioned and those same Republicans were asked whether the "federal government is doing enough to reduce the effects of global climate change," those saying it's not enough jumped to 56 percent. "When you take his name off of the policy," Dr. Cohen said, more of the young Republicans say "we're probably not actually doing enough."
These results are fairly consistent with other recent surveys of climate attitudes by the Pew Research Center and the Yale Program on Climate Change Communications, said Anthony Leiserowitz, the director of the Yale program.
Will climate change bring millennials to the polls?
When asked how important the issue is in choosing who they will vote for in 2020, only 18 percent said it was their most important issue, while 43 percent said it would influence their vote. Among racial groups, those most likely to say it would influence their vote were Asian-Americans (50 percent), then Hispanics (45); 41 percent of white and black respondents said it would. Of those saying it was the most important issue, 24 percent of Hispanics said it was, followed by 18 percent of Asian-Americans, 17 percent of blacks and 15 percent of whites.
Ultimately, Dr. Cohen said, "it's an important issue that they say will influence their vote, but it won't determine their vote."

Texto completo: Queen Elizabeth greeted President Donald Trump with a big (adorable) smile and a handshake Monday at Buckingham Palace to kick off a three-day state visit to Britain – only the third offered to an American president during the queen's 67 years on the throne.
Also Monday: iTunes' death, a rat-infested pop-up bar and the fate of James Holzhauer.
But first, calories: IHOP put a pancake inside a burger, and it's literally the most American thing we've ever seen. Now back to Britain.
Trump's royal tea time stymied by 'an ice cream'
A tea time between Prince Charles, the president and first lady Melania Trump hit a slight bump when a photographer's flash diffuser fell on the palace floor. “It looks like an ice cream," said Charles, 70, as he picked it up with a laugh. Monday evening, the Trump family feasted with the queen at a white-tie-and-tiaras state banquet at Buckingham Palace. *Double-checks email for invite. * No sightings of Duchess Meghan – as we totally expected.
Also Monday: Trump called London's mayor a "stone cold loser. " That's one way to kick off a U. K. trip.
Goodbye, iTunes, it's been a great 18 years
Apple didn't say it’s actually killing iTunes, but it will break it up into three separate apps. At its Worldwide Developers Conference on Monday, Apple said it will rename iTunes as a pure music app and pull out movies, TV shows and podcasts into separate apps. For mobile devices, iOS 13 is the new name for Apple's fall operating system upgrade. Here's what's new with iOS 13:
Dark Mode: This option gives a new look to your phone or tablet, with dark backgrounds.
Maps: An all-new, more information-rich look to the Maps app is coming soon.
Siri: The much-maligned personal assistant gets a new voice in the fall.
Photos: Management tools will be added to make it easier to find photos.
Log in with Apple: Apple will offer a "Log in with Apple" in a nod to privacy concerns.
Virginia Beach shooting hero died trying to save others
When Ryan Keith Cox heard gunshots, he rushed to get co-workers to safety and ended up sacrificing himself. Cox was one of 12 victims of Friday's shooting at a Virginia Beach municipal building. He died a hero, one colleague said. Cox led Christi Dewar and fellow co-workers into a break room and told them to barricade the door. “I've got to see if anybody else needs help," he said, per Dewar. Cox left. Then they heard gunshots. "That’s when he got Keith,” she told NPR. The day after the shooting, Dewar went to Cox's parents' house to tell them of their son's heroics, she said. “He's the type of person who you know would lay down his life for someone, just like he did," Dewar said.
(And a correction: The number of people injured during the shooting was misstated in yesterday's newsletter. Four were wounded. )
Real quick
A rat-infested pop-up bar is opening in San Francisco, for some reason.
A 17-year-old girl was bitten by a shark in North Carolina. She survived.
A YouTuber will get prison time for giving a homeless man toothpaste-filled Oreos.
Jennifer Aniston's emergency plane landing: "We heard an explosion. "
Missing Texas 4-year-old Maleah Davis' remains were confirmed in Arkansas.
Former "House of Cards" star Kevin Spacey appeared in court for that groping case.
Pirates of the Caribbean: Blackbeard’s copyright
It's basically a real-life "Pirates" sequel: Legendary pirate Blackbeard's famed ship, grounded three centuries ago, will set sail toward the Supreme Court over a copyright dispute. The case pits North Carolina against a video company documenting the shipwreck's salvaging. The state posted the company's work online to promote tourism, going so far as to pass "Blackbeard's Law" to make the salvage effort public record. That doesn't sit well with the videographers, who resorted to a play on words in their Supreme Court filing: “The state brazenly pirated them," the company protested. The pirate ship – Queen Anne's Revenge – ran aground in 1718 and was discovered in 1996.
Sorry, James, it’s over.
Big-time “Jeopardy!” spoiler alert!
The interwebs were (pretty much) on fire Monday morning when a leaked clip dropped that appeared to show “Jeopardy!” contestant James Holzhauer finally losing. Turns out, the clip was real. Holzhauer lost Monday, ending his 33-day run on the game show, during which he took home a total of $2,464,216. He came up just $56,484 shy of besting the all-time record set by Ken Jennings. “Nobody likes to lose,” Holzhauer said to The New York Times on Monday, confirming the loss.

Texto completo: In her latest delve into the legal world, aspiring lawyer Kim Kardashian West is working to free Kevin Cooper, a man sentenced and sent to death row for the murder of four people in the 1980s.
"I had an emotional meeting with Kevin Cooper yesterday at San Quentin’s death row," Kardashian West tweeted Friday. "I found him to be thoughtful and honest and I believe he is innocent of the crimes for which he was convicted. "
Kevin Cooper was arrested in 1983 for the brutal murders of Doug and Peggy Ryen, their 10-year-old daughter, Jessica, and 11-year-old neighbor, Christopher. Joshua Ryen, 8, was also injured, according to the Los Angeles Times.
Two years later, Cooper was convicted and handed a death sentence, despite wavering witness testimonies and arguments from the defense that evidence was being hidden.
"I am hopeful that Kevin will be exonerated since DNA testing has now been ordered on Kevin’s case and I remain grateful to Governor Newsom for ending capital punishment in California," Kardashian West also posted.
Food Network host Sunny Anderson added that Kardashian West's "dad would be so proud. " he late Robert Kardashian, was best known as the defense attorney in the O. J. Simpson murder trial in 1995.
New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof, who has previously argued that Cooper was framed by local law enforcement, praised Kardashian West's efforts.
"Democrats and Republicans alike refused to grant him advanced DNA testing, but now finally the testing is underway," he tweeted.
But many others criticized the reality star for siding with a man convicted of multiple murders and previously accused of rape, according to CBS News and The New York Times.
"Kim Kardashian has officially taken it too far by working with Kevin Cooper," one user tweeted. "He is a terrible person, rapist and murderer. It's actually pretty disturbing she's working with him. "
Others wondered if Kardashian West and her team had done their homework beforehand.
"Will you speak to the victims families?" another user wrote. "What are you trying to gain here? Just a voice for the accused not for the victims?"
The "Keeping Up With the Kardashians" star announced plans to apprentice with a law firm and study for the bar exam after successfully working to free Alice Marie Johnson, a 63-year-old who had been serving a life sentence for a first-time, nonviolent drug offense.
"I had to think long and hard about this," she told Vogue in April. "It’s never one person who gets things done; it’s always a collective of people, and I’ve always known my role, but I just felt like I wanted to be able to fight for people who have paid their dues to society. I just felt like the system could be so different, and I wanted to fight to fix it, and if I knew more, I could do more. ”

'Sopranos' home up for sale

Texto completo: Bada-bing, bada-boom: The real-life "Sopranos" house is for sale.
The New York Times said Friday that the 5,600-square-foot home at 14 Aspen Dr. in North Caldwell, New Jersey - the fictional family abode of mob boss Tony Soprano on the 1999-2007 HBO drama "The Sopranos" - has an asking price of $3.4 million.
While neighboring properties have sold for between $1.5 to $2 million, "I don't think you can quantify the intrinsic value of this home," Victor Recchia, 65, owner of the house with wife Patti, told the newspaper.
With four bedrooms, four full baths plus a powder room, two two-car garages and a detached one-bedroom guesthouse on a 1.5-acre lot, it rests behind twin pillars where its curved driveway meets a cul-de-sac road. It was built in 1987 for and by Victor Recchia, a construction-company owner.
While the interiors were recreated at Silvercup Studios in Queens, where production of the show was based, the house was used not only for exteriors but often for indoor location shooting as well. In particular, part of the pilot episode was filmed in the kitchen, and here was the backyard pool with its visiting ducks, and the patio where Tony Soprano (the late James Gandolfini) had his panic attack.
Like "The Brady Bunch" house in California, which recently was bought by HGTV for a nostalgic restoration reality show, the "Sopranos" house has its fans, many of whom take photos of themselves where the driveway ends and post them on a Facebook fan page.
"I was pulling out of the driveway and I noticed a few fellas on their motorcycles coming down the cul-de-sac," Patti Recchia told the Times. "So I open my car window just to acknowledge them, and they say, 'Hi, Mrs. Soprano! We're not going to mess anything up, just want to take a couple photos.' "
The series won 21 Emmy Awards and was hailed as groundbreaking for its delving into the family life and inner dynamics of a nominally villainous character. A prequel movie, "The Many Saints of Newark," starring Gandolfini's actor son Michael Gandolfini as a young Tony Soprano, has been filming at locations including Garden City for a planned release next year.

Texto completo: VIRGINIA BEACH, Va. – Four were engineers who worked to maintain streets and protect wetlands. Three were right-of-way agents who reviewed property lines. The others included an account clerk, a technician, an administrative assistant and a special projects coordinator. In all, they had served the city of Virginia Beach for more than 150 years.
These 11 city employees and one contractor were wiped out Friday when a fellow city worker opened fire inside a municipal building. A day after the shooting, city officials sought to honor them by sharing their job titles and years of service in a somber slideshow.
“They leave a void that we will never be able to fill,” said City Manager Dave Hansen, who had worked for years with many of the dead.
Police Chief James Cervera identified the assailant as DeWayne Craddock, who had been employed for 15 years as an engineer with the city’s utilities department. He declined to comment on a motive for the rampage, which ended with Craddock’s death in a gun battle with officers. City officials uttered his name just once and said they would not mention it again.
Joseph Scott, an engineering technician with the utilities department, said he had worked with Craddock and had a brief interaction with him Friday, passing him in the men’s restroom about five minutes before the shooting.
“He was in there brushing his teeth, which he always did after he ate,” Scott said. “I said ‘Hey, how you doing? What are you doing this weekend?’ It was just a brief conversation.”
Scott said he left for the day right after and learned of the shooting when a co-worker and then his son called him asking if he was OK.
“I couldn’t believe that it happened,” he said.
One of the dead employees had worked for the city for 41 years. Six worked in the same department as Craddock, though authorities have declined to say if anyone was specifically targeted or if the suspect had issued threats before. The victims were found throughout the building, on three floors, police said.
The municipal building was open to the public, but security passes were required to enter inner offices, conference rooms and other work areas. As a current employee, Craddock would have had the pass to enter the inner offices, Hansen said.
In response to a reporter’s question, Cervera said the gunman had not been fired.
One of the dead, Christopher Kelly Rapp of Powhatan, enjoyed Scottish music and joined a pipe band last fall. He played with the group in October during a Celtic festival in Virginia and marched with bandmates on St. Patrick’s Day.
“Chris was reserved but very friendly, quietly engaging members one-on-one after our weekly practices,” the band, Tidewater Pipes & Drums, said in a statement.
Another victim, Mary Louise Gayle of Virginia Beach, was described as a “super sweet lady” who always had a big smile. “She would always be out there in the yard, working on something and talking to my daughters,” John Cushman, Gayle’s next-door neighbor, told The New York Times.
The other employees who were killed were identified as Tara Welch Gallagher, Alexander Mikhail Gusev, Katherine A. Nixon, Ryan Keith Cox, Joshua O. Hardy and Michelle “Missy” Langer, all of Virginia Beach; Laquita C. Brown and Robert “Bobby” Williams, both of Chesapeake; and Richard H. Nettleton of Norfolk. The 12th victim, Herbert “Bert” Snelling of Virginia Beach, was a contractor who was in the building to seek a permit.
The police and fire departments were to assign members of their honor guards to help each victim’s family.
Authorities said Craddock fired indiscriminately. At least three other people who were wounded remained hospitalized Saturday.
Craddock appeared to have had no felony record, making him eligible to purchase guns.
Hundreds of people attended a Saturday prayer vigil for the dead. Scott said he, his wife and several others prayed for the shooter too.
“He was a human too, and his family is hurting too,” Scott said. “He’s not evil ... he was just another guy who had problems.”

Texto completo: In a plot twist worthy of a crime novel, the New York Times reported on Thursday that the hard drives of a dead political strategist reveal that the Trump administration's decision to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census was part of an alleged plot to help elect white Republicans.
The strategist, Thomas Hofeller, was a Republican known as "the Michelangelo of gerrymandering" for his work in creating partisan districts that benefited the GOP. Files on hard drives discovered by his daughter after his death showed that he wrote a 2015 study that found that adding a citizenship question to the census would lead to more Republican-friendly congressional maps.
Files on the drives also showed that he wrote the key portion of a draft letter that the Department of Justice used to maintain, dubiously, that the citizenship question was needed to help enforce the Voting Rights Act. The Times noted that "the disclosures represent the most explicit evidence to date that the Trump administration added the question to the 2020 census to advance Republican Party interests."
These revelations will not surprise anyone who has followed ongoing legal wrangling over citizenship and the census. On this issue - which will affect the day-to-day lives of millions of Americans for years - the Trump administration has consistently acted in bad faith and with disregard for ' the integrity of the census.
Every 10 years since 1790, the census has counted all the people in the country. The 14th Amendment explicitly states that "Representatives shall be apportioned among the several States according to their respective numbers, counting the whole number of persons in each State, excluding Indians not taxed." The word "citizen" does not appear in this provision. The framers' intent was clear. Apportionment was to be based on a count of all persons - whether they were citizens or not.
The Trump administration says a citizenship question is needed to bolster the Voting Rights Act. Civil rights groups and Latino advocacy groups dispute this notion. They point to research showing that a citizenship question will depress the response rate of Latinos and immigrants, as many will opt out, fearful of revealing their immigration status to the government.
A bipartisan group of six former Census Bureau directors has warned that adding a citizenship question would harm the count. The bureau's own experts estimate that 6.5 million people will not respond to the 2020 census if a citizenship question is on it.
In the lawsuits that resulted from the administration's decision to add the citizenship question, we learned a few things: The decision was rushed by Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross in a political manner, according to a federal judge in New York. Another judge, in California, found that Ross had "ignored" federal law when he insisted on adding the question. And the Trump administration disregarded the advice of scientists at the Census Bureau (who opposed adding the question), in favor of conferring with immigration hardliner Kris Kobach, the former Kansas secretary of state, and former White House adviser Steve Bannon.
Now the Times has uncovered Thomas Hofeller's pernicious influence in this, process as well. His research found that adding a citizenship question would harm the political power of Latinos and would be "advantageous to Republicans and non-Hispanic whites."
Not only did he urge the administration to add the question, he helped cook up the pretext that it was being done to protect voting rights - never mind that the Trump administration has not pursued any cases to protect Hispanic voters. This shady episode further politicizes the census, which is supposed to better our communities, not make some of them invisible. - (CNN)

Texto completo: Chris Wondolowski built upon his MLS record with his 151st career goal before halftime, and the visiting San Jose Earthquakes held on for a 1-1 draw against D.C. United on Saturday night at Audi Field in Washington.
Wondolowski has now scored the past seven goals for San Jose in their last three matches, two wins and a draw. Under first-year coach Matias Almeyda, the Quakes (5-6-3, 18 points) have lost only once in their past seven after beginning the season with four consecutive defeats.
Luciano Acosta leveled through an opportunistic rebound in the 68th minute, his second goal in as many games and fifth of the season. But D.C. United (74-6, 27 points), the top team in the Eastern Conference, remained winless with four points over their last five games, their longest such stretch since Wayne Rooney arrived in Washington last July.
Wondolowski's scored in the 37th minute, knocking home a head shot off a cross from Nick Lima. Wondolowski snuck in behind D.C. defender Jalen Robinson.
The Earthquakes dominated the first half, outshooting D.C. 17-3 in the first 45 minutes, including a 6-0 edge for shots on target.
LIMA, YUEILL CALLED TO NATIONAL TEAM » San Jose Earthquakes defender Nick Lima and midfielder Jackson Yueill have been called to the United States men's national team ahead of the Gold Cup. The 28-man roster will train and compete in a friendly against Jamaica on Wednesday in Washington, DC.
The friendly represents the final tuneup for the United States ahead of the CONCACAF Gold Cup, which takes place June 15July 7 in the United States, Costa Rica and Jamaica.
SALAH, ORIGI GOALS BRING LIVERPOOL CHAMPIONS LEAGUE REDEMPTION » Liverpool ended an incredible season by winning Europe's biggest prize after beating Tottenham Hotspur 2-0 in Saturday's all-English Champions League final ion Madrid, Spain, earning sweet redemption after agonizingly missing out on the Premier League title.
Mohamed Salah scored the second-quickest goal in a Champions League final by converting from the penalty spot in the second minute while Divock Origi sealed victory in the 87th after Liverpool had survived some heavy late pressure from Spurs.
Liverpool, whichmissed out on the Premier League title to Manchester City by one point, did not produce their usual whirlwind attacking game but Salah's debatable penalty and Origi's arrowed finish sealed a sixth European Cup triumph.
WOMAN ACCUSES NEYMAR OF RAPE » A Brazilian police document says an unidentified woman has accused Neymar of raping her in Paris last month. The document obtained by The Associated Press on Saturday says the incident took place on May 15 in a hotel.
The woman went to police on Friday in Sao Paulo.
Neymar's representatives have not replied to a request for comment. He is in Brazil preparing for the Copa America starting next week.
The woman says she and the Brazil star met in France after exchanging Instagram messages.
COLLEGE BASEBALL
CAL ELIMINATED FROM NCAAS » Dave Matthews hit a tiebreaking three-run homer in the fifth inning, and Central Connecticut State won its first NCAA Tournament game, eliminating Cal 7-4 in a regional game in Fayetteville, Arkansas.
Cal's Andrew Vaughn, who has a chance to be the first back-to-back winner of the Golden Spikes Award as the top amateur player in the country, was 0 for 6 in two games as the secondseeded Golden Bears (32-20) got swept in their first regional appearance since 2015. Vaughn also is expected to be a top-10 draft choice Monday.
SAC STATE KNOCKS OUT UCSB » Trevor Doyle had two hits, including a goahead two-run double in the eighth inning, and Sacramento State avoided elimination with a 6-4 victory over UC Santa Barbara at the Stanford Regional. Sac State (40-24) faced the host Cardinal in a late game Saturday in the double-elimination regional at Sunken Diamond.
Hornets' leadoff hitter Bronson Grubbs singled in his first three at bats and drove in three runs to help the Hornets open a 4-0 lead after four innings.
BOXING
RUIZ STUNS JOSHUA FOR HEAVYWEIGHT TITLE » Andy Ruiz flattened Anthony Joshua twice in the seventh round and capped one of boxing's biggest upsets to win his share of the heavyweight championship at New York's Madison Square Garden.
Ruiz won it at 1:27 by TKO in the seventh round to become the surprise champ in a bout that had shades of Buster Douglas' upset over Mike Tyson in 1990. Ruiz barely was on anyone's heavyweight radar when he was summoned as a replacement to fight champion Joshua in front of a packed Garden.
Ruiz (33-1, 21 KO's) stepped in after fighting on April 20, when he stopped Alexander Dimitrenko. Jarrell Miller's failed drug tests sent the challenger to the sideline.

Takuma Sato finished third on Belle Isle, followed by rookie Felix Rosenqvist and Ryan Hunter-Reay, who closed strong after spinning out and dropping to 15th early in the race. Pagenaud, who entered the race leading the series in points, was sixth after starting 13th in the 22-car field on Belle Isle.
The 70-lap race became a 75-minute timed event after thunderstorms delayed the start by more than an hour. There were five yellow periods due at least in part to conditions, leading to 14 laps under caution and 29 under green.
BYRON WINS POCONO 400 POLE » William Byron continued to assert his mastery of pole qualifying in the NASCAR Cup Series. Charging around the 2.5mile triangular track at Pocono Raceway, in 51.875 seconds (173.494 mph), Byron claimed the top starting spot for Sunday's Pocono 400 in Long Island, Pennsylvania.
"Pole day's been good for us," said Byron, who collected his third Busch Pole Award of the season and the third of his career after winning his second last week at Charlotte. "Keep racking those up and, hopefully, rack up a better result on race day, too."
The Daytona 500 pole winner beat Kyle Busch (172.629 mph) for the No. 1 starting spot by .260 seconds.
Clint Bowyer qualified third, followed by Erik Jones, Brad Keselowski and Denny Hamlin, as Joe Gibbs Racing put three of its drivers in the top six.

Assange espionage indictment: classified hypocrisy and a prosecutorial Trojan horse

Texto completo: The May 23 Espionage Act indictment of Wikileaks founder Julian Assange evoked justified outrage and condemnation from media organizations and free speech advocates. Federal prosecutors claim in the indictment that Assange illegally received classified U.S. government information on United States military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, State Department cables involving U.S. foreign relations and the identities of human sources helping American forces in Iraq and Afghanistan.
Carrie DeCell of the Knight Institute at Columbia University observed on Twitter that the “government argues that Assange violated the Espionage Act by soliciting, obtaining, and then publishing classified information. That’s exactly what good national security and investigative journalists do every day.”
Masha Gessen at The New Yorker addressed an equally weighty issue when she observed, “The last thing we want the U.S. government, or any government, to do is to start deciding who is and who is not a journalist.”
I’m going to take that analogy one step further: the last thing we want is executive branch departments and agencies unilaterally and selectively asserting what should or should not be considered legitimately classified information.
The very law being used to charge Assange was passed over 100 years ago at the beginning of America’s entry into World War I. The Espionage Act of 1917 was used by the Justice Department and Postal Service to cow, investigate, shut down and even prosecute news outlets that challenged the Wilson administration’s wartime policies.
One of the most prominent targets was former Rep. Victor Berger of Wisconsin and his newspaper, the Milwaukee Leader. For publishing editorials critical of the war, Berger was charged and convicted under the Espionage Act in 1919. Though the conviction was overturned two years later, in the interim, Berger won reelection to the House twice but his colleagues refused to seat him.
In Assange’s case, he and Wikileaks did exactly what newspapers have done for decades — seek information about U.S. government policies and actions that were either questionable or outright illegal and publish information accordingly.
In 1971 for the New York Times it was the Pentagon Papers — the classified history of the Vietnam War leaked by then-RAND Corporation analyst and former Marine Corps infantry captain Daniel Ellsberg.
For the Washington Post, it was Watergate, including then-Attorney General John Mitchell’s illegal, secret surveillance slush fund used to target Democratic politicians. For Assange and his then-U.S. Army intelligence analyst accomplice, Chelsea Manning, it was about exposing U.S. war crimes in Afghanistan and Iraq.
In the Assange Espionage Act indictment, federal prosecutors specifically invoke Manning’s sharing and Assange’s receipt of classified information as also involving violations of Executive Order 13526, National Security Information, which states (Sec. 1.4(a)) that “military plans, weapons systems, or operations” are considered classified under the executive order.
But the Army officials who classified the 2007 Apache helicopter video released by Assange showing the killing of Iraqi civilians misused the classification system to conceal criminal conduct — something expressly forbidden by Sec. 1.7(a) of the very same Executive Order federal prosecutors cited in the Assange indictment.
So where are the indictments against Pentagon or CIA officials who knowingly and deliberately misused the classification system to conceal acts of torture or other war crimes in Iraq, Afghanistan or elsewhere? The hypocrisy and selective application of federal laws, regulations and executive orders in matters of national security is on full display in the Assange indictment. And there is another deeply troubling thing about the latest Assange indictment: the Justice Department’s attempt to criminalize the digital transfer of government information to third parties.
The 18th count against Assange focuses on alleged violations of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA), namely that Assange (via Manning) sought to “knowingly access a computer … to obtain information that has been determined by the United States Government … to require protection against unauthorized disclosure” and to “willfully communicate, deliver, transmit, and cause to be communicated, delivered, or transmitted the same, to any person not entitled to receive it.”
The indictment also mentions three times Assange and Manning using “a cloud drop box” for the exchange of the purloined documents. In effect, prosecutors are arguing that the entire chain of digital exchanges between Wikileaks and Manning were illegal, and that the use of a “cloud storage” mechanism was a key feature of the crime.
Multiple news organizations utilize the Freedom of the Press Foundation’s encrypted SecureDrop system for receiving sensitive, including classified, documents from sources seeking to expose illegal or questionable government activities. If federal prosecutors prevail on Count 18 of the Assange indictment, it would open up every news organization in the world utilizing SecureDrop or a similar system to a CFAA prosecution — whether a whistleblower was digitally passing along Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) reports of immigrant abuse, Pentagon documents showing contracting irregularities, etc.
Prosecutors are attempting to overturn the Supreme Court decision in the Pentagon Papers case through a statutory Trojan Horse (the CFAA) all while deliberately ignoring the real crime in this episode — the deliberate misuse of federal classified information statutes and executive orders to conceal American government war crimes.
Former CIA analyst and House senior staffer Patrick G. Eddington is a research fellow at the Cato Institute.

Texto completo: The May 23 Espionage Act indictment of Wikileaks founder Julian Assange evoked justified outrage and condemnation from media organizations and free speech advocates. Federal prosecutors claim in the indictment that Assange illegally received classified U.S. government information on United States military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, State Department cables involving U.S. foreign relations and the identities of human sources helping American forces in Iraq and Afghanistan.
Carrie DeCell of the Knight Institute at Columbia University observed on Twitter that the “government argues that Assange violated the Espionage Act by soliciting, obtaining, and then publishing classified information. That’s exactly what good national security and investigative journalists do every day.”
Masha Gessen at The New Yorker addressed an equally weighty issue when she observed, “The last thing we want the U.S. government, or any government, to do is to start deciding who is and who is not a journalist.”
I’m going to take that analogy one step further: the last thing we want is executive branch departments and agencies unilaterally and selectively asserting what should or should not be considered legitimately classified information.
The very law being used to charge Assange was passed over 100 years ago at the beginning of America’s entry into World War I. The Espionage Act of 1917 was used by the Justice Department and Postal Service to cow, investigate, shut down and even prosecute news outlets that challenged the Wilson administration’s wartime policies.
One of the most prominent targets was former Rep. Victor Berger of Wisconsin and his newspaper, the Milwaukee Leader. For publishing editorials critical of the war, Berger was charged and convicted under the Espionage Act in 1919. Though the conviction was overturned two years later, in the interim, Berger won reelection to the House twice but his colleagues refused to seat him.
In Assange’s case, he and Wikileaks did exactly what newspapers have done for decades — seek information about U.S. government policies and actions that were either questionable or outright illegal and publish information accordingly.
In 1971 for the New York Times it was the Pentagon Papers — the classified history of the Vietnam War leaked by then-RAND Corporation analyst and former Marine Corps infantry captain Daniel Ellsberg.
For the Washington Post, it was Watergate, including then-Attorney General John Mitchell’s illegal, secret surveillance slush fund used to target Democratic politicians. For Assange and his then-U.S. Army intelligence analyst accomplice, Chelsea Manning, it was about exposing U.S. war crimes in Afghanistan and Iraq.
In the Assange Espionage Act indictment, federal prosecutors specifically invoke Manning’s sharing and Assange’s receipt of classified information as also involving violations of Executive Order 13526, National Security Information, which states (Sec. 1.4(a)) that “military plans, weapons systems, or operations” are considered classified under the executive order.
But the Army officials who classified the 2007 Apache helicopter video released by Assange showing the killing of Iraqi civilians misused the classification system to conceal criminal conduct — something expressly forbidden by Sec. 1.7(a) of the very same Executive Order federal prosecutors cited in the Assange indictment.
So where are the indictments against Pentagon or CIA officials who knowingly and deliberately misused the classification system to conceal acts of torture or other war crimes in Iraq, Afghanistan or elsewhere? The hypocrisy and selective application of federal laws, regulations and executive orders in matters of national security is on full display in the Assange indictment. And there is another deeply troubling thing about the latest Assange indictment: the Justice Department’s attempt to criminalize the digital transfer of government information to third parties.
The 18th count against Assange focuses on alleged violations of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA), namely that Assange (via Manning) sought to “knowingly access a computer … to obtain information that has been determined by the United States Government … to require protection against unauthorized disclosure” and to “willfully communicate, deliver, transmit, and cause to be communicated, delivered, or transmitted the same, to any person not entitled to receive it.”
The indictment also mentions three times Assange and Manning using “a cloud drop box” for the exchange of the purloined documents. In effect, prosecutors are arguing that the entire chain of digital exchanges between Wikileaks and Manning were illegal, and that the use of a “cloud storage” mechanism was a key feature of the crime.
Multiple news organizations utilize the Freedom of the Press Foundation’s encrypted SecureDrop system for receiving sensitive, including classified, documents from sources seeking to expose illegal or questionable government activities. If federal prosecutors prevail on Count 18 of the Assange indictment, it would open up every news organization in the world utilizing SecureDrop or a similar system to a CFAA prosecution — whether a whistleblower was digitally passing along Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) reports of immigrant abuse, Pentagon documents showing contracting irregularities, etc.
Prosecutors are attempting to overturn the Supreme Court decision in the Pentagon Papers case through a statutory Trojan Horse (the CFAA) all while deliberately ignoring the real crime in this episode — the deliberate misuse of federal classified information statutes and executive orders to conceal American government war crimes.

Designer Virgil Abloh comes to MCA

Texto completo: The other day, Instagram followers of Virgil Abloh, the 38-year-old creator of Off-White and also now the "artistic director" of Louis Vuitton's entire menswear line, got a treat -- the clearest image yet of Nike Air Force 1 MCA.
Chicago's Museum of Contemporary Art is not sponsoring Donald Trump's preferred conveyance. The MCA Chicago Air Force 1 is a pair of shoes, a collaboration between Nike and Abloh's Milan-based Off-White fashion label.
To quote the fashion site highsnobeity, the shoe is noteworthy for "a sky blue leather upper and midsole, the deconstructed Swoosh is a reflective silver color with white laces, a red zip tie, and white OFF-WHITE branding underneath the medial Swoosh."
Got all that?
Off-White fans, many of whom are teenagers, really want that shoe before anyone else. The place to get it, however, won't be one of the brand's 24 stores or even the likes of Barney's, which sells Off-White products. Unless you're Serena Williams -- who Instagram reveals Abloh gifted a bespoke version of one of these shoes, writing "FOR SERENA ONLY" on the sole -- you'll want to watch the Frenzy flash-sale app, where the MCA will have an online storefront.
You will also want to go to the MCA, which this summer features an exhibit all about the Rockford-born Abloh and his work, titled "Figures of Speech."
How, where and when you can buy the shoe remains, at press time, shrouded in some Instagram-friendly mystery. But the MCA's exhibit also includes a pop-up store, called "Church & State," sure to have other Abloh merchandise related to the show. There will be a scene. It's a bit like an art museum holding an exhibit of, say, Salvador Dali (during his lifetime), wherein the painter popped out new lithographs, exclusively in the gift shop.
This is not entirely new in the rarefied Abloh universe: this time last year, he dropped a special black-and-silver version of his Air Force 1 at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City. The public could only buy it in the gift shop there, which enjoyed some boffo days. But there is a distinction there: "Is Fashion Modern?" Involved the work of multiple designers and creators. "Figures of Speech" is all about Abloh -- his fashion designs but also his interests in music, entrepreneurship, architecture and graphic and industrial design. (Abloh received his master's degree from the Illinois Institute of Technology).
This all raises some fascinating questions about the relationship of a nonprofit museum with a fashion icon who has also partnered with IKEA and Evian, and who now heads menswear at a luxurious French fashion house worth billions of dollars and with a reputation as one of the most valuable brands in the world. Abloh may have begun with streetwear but he now travels by private jet.
You could look at this two ways. One is that the MCA has de-emphasized art in favor of high fashion, leveraged its own prestige to offer up a giant high-end commercial for two incredibly expensive European brands, even to the point of setting up a store for them. Selling, you might argue, should not be so integrated a piece of artistic exhibiting. You might claim a hot shoe created by a commercial (and highly compensated) designer is not an artwork on the level of some of the works you can find on the walls of the MCA. And you might raise your eyebrows at Louis Vuitton being one of the major sponsors of the upcoming MCA gala.
Some of these same arguments were leveled at the George Lucas Museum when the filmmaker wanted to build his edifice in Chicago -- another play, you might say, by a commercial creator for a purer "artistic through line" that the city rejected for a whole variety of reasons, relevant and otherwise.
In a May 23 interview with the New York Times (held, where else, at the Soho House) concerning this exhibit, Abloh said that he was himself musing on the relationship between fashion and art, and trying to reposition himself in the latter world by focusing on his "artistic through line." He told the newspaper that he wanted his works to be remembered as artistic creations -- and that the MCA retrospective was a crucial part of that personal transition. He also positioned the exhibit as a victory for diversity and egalitarianism, a shot across the bow of the old-school, curated and exclusionary elitism of art museums, you might say.
Why shouldn't somebody who started with T-shirts and now gets very well paid to do a "collaboration" at Nike get a retrospective? Are museums to limit themselves to artists who had patrons?
Commercial fashion, of course, has always aspired to be art and has historically found a place in museums, even if the designers have typically not still been in their mid-career 30s. And wealthy, fashionable customers always have sought the latest ideas from the runways.
But brands like Supreme and Off-White have made much more explicit plays for such recognition. On a recent weekend afternoon at Supreme's New York store, the line stretched around the block, the brand having limited the number of people allowed in a store that took its gallery-like cues from the innovations at brands like Apple, which figured out that looking like an art museum sold you more products at higher prices.
In London and New York, upscale streetwear brands now maintain Studio 54-like lines, complete with bouncers. And, of course, they know how to manufacture scarcity, "dropping" their products in limited qualities for limited amounts of time, announcing artistic "collaborations" rather than the more mercurial "partnerships," and increasing the value and collectibility of their wares, and maybe their status as art works.
You only have to consider the recent gala at the Metropolitan Art Museum in New York -- once merely the province of the social pages, now a major cultural event where the bedecked attendees are more interesting, and far more Instagram worthy, than some of the works on the walls. The MCA gala has, in fact, reinvented itself as a progressive parade.
Is all this really a move toward egalitarianism? That's arguable. Those MCA Chicago Air Force 1 shoes will be expensive items. But to suggest that any exhibit with a gift shop is shorn of commercialism is absurd. And if Abloh, a huge celebrity whose world-class work generates colossal revenues, wants to share some of that economic output with the MCA, why not be appreciative?
This is for sure: the MCA will be getting visitors this summer who never have walked through its doors before. And a museum has an ethical obligation not just to lead, but to respond to, the public taste. Especially of the young.
Abloh is a sophisticated artistic player in every way, not the least being his attention to legacy. Like Lucas, he has figured out that if you want to be remembered as an artist (with early, middle and late periods), you have to position (or re-position) yourself as one. You can't just trust people to figure that out for themselves anymore. Too much argument now. And Abloh has the clout to pull that off.
His secret weapon? The Nike Air Force 1 MCA, of course.

Texto completo: Just about a week ago lawmakers in Nevada passed a bill meant to guarantee that ALL of the votes cast by its citizens in a presidential election actually ... count.
Imagine that.
This doesn't happen in Arizona.
Or plenty of other states.
But there is a movement on to make it happen nationwide and Nevada has become the 15th state to join it. The Nevada bill would give all of the state's electoral votes to the candidate who wins the nationwide popular vote.
If enough states pass such legislation (and the momentum is building in that direction) the anti-democratic vestige of slavery known as the Electoral College would go the way of the sham Trump University (which shut down and ended with a $25 million settlement between the president and student-victims).
An organization called National Popular Vote is out to eliminate the Electoral College without tampering with the Constitution.
Nevada's decision, along with the other 14 states and the District of Columbia, commits a total of 195 electoral votes to the cause.
When enough states join the effort to reach 270 electoral votes the passed bills will kick in and guarantee that the candidate with the highest vote total nationwide would become the president.
As it should be.
President Donald Trump used to believe this, once tweeting:
The electoral college is a disaster for a democracy.
Hmmmm.
So true.
The creation of the Electoral College wasn't about moral certainty or about protecting small states (I hear that all the time) or anything like that. It was a simple power play by slave states.
Presidential Electors are granted based on population. Slave states wanted their slaves counted in their population numbers (even though they weren't citizens and could not vote) in order to give themselves more votes in the Electoral College. The "compromise" that was reached, grotesque as it now seems, was that each slave counted for three-fifths of a person.
It was the idea of James Madison, a slave owner, and the representatives of Southern states.
Those states had the most people — but only if slaves were counted. As Paul Finkelman, visiting law professor at University of Saskatchewan in Canada, pointed out, "None of this is about slaves voting. The debates are in part about political power and also the fundamental immorality of counting slaves for the purpose of giving political power to the master class."
A co-founder of National Popular Vote is John Koza, described by The New York Times as someone who helped invent scratch lottery tickets.
The National Popular Vote would finally eliminate the false premise that the Electoral College was meant to protect small states. In fact, our system reduces a presidential election to a few battleground states and voids millions of votes.
Koza said, "Everybody's vote should count. But entire campaigns run around a couple of states and that, in turn, distorts government policy."
A few years back, the Arizona House, by a 40-16 margin that crossed political lines, passed a bill to join the effort.
Then-Senate President Andy Biggs would not let the bill come to a vote in the Senate, however.
J.D. Mesnard, who introduced the bill, said in 2016, "Our presidential elections have come down to 10 battleground states. Arizona is so decidedly Republican that neither Democrats nor Republicans find it necessary or beneficial to campaign here. Arizona's issues are ignored because Arizona voters don't matter."
His view may have changed since Trump was elected by winning in the Electoral College while getting trounced by nearly 3 million votes.
This isn't be about Trump, however. Or any other candidate. It isn't be about Republicans or Democrats.
It's about divesting ourselves of a process for electing the leader of the free world by way of a system designed to count slaves as three-fifths human.

Texto completo: Not long ago, Frederic Eliot, head chef at Scales in Portland, posted a few choice words on Facebook. To Mainers, they were fightin' words.
"Fiddleheads are gross," he wrote. "They taste like moss when raw and then cooked, have zero flavor. Sorry hipsters."
The post (which made me laugh) drew a ton of protests from the chef's friends, but I understood where he was coming from, completely. Why? Because I feel the same way about rhubarb.
My opinions about rhubarb are as unpopular as Eliot's in my little corner of the newsroom, specifically in the chair occupied by food editor Peggy Grodinsky, lover of rhubarb in all its icky forms. She's always trying to get me to eat it, and swears she could present it in a form that would be palatable to me. (Is that the only demand we require of our food these days? That it be tolerable?)
Oh, I will eat rhubarb occasionally, if I am hungry enough and it is disguised well enough (meaning drowning in sugar). But I don't seek it out. Eliot, I discovered after a little back-and-forth, loves rhubarb jam. Do you know how much sugar goes into a basic rhubarb jam? For every 2 pounds or so of chopped rhubarb, you're looking at a whole pound of sugar. And don't get me started on that staple dessert of spring, strawberry-rhubarb pie. It ought to be called "A Waste of Good Strawberries."
I don't like the texture or extreme tartness of rhubarb. So shoot me. When Peggy begs me to reconsider, you know what I'm thinking? "Why is it so important to you that I like this odd, stringy stalk that looks like red celery?" It's not like I'm saying I hate puppies. There's no need to call the FBI to investigate my latent serial killer tendencies. Everyone has a food they don't care for. (In the Facebook fiddlehead exchange, one commenter noted that drinking Moxie was like "taking a sip from a flat can of Tab that had been used as an ashtray.")
My father hates broccoli with a passion. I have his genes, yet I love cruciferous vegetables, including broccoli. But I respect his tastes and never cook broccoli when I'm visiting. A lot of people gag at the sight of cauliflower, but I think an uncooked head of cauliflower is nothing less than a work of art. With the help of a hungry friend, I once consumed an entire (small) head of roasted cauliflower at Walkers Maine in Cape Neddick. And the fried cauliflower I had at Baharat in Portland a few weeks ago was so dreamy, I was tempted to order a second portion. I like bitter greens, and I love the tartness of kombucha. But undoctored, cooked rhubarb is too tart and feels a little slimy to me, like nature's pink snot.
Five years ago, I wrote a column headlined "Recipes to Make Rhubarb Haters Reconsider," for which I had to interview chefs about the creative ways they were cooking with rhubarb, such as in rhubarb cocktails and rhubarb-hibiscus crepes. Did that change my mind? No.
I am not alone in my disdain for rhubarb. Entire blogs and websites are dedicated to the topic. Consider the "I Hate Rhubarb" Facebook page, which is apparently based in Australia. The page has a few photos of people making funny "Rhubarb Faces"; they look as if they are sniffing sweaty, stinky sneakers. The page notes that rhubarb "is actually a weed that someone decided to eat centuries ago. It can be toxic and only ever gets used with loads of sugar."
"We have all been conned!"
Maybe the love of rhubarb is a regional quirk. Rhubarb was around (more or less) in my Southern childhood, but people don't eat it there the way they do here in New England. Here, I believe, love of rhubarb is heavily influenced by that first, desperate whiff of spring. It's another sign, along with crocuses and fiddleheads, that our long winter slog is at last coming to an end. If deadly foxgloves thrived in spring, we'd probably eat those, too.
I got a good chuckle out of a recent Facebook thread that was all about rhubarb. Marty and her husband Steve, family friends from Tennessee, recently moved to Wyoming. One morning this spring, Marty discovered something strange growing in her yard, right in front of her flower bed. It looked like a colorful, alien insect poking its head through the spring snow. She posted pictures.
"Who knows what this is beginning to bud from my Wyoming backyard?" Marty asked her Southern friends on April 20. "It grew last year into a tall plant with big stalks. Ugly."
Once a gardener identified the plant as rhubarb, Marty's friend Danielle interjected: "It makes an awesome pie!!"
Another friend said she'd heard praise for rhubarb pie for years, "especially if mixed with strawberries. Cousin in Virginia raises it. Says it's the best."
But many of Marty's friends appeared to be unfamiliar with rhubarb and with rhubarb pie.
"That's nasty," wrote Cindy. "I say spray it with Roundup." (Note: I do not endorse using Roundup, so please don't send me angry emails.)
"No lie ..." wrote Leigh. "I thought it was some ripped-up animal you took a picture of in your yard."
Some folks suggested that Marty transplant the rhubarb to a more appropriate spot. In the end, her husband cut it out of the yard, split it up and gave it to two couples at church.
Marty says if it grows back, she might try making a pie. Not on my watch, sister.
There is one thing I do like about rhubarb - the word itself. Did you know that the word rhubarb was used by radio actors in the 1930s to mimic the sound of a rowdy, out-of-control crowd? "Rhubarb, rhubarb, rhubarb..."
Think fibrous loose ends. A tangled mess. A rhubarb.
It's also baseball slang for an argument or fight between players and umpires (it was even used this way in the New York Times in 1947). Baseball lore says that sportswriter Garry Schumacher coined the word in the late 1930s, and radio announcer Red Barber popularized it.
According to Time magazine, fighter pilots on strafing missions during World War II were said to be "on a rhubarb."
My favorite use of the word is from a 1951 movie called - you guessed it - "Rhubarb." It's about a cat that inherits a Brooklyn baseball team from his wealthy, eccentric owner. Seriously. Academy Award winner Ray Milland, Gene Lockart, William Frawley (aka Fred Mertz) and even a very young Leonard Nimoy (who didn't get a credit for his role) are in the film.
Here's a bit of movie trivia that I know my editor, Peggy the cat lover, will like: A male marmalade tabby cat named Orangey played Rhubarb, along with 13 look-alike stand-ins. In the game scenes there were, apparently, a lot of catcalls from the stands. (Sorry, couldn't help myself.)
Back to rhubarb, the food. I confess that I always found Garrison Keillor's little ditty on A Prairie Home Companion, "Bebob-a-Rebop Rhubarb Pie," funny and catchy. Before singing the song, he always spun a tale of a day when everything - and I mean everything - went dreadfully wrong. His story of woe always ended with:
"Wouldn't this be a good time for a piece of rhubarb pie? Yes, nothing gets the taste of shame and embarrassment out of your mouth like a piece of rhubarb pie."
(Maybe because it's like washing your mouth out with a slimy glob of tart liquid soap.)
Then he sang: "One little thing can revive a guy, and that is a piece of rhubarb pie."
(Yes, because it's so awful.)
"Serve it up, nice and hot. Maybe things aren't as bad as you thought."
Or maybe they are, if that's all you've got for comfort food. Me? I prefer pecan pie. Or coconut cream.
Anything but rhubarb.

New York theater groups hosting a live reading of the 448-page Mueller report

Texto completo: Two theater groups and a media company are putting on a reading in New York of all 448 pages of the Mueller report from Saturday night to Sunday.
The groups are hosting the 24-hour event to spread awareness of former special counsel Robert Mueller's report to Congress over Russian interference in the 2016 election. The event, "Filibustered and Unfiltered: America Reads the Mueller Report," will take place at the Arc in Long Island City, according to the New York Times.
The theater companies New Neighborhood and Slightly Altered States and the arts and media company DMNDR have been planning the production for more than a month. The reading comes after with a press conference given by Mueller earlier in the week that thrust his report back into the spotlight and kicked off renewed calls for the impeachment of President Trump.
"It's not meant to be a performance," said Jackson Gay, who is directing the reading. "It's meant to be a bunch of people coming together and finding their voice. We shouldn’t just sit back on our couches and let other people tell us what to think."
"It's really just about our responsibility as American citizens to read this thing that we paid for," she said.
About 120 people have volunteered to participate in the event, according to Business Insider. The volunteers will take turns reading through the Mueller report, letting dramatic music play during the redacted portions. Audience members may enter and leave at any time during the reading.
The hosts of the event are not sure what kind of overall turnout to expect, but sales for the $10-ticket show have been "super encouraging," New Neighborhood's Steven Padla said.

A devout discussion with Daniel

Texto completo: Whether she's writing books or guest columns for the Telegraph Herald, the Rev. Lillian Daniel has a lot to say about religious
Community, prayer and what Christian
Houses of worship should strive to be.
The pastor at First Congregational United Church of Christ in Dubuque since 2016, Daniel also has been featured in the New York Times and on PBS. She mixes thought-provoking passages with a variety of anecdotes and humor, both in her writing and sermons.
"You don't pick out one line from Scripture and put it on a bumper sticker, right?" she asked during our recent podcast interview in her spacious office that is decorated with furniture from her childhood after her parents died at young ages.
"I do love tradition. I love history and that kind of thing. But when you study history and tradition in churches, it's not rigid. There's always more light and truth to break forth from God."
Daniel previously was a pastor at churches in Glen Ellyn, Ill., and New Haven, Conn.
Our discussion was the longest yet in this series, now in its ninth installment. Here are some excerpts:
Swenson: I am almost finished reading your latest book, "Tired of Apologizing for a Church I Don't Belong To." Describe how you came up with the title and what kind of church you belong to.
Daniel: (After telling a story, she said) Why is it that open-minded Christians will almost be in the closet about their faith? It's because they don't want to be compared to some other type of Christian. That's where the title came from.
If I weren't the pastor, I'd want to be a member of (First Congregational) church. It's a wonderful group, very historically grounded in God and the Christian tradition, but forward thinking, inclusive and open-minded. We just celebrated our 180th anniversary. We'll perform a gay wedding. I think we were the first to church in town to do that.
Swenson: The idea of a church community seems great to me, partly because I'm a Christian who believes that Christ died for our sins and that there will someday be a final judgment. That makes some Christians shudder these days.
Daniel: I think there are some churches where there's an urgent impetus to go out and recruit people and convert them to Christianity so that once they die and get to heaven, they're going to have the right identity card in their pocket. I don't believe that. I think there's depth and truth in different religions, and so for me, the value of religious community is not a get-out-of-jail-free card. And I don't think it's meant to be fear-based.
Now, I also acknowledge that I could be entirely wrong about salvation. I could get to heaven and Jesus could have words for me. I don't know the answer to that. But I feel more confident accepting the mystery and that my job description does not include judgment of others.
Swenson: How do you view Jesus, and what are your thoughts on heaven and hell?
Daniel: I don't know. I've been to neither one. I do acknowledge both and fall into that (author) C.S. Lewis understanding of it. Yes, you can end up distanced from God, but in his theology, basically there's not a mean-spirited, judgmental God creating the distance. It's still us creating the distance.
Yes, I believe that Jesus died for our sins and that we have new life through Jesus, but I cannot imagine the Jesus that I follow being up in heaven saying, "No Jews allowed." That makes no sense to me.
Swenson: Do you believe he rose from the dead?
Daniel: I do. But I think like most people, I have my moments where I think, "I don't know; that seems crazy." And then, I have my moments where I think the world is full of miracles and mystery and "who knows?"
Swenson: If there is no heaven or hell in the literal Biblical sense, why should people - such as an atheist and a humanist I have previously interviewed - bother with any kind of a church when they can create their own, equally loving communities? Who needs God?
Daniel: I'm kind of in the middle on that one. I have friends who are atheists and they spend time in community. The important piece you get with a religious tradition is community ... when life gets hard, somebody gets cancer, these are sort of the deeper things- sorrows of life, losses, death - that's where I think religious community can bring thousands of years of people wrestling with these ideas and this text, this weird collection of books we call the Bible. To me, that adds depth and meaning.
But I can recognize that an atheist could find that community at an ethical humanism society meeting and they would feed the hungry and visit prisoners and care for the sick. I wouldn't presume to tell that person that none of that counts unless it has a Christian gold star at the top or whatever. I think that's obnoxious, and I think Jesus would think that's obnoxious.
Swenson: I believe Jesus was perfect and that's why even more contemporary people say "What would Jesus do?" We try to live up to his standard.
Daniel: What's unique about Jesus and why people are so fascinated is the idea that he is both divine and human. So there are ways in which you can see this perfection, but you also have cases where he loses his temper, where he's out-and-out rude or unkind to people ...
Swenson: He weeps.
Daniel: ... he weeps, he despairs, he seems to give up hope at points. And that's what I think is so beautiful about this whole religion ... he plays a different role.
And this idea that God, in God's perfection and power, said 'OK, I've tried to talk to you people over and over again, I've come in a burning bush, I've done this ... you're still not listening. I'm going to come and experience life and the sorrow and the heartache you experience, and I'm going to die this horrible death so that we'll have a relationship. That's how much I love you.'
That's very different from other religions. And that sense of immediacy there.
And then, this idea we have of the third part of the Holy Trinity, the Holy Spirit ... that is continually interacting with us and wanting to have a relationship with us and have us live in beautiful, meaningful ways.

Texto completo: Let's go crazy
Twin Cities Public Television has been putting an emphasis on Minnesota's musical past recently, with rich rewards for those who want to party like it's 1999. Its latest archaeological dig has turned up "Rave Un2 the Year 2000," Prince's legendary New Year's concert from Paisley Park with timeless hits and fan favorites like "Nothing Compares 2 U."

The long con
If you thought "Gandhi" was lengthy, try sitting through the setup for Ben Kingsley's latest project, "Perpetual Grace, LTD." The Oscar winner plays a religious leader who, along with his wife (Jacki Weaver), may or may not be the victims of the world's most ridiculous con game. The end of the first episode suggests that this could end up being a fun ride, but getting to that tease is a bit of a struggle.
8 p.m. Sunday, Epix
Journalism 101
Each episode of "The Weekly" follows New York Times reporters as they work a big story, starting with the exposure of a Louisiana private school that cooks the books to get its students into Ivy League universities. I'm all for series that champion journalism, but the half-hour format makes the craft look a little too slick and easy.

Texto completo: Por un precio inicial de $3.4 millones de dólares, los fanáticos de la exitosa serie de HBO “The Sopranos” (1999-2007) pueden soñar con comprar la casa del mafioso principal, Tony (James Gandolfini).
Según The New York Times, la propiedad de aproximadamente 5,600 pies cuadrados, ubicada en 14 Aspen Drive en North Caldwell (NJ), ha sido colocada en el mercado.
La casa aparecía en los créditos de apertura del programa, cuando Tony se detiene en el camino curvo. Otras partes, como la cocina y un patio al aire libre, también aparecieron en el programa piloto. Más tarde se reprodujo para filmar escenas de interiores en un estudio en Queens.
Durante las seis temporadas del programa, la casa original se usó entre 30 y 50 veces. Las diversas escenas están bien documentadas en una guía en línea de los lugares de rodaje de “Los Sopranos”.
Muchos fanáticos se acercan para hacer fotos. Los propietarios son Victor y Patti Recchia, quienes se negaron a comentar cuánto les pagó HBO por usar su casa.
Victor, quien dirige Fourth Generation Construction, construyó en 1987 la casa de cuatro habitaciones y 4 baños y medio (con más de 20 en las cercanías).

Texto completo: What the composer John Corigliano remembers most about the AIDS crisis is the look of horror in his friends' faces when they received their diagnoses.
"Everyone had fear," he said in a recent interview. "You would be watching friends die, and wondering if you were next. And musicians were affected enormously."
Mr. Corigliano wrote his Symphony No. 1 in tribute to those who were lost to AIDS. The New York Philharmonic is performing the work, which had its premiere in 1990, on Saturday, as part of its season-ending series "Music of Conscience."
Later that evening, the Philharmonic will present one of its Nightcap concerts, which are meant to offer glimpses into the minds of living composers -- in this case, Mr. Corigliano, who has assembled a program including works by five colleagues who died at the height of the AIDS crisis.
"The Philharmonic is playing my First Symphony," he said, "but it is not a complete evening until you hear the music of the young composers who didn't make it. The real people who died need a voice, too."
Many of these artists died without the luxury of the personal estates or foundations that often help to keep composers' works in the repertory. Instead, their music was preserved largely through the efforts of the Estate Project for Artists with AIDS, which was formed in 1991, and whose records are now housed with the New York Public Library.
Even so, you would be hard pressed to find these five men represented in concert halls today. And they were still growing as artists when their lives were cut short: Unlike instrumental virtuosos, who typically find fame in their teens and 20s, most composers don't blossom until middle age.
"This is the tragedy," Mr. Corigliano said. "These guys were mostly in their 30s; they were just beginning to find their voice."
Chris DeBlasio, 1959-93
'Walt Whitman in 1989'

Mr. Corigliano remembers Chris DeBlasio, a student of his, as "just a very terrific young man who was in love with music." He was a singer and a composer, and often both at once.
He wrote musical theater and operetta, as well as incidental music -- including for "Night Sweat," a play by Robert Chesley, another composer on this list -- and eventually composed "Psalm 41" for an interfaith service on the eve of World AIDS Day in 1992, not long before his death.
"Walt Whitman in 1989" may be Mr. DeBlasio's most famous song. Mr. Corigliano has a theory about its lyricism: "Most of these composers were writing tonal works," he said. "Maybe they were desperately trying to speak to people, like they were saying, 'We want to go down leaving works that people want to hear."'
Deolus W. Husband Jr., 1959-89
'The Angel'
Deolus W. Husband Jr. also studied with Mr. Corigliano, as well as with Ludmila Ulehla at the Manhattan School of Music, where he received his doctorate in 1987. During the final years of his education -- and after, when he worked with dance companies and, for his last commission, the Harpsichord Music Society -- he lived in Upper Manhattan, in an Inwood apartment with his partner, Edwin Alexander, and their three cats.
Few recordings of his works survive. The score for "The Angel," a setting of William Blake, features experiments in graphic notation, which Mr. Corigliano found adventurous. "He went out of the standard kind of language," he said. "This is a highly sophisticated piece."
Robert Savage, 1951-93
'AIDS Ward Scherzo'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Robert Savage studied with Mr. Corigliano and other important gay composers, including David Del Tredici and Ned Rorem. He was also a pianist, and wrote mainly for that instrument, often performing his own music. Outside the music world, he was a member of the Zen Mountain Monastery in upstate New York; at the Gay Men's Health Crisis, he ran a Zen meditation group for people with AIDS.
He wrote "AIDS Ward Scherzo" while a patient at St. Vincent's Hospital in Manhattan. "I wonder if he was taking the word 'scherzo,' which means 'joke,' to make a point," Mr. Corigliano said. "It's extremely lyrical. With people around him dying, he must have found something really beautiful to cling to."
Robert Chesley, 1943-90
'Autumn'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Robert Chesley studied music at Reed College in Oregon, but he became better known as a writer. He wrote 10 full-length plays -- including "Night Sweat" (1984), regarded as the first play to reckon with the AIDS crisis -- and 20 one-acts, as well as short stories, novels and an opera libretto.
Among his nearly four dozen musical works are songs that struck Mr. Corigliano as necessary for the Nightcap concert, even though he never knew Mr. Chesley personally. When he first heard "Autumn," he said, he thought of the best of Schubert.
"It's completely simple, but without being simple-minded," Mr. Corigliano said. "The melody is clear and beautiful, and great art song is made of doing something so ingenious with so few notes."
Kevin Oldham, 1960-93
Sarabande and Toccata

Kevin Oldham didn't write music until he received his AIDS diagnosis. He was a Juilliard-trained pianist who had made a name for himself as the soloist in Rachmaninoff's "Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini." But he gave up concertizing when he made the switch to composing.
"It seems to me that whether you stay alive or not seems to be the trivial part," Mr. Oldham told The New York Times in 1992. "It's your work itself that must have a life of its own. If I can make sure that my music will continue to have life, that seems to be the more important consideration."
Being a pianist, Mr. Corigliano said, helped Mr. Oldham write "extremely good music" for the instrument, including the Toccata that will open the Nightcap concert. "He knew how hands work on the keyboard."
His Concerto for Piano had its premiere in 1991 and was broadcast on national television. The piece didn't have another hearing until 1993, with the Kansas Symphony Orchestra. By then, Mr. Oldham was hospitalized and diminished. But he left his bed to perform as the soloist in his own concerto, one last time.
