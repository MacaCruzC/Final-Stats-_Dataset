Texto completo: Sarah Palin is trying to get a share of the New York Times ad revenue as she continues a defamation lawsuit against the paper.
According to court papers amended Monday, Palin is seeking "punitive damages in an amount to be proven at trial far in excess of $75,000." The filing calls for "restitution in the form of The Times' advertising revenues attributable to the Palin Article."
Palin, 55, said the New York Times was driven by "animosity and ill-will" when it drew a connection between her PAC and the shooting of former Democratic Arizona Rep. Gabrielle Giffords. The original lawsuit was filed in June 2017 before being dismissed and then reinstated this year.
"Gov. Palin brings this action because Mr. Bennet and The Times did not live up to the primary responsibility attendant to the extraordinary power of the press: tell the truth," the complaint against the paper said.
The New York Times corrected the editorial at the center of the lawsuit, and editor James Bennet claimed no intentional link between the two.

Texto completo: Annually, I dedicate a year-end column to “pundit atonement.” I confess where I went wrong: my erroneous predictions, my gross misreads, my lapses of judgment, and my plain old errors.
This time, I won’t dwell on my worst moment of 2019 but actually my best work.
Alienated America is the book I started working on in late 2015 when Donald Trump was surging and I wondered why so many people agreed with him that the American dream was dead. The book came out in February 2019, and, while it never made the New York Times bestseller list, I consider it a success.
I argued that working-class woe in America is real. It was not some imagined suffering by those bitter at losing their privilege. The root cause was not purely economic, I contended. Rather, the collapse of community institutions was causing a variety of maladies, such as the winnowing of the labor force, a plague of drug addiction, the breakdown of the family, and increasing political rancor.
And the most important institution to collapse in the United States, I argued, has been the church. Religious congregations — Catholic, mainline, evangelical, black, white, Jewish, Muslim — have always been the core institution of civil society for America’s working and middle classes. Half of all civic activity originates in religious organizations, Robert Putnam found in Bowling Alone.
The secularization of America, then, is a deadly plague. What caused it? In answering this question, I made my gravest omission of the year. I rightly pointed to technology and modernity. I pointed to a changing morality that is more at odds with the teachings of most faiths. I pointed to an active effort by the Left to drive the church out of the public square.
But I let the greatest culprit of all off the hook — the church itself.
In Alienated America, I acknowledged that my own Catholic Church, along with Protestant denominations, had driven people away with a multitude of their own sins. But the culpability here deserved far more attention than the passing mention I gave it.
Catholic priests raped and abused children, young men, and young women, and the hierarchy covered it up. It’s hard to imagine a greater violation of Christ’s commandment to care for the least among us. It’s hard to imagine a greater abdication of the duty to be like the Good Shepherd. The church's shepherds were, in fact, protecting a flock of wolves.
Many of the direct victims of this abuse have never recovered. But there’s a second set of victims of this scandal: those who have fallen away from church or seen church fall away from them.
Just before Alienated America was released, I was editing some op-eds at the pub near my home, with an early copy of my book sitting on the bar. The guy on the stool next to me asked about the book. When I got to the part about church closings, he told me he was a former Catholic.
The little evangelist awoke inside me, and I tried to gently prod him to come back. Then he told me his story.
Sometime last decade, he wanted to volunteer to teach some basics of his trade to the children of his parish as part of a broader vocational education event. But the pastor would not let him because he hadn’t gone through the background check and training regimen the diocese required to guard against pedophiles.
Sure enough, though, it wasn't long before a priest who had been in that same parish was credibly accused of sexual assault.
The hypocrisy was just too much for this man, and his story was too much for me to rebut. What's more, his story isn’t that rare — many people have left the church, spurred by similar events. As attendance has dropped, local parishes have closed, and so still more people have dropped out. The folks left behind without a spiritual home are left alienated, at the mercies of the plagues afflicting the working class.
Much less serious sins than that have undermined the churches of this country. Many churches have replaced spirituality with politics. Others have abandoned their duty to feed the poor, happily handing that over to government or the professionals. I could go on. And I should have gone on.
This problem deserved maybe a whole chapter in my book on alienation. I gave it only a few sentences.
For these and all my omissions, I apologize to my readers.

Texto completo: The New York Times caught flack after the publication labeled Iranian-controlled militias, which attacked the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad, as "mourners."
"Hundreds of Iraqi mourners tried to storm the United States Embassy in Baghdad, shouting 'Down, down USA!,' in response to deadly American airstrikes this week that killed 25 fighters," the paper said in a Tuesday tweet.
Tweet
The tweet met with swift condemnation from those saying they were parroting Iranian propaganda. Protesters shouted, "Death to America," as they broke into the embassy compound.
TweetTweetTweetTweet
TweetTweet
The demonstration came in response to airstrikes by the United States against Iranian-backed militias, which were stationed in Iraq. The U.S. has sent in Marines to help reinforce the compound.
Iraqi Prime Minister Abdul Mahdi called the airstrikes an "outrageous attack." Mahdi called for a three-day mourning period following the strikes.
The Iraqi military said an attack on foreign embassies would be "punishable by law with the most severe penalties." The U.S. ambassador to Iraq is planning to return to the embassy in Baghdad to show that "America is not going to flinch in the face of this pressure."

Sarah J. Jackson: Twitter made us better

Texto completo: It’s impossible to avoid news about how harmful social media can be. The Cambridge Analytica scandal. The ubiquitous Russian bots. The lackadaisical response of tech industry leaders to privacy violations, election meddling and harassment.
All the optimism about social media as a vehicle for social change that followed the Arab Spring in 2011 has largely dissipated. Twitter — which once prompted users with the innocuous question “What are you doing?” — is now better known as a home for unforgiving criticism, stripped of the politeness that can soften real-life interactions. Many have become social media cynics.
Despite it all, the way we use Twitter made this decade better.
Rightful critiques of social media, and Twitter in particular, shouldn’t obscure the significance of the conversations that have happened there over the past 10 years. As we enter 2020, powerful individuals and societal problems can no longer avoid public scrutiny. That’s thanks in part to those who have demanded attention through the website. The online activism and commentary that take place on Twitter are often dismissed as expressions of “cancel culture” or “woke culture.” But a closer look reveals what’s really happening: Many people who lacked public platforms 10 years ago — the young and members of marginalized groups in particular — are speaking up, insisting on being heard.
For our forthcoming book, “#HashtagActivism: Networks of Race and Gender Justice,” my colleagues and I studied how groups including African-Americans, survivors of gendered violence and transgender women have used Twitter to build vibrant communities and to influence news and politics. We found that movements like #BlackLivesMatter and #MeToo, while they had pre-Twitter origins, were pushed into mainstream consciousness by networks of ordinary people sharing firsthand stories, making demands and developing shared political narratives on the site. Without Twitter, these campaigns for race and gender justice would still exist, but they wouldn’t have nearly the same momentum.
It’s well known that African-Americans’ influence on Twitter — where they are overrepresented both compared with their numbers in the United States population and compared with other demographic groups who use the internet — shapes meme culture, fashion trends, slang and humor. But it also fuels cultural criticism and political demands.
Just look at the record: With #OscarsSoWhite, users drew attention to the 2015 and 2016 nominations that featured no people of color in any of the lead or supporting actor categories. That hasn’t happened since, and in 2019 the hashtag’s creator, April Reign, was invited by the academy to attend the award ceremony. When a CNN headline about a black man found hanging from a tree in Mississippi inexplicably focused on his criminal record, #CNNBeLike inspired parodies of the network’s framing and the prevalence of racist media stereotypes. That was undoubtedly noticed by journalists responsible for deciding how to present reporting to their audiences. #CosbyMeme, a hashtag that originated with the actor’s own account and asked fans to create memes about him, was hijacked to redirect focus to his assaults on women. #IfSlaveryWasAChoice captured the absurdity of Kanye West’s bizarre analysis of American history, using stinging sarcasm to make clear that the rapper was not to be taken seriously.
Without Twitter, far fewer Americans would have heard the names Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown and Sandra Bland — black people whose deaths have become synonymous with #BlackLivesMatter activism. When users deployed the hashtag #TamirRice — the name of the 12-year-old black boy who was holding a toy gun when he was killed by a police officer — alongside #EmmettTill, the platform was being used to link current events to the long history of anti-black violence once documented by accounts like Ida B. Wells’s 1895 book “The Red Record.” These digital campaigns pushed many major news outlets to report more thoroughly on police shootings. The ways in which local and federal agencies collect and track use-of-force data have changed.
Long before #MeToo, hashtags like #YesAllWomen (used to note the pervasiveness of misogynistic violence), #GirlsLikeUs (used to discuss issues facing transgender women) and #YouOkSis (used to draw attention to black women’s experiences with street harassment) were deployed by diverse groups of women to illustrate how, to borrow the old feminist refrain, the personal is political.
Twitter users have disrupted a media landscape where gatekeepers — in an industry that has always fallen short when it comes to race and gender diversity — were for too long solely responsible for setting the agenda of what we talked about as a country. While most Americans do not have Twitter accounts, journalists and politicians often do, and they have turned heavily in the past decade to the activists, scholars and people of color on Twitter to inform their coverage and policies. When they haven’t done so, these communities have responded resoundingly online. And America has listened.
Twitter has fundamentally altered the ways many communities interact with the media, as users feel empowered to challenge harmful framing. “I think the presence of Asian-Americans on Twitter has actually really showed journalists, editors and people in general in the newsroom how it is important to cover Asian-American issues,” one user told my colleagues and me in an interview for a report published by the Knight Foundation. “With Twitter, you can call out a publication if they mess up, or if they don’t cover certain topics. Now there’s accountability.”
Film producers, television writers and advertisers have changed the way they create content to respond to fans who express their views online. Showrunners from USA Network and the CW have acknowledged the influence of Twitter fans on the content of their programs. Hashtags like #NotBuyingIt have called brands from Huggies to BMW to account for sexist ads. After a boycott promoted on Twitter, the Hallmark Channel reversed a decision to exclude advertisements featuring a lesbian couple. Gone are the days when a piece of art could promote stereotypes, demean women or ignore the existence of people of color without a backlash. Professional critics might identify these problems. Twitter users definitely will. They’ll demand better. And many times, they receive it.
It’s not surprising when powerful people resent Twitter, calling the critiques that come from it too negative, too intolerant, too sensitive. Twitter didn’t invent knee-jerk reactions, conflict or polarization, but it did expand the set of voices all of us have to hear.
Like all technological tools, Twitter can be exploited for evil and harnessed for good. Just as the printing press was used to publish content that argued fervently for slavery, it was also used by abolitionists to make the case for manumission. Just as radio and television were used to stir up the fervor of McCarthyism, they were also used to undermine it.
Twitter has fallen short in many ways. But this decade, it helped ordinary people change our world.

Sadness prevails: ‘Black Monday’ at Halas Hall

Información de publicación: Daily Herald ; Arlington Heights, Ill. [Arlington Heights, Ill]. 31 Dec 2019: 2.

Resumen: In America, it is first noted to have been used by a Democratic congressman from Mississippi, John Bell Williams on the floor of the House on May 17, 1954, in response to the Supreme Court’s landmark decision in the case of Brown vs. the Board of Education. Most credit the coining of Black Monday as the day after the NFL’s final games of the regular season to a pair of writers from The Associated Press whose names I have been unable to track down who used it in a story for The New York Times in 1998. Of the 53 players on the Bears’ active roster at season’s end, nine on injured reserve and 10 on the practice squad, only 40 have contracts for the 2020 season.

Texto completo: The phrase "Black Monday" is most widely recognized in pop culture today for its connection to the NFL, but it’s not its origin.
The Irish believe Black Monday dates to the Monday of Easter week in 1209 and denotes the slaughter of hundreds of English settlers who had migrated to Dublin.
In America, it is first noted to have been used by a Democratic congressman from Mississippi, John Bell Williams on the floor of the House on May 17, 1954, in response to the Supreme Court’s landmark decision in the case of Brown vs. the Board of Education.
It is widely recognized as Oct. 19, 1987, a day the Dow Jones industrial average lost 508 points.
While it has since lost more points in a single day, the 22.6% drop still represents the greatest single-day crash in history.
All that is interesting, but my beat is still the National Football League. Most credit the coining of Black Monday as the day after the NFL’s final games of the regular season to a pair of writers from The Associated Press whose names I have been unable to track down who used it in a story for The New York Times in 1998.
In NFL circles, it is used to refer to the firing of multiple coaches and general managers on the same day immediately after the season ends, but in reality it also could be used to refer to the moods and emotions of hundreds of players around the league from the 20 teams that will not be in the playoffs.
For example, by the time the doors of the Bears’ locker room were opened to the media Monday morning many of the players already were gone. Of those who remained, most were in dark, if not completely black, moods.
It had little to do with not being in the playoffs as that reality became clear a couple of weeks ago.
Of the 53 players on the Bears’ active roster at season’s end, nine on injured reserve and 10 on the practice squad, only 40 have contracts for the 2020 season.
While some of the 22 free agents and 10 practice-squad players will be re-signed by the Bears, and others by other teams, on Black Monday there were technically 32 unemployed players in the room.
Additionally, players under contract such as Adam Shaheen, J.P. Holtz, Charles Leno, Javon Wims, Joel Iyiegbuniwe and Josh Woods, to name a few, have to know their Bears futures are uncertain, while still more like Leonard Floyd, Prince Amukamara and Taylor Gabriel face the possibility of being 2020 salary-cap casualties.
Even for those almost certain to return, looking around that locker room at friends and teammates they have lived, played, laughed, perhaps cried and gone to battle with, and knowing they are unlikely to be teammates with again made for a dark day.
It’s a part of the business most of us not only never experience but have little context to fully understand and often don’t think about.
Kevin Pierre-Louis has made a case to stay, but he is one of those free agents who described Black Monday this way: "It is difficult because you grind with these guys every day.
"You get close to certain players, so knowing that you might not be there next year or someone else might not be there next year, it’s definitely tough.
"But it’s tough because you do blood, sweat and tears with these guys, you build these bonds, and it’s hard to let them go."
Nick Williams knows the feelings of Black Monday all too well after stints in Pittsburgh, Kansas City and Miami and being out of the league in 2017.
"We’ll see what happens in the future.
"Obviously, I want to be back here. I want to be a Bear. I love this organization. They’ve afforded me a lot of great opportunities. I like this locker room. I like my teammates. We’ll see what happens."
It was 51 weeks ago — fresh off the "double doink" that ended last season — the pain in the room was palpable but the mood more gray than black, and it quickly turned sunny off the great accomplishments and expectations for this season.
Monday it was just sad.

Texto completo: On the first day of Larycia Hawkins' political science classes at the University of Virginia, she steps to the front of the classroom and gives a little speech.
It's not about the syllabus. It's about her unintended, uncomfortable fame.
"I say, 'OK, if you Google my name, there's a New York Times story about me,' " Hawkins says. "And I tell students that if you are curious about what I think about issues, here are a lot of articles about it online."
Some students will have read about their professor's 2015 battle with her previous academic home, prominent Christian liberal arts school Wheaton College, in suburban Chicago.
Others might not be aware that Hawkins has been the subject of an intense controversy that swept through the evangelical Christian community and cost her her job and tenure at Wheaton. Or that her story is the subject of a documentary, "Same God," which began airing Dec. 13 on PBS.
"The further we get out from the job that I left," she says, "it's easier. But one of the things it has changed is how I introduce myself on the first day."
In December 2015, Hawkins had decided to pursue "embodied solidarity" with Muslims by wearing a hijab during Advent, the Christian season leading up to Christmas. She posted a photo of herself on Facebook wearing a hijab, along with words that stated her solidarity with Muslims because "they, like me, a Christian, are people of the book. And as Pope Francis stated last week, we worship the same God."
"I didn't think, I don't think, I was doing anything radical," Hawkins says.
Wheaton disagreed, and questioned whether her "same God" statement contradicted the statement of faith that all Wheaton professors must sign as a condition of employment. Hawkins, a devout, lifelong Christian, found herself defending her theological views and, eventually, agreeing to resolve the conflict by leaving the school in February 2016. Along the way, she had become the subject of heated debate among evangelicals.
Filmmaker Linda Midgett, who began working with Hawkins on "Same God" in early 2016, says, "I can't overstate how much this turned Larycia's life upside down. I think what people fail to think about is the way that her life was uprooted for years. And she didn't know she was risking all that when she made that Facebook post."
Even more troubling, Midgett says, "she lost her anonymity, the pleasure of being a private citizen who isn't judged by people who don't know you."
"It's hard on my relationships with friends and family," Hawkins says, "because I'm experiencing mental trauma and anxiety and depression that come and go."
Hawkins began a life of shuttling back and forth between Virginia, where she initially landed a one-year fellowship at UVA's Institute for Advanced Studies in Culture, and Chicago.
Hawkins, who is African American, began her journey in Oklahoma, where she grew up steeped in the traditions of the black Christian church. Though politics were not an overt part of her church life, she says, themes of the civil rights movement and social justice ran deep in her family. "Those things were never far or distant from our memory or our home," she says. "A lot of these lessons were taught, some of them were just there."
At Wheaton, Hawkins' experience of the practice of faith was juxtaposed with traditions that lean more heavily on white evangelical experiences. Though Wheaton College is proud of having one of the first black college graduates in Illinois in 1866, in 2013 Hawkins became the first-ever black woman to be given tenure at the school. It wasn't always an easy position to be in. "There was a level of discomfort about the notion that the same Jesus could lead a person reared in that black church tradition to think one way about an issue," says Hawkins, "whereas white evangelicals might think quite differently about the same issue."
Midgett, who became close with Hawkins during the filming of the documentary, understands different interpretations of faith. Her own religious tradition springs from the white evangelical church, her family is still very much a part of that world and she is a Wheaton alumna. "I have some strained relationships from having done the film," she says, "because there was definitely pressure to not do it."
Once she saw how polarizing Hawkins' stance had become within the evangelical community, she says, she felt she had to tell the story. "I think something so important is going on here, even more important than what happened to Larycia." Midgett believes that the evangelical movement "is at a critical point" in its relationship to political power. "It is a difficult time," she says, "because the majority of white evangelicals right now, the platform that they have is antithetical to a lot of Christianity, in my opinion. I say this as somebody with relatives and close friends who have those beliefs. These are people I love who I strongly disagree with. It's hard."
The filmmaker finds herself defending Hawkins' "same God" statement, over and over. "I continue to see people who have decided in their minds that she is conflating Christ and Islam," Midgett says. "And they're completely wrong, that's not what she was saying and not what that statement means. It's important to understand what it means, and the intent."
As the film grapples with the dissonance between the principles of Christianity and the response to Hawkins' gesture, Hawkins is also shown coming to terms with the part race and sex played in the outcome. She was supported by many colleagues on the faculty, and several of them - all men - speak freely in the film about racism and their issues with the way Hawkins was treated. "They are in a different position as men at the college," says Midgett. "And that's a reality. It was very difficult for me to get women to go on camera."
Though the film throws political and religious divisions into sharp relief, Hawkins says that her aim for its impact remains much the same as her aim for that original Facebook post. "I hope it brings people closer together," she says. "My favorite showings have been where I can see the body language of people relax over time, because they allowed themselves to stay in the conversation. I'd like to think those people left with a greater understanding about embodied solidarity."

He's talkin' 'bout practice?; Durant turned down Knicks over facility

Texto completo: There's a new reason why Kevin Durant shunned the Knicks in free agency.
According to Lakers forward Jared Dudley, the Knicks' practice facility is inconveniently located compared to the Nets', creating an undesirable living situation and commute to MSG. Dudley, who played last season for the Nets, said he personally relayed that message and it eventually got to Durant.
"I'd get rid of that practice facility in Westchester," Dudley told The Athletic. "Nobody wants to live there, nobody wants to commute there. You have to get as close to the city as possible. That's why Brooklyn got Kevin Durant. I told DeAndre Jordan who told Kevin Durant that the [Nets'] practice facility is two minutes from [Barclays Center]. They didn't even know that. I lived in the city. It took me 12 minutes to get to the practice facility."
The Knicks' practice facility is located in Tarrytown in Westchester County, about 30 miles from MSG. During rush hour, the drive is well over an hour. Most of the Knicks don't live in New York City because the majority of time is spent at the practice facility.
The Nets, by contrast, opened their $50 million practice facility four years ago about three miles from Barclays Center in Sunset Park.
Jordan played two months with the Knicks last season and, according to the New York Times, helped sway his good buddy Durant to the Nets. Jordan also signed with the Nets in the summer on a four-year deal.
For Dudley, this isn't the first reference to the Knicks' practice facility being problematic. He said the same thing before free agency.
"If you want to be here in Brooklyn, if some players want to live in the city and you can drive 10-15 minutes to practice, or do you want to go all the way to Westchester and take an hour and have a driver? You know what I mean?" Dudley said.
BULLOCK BACK
Reggie Bullock could make his season debut for the Knicks on Wednesday against the Blazers. The shooting guard, who signed in the summer, had offseason back surgery and recently started practicing.
"We've got practice (Tuesday) and then we'll make the final call if he's ready to play the next day," interim coach Mike Miller said. "think that will be the easiest way."
"I think a lot of it is just him having the days to kind of build himself up. If you look at it, everybody else had a training camp and preseason games. This guy's coming off an injury, so he has to rehab and he needs a little bit of time to be comfortable and be confident with everything. I think he's doing well with that."

A very bad day in the Cretaceous
You probably know the broad outline of the story: 66 million years ago, a giant meteorite landed in what is now the Gulf of Mexico, and ended the dinosaurs. This year, various teams of scientists, working independently, helped fill in the picture of exactly what happened on that fateful day.
The biggest discovery was a site in North Dakota that preserved a jumble of fossilized fish and plant life that may have been thrown together by a tsunami on the very day of the meteorite strike. Closer to the impact site, scientists also cataloged a geological timeline of disasters that befell Earth that day. And researchers detailed evidence found in Europe that the Chicxulub event acidified the ocean in a flash, extinguishing much of Earth's ocean life at the time.
North America's birds are vanishing
An exhaustive analysis of hundreds of bird species in the United States and Canada contained a warning: The majority of bird species are in decline, many by huge numbers. The likely culprits? Habitat loss and pesticides.
Quantum computing changed everything and nothing
Quantum computing had a big year. Google claimed to have reached a long-sought breakthrough called "quantum supremacy," allowing computers to perform calculations at inconceivable speeds. Some scientists are cautious about the implications of the development, but major U.S. tech companies and China are investing heavily in quantum computing. IBM, a Google competitor, described the term "quantum supremacy" as misleading and proposed another metric, "quantum volume."
Not mind-blowing enough? An IBM quantum computer was used this year to make history go backward.
The human family tree got a new branch
This year we met a new extinct human relative, Homo luzonensis. It was discovered in a cave on Luzon Island in the Philippines, and adds further complexity to the story of human evolution.
Your dog loves you
It really does. Clive Wynne, a psychologist specializing in dog behavior, contends that what makes your furry friend special is not its intellect but its ability to bond with you. And not just with you. The dog's ability to bond across species -- with sheep, goats, even (horrors!) cats -- makes it an evolutionary success story.
Your cat likes you, too
Your cat may or may not like-like you. But it is strongly bonded to you, and in an unfamiliar situation, when it feels threatened, it is likely to turn to you for comfort.
Milk doesn't just come from mammals
Almond milk is over. Oat milk is canceled. What's in? Spider milk. Burying beetle milk. Great white shark milk. Flamingo milk. Which raises the question: what exactly is milk? Not all experts agree, but some scientists say that if a substance is synthesized or highly modified by a parent, and the offspring's life depends on it, that's milk. Now excuse us while we put out cookies and pink flamingo milk for Santa.
There really is a 5G conspiracy
At home, Russia, like the United States and other countries around the world, has embraced the promise of 5G, the next generation of cellphone technology. But in the U.S., RT America, the broadcast network run by the Russian government, has been warning American viewers that the telecommunications technology will kill and disable children. Many alarming claims about 5G technology are linked to bad, debunked science. The U.S. intelligence agencies describe RT America as "the Kremlin's principal international propaganda outlet." The network has taken aim at fracking, vaccination and even the U.S. electoral process; now it has applied its playbook to cellphones.
Extinction warnings for some salmon and orcas
Thirteen species of salmon and steelhead trout are considered threatened or endangered in the Northwest's Columbia basin region. Wild Chinook salmon could disappear within the next 20 years, according to one Forest Service expert. The fish are a keystone food source for other species, and an endangered population of orcas may be starving for lack of enough wild salmon to eat. Many scientists favor removing dams on some rivers to save the orcas and the fish. But the idea faces resistance from government agencies that manage the rivers.
The fish cannon is no joke
A video of salmon traveling through a long tube went viral in 2019. You probably watched it. But the Whooshh cannon -- its actual name -- is a serious tool that conservationists are testing not only to help fish migrate, but to contain invasive carp that foul North American waterways. If it doesn't work, scientists have other ideas, like koi herpes.
Deep sea expeditions can't find everything
Voyages deep below the ocean uncovered many things this year: 3D images of underwater volcanoes; close-ups with giant squid; pristine shipwrecks that are centuries old. The technology for such dives is getting better and better, too. But some mysteries have yet to surface.
Robert Ballard, the ocean explorer who found the wreck of the Titanic, set his sights on solving the enigma of Amelia Earhart's fate. Following an irresistible hint, his crew headed to the Pacific island nation of Kiribati, spending weeks searching for her crashed plane by air, land and sea. They returned empty-handed, but with one bit of solace: A blurry clue from an old picture, which had driven years of speculation about Earhart's final resting place, can probably be dismissed for good.
The North Pole isn't where you think it is
The North Pole is at the very top of the world, right? Actually, the planet's magnetic north is a considerable distance from 90 degrees north, and it moves around. Lately it has moved more than expected, requiring scientists to update the World Magnetic Model a year earlier than planned. The tinkering ensures that modern navigation tools will continue to function properly, but it is a reminder of the geoscience mysteries deep beneath Earth's surface.
Dead brain cells were 'revived'
When does life end and death begin? Scientists seem to have blurred that line when they managed to restore cellular activity in brains removed from slaughtered pigs. Although the pig brains did not exhibit any higher functions, some cells regained metabolic activity. The research is preliminary, but it upends standard medical thinking about the brain and raises more than a few metaphysical conundrums.
Pondering the periodic table's future
Happy 150th birthday to the Periodic Table of Elements! As scientists celebrated Dmitri Mendeleev's enduring array of chemical elements this year, some also wondered whether there might be a better way to organize the stuff of the universe. A New and Improved Table could come in handy: As more superheavy elements are discovered, their behaviors could challenge the integrity of Mendeleev's memorable chart.

Texto completo: In a year-end note, a deputy chairman said the Chinese tech giant's confrontation with the United States would hurt its prospects for 2020.
HONG KONG -- For Huawei, it has been a year of lawsuits, blacklists, diplomatic fights, spying accusations and, most recently, viral anger from the Chinese internet.
Through it all, the company posted solid growth, its deputy chairman Eric Xu said on Tuesday. In a year-end note, Mr. Xu said the company's sales in 2019 increased an estimated 18 percent from a year earlier to $ 121.8 billion, just below the company's initial target for revenue.
The results hinted at a slowdown in the final quarter of the year, and Mr. Xu's note was rich in metaphors describing the difficult days ahead. Alternately likening the company to plums bitten by winter's frost, a bamboo stalk battered by wind and an embattled aircraft, the executive said that in 2020, the company would not grow as rapidly as it did in the first half of 2019.
"It's going to be a difficult year for us," wrote Mr. Xu, adding that "the external environment is becoming more complicated than ever, and downward pressure on the global economy has intensified."
Huawei is the world's leading maker of equipment that powers cellphone networks and a champion of Beijing's ambitions to build new, cutting-edge technology companies. Officials in the United States have long been worried that China's government could use Huawei's products to gather intelligence, an accusation the company has repeatedly denied.
Huawei's year went from bad to worse when the United States added the company to an export blacklist in May. The move effectively restricted its ability to purchase American products crucial to its smartphones and telecom gear, weighing on revenue growth.
The blocks, though, have proven somewhat porous. The Trump administration has permitted sales to Huawei that are used to maintain existing mobile networks. Some of its American suppliers determined they could lawfully continue selling nonsensitive products to the company. In October, the Trump administration said it would issue export licenses to certain United States companies selling to Huawei, further easing pressures on its supply chain.
Even so, Mr. Xu indicated that the confrontation with the United States would continue to dampen growth and said he expected Huawei to remain on the blacklist in 2020.
"Difficulty is the prelude to greater success, and adversity the whetstone of an iron-willed team. The U.S. government's campaign against Huawei is strategic and long-term," he wrote.
Huawei, he said, will "need to go all out" to develop software and services that work with its smartphones. Analysts have worried about whether the company's smartphones would remain competitive since it was blocked from working with Google. Huawei had to release its latest flagship smartphone, the Mate 30 series, without regular access to Google's apps.
Mr. Xu said the company shipped a total of 240 million smartphones in 2019, an increase of almost 17 percent over the 206 million units it sold in 2018.
The company's shares are not publicly traded and it has no obligation to announce its results. In a nod to transparency, Huawei has long announced financials, and this year it began reporting unaudited results quarterly. The numbers for 2019 are not audited, and the company will likely provide further details for its performance in the first months of 2020.
With Huawei's business under pressure, Mr. Xu also warned of tough times for employees, even as he thanked them. Huawei unexpectedly became the center of online anger in China this month after an employee said he had been jailed for 251 days after demanding severance pay from the company. The experience struck a chord for many Chinese white-collar tech employees, who are now facing sagging returns for long hours at the office.
Despite the renewed focus on Huawei's famous hard-charging corporate spirit, Mr. Xu did not mince his metaphors in describing the company's outlook on its employees.
"Managers at all levels need to put company interests above personal gain and go where they are needed most, including hardship regions," he wrote, calling those willing to put up with such difficulties "tree growers."
He said the company would remove managers who were performing in the bottom 10 percent as part of a plan to better prune talent.
"We will remove mediocre managers more quickly -- people who have lost their enterprising spirit, who have built their position on personal connections or empty and unactionable reporting, and those who prioritize short-term gains and pass problems on to their successors," he wrote, calling such people "the pit-diggers among us."

Texto completo: Dejó cinco heridos y una comunidad de judíos traumada; pero el apuñalamiento masivo perpetrado por un hombre el sábado por la noche en la casa de un rabino en Monsey, Nueva York, podría haber provocado consecuencias aún peores , según testigos de esta escena de terror.
Algunos de los presentes se enfrentaron al agresor y consiguieron contener su furia, asegura The New York Times. Posteriormente, el agresor huyó. Fue detenido dos horas después en Harlem, cuando la policía identificó el carro con el que dejó el lugar.
Josef Gluck, un hombre de 32 años, contó que el atacante, identificado posteriormente como Grafton Thomas, de 37 años, tras irrumpir en la casa con la cara cubierta por una bufanda empezó a ir de un lado al otro con un machete en la mano, “tratando de golpear a todos”.
“Hey, te atraparé”, le gritó. Él primero huyó. En la cocina, recogió a un niño pequeño, y luego salió a un porche. Después volvió atrás, y trató de enfrentar a Thomas. “Agarré una mesita de café antigua y se la arrojé a la cara”, dijo Gluck.
Otras de las personas presentes en la casa lucharon contra el intruso, lo golpearon con objetos y lo forzaron a retirarse, reporta el Times. Cuando Thomas fue detenido, aún estaba ensangrentado . De los cinco heridos que provocó presuntamente, cuatro fueron atendidos y ya salieron del hospital, mientras que uno permanecía este domingo por la tarde con fracturas en el cráneo, agrega este periódico.
El gobernador de Nueva York, Andrew Cuomo, definió este domingo el apuñalamiento como un “acto de terrorismo doméstico”. En su opinión, esta acción violenta —la última de una serie de ataques perpetrados contra la comunidad judía en la región— fue impulsada por el “odio”.
Por su lado, el presidente Donald Trump dijo que se trató de un ataque “antisemita”. “Todos debemos unirnos para luchar, enfrentar y erradicar el flagelo del antisemitismo “, agregó.
Mientras tanto, la comunidad judía del área de Nueva York y de Estados Unidos se interroga sobre cómo detener la creciente violencia antisemita, destaca NBC News. Muchos miembros de esta comunidad están aterrorizados , aseguraron líderes judíos y otras personas que forman parte de ella.
Cuatro funcionarios electos judíos en Nueva York pidieron al gobernador Cuomo que que declarara un estado de emergencia y desplegara la Guardia Nacional para “patrullar y proteger visiblemente” los vecindarios judíos ortodoxos de la zona.
Otras personas manifiestan incertidumbre sobre cómo abordar la situación. “No estamos seguros de qué hacer, porque no estamos acostumbrados a esto”, dijo el rabino Jon Kelsen, decano de Yeshivat Chovevei Torah, una moderna escuela rabínica ortodoxa en el distrito de Bronx de la ciudad de Nueva York.
Si por lo general las peticiones de más seguridad generalmente suponen la solicitud de una mayor presencia policial , algunos temen que más seguridad pueda obstaculizar el diálogo que Kelsen indicó como tan importante.
“En este momento, las herramientas que tenemos para la seguridad [son] más policías y más armas”, dijo Audrey Sasson, directora ejecutiva de Judios para la Justicia Racial y Económica. “Pero la pregunta para mí es cómo podemos construir otras herramientas “, agregó.

Texto completo: The Associated Press
WHITE SETTLEMENT, Texas - Congregants returned fire and fatally shot a gunman who killed at least one person in a church near Fort Worth, Texas, on Sunday, police said.
A second parishioner has life-threatening injuries following the attack at the West Freeway Church of Christ, White Settlement Police Department Chief J.P. Bevering said during a news conference Sunday afternoon.
The assailant fired once before the "heroic actions" of the congregants cut his assault short, Bevering said.
"Unfortunately, this country has seen so many of these that we've actually gotten used to it at this point. And it's tragic and it's a terrible situation, especially during the holiday season," Jeoff Williams, a regional director with the Texas Department of Public Safety, said at the news conference. "I would like to point out that we have a couple of heroic parishioners who stopped short of just anything that you can even imagine, saved countless lives, and our hearts are going out to them and their families as well."
Authorities have released scant details about the victims, the shooter and what led to the attack.
An elder at the church told the New York Times that one of those killed was a security guard who responded to the shooter, calling him a dear friend.
"He was trying to do what he needed to do to protect the rest of us," said the elder, Mike Tinius.
"It's extremely upsetting to see anyone committing violence," he said.
Tinius said he didn't know the gunman and that the shooting appeared to be random.
A woman who answered the phone at the West Freeway Church of Christ told the AP she could not answer any questions and that she was told to direct inquiries to authorities.
In a livestream of the church service, the gunman can be seen getting up from a pew and talking to someone at the back of the church before pulling out a gun and opening fire. Parishioners can then be heard screaming and seen ducking under pews or running as papers fly to the floor.
More than 100 people, including children, can be seen sitting in the pews from the livestream's viewpoint.
Two people with minor injuries sustained while ducking for cover were treated at the scene, MedStar Mobile Healthcare spokeswoman Macara Trusty said.
Gov. Greg Abbott asked the state to pray for the victims, their loved ones and the community of White Settlement, about 8 miles west of Fort Worth.
"Places of worship are meant to be sacred, and I am grateful for the church members who acted quickly to take down the shooter and help prevent further loss of life," Abbott said in a tweeted statement.
It is not the first deadly shooting to take place at a church in Texas. In November 2017, Devin Patrick Kelley opened fire on the congregation at a church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, killing more than two dozen worshippers, before taking his own life.

Texto completo: FARMINGTON — The formerly sparse craft beer scene in San Juan County will become a little more crowded next year.
The Bow & Arrow Brewing Co., based in Albuquerque, will be opening the Rambler Taproom on East Main Street in Farmington in early 2020, according to founder, president and CEO Shyla Sheppard. The 1,200-square-foot space, which will feature a seating capacity of less than 30. It will not brew beer on site, but will feature all the Bow & Arrow products that are available at the main location in Albuquerque.
Sheppard runs Bow & Arrow with her partner Missy Begay. Their company has been described as the first brewery in the country that is owned and operated by Native women, and Bow & Arrow has been profiled in publications and web sites ranging from The New York Times and The Guardian to Vice.com and NationalGeographic.com.
The Farmington City Council approved a small brewer 1st off-site location liquor license for the Rambler Taproom at its Dec. 10 meeting. The business will be located in Suite 109 of the GoTo Plaza at 5100 E. Main St., a development best known for its anchor tenant, a Durango Joes Coffee location.
Sheppard said she and Begay chose Farmington for their first satellite operation for a variety of reasons. She noted the existence of the Three Rivers Brewery and the recently opened Lauter Haus Brewing Co. in Farmington, and said both are excellent. But she believes the market here remains underserved.
"I feel like we could really add something to the craft beer scene there in Farmington," she said. "We brew some styles that are a little different."
Bow & Arrow has partnered with Navajo Agricultural Products Industry for some of its brewing ingredients in the past, and Sheppard said she looks forward to opening an operation in closer proximity to that company. She said Bow & Arrow also will explore the idea of finding and working with other producers in the Four Corners area.
Sheppard, a North Dakota native who is a member of the Three Affiliated Tribes, also said she and Begay, who is Navajo, like to spend a lot of time in the Farmington area. That made it a natural choice for their second operation, especially since Sheppard said she will be spending a lot of time here to get the taproom open.
"I've really grown to appreciate it," she said of the Four Corners area. "I love the outdoors, and spend a lot of time camping and going to Navajo Lake and Glade Run (Recreation Area). I like trail running and mountain biking. And I love the landscape there."
The name Sheppard and Begay chose for their Farmington location reflects their affection for this area.
"We like the idea of the Four Corners and the Great American Southwest — ramblers and seekers," she said. "We chose the name in that spirit. It made a lot of sense for that location."
Sheppard said the taproom will feature the same vibe as Bow & Arrow's main location in Albuquerque, 608 McKnight Ave. NW, which has a modern beer hall design. Long wooden tables with bench seating, high ceilings, concrete floors and exposed ductwork are accented by an expansive bar, chandeliers, natural lighting and custom woodwork.
"It's a community gathering place," she said, describing its inclusive atmosphere. "You can hear each other and have conversations."
Live music has not been a part of the mix at the Albuquerque location, she said. Shepard did not rule out live entertainment for the Farmington taproom, but she said if it is offered, it will be presented sparingly.
The Rambler Taproom will offer all the Bow & Arrow products, many of which are flavored with fruits ranging from strawberries and key limes to tangerines, as well as a wide array of hops. Sheppard said beers will be sold by the glass, in growlers and in barrel-fermented bottles.
Sheppard said construction on the site has not gotten underway yet, but the build-out is not expected to take long. She said she expects the taproom to open at the end of the first quarter of 2020 or the beginning of the second quarter. The business is expected to employ between five and eight people, she said.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — Representative John Lewis, Democrat of Georgia and an icon of the civil rights movement, revealed Sunday that he had advanced pancreatic cancer but planned to return to Washington to continue work and begin treatment.
“I have been in some kind of fight — for freedom, equality, basic human rights — for nearly my entire life," Lewis, 79, said in a statement. “I have never faced a fight quite like the one I have now."
Survival rates for pancreatic cancer are grim, and Lewis said his cancer was Stage 4, the most advanced.
“I have decided to do what I know to do and do what I have always done: I am going to fight it and keep fighting for the beloved community," Lewis said. “We still have many bridges to cross."
Born on a sharecropping farm, Lewis has spent his life fighting for racial integration and civil rights, rising through the ranks of the civil rights movement before taking office. As the dean of the Georgia delegation, he is seen by many Democrats on Capitol Hill as the conscience of the caucus.
“You're not alone in this fight, my friend," Representative David Cicilline, Democrat of Rhode Island, wrote on Twitter. “The whole nation, which owes you an incredible debt, is with you."
“If there's one thing I love" about Lewis, former president Barack Obama wrote on Twitter, “it's his incomparable will to fight. I know he's got a lot more of that left in him."

Sanders staffers complain about use of Amazon
Senator Bernie Sanders frequently attacks Amazon on the campaign trail, vowing to break up the online retail giant if elected and decrying its ability to pay no federal taxes on billions in profits.
That's why impassioned dissent erupted within the Sanders campaign earlier this year over its purchases of large amounts of supplies through Amazon, according to five people with knowledge of the situation. Carli Stevenson, then a senior Sanders campaign aide in New Hampshire, raised concerns directly with national campaign officials and suggested using a different company, three of the people said.
The Sanders campaign continued using Amazon despite the concerns. Through September, it had spent more than $233,000 on Amazon purchases. In a statement, Sanders campaign spokesman Mike Casca said, "We agree that too few companies have too much power over our economy and our media in America and they often don't pay their fair share of taxes, which is why a Sanders administration will take them on."He declined to answer questions on why the campaign opted to use Amazon.

Texto completo: As a lawyer, he represented Lenny Bruce in an obscenity arrest. As a judge, he ruled in the self-defense case of the subway shooter Bernard Goetz.
Bentley Kassal, a former New York lawyer and judge whose clients and cases mirrored the urgencies of the court system over nearly 80 years -- from the trial of Lenny Bruce for obscenity to that of Bernard Goetz for subway vigilantism to the city's liability for sheltering the homeless -- died on Dec. 19 at his home in Manhattan. He was 102.
His death was confirmed by his wife, Barbara Kassal.
Beginning with his birth in Harlem to Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe, Mr. Kassal's life reads like a collaborative biography, each chapter gilded to outshine the one before -- World War II hero, progressive Democratic politician and elected and appointed judge.
He was born on Feb. 28, 1917, to Hyman Kassal, a liquor distributor and native of Austria, and Pauline (Nirenberg) Kassal, who was from Poland.
After graduating from Townsend Harris High School in Manhattan, Mr. Kassal earned a bachelor's degree from the University of Pennsylvania in 1937 and a law degree from Harvard Law School, where he played on the undefeated Eastern League championship rugby team. He was admitted to the bar in 1940.
He enlisted after Pearl Harbor and served in the Army Air Forces in North Africa and Europe as an intelligence officer. He was awarded the Bronze Star, participated in three invasion landings and was discharged as a captain. In 2009 he was awarded membership in the American Society of the French Legion of Honor.
As a state assemblyman from the West Side of Manhattan from 1957 to 1962, he introduced legislation that resulted in the establishment of a state arts council; and his opposition to the annual renewal of a bill requiring Cold War loyalty oaths from state employees led to its expiration.
In 1964, appearing in his only major criminal case, he represented Bruce, the controversial comedian, who was arraigned on obscenity charges after a performance at the Cafe Au Go Go in Greenwich Village.
Bruce was sentenced to four months in prison but never served. He died before his appeal was decided and was posthumously pardoned by Gov. George W. Pataki in 2003.
"I represented him and Howard Solomon, the owner of Cafe au Go Go, in 1964 when they were arrested for obscenity and had them released from custody that night after a midnight hearing at the apartment of Appellate Justice Arthur Markewich," Mr. Kassal recalled in a letter to The New York Times in 2003.
"I had the pleasure and good fortune to see Lenny Bruce's act; he was brilliant and funny," he added. "In comparison with the present everyday commonplace use of profane words, on television, radio, on the stage and in movies, his act was mild, temperate and very inoffensive."
In 1986, writing the majority opinion for the Appellate Division of the State Supreme Court, Justice Kassal upheld the dismissal of charges against Mr. Goetz, who is white, in the shooting of four black youths in a subway car in 1984.
The decision concerned the prosecutor's instructions to the grand jury: Should Mr. Goetz's action in shooting the youths be judged in the context of his state of mind at the time or that of a hypothetical reasonable man placed in the circumstances that Mr. Goetz faced? The incident, which occurred amid rising crime rates, prompted a debate over self-defense versus vigilantism that is still going on.
The Court of Appeals, the state's highest court, affirmed the prosecutor's charge to the jury that a defendant's belief that he is in imminent danger does not by itself justify the use of deadly force; an objective belief, one that would be shared by a hypothetical reasonable person, is also required, the court said.
Mr. Goetz was acquitted of attempted murder and first-degree assault and convicted of carrying a loaded, unlicensed weapon in a public place.
In 1993, Justice Kassal, as part of an appellate panel, ruled that the city's practice of leaving hundreds of homeless families to sleep overnight in city offices for as long as a week was "intolerable."
"The city's contention that compliance is impossible is belied by the fact that the city was able to do so in the recent past," the court said.
After being elected to a seat on the Civil Court, Justice Kassal served on the Supreme Court and the Appellate Division. In 1985, he was appointed by Chief Judge Sol Wachtler to serve for a brief term on the Court of Appeals. After reaching mandatory retirement age, he joined the prominent firm of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom as counsel to the litigation department.
He retired when he was 101.
For decades Mr. Kassal worked as a volunteer photographer for charitable organizations, traveling around the world on vacations and donating images that were used by UNICEF, Save the Children Federation and other philanthropic groups.
In addition to his wife, a retired Bonwit Teller executive, he is survived by his godchildren, Aaron Rosenberg, Lauren Chesbrough, Maggie Villano and Bubba Kassal.
Mr. Kassal met Barbara Wax when she was 19. After a lifetime of bachelorhood, he married her in 1986, when he was 69 and she was 44. It was the first marriage for both.
"I had a lot of growing up to do," she said, "but I knew he was the one."

Texto completo: Museum officials discuss the challenge of ensuring diversity and the essential role of philanthropists.
To the Editor:
Re "How the Superrich Captured the Art World," by Michael Massing (Sunday Review, Dec. 15):
Art museums as we know them in the United States owe their very existence to the philanthropists Michael Massing disdains. Such educationally and civic-minded individuals have been responsible for establishing art museums across the country, and have built those museums' buildings and collections, funded their endowments and supported their yearly operations for well over a century; this continues today.
That among these individuals are inheritors of generational wealth, successful manufacturers, investors and entrepreneurs, and members of civic and business elites is not surprising. Nor is it troublesome.
Our field has developed and maintained professional practice standards and ethics governing relationships between trustees and donors and the museums they serve and support; these rules ensure appropriate levels of artistic independence, and they work.
They state that the director is the artistic leader of the museum, and, in consultation with curators and educators, is responsible for what is shown, and how it is interpreted. Donors do not make these decisions, and neither do boards.
None of these individuals are obligated to support art museums. Yet their philanthropy is not only critical to institutional sustainability, but it also makes great works of art accessible to everyone and provides opportunities for education, inspiration and enjoyment.

The writer is director of the Saint Louis Art Museum and president of the Association of Art Museum Directors.
To the Editor:
The lack of socioeconomic, racial and ethnic diversity on museum boards is a pervasive national challenge.
A recent industry survey revealed that nearly half of museum boards are entirely white. Three-quarters of museum directors believe that diversifying their boards, racially and ethnically, is important. But far fewer have developed plans to become more inclusive, have engaged boards in inclusion training or have carried out other changes to the status quo.
Museums' viability and financial sustainability depend largely on their ability to be relevant. If you visit a museum and don't see anyone who looks like you, and the board's strategic decisions don't reflect your cultural identity, and the collection and interpretation don't include you and your history, you're probably not going back.
Many courageous museum boards recognize this challenge and are prioritizing long-lasting systemic culture change at the top, where the tone and priorities for each museum are established.
Diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility work are about museum excellence, and it's a moral, political and business imperative.

Publishers see 2020 as the year more start to get paid for news

Texto completo: NEW YORK – For years, news outlets promoted their work on various online platforms, hoping to bring readers and advertisers back to their own websites.
But the ad dollars have largely flowed to Facebook and Google. Now, as they head into 2020, embattled publishers are hoping to turn the tables on tech platforms that have profited from their work – by getting them to pay for stories.
So far, the amount of money flowing back to newsrooms is still relatively small, but media executives are encouraged by what they say is a willingness to pay for news in some corners of the tech industry.
“It’s a positive trend we’re seeing from the platforms,” said Ben Smith, editor-in-chief of BuzzFeed News.
The most prominent example is Facebook Inc., which unveiled a separate news section in October and agreed to pay for articles from the New York Times, Wall Street Journal, Washington Post and other media companies. Some publishers are getting $1 million to $3 million a year.
Facebook joins a diverse group of startups that need news articles to attract users, and are cutting checks for them.
Hosting stories
Pocket, an ad-supported app owned by Mozilla Corp., struck a deal with the Atlantic and is talking to other publishers about paying to host older stories. The Pocket app is best known for letting people save content to read later. But it also recommends articles and is testing whether stories published months or years ago can enjoy a second life.
Since 2017, Medium, a digital publishing company, has paid about a dozen publications, including New York magazine and MIT Technology Review, to share a handful of articles. Medium, which is led by Twitter Inc. co-founder Ev Williams, charges $5 a month for a subscription and is considering paying more news outlets for their stories.
“We continue to have conversations with quality publishers and expect to bring many new partners on board in 2020,” a Medium spokeswoman said.
SmartNews Inc., a news app founded in Japan in 2012, is paying for the rights to stories from the British Broadcasting Corp., Buzz- Feed, HuffPost and others. The company, which debuted in the U.S. in 2014, has grown to about 20 million users and hosts some articles directly on its app, where they load more quickly and can be read offline.
Getting paid
“As much as publishers like traffic, I think they like getting checks even more,” said Rich Jaroslovsky, vice president of content at SmartNews and a former Bloomberg News employee.
So far, with the exception of Facebook, the payments aren’t large enough to be significant, media executives say. According to one publisher, Medium is paying less than $100,000 a year. But others are getting more. SmartNews, which pays based on how popular the articles are, is offering sums ranging “from high five figures to over six figures” annually, according to Digiday.
One big question is whether Apple Inc. and Google will follow suit and start paying for news like Facebook. Google already pays some outlets for audio news on its version of Amazon’s Alexa, but publishers say they’ve gotten no indications that either company is considering paying the same way Facebook does.
Local news
And few local publishers are seeing any money from these companies. SmartNews pays for articles from the Los Angeles Times, while Facebook is also paying large metropolitan newspapers like the Philadelphia Inquirer, the Dallas Morning News and the owner of the Chicago Tribune.
But Medium doesn’t license articles from local media outlets, and most news apps aren’t interested in articles from smaller newspapers that need money the most, said David Chavern, president of the News Media Alliance, an industry trade group.
“Local news is getting ignored by the technologists,” he said.
Still, media executives see the payments as a windfall, since they are being paid for articles they publish anyway. And most of them aren’t in a financial position to turn money down.
“The news business is shrinking, so even small sums of money can be significant,” said Emily Bell, director of the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia Journalism School.
Bloomberg Media also licenses some Bloomberg content to other news outlets.
After years of chasing web traffic for advertising dollars, media executives are more discerning before handing their journalism over to tech platforms, said New York Times Chief Executive Officer Mark Thompson.
“There was a sense that Silicon Valley was doing us a favor by distributing our content and we should be grateful for that,” Thompson said at an investor conference this month.
Now, he said, “we’re going to talk other platforms and say what can they do for us if they want us to stay?”

'Was the president aware?': Trump official grilled on Eddie Gallagher after fellow SEALs call him 'evil'

Texto completo: White House national security adviser Robert O'Brien fielded several questions about President Trump's praise of Navy SEAL Eddie Gallagher after confidential video testimony showed the men who turned him in for alleged war crimes calling him "evil."
Footage obtained by the New York Times last week revealed several SEALS recalling Gallagher's behavior during a 2017 tour of Iraq, during which he was accused of shooting civilians and killing a teenage ISIS supporter, with one noting, "He was perfectly OK with killing anybody." In response, Gallagher said he felt "sorry" for those who appeared in the video and accused them of lying.
During a Sunday morning appearance on ABC's This Week, correspondent Jonathan Karl grilled O'Brien on the latest revelations, which came weeks after the president restored Gallagher's rank.
“Were you aware of those details?” Karl asked. “Was the president aware of the details when he was pardoned?”
O'Brien noted that Trump "has the power to pardon and grant clemency," but Karl continued to press him, pointing out that Gallagher's fellow SEALs said he “got crazier and crazier. He was perfectly OK with killing anybody.”
“Do you find those comments troubling? Does the president?” Karl asked.
“It’s very troubling that we send folks out that have to make split-second decisions dealing with terrorists and bomb-makers in difficult decisions overseas," O'Brien answered. "The president has said we’ll stand behind our warriors, we’re gonna have their backs. There was an investigation, and by the way, that’s a select group of SEALs. There were also many SEALs … that supported Chief Gallagher, that appealed to the president and asked for clemency.”
Tweet
While Gallagher was acquitted of the war crime charges against him over the summer, he was found guilty of taking a photo of the corpse of an ISIS fighter. As a result, the Navy demoted him one rank, but Trump restored his rank in November. The Navy had considered further disciplining him by revoking his SEAL Trident pin but later decided against it.

Mike Tinius , un feligrés que estaba en la iglesia, declaró a The New York Times que la víctima mortal es un guardia de seguridad del templo que respondió al autor de los disparos.
“Estaba tratando de hacer lo que tenía que hacer para protegernos al resto de nosotros”, declaró el hombre, quien prefirió no identificar a la víctima.
Las autoridades desconocen hasta el momento las motivaciones del autor del ataqu e, que tampoco ha sido identificado.
Macara Trusty, portavoz del MedStar Mobile Healthcare , señaló que una persona sufrió un paro respiratorio mientras era traslada a un hospital, pero lograron revivirla antes de ser llevada a cirugía.
En un comunicado, el gobernador Greg Abbott calificó el hecho como un “diabólico acto de violencia”.
“Los lugares de culto están destinados a ser sagrados, y estoy agradecido por los miembros de la iglesia que actuaron rápidamente para abatir al tirador y ayudar a prevenir una mayor pérdida de vidas”, agregó.
El tiroteo ocurre casi doce horas después de que un hombre fuera detenido en Nueva York tras apuñalar a cinco personas en la residencia de un rabino al norte de la ciudad el sábado, en lo que las autoridades han descrito hoy como “terrorismo doméstico”.

¿Quién reemplazó a los inmigrantes en las plantas de pollo donde hubo redadas en Mississippi?

Texto completo: Las plantas de procesamiento de pollo donde hubo redadas en Mississippi el pasado agosto han recuperado una parte de fuerza laboral.
Un informe del New York Times revela que miembros de la comunidad negra en la región han tomado las plazas de trabajos en plantas como Koch Foods. El reporte indica que muchos fueron contratados en los días posteriores a las redadas en las que 680 inmigrantes hispanos fueron detenidos.
Los trabajadores negros volvieron a la industria en la que laboraron entre finales de la década de los 60 y mediados de los 80, antes de que las plantas decidieran ir por trabajadores migrantes a México para bajar costos operativos, motivados por la oportunidad de ganar más de $11 dólares por hora. Esos sueldos no se pueden ganar en tiendas minoristas o restaurantes de comida rápida, donde el pago es el mínimo del estado ($7.25).
Un gerente de un restaurante Sonic Drive-In dijo al diario neoyorquino que perdió 10 empleados a los pocos días de las redadas.
El reportaje de Richard Fausset también hace un recuento del dilema ético para los trabajadores negros ya que muchos lamentan la separación de familias hispanas y la persecución a los inmigrantes. Muchos son solidarios porque recuerdan los tiempos de la esclavitud.
Finalmente, el texto deja claro que el trabajo en las plantas de procesamiento de pollo es calificado como “duro” por los trabajadores. Esto lleva a pensar que la contratación actual podría estancarse, y las empresas podrían enfrentar a una escasez de trabajadores en el futuro.

Texto completo: Those of us in journalism primarily do one thing: cover events. We report and opine about events like election campaigns, wars and crimes. A lot of the events we cover are decisions — a decision to reform health care or write a tweet — so we tend to congregate in the cities where decision-makers live. The internet has sped up the news cycle. Now we put more emphasis on covering the last event that just happened. But it’s still mostly events.
But a funny thing has happened to events in this era. They have ceased to drive politics the way they used to. We’ve seen gigantic events like impeachment, the Kavanaugh hearings, the Mueller investigation and the “Access Hollywood” tapes. They come and go and barely leave a trace on the polls, the political landscape or evaluations of Donald Trump.
Events don’t seem to be driving politics. Increasingly, sociology is.
Do you want to predict how a certain region is going to vote in the 2020 presidential race? Discover who settled the region in the 17th and 18th centuries. If the settlers were from the East Anglia section of Britain, then that region is probably going Democratic. If the settlers were from the north of Britain, that region is very likely to vote for Donald Trump.
Do you want to predict how a state is going to vote? Find out how that state voted in the 1896 presidential election. As Washington University political scientists Gary Miller and Norman Schofield have observed, 22 of the 23 states that voted Democratic in 1896 had turned Republican by 2000. Similarly, 17 of the 22 states that voted Republican in 1896 had turned Democratic by 2000. The parties have flipped regions.
Do you want to predict how an individual is going to vote? Ask a simple question: Is she urban or rural?
Geographic and psychosociological patterns now overshadow events in driving political loyalties and national electoral outcomes. Demography is destiny.
There’s a more precise way to put this. An event is really two things. It’s the event itself and then it’s the process by which we make meaning of the event. As Aldous Huxley put it, “Experience is not what happens to you, it’s what you do with what happens to you.”
When a whole country sees events through a similar lens, then you don’t have to think a lot about the process people use to make meaning. It’s similar across the land. But when people in different regions and subcultures have nonoverlapping lenses, the process by which people make sense of events is more important than the event itself.
For reasons I don’t understand, we’ve had an epistemic explosion over the past few decades. Different American regions and subcultures now see reality through nonoverlapping lenses. They make meaning in radically different ways. Psychosocial categories have hardened.
We in the media will continue to cover events, which, of course, is absolutely necessary. But with some noble exceptions (I’m thinking of Thomas Edsall of The New York Times and Ronald Brownstein of The Atlantic), we underreport on how meaning is made in different subcultures. You can’t make sense of reality without that. Often we throw up our hands: “Can’t these people see the facts?!?” I’m as guilty as anyone.
In this new context, I’m curious to know how lenses get crafted. For example, intersectionality is a lens that was created by theorists decades ago and is now a way of seeing that many people use to organize their view of reality. How did that happen?
I’m curious to know how a man in rural Idaho who has lost a son to suicide and a brother to fentanyl sees the impeachment hearing. How does he make meaning of that event in real time?
I’m curious to know how you can change another person’s lens. Can you do it by writing and talking or do you have to move her to a different place and immerse her in a different reality?
I’m curious to know how power inequality shapes people’s lenses. As Jonathan Rauch suggests in the current issue of National Affairs, ideological polarization is not on the rise; emotional polarization is on the rise. We don’t necessarily disagree more. We perceive our opponents to be more menacing. We see more fearfully.
The big difference for those of us in media is that the main story is not only where the decision-makers are creating events. It’s also and maybe more so in the eyes of those doing the perceiving.
Obviously, in this era it’s even more important to have a news organization that is ideologically, culturally and geographically diverse, so you can surface and explore the different unconscious ways groups see.
It’s also important to ask different questions. It’s not enough to simply ask people’s opinions through polls and interviews. Epistemology is deeper than opinions. It’s found through deeper probing.
This is a wonderful opportunity for us to think about our jobs in more profound ways. The core insight is that in a hyperpluralistic society you can’t know people in other groups until you know how they know you.

Health Costs Are Way Out Of Line With the World's

Texto completo: A study of international prices finds American patients pay much more across a wide array of common services.
Why does health care cost so much more in the United States than in other countries? As health economists love to say: "It's the prices, stupid."
As politicians continue to lament the system's expense, and more Americans struggle to pay the high and often unpredictable bills that can accompany their health problems, it's worth looking at just how weird our prices really are relative to the rest of the world.
The International Federation of Health Plans, a group representing the C.E.O.s of health insurers worldwide, publishes a guide every few years on the international cost for common medical services. Its newest report, on 2017 prices, came out this month. Every time, the upshot is vivid and similar: For almost everything on the list, there is a large divergence between the United States and everyone else.
Patients and insurance companies in the United States pay higher prices for medications, imaging tests, basic health visits and common operations. Those high prices make health care in the U.S. extremely expensive, and they also finance a robust and politically powerful health care industry, which means lowering prices will always be hard.
For a typical angioplasty, a procedure that opens a blocked blood vessel to the heart, the average U.S. price is $ 32,200, compared with $ 6,400 in the Netherlands, or $ 7,400 in Switzerland, the survey finds. A typical M.R.I. scan costs $ 1,420 in the United States, but around $ 450 in Britain. An injection of Herceptin, an important breast cancer treatment, costs $ 211 in the United States, compared with $ 44 in South Africa. These examples aren't outliers.
There are so few cases where the United States price isn't the highest that they jump out. Cataract surgery costs more in New Zealand; Kalydeco, a new drug for cystic fibrosis, costs more in the United Arab Emirates. But for most of the studied cases, prices for services and drugs in other developed countries are less than half of those in the United States.
"It is staggering how much the United States is more expensive," said John Hargraves, the director of data strategy at the Health Care Cost Institute, a group that aggregates claims data from several large American insurance companies and provided the U.S. data to the study.
The international survey focuses on prices paid by private insurance companies; in many countries, public health programs pay less, meaning the gap in prices for many countries may be even larger if it took account of every patient. The survey doesn't have information from every country, nor detailed prices for every medical procedure. Drug prices do not include rebates. But the report's overall message is clear. Prices in the United States are higher for nearly everything -- by a lot.
Researchers at Harvard conducted an exhaustive study last year of things that make health systems in developed countries different from one another. They determined that the United States is distinct in a few ways. But the clear finding of those researchers was that it's this huge gap in prices, more than any other single factor -- not the number of doctors' visits or hospitalizations, not the quality of medical services, not differences in social service spending -- that helps explain why the United States is such an expensive place to be sick. (I wrote an article about that study, if you're interested in the details.)
Over the last decade, most of the political health policy debate has been about how to ensure broader insurance coverage for the public. (Another way the United States is unusual is in having so many residents without any form of health insurance.) But the debate among candidates for the 2020 presidential race has begun to tack slightly toward policies that will address price as well.
The single-payer plans Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren have proposed would use a large government insurer to set prices for all medical services. Both campaigns assume substantial savings would result as that government system lowered prices across the board: for doctors, hospitals, medical devices and drugs.
Even plans considered more moderate, like those from Pete Buttigieg, the South Bend, Ind., mayor, and Michael Bloomberg, the media executive and former mayor of New York, would impose some controls on health care prices, by limiting the amount that doctors and hospitals could charge in the situations where they typically charge the most.
President Trump, too, has pushed forward with an initiative to lower prices: Through an executive order and regulation, his administration is seeking to require health care providers to publicize the prices they have negotiated with insurance companies. The idea is to promote more competition through transparency, though researchers are divided on whether the measure will work. (The administration has also worked with bipartisan legislators to eliminate surprise billing, which occurs most commonly in medical emergencies at hospitals, though that effort has stalled.)
Higher prices are not new for the United States, but they have become newly salient, as more health insurance comes with high deductibles and other forms of cost sharing that require patients to pay a larger part of the bill or even the full cost of their care. The overall upward creep of prices has also led insurance premiums to rise, taking a bite out of tax revenue, wages and corporate profits, too.
There's also been some recent bipartisan interest in taking on drug prices specifically -- though few policies have gotten very far in Congress.
Any successful effort to tamp down American prices, of course, will mean reducing someone's paycheck. The uniquely high prices for drugs in the United States help make pharmaceutical companies profitable. The high prices paid for hospital care keep large research hospitals and small rural providers afloat. The high prices help doctors pay off extensive education debt -- but also help place them among the highest-paid professions in our economy. None of those groups particularly want a pay cut.

Texto completo: Don Imus, a legendary radio host who died Friday at 79, pushed the boundaries of decorum for decades with his controversial comments.
The "Imus in the Morning" host, who had been hospitalized in Texas since Christmas Eve, was both popular and off-putting.
Imus found himself in hot water numerous times over his half-century career, facing accusations of racism, misogyny and homophobia. But he also leaves fans who will miss his funny, familiar voice and admire his decades-long dedication to charitable work.
Imus, once named one of the 25 Most Influential People in America by Time magazine, was an outspoken and polarizing shock jock, take it or leave it. Here are five Imus moments heard 'round the world:
Obit: Legendary radio host Don Imus dies at age 79 after being hospitalized since Christmas Eve
The Rutgers women's basketball debacle
Imus will forever be remembered for racially offensive comments about the Rutgers University women's basketball team that led to CBS canceling his nationally syndicated radio show.
In April 2007, Imus described the players on the women's basketball team as "rough girls" and "nappy-headed hoes. " He later apologized for the "an insensitive and ill-conceived remark" after mass backlash, saying at the time, "Our characterization was thoughtless and stupid, and we are sorry. "
Offensive comments: Imus, who used slurs about Rutgers team, ends show
Adam 'Pacman' Jones controversy
In 2008, Imus found himself back in the headlines for the wrong reasons following comments about Dallas Cowboys' cornerback Adam Jones that were deemed racist.
While discussing Jones' suspension and previous arrests on-air, Imus asked, "What color is he?" When a fellow commentator said that Jones was African American, Imus responded, "Well there you go, now we know. "
Howard Stern feud
Imus frequently sparred with fellow shock jock Howard Stern, who usurped Imus' position as the No. 1 morning host in New York City. His vitriol descended into bigotry. During a 1984 interview, Imus used an anti-Semitic slur in a reference to Stern.
Swipes at Bill Clinton
In 1996, Imus caused a stir at the annual Radio and Television Correspondents Association Dinner by making several crude cracks at the expense of then-President Bill Clinton and First Lady Hillary Clinton, who both sat nearby.
Imus joked about Clinton's extramarital activities, among other things. He added, "We all know you're a pot-smoking weasel. "
A White House spokesman called Imus' bit "fairly tasteless. "
Gwen Ifill insult
In 1993, Imus dismissed esteemed journalist Gwen Ifill, an African American, as a "cleaning lady. "
Ifill, then a New York Times reporter, moved on TV journalism, serving as a co-anchor and co-managing editor of PBS NewsHour. In February 2016, she and her NewsHour co-anchor, Judy Woodruff, becoming the first female duo to moderate a Democratic presidential debate. She died later that year.

Texto completo: Headnote WILL SENATE MAJORITY LEADER MCCONNELL
(Editorial Note: December 18, the House of Representatives voted to impeach President Trump on two counts. Senator Kamala Harris' commentary is in reference to after the impeachment vote is a "yes for impeachment" and her roll in the Senate thereafter.)
... Sometime early in the new year, I will take an oath on the Senate floor to uphold the Constitution, review evidence and follow the facts wherever they lead, regardless of party or ideology. Every one of my colleagues will be required to do the same.
As a former prosecutor, I understand the importance of holding powerful people accountable. I know that every trial requires fairness and truth. Having worked my whole life serving the people, I know that any trial that abandons the pursuit of truth cannot be considered fair or just.
But the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, appears more interested in covering up the president's misconduct than in pursuing truth and fairness.
He is already trying to limit the impeachment trial by preventing witnesses from testifying, and he has all but announced a verdict. In doing so, he showed the American people that he has no intention of honoring his oath.
Let's be clear: Mr. McConnell doesn't want a Senate trial. He wants a Senate cover-up.
Fortunately, Mr. McConnell does not have the power to unilaterally undermine this trial. Every single senator will be empowered with an equal vote on how the trial will proceed.
Though in just the past year, Mr. McConnell has used his position to unilaterally block legislation to restore the Voting Rights Act, lower the prices of prescription drugs and address the gun violence epidemic, he cannot wield the same authority in a Senate impeachment trial.
In this trial, senators will be far more than jurors. Every one of us will vote to determine the rules for the trial, decide which witnesses testify and ultimately serve as both court and jury.
Each of us will be called on to uphold our oath with every decision we make. We will all be held accountable by the American people if we refuse to discover the facts relevant to the articles of impeachment.
The Senate Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer, has made a reasonable request to hear from four additional witnesses with firsthand knowledge of the president's misconduct and to review documents that shed light on why the administration initially decided to cut off military aid to Ukraine.
We need to hear from Mick Mulvaney the acting White House chief of staff, who admitted to Mr. Trump's bribery scheme on live television, and from the former national security adviser, John Bolton, who has been shopping stories about Mr. Trump to book publishers instead of speaking with Congress.
Every senator should want to hear from anyone who can speak directly to the president's misconduct related to the articles of impeachment.
Even Richard Nixon allowed the key figures behind the Watergate scandal to speak to Congress, and he eventually turned over incriminating portions of his Oval Office recordings to investigators.
But Mr. Trump has stonewalled Congress and inhibited our ability to seek justice by demanding that those closest to the center of the Ukraine scandal stay silent.
Senators must be allowed to subpoena relevant witnesses and submit questions to them directly.
The Senate should not vote on any article of impeachment or consider a motion to dismiss the trial until we have reviewed the additional testimony and evidence that Mr. Schumer has requested.
I have never been in a courtroom where the accused can unilaterally block witnesses from testifying or prohibit prosecutors from asking witnesses questions. No court would allow a trial to proceed this way, and neither should any member of the Senate.
Ensuring the integrity of this trial is a solemn responsibility for every senator, with consequences that extend far beyond any one presidency. My colleagues and I have a duty to use our voice and our vote to insist on a fair trial, rooted in the pursuit of truth. We must demonstrate to the American people that in our system of justice all are equal under law, and that there are not two sets of rules, one for Donald Trump and another for everybody else.
We must conduct the Senate impeachment trial in a way that is fair and that reflects impartial justice.
History will judge the actions taken by the United States Senate at a time when our Constitution and the rule of law were at stake. I'll be fighting for justice and accountability, and my colleagues should too.

Texto completo: Joe Biden ha asegurado este viernes que no declarará en el ‘impeachment’ en el Senado contra el presidente Donald Trump, si es llamado para ello.
“No lo haré porque está todo diseñado como Trump lo ha hecho durante toda su vida: intentando desviar la atención sobre él mismo. El asunto que se trata no es lo que hice yo”, ha asegurado Biden, en unas declaraciones recogidas por el diario The New York Times.
El exvicepresidente ha asegurado que es todo una “distracción”, a lo que ha añadido que los motivos por lo que sería llamado a declarar en el ‘impeachment’ contra Trump serían “absolutamente engañosos”
Por ello, ha reiterado que los republicanos quieren su testimonio para “desviar la atención” sobre las acciones que ha realizado Trump al frente de la Casa Blanca.
Las declaraciones de Biden tienen lugar después de que la Cámara de Representantes de Estados Unidos aprobara abrir un ‘impeachment’ en el Senado contra Trump, quien se convertirá así en el tercer mandatario del país en hacer frente a un juicio político.
Con 230 votos demócratas a favor, 197 en contra (195 republicanos y dos demócratas) y una única abstención, la de la congresista demócrata Tulsi Gabbard, los cargos presentados en contra de Trump por abuso de poder y obstrucción a la justicia salieron adelante.
La Comisión Judicial acusó a Trump de un cargo de abuso de poder por presionar a su homólogo ucraniano, Volodimir Zelenski, para que abriera dos investigaciones que le beneficiarían para la reelección en 2020: una sobre las supuestas corruptelas del precandidato demócrata Joe Biden y su hijo Hunter en sus negocios en Ucrania y otra sobre “la desacreditada teoría” de que fue ese país, no Rusia, el que interfirió en los comicios de 2016.
Trump también está acusado de un segundo cargo de obstrucción al Congreso por rechazar los requerimientos que le ha hecho la Cámara de Representantes tanto de información como de comparecencia en el marco de la investigación del ‘impeachment’.
Por su parte, la Casa Blanca afirmó que esta decisión fue “uno de los episodios más lamentables de la historia estadounidense”. “Sin recibir un solo voto republicano y sin probar que se incurriese en ningún tipo de delito, los demócratas han sacado adelante unos cargos ilegítimos contra el presidente en la Cámara de Representantes”, señalaron.

Texto completo: Mhuu Thit’s passionate belief in human rights comes with a risk. The young Burmese journalist could end up in prison for his commitment to free speech. As the editor and founder of Channel FFE, an online publication that bills itself as an independent media that stands up for human rights and justice, he knows his country lacks legal protection for free speech.
As he said during a recent conversation at the George W. Bush Institute, where he is a Liberty and Leadership Scholar, a member of Parliament could send a journalist like him to prison.
Fortunately, that has not happened to him, although 44 journalists had faced trial in Burma as of last December. He even has written about the plight of the Rohingya, the stateless Muslim group that has experienced such brutal oppression that The Economist last year described the situation as “bearing all the hallmarks of a genocide.”
Mhuu Thit, 35, explains that African freedom advocates like Nelson Mandela and Desmond Tutu inspired him. They have given him that “X factor” that often characterizes advocates for freedom of conscience: a visceral understanding that human dignity is tied up with our ability to speak freely, worship freely and live freely.
He will need that core understanding as a journalist because, unfortunately, authoritarian leaders are on the prowl against those very freedoms. The Committee to Protect Journalists’ annual survey reveals that at least 250 journalists are in prisons around the world. This is the fourth straight year for that many imprisoned journalists, which is not the kind of streak you like to see if you cherish freedom.
China is the worst offender, followed by America’s NATO ally Turkey. According to the survey, at least 48 journalists are in Chinese prisons. The report explains that the Chinese government’s crackdown on Muslims in the Xinjiang province has resulted in the arrest of dozens of journalists there.
Turkey is equally repressive, although the number of imprisoned journalists declined from 68 in 2018 to 47 in 2019. According to the report, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has “stamp(ed) out independent reporting and criticism by closing down more than 100 news outlets and lodging terror-related charges against many of their staff.”
Interestingly, 98% of imprisoned journalists across the globe are covering their own countries. The politics beat landed the most in prison, followed by human rights and corruption.
Repression of journalists abroad may seem distant. But it is not.
■ First, suppression of free speech abroad makes it harder to get information about what is happening in closed societies. Think how little most of us know about North Korea.
■ Second, suppression of civil liberties creates instability in the international arena, which carries risks for us at home. The Mexican drug cartels’ attacks on members of the media, which has resulted in journalists being slain in places like Nuevo Laredo, solidifies their presence in a country with which we do significant trading.
■ Third, the lack of a free press increases the odds of news and information being manipulated by the authorities. “Fake news,” and I mean real fake news, allows adversaries like Russia and China to sow confusion around the world. “It’s the democratization of misinformation,” Jacob Davey of the London-based Strategic Dialogue in London recently told The New York Times.
Misinformation even infects some views of our own robust press. A September Gallup poll shows only 41% of Americans have a “great deal” or “fair amount” of trust in the media to report the news “fully, accurately and fairly.”
When journalists aren’t allowed to do the hard work of reporting, fact-checking, and editing, the truth becomes harder to get out. And that creates the kind of turbulence that carries geopolitical risks for our own country.
So when journalists like Mhuu Thit do their work in a far-away country like Burma, we should cheer them on. First, for their own country’s sake. But also because their courage is in our own best interest.

Texto completo: CRESTON, Iowa — The voters at campaign events for Joe Biden here in Iowa and across the country are not just shopping for a candidate for themselves.
As they jostle to take pictures with the former vice president and listen to him preach about national unity, they are often thinking about someone else — a dad, a neighbor, or a colleague. They consider the political leanings of people close to them who are uncomfortable with the most liberal presidential contenders, but who hate the chaos of the Trump era and are receptive to the kind of centrist, seasoned candidacy Biden offers.
Some Democrats have been warning the party not to obsess over these potential swing voters, arguing that electability calculations about mythical undecided moderates are futile at this moment of extreme political polarization.
But for many Biden supporters, those voters are their Republican-leaning relatives and friends. And their perspectives are an increasingly prominent consideration as the Iowa caucuses near.
“I think he could get the independents and moderate Republicans who refuse to vote for Donald Trump," said Bailey Smith, 27, a leader in Atlantic, Iowa's business community and an undecided voter who attended a Biden campaign event Sunday. Asked whether she had any moderate Republicans in mind, she replied, “My dad."
It is a dynamic that helps explain why, despite Biden's series of missteps and uneven debate performances, many Democratic voters still believe the former vice president would stand the best chance against President Trump in a general election, polls show.
That is a message Biden's top surrogates are sounding at every turn, citing potential swing voters in the process.
Yet crossover voters are also a rare breed. But recent New York Times Upshot/Siena College surveys show that a narrow slice of swing voters does exist in key battleground states, as do voters who say they would be comfortable with Biden but not Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts.
And according to a dozen Republican donors and strategists, as well as former elected officials who can speak free from concerns about retribution from Trump, there is some evidence that Biden can connect with these voters.
“Oh yeah, he definitely does," said former governor John Kasich of Ohio, a 2016 Republican presidential candidate, pointing to Biden's ability to speak to blue-collar voters.
NEW YORK TIMES
Liz Cheney eyes seat sought by former Wyo. lawmaker
CHEYENNE, Wyo. — While US Representative Liz Cheney considers whether to run for an open Senate seat in Wyoming, the race so far has only one well-known candidate: Cynthia Lummis, a fellow Republican and, along with Cheney, one of only three women who has held the state's US House seat.
The 1976 Miss Frontier, Lummis went on to a political career that included 14 years in the Wyoming Legislature, two terms as state treasurer, and four terms as congresswoman, retiring in 2016.
Recently she's had the ear of President Trump, discussing best livestock-grazing practices on public lands in the West while interviewing in person, twice, for Interior secretary, a job she didn't get.
Few would try to beat Lummis, 65, and her long political experience, but those who might include Cheney, who plans to announce in early 2020 whether she will run for Senate.

Texto completo: (JTA) — A man who works as a software engineer broke into a Yeshiva University dormitory in Manhattan and set three separate fires using matches intended to light Chanukah candles.
Students were asleep in the building when the incident occurred after 3 a.m. on Dec. 20, New York City Fire Commissioner Daniel A. Nigro announced on Friday.
Peter Weyand, 33, was arrested on Friday for breaking into the Yeshiva University Schottenstein Residence, in an incident partially captured on security camera. He is charged with arson, burglary with criminal intent, reckless endangerment of property, criminal mischief, criminal trespass and aggravated harassment.
Weyand is believed to have been under the influence of drugs at the time of the incident, the New York Times reported, citing a law enforcement official familiar with the case who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the investigation is continuing. None of the charges raise the level of the incident to a hate crime, despite the fact that the university is a major Jewish institution in the city.
The fire department released surveillance video of a man kicking out the bottom of a glass door to the dormitory’s lobby and then crawling through it, finally continuing into the building. The video does not show the fires.

'Bombshell' blows up myths and facts

Texto completo: "Bombshell" recently exploded into the awards race, leading the Screen Actors Guild Awards nominations with four nods, including best ensemble, actress (Charlize Theron) and supporting actress (Margot Robbie and Nicole Kidman).
The drama goes behind the scenes at Fox News in 2016. It chronicles the efforts of a group of women – including on-the-outs host Gretchen Carlson (Kidman) and star anchor Megyn Kelly – to expose a culture of misogyny, leading to the ouster of Machiavellian CEO Roger Ailes (John Lithgow), who was accused of sexual harassment by more than 20 women.
Fox News spokesperson Caley Cronin declined to comment to USA TODAY beyond confirming that "Bombshell" producers "never reached out to Fox News during any part of the production."
The film was directed by Jay Roach ("Trumbo") and written by Charles Randolph ("The Big Short"), who breaks down what's fact, fiction and somewhere in between.
Is Robbie's character real? Robbie plays an ambitious, wide-eyed staffer named Kayla Pospisil. A lifelong Fox News fanatic and young evangelical ("I see myself as an influencer in the Jesus space," she says), Pospisil soon catches the eye of Ailes, who promises to promote her to on-air talent in exchange for sexual favors.
Although Pospisil is a fictional character, her experiences of harassment are drawn from interviews Randolph and Roach conducted with ex-Fox News staffers (some of whom violated their non-disclosure agreements to speak with filmmakers).
"What happens inside of Roger's office is based on the stories of three women we had access to," Randolph says. The rest is pulled from Randolph's evangelical upbringing.
"Her being ideologically fervent like a dedicated Republican, but a little sexually fluid and utterly morally sincere, that's based more on women in my life."
Is McKinnon's character fictional? The "Saturday Night Live" favorite is a scene-stealer as Pospisil's savvy co-worker Jess Carr, a closeted lesbian and liberal who has complicated feelings about working at a network that preaches against her values and lifestyle.
Carr was "all made up," Randolph says.
"I wanted to show the bystander narrative. Megyn's story is the story of someone who comes to discover she is complicit by virtue of the institutional norms and her ability to manipulate them in the predation of a younger generation of women. Likewise with Kayla: Her willingness to look the other way creates this dynamic, and she realizes at the end that it affects herself."
Did someone poison Kelly? The film begins with an anxious but steely Kelly en route to moderate the first debate of the Republican primary campaign. She accepts coffee offered by her driver, only to fall violently ill before the debate is about to begin. Rattled, she later relays the incident to Ailes, wondering aloud whether it was nerves or if the man tampered with her drink.
The scene is lifted directly from Kelly's 2016 memoir "Settle for More," although the journalist refuted inferences by the New York Times and others that she was poisoned. Yet "Bombshell" leaves the circumstances around her mystery illness intentionally vague.
"Roger said, 'How dare you have a cup of coffee from a guy you don't know. What are you, crazy?'" Randolph says. "Megyn has a good ear for absurdist details."
Did Ailes consult Rudy Giuliani? "Bombshell" is a who's who of famous faces, including Malcolm McDowell as Rupert Murdoch, Allison Janney as Ailes' legal counsel Susan Estrich, and Connie Britton as Ailes' wife, Beth. Then there's Richard Kind, who portrays Ailes' friend Rudy Giuliani. The embattled Ailes asks the politician/attorney how to handle the fallout of his sexual harassment allegations.
"Ailes had three different lawyers who we let Giuliani stand in for," Randolph says. "If you wanted to be a Republican public intellectual, all avenues went through Roger Ailes' office, and that mattered in terms of his ability to prey on young people who had aspirations."
Was Ailes known as 'the legs man'? The film shows a competitive work environment at Fox News for female anchors and producers, many of whom rarely spoke or befriended each other. (Kelly and Carlson, for instance, only share the screen once in passing in an elevator – true to real life, where they worked different shifts and "almost never interacted," Randolph says.)
"Bombshell" also illustrates Ailes' predatory behavior: asking women to spin in front of him during meetings, and demanding that on-air talent wear short skirts to show off their legs. Such scenes were drawn from Kelly's book, as well as Gabriel Sherman's 2014 Ailes biography, "The Loudest Voice in the Room," and Sarah Ellison's 2016 expose for Vanity Fair, Randolph says.
"All the women who filed complaints about him who have gone public have been really brave in articulating ... what happened to them," Randolph says.
The film's most chilling scene is a private meeting between Ailes and Pospisil when he pressures her to lift her skirt. The camera lingers on Pospisil, near tears, as he orders her to inch it higher and higher, revealing her underwear. By letting the abuse play out in real time, Randolph hopes male viewers, in particular, will feel uncomfortable but also feel greater empathy for victims.
"When you're in the room and you appreciate the intonations and context of it, you can see how it could be utterly life-changing and maddening and complicated for a young woman,'" he says.
Megyn Kelly (played by Charlize Theron) probably wasn't poisoned by the driver taking her to a Republican debate. But "Bombshell" leaves that open-ended.

Texto completo: "They have never been as popular,
with the possible exception of 1924. Now crosswords are more up to date, they're livelier, they feel more modern."
Will Shortz
New York Times crossword puzzle editor
In 1924, the U.K.-based newspaper The Tamworth Herald warned of a dangerous craze that had "enslaved" the United States.
The paper described a "menace ... making devastating inroads on the working hours of every rank of society." People were "shamelessly" participating at all hours of the day. It was dealing "the final blow to the art of conversation."
The culprit? Crossword puzzles.
Yep, crossword puzzles, those grids of black-and-white blocks and often pun-ny clues that appear in the pages of newspapers. They were all the rage in the 1920s, until the nationwide fad eventually died along with the Charleston and pole-sitting.
Nearly a century later and we're in the "golden age of crosswords." Or so says Will Shortz. He should know: Shortz has been the editor of the storied New York Times crossword puzzle since 1993, and before that worked at Games magazine for 15 years.
"They have never been as popular, with the possible exception of 1924," Shortz, who lives in Pleasantville, told NorthJersey.com. "Now crosswords are more up to date, they're livelier, they feel more modern. I think they're attracting a wider audience than ever."
'A good kind of torture' Once upon a time, crossword fans had to rely on newspapers, magazines or published puzzle books to get their fix. Now you can solve them on your tablet or phone via apps (USA TODAY's crossword app was a big hit with its readers), or subscription-based sites like The Inkubator and Fireball Crosswords can send them to your inbox. You can sign up for Queer Crosswords or Women of Letters by donating to specific charities.
"Now there are so many other options and venues," said Anna Gundlach, a puzzle fan and crossword constructor who lives in Portland, Oregon. "A lot of the distribution channels are able to be bypassed entirely."
The proliferation of independent crossword puzzles means a wider range of clues and answers and more provocative content. Puzzle editors at the New York Times reject puzzles if they decide a clue or answer is too obscure. Gundlach said the paper passed on one of hers because it referenced Bell Biv DeVoe.
"The American Values Club, which I've done a crossword for recently, has a more Gen X, millennial bent to it," she said. "Fresher clues, not afraid to swear or talk about sex."
Gundlach has had a nearly lifelong puzzle obsession. For Howard Barkin, a love of crosswords came late. He started solving them in his early 30s during lunch breaks to get his mind off work. Now he's 45 and a legit crossword puzzle champion. Barkin, who lives in Somerset County, finished first in the 2016 American Crossword Puzzle Tournament in Stamford, Connecticut.
Shortz is the director for the contest, which pits the best crossword solvers against one another in seven games over the course of a weekend, culminating in a final round for the three finalists. Barkin's tournament victory came after solving the last puzzle in 7 minutes, 49 seconds.
The stress was high, Barkin said.
"Most people aren't used to solving a crossword with a timer counting down in a room full of 500 people," he said.
Barkin also constructs crosswords when he frees time between doing dishes and raising two young daughters. He said his favorite to solve involve "extremely evil" tricks.
"A puzzle that breaks the rules, but for a good reason," he said. "A puzzle where you have to write a Greek letter into a square or something. It's a good kind of torture."
'Wow us' Even with a host of alternatives, the gold standard crossword remains the one The New York Times publishes.
"It's capital T, capital C: The Crossword," Gundlach said. "When people talk about 'the Sunday crossword' or 'the Friday crossword,' that's generally assumed to be the New York Times crossword."
Crossword fans use the hashtag #NYTXW on Twitter to brag about their finish times and offer their often-harsh criticism of that day's puzzle. The Dec. 12 crossword elicited reviews like "Ugh. So Bible heavy and then that twist? No." and "Ok #NYTXW sorry I don't know the ATOMIC NUMBER of NEODYMIUM?!?!"
The paper's associate puzzles editor, Sam Ezersky, doesn't take that kind of criticism personally. His Facebook banner photo is a foul-mouthed pan of one of his crossword puzzles.
"It's an obsessive culture," Ezersky said. "I get being so passionate about something like this."
Ezersky grew up in a Washington, D.C., suburb as a puzzles fanatic and sold his first crossword puzzle to the Los Angeles Times when he was 16 years old. He's 24 now, lives in Hoboken, New Jersey, and spends his days sifting through some of the roughly 600 crossword puzzle submissions the New York Times receives monthly (via snail mail only). Some he turns down with nothing more than a glance. Either the grid is an odd pattern, or the words are meh.
"We're just looking for fresh things that really capture our attention," he said. "These days we really need the puzzles to wow us."
Ezersky does not construct puzzles as much as he used to, but he snagged a dream assignment this year, creating the annual "super mega" crossword that ran Dec. 15 in the New York Times' special puzzles section. It was a massive undertaking: a 50x50-square grid with 708 answers. It's so big the clues are printed on a separate page. Ezersky estimates it took hundreds of hours to construct. Still, he would have begged to do it if necessary.
"I know there were other constructors that declined because it's a such a Herculean task," he said. "If I could have been totally no filter and not cared about professionality, I would have been like, 'Please, please, please, please, please.'"
An Ezersky crossword from August shows how his mind works when he puzzles out a puzzle. He began with the across answer at the bottom left, where he placed "tech-savvy." He then stacked "heist film" right on top, giving himself the unenviable challenge of finding a down answer that ends with "lv." He did: "capital V."
Once the grid is done, he dreams up clues. He clued "tech-savvy" with "E-sharp?" – that question mark is crossword-ese indicating there's a joke or pun involved – and asked readers to get to "capital V" with the clue "Symbol for 54-down." The answer was "volts."
Constructing crossword puzzles can be agonizing, Ezersky said, but he wouldn't want any other job.
"My mantra to myself is I'm just getting started," he said. "I'm just humbled and grateful to be doing what I'm doing."

Texto completo: For years, air quality in the U.S. steadily improved. And just like that, deaths related to air pollution fell off, too.
However, in 2017 and 2018, new data show the amount of fine-particle air pollution got worse, with concentrations rising 5.5 percent after falling by 24.2 percent the previous five years.
The reversal made a real difference in the lives of thousands of Americans. Using reliable formulas that reflect the relationship between pollution and mortality, researchers say in 2018 alone worsening air quality can be linked to more than 10,000 additional deaths.
Fine-particle air pollution — from tailpipes of cars and trucks, and smokestacks at factories and power plants — is very harmful. Measuring less than 1/30th the width of a human hair, it can be inhaled and absorbed into the bloodstream. It has been linked to heart disease and stroke, respiratory disease and lung cancer, as well as dementia and Alzheimer's disease. It can lead to lower test scores and work productivity.
Regulations have gone a long way in limiting the bad effects of air pollution. But even as pollution fell, by one measurement dropping the number of deaths related to it by 47 percent in the two decades prior to 2010, it could still be blamed in part for 71,000 deaths that year — as many as fatal shootings and car accidents combined. In 2015, even as every county in the U.S. met federal air quality standards, pollution was responsible for more than 30,000 deaths.
It's a problem, and now it's getting worse, again.
Americans drove more and used more natural gas the last two years, part of the reason pollution is on the rise. Wildfires, mainly in California, also played a role.
But also cited as a factor were actions by the Environmental Protection Agency, beginning during the Obama administration and given the throttle under President Donald Trump.
Enforcement of the Clean Air Act began to fall off under Obama but fell precipitously under Trump. The Trump administration also has rolled back 24 rules and regulations related to air quality, according to an analysis by The New York Times. Last year, the EPA disbanded a panel of experts that advised the agency on fine-particle pollution, replacing it with consultants from the fossil fuel, pharmaceutical and tobacco industries.
And when the EPA found that eliminating the Clean Power Plan — which sought to lower carbon emissions from power generators — would cost an additional 1,400 premature deaths, the Trump administration decided to change the way such calculations are made.
In short, against all scientific evidence, the EPA now says that cleaner air does not lead to better health.
That is simply not the case. Ignoring the very real problems caused by air pollution will only allow it to get worse, affecting the health of tens of thousands of Americans each year.

Texto completo: KABUL, Afghanistan -- The Taliban ambushed a peace convoy in western Afghanistan and abducted 26 activists who are members of a peace movement, a police spokesman said Wednesday.
The insurgents staged the ambush in the district of Bala Buluk in Farah province on Tuesday. The Taliban forced the six-vehicle convoy to a halt, then got into the cars and drove them and the activists to an unknown location, said provincial police spokesman Mohibullah Mohib.
According to Mohib, a police operation is underway to locate and free the activists whose convoy was going village-to-village to rally for peace.
Bismillah Watandost of the People's Peace Movement of Afghanistan, to which the activists belong, said that 27 of their members were abducted by the Taliban in the Farah assault. The different figures could not immediately be reconciled.
The Taliban, who have been active in Farah, have not claimed responsibility for the abductions. However, Watandost also said that tribal elders in the province launched an effort to negotiate with the Taliban to release the abducted activists. He added that phone lines were down in the region, making communication and getting information from the area difficult.
The latest rallies by the activists from the People's Peace Movement of Afghanistan started on Friday, first in southern Helmand province, a Taliban stronghold.
At a similar series of peace rallies in October, the Taliban abducted six activists from the movement in eastern Logar province but released them the same day.

Time and cost of relocation of US base in Okinawa to double
TOKYO -- The relocation of a U.S. Marine Corps base to a less-crowded area of the southern Japanese island of Okinawa will take more than twice as much money and time as previously estimated because of the need to stabilize the reclaimed land it will be built on, Japan's government said Wednesday.
The Defense Ministry said the relocation of U.S. Marine Corps Air Station Futenma from densely populated Ginowan to Henoko on Okinawa's eastern coast will cost $8.5 billion and take 12 years, pushing its completion into the 2030s. That adds more than a decade to the plan already delayed by more than 20 years because of local opposition.
Under an earlier plan agreed to by Tokyo and Washington in 2013, construction was to cost about $3.2 billion and take five years, with completion expected in about 2022.

Michigan AG asserts Nassar probe not suspended after all
LANSING, Mich. -- Michigan's attorney general on Wednesday said her communications director's statement declaring the suspension of a nearly two-year criminal investigation into Michigan State University's handling of complaints against sexual abuser Larry Nassar was "inadvertently misleading."
Attorney General Dana Nessel said in a written statement that the investigation is ongoing.
The probe, which began under Nessel's predecessor, has resulted in charges against three former school officials. One was convicted. Two others, including former President Lou Anna Simon, were ordered to trial.
"For the record, I remain deeply committed to finding the truth about who knew what about Larry Nassar at MSU, " Nessel said.

Songwriter Allee Willis, who penned 'Friends' theme, dies
LOS ANGELES -- Allee Willis, a songwriter whose work included the Broadway musical "The Color Purple" as well as the theme song from the TV show "Friends" and Earth, Wind & Fire's "September," has died. She was 72.
The cause of death Tuesday was a cardiac event, The New York Times reported, but did not specify where she died, though she had been living in Los Angeles.
Willis was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2018 -- more than 30 years after she won a Grammy for co-writing Patti LaBelle's "Stir It Up" for the "Beverly Hills Cop" soundtrack.
She was also nominated for an Emmy for the "Friends" theme song, "I'll Be There for You" performed by the Rembrandts but lost to the theme of "Star Trek: Voyager."

Burning Man organizers sue over US permit fees
RENO, Nev. -- Burning Man organizers sued the U.S. Bureau of Land Management to recover millions of dollars they say the government has overcharged them in fees over the past seven years at the counterculture celebration.
Black Rock City LLC, the nonprofit that produces the annual Burning Man event, filed the lawsuit Dec. 13 in U.S. District Court in Washington.
Organizers told the Reno Gazette Journal they're tired of waiting over the past four years for the bureau to provide justification for the nearly $3 million it charges annually for a permit to hold the 80,000-person event in the Black Rock Desert about 100 miles north of Reno.
In recent years, Black Rock City has been required to reimburse the BLM, which provides law enforcement and oversight at the event, for its services and expenses.

Relief group: 216,000 have fled homes in NW Syria
BEIRUT -- More than 200,000 men, women and children fled their homes in northwest Syria in buses, trucks and cars in recent weeks, amid intense air and ground bombardment by government forces, a Syrian relief group said Wednesday.
Government forces have been bombarding southern and eastern Idlib province, the last rebel stronghold in the country, since late November. A ground offensive that began last week has displaced more people and government forces have captured more than 40 villages and hamlets, according to the Syrian army and opposition activists.
The Syrian Response Coordination Group, a relief organization, said 216,632 people have fled their homes, many of them with no specific place to go. Many have been heading toward the Turkish border for safety.
In Chile: Helicopters on Wednesday dropped water on the outskirts of the Chilean port city of Valparaiso to extinguish a fire that destroyed about 150 homes.
Dozens of people living in the city's Rocuant and San Roque hills sifted through the ruins of their homes after the fire, fanned by strong winds, swept through their neighborhoods on Tuesday. Residents had been evacuated and there were no reports of casualties.
Interior Minister Gonzalo Blumel said authorities believe arson caused the blaze and urged people to report any suspicious activity.
The fire was doused in urban areas but remains "active" in the woods, said Ricardo Toro, head of the national emergency office.<

Texto completo: A constitutional lawyer says the justices have proved more loyal to the president than to the rule of law. Also: Women's activism; the Republicans and climate change.
To the Editor:
Linda Greenhouse's fine essay "The Supreme Court's Loyalty Test" (Sunday Review, Dec. 22) describes the significance of the court's ultimate decisions in the three Trump-related cases it just agreed to review. Those decisions, she says, will "give the country much-needed clarity" about whether the court is more loyal to President Trump than to the rule of law.
But the fact that the court decided to review the cases tells us that it is more loyal to Mr. Trump. The court has failed the loyalty test.
There was no good reason for the Supreme Court to review the rulings of the three federal circuit courts that rendered decisions against Mr. Trump. If those rulings had been left to stand, the documents (tax returns, financial returns, records of conversations) and testimony that would damage this president, perhaps fatally, would have immediately been produced. And the Democrats' claim that witnesses and additional documents should be part of the Senate impeachment trial would have added substance.
There are reasons a Supreme Court should take a case. Those reasons do not exist here. All the court's action does is delay until the middle of next year -- perhaps after the Senate trial -- the production of documents and people that the public is entitled to see and hear from. That delay may well save Mr. Trump his presidency.
Mr. Trump won. The rule of law lost.

When Women Raise Their Voices
To the Editor:
Re "The Secrets of Successful Activism" (Op-Ed, Dec. 17):
Hahrie Han is right to note that "democracy is a muscle" that strengthens as we use it. What she didn't mention is that using that muscle changes your life.
For the last two years, I have been profiling women who have become effective activists and leaders through my podcast, "The Pledge." What I see over and over is that once we start raising our voices, we find and build strength we never knew we had.
Many of these women have experienced trauma earlier in their lives, and it is through political activism and working for the good of their communities that they have found healing and power.
Not only is it salutary, it is also contagious. Interviewing these women has helped me find new energy for action, and reasons for hope in depressing times.

The G.O.P.'s Dangerous Denial of Climate Change
To the Editor:
Re "The Party That Ruined the Planet" (column, Dec. 13):
Thanks to Paul Krugman for using his power as a columnist to try to do good. Mr. Krugman lays out the facts of climate change and the terrifying but predictable rate at which it is setting the stage for an uninhabitable planet. He points out that the modern Republican Party has watched this happen and shirked its responsibilities every step of the way.
It is a horrible feeling to recognize how powerless we are as citizens to inject common sense into this scenario while our planet withers and groans from our abuses. The true enemies are those in power who have chosen to ignore the facts on the only issue of lasting importance: survival.
Amy Knitzer
Montclair, N.J.
To the Editor:
I have one disagreement with this excellent article. Paul Krugman seems to imply that the whole Republican world has been snookered into believing that climate change is a hoax.
This may be true of some of the more feebleminded, but most of the Republicans who (a) are in public office or (b) benefit from the curtailment of environmental protection probably well understand the problem. If they publicly denigrate climate science it's only because (a) they fear political reprisal from President Trump and his supporters, or their own donors, if they don't, or (b) they believe that such protection threatens their jobs or impairs their investments.

Texto completo: It had to be one or the other. But as great as LeBron James has been, Curry had the edge in one major way: He changed the game.
The New York Times is reflecting on the past decade in the N.B.A., which has evolved perhaps more than any other major sports league.
The choice for the N.B.A.'s player of the decade came down to just two superstars -- Stephen Curry and LeBron James. Which of the two should it be?
After all, if it wasn't Curry holding a championship trophy in recent years, the expectation was that it would be James instead. Nine of the decade's N.B.A. finals featured at least one of them, and their teams claimed six of the championships. They won half of the past decade's Most Valuable Player Awards. If one of them wasn't on national television on a given night, then the other one was. With the previous generation's biggest stars fading, they boldly staked their claim to the spotlight.
But when it came to picking the player of the decade, our writers' decisions were pretty clear.
The Case for LeBron James
Senior staff editor and reporter
Let's see: the most points in the decade, the most field goals, the top rating in most advanced stats, the most Most Valuable Player awards (three), the most finals M.V.P. awards (three). LeBron James even led the decade in minutes played.
Or you could be a contrarian and choose, maybe, the blocks-per-minute leader, JaVale McGee. Probably not the right pick, though.
Sports reporter
Three N.B.A. championships, including the first for the city of Cleveland. Three more M.V.P.s to go with the one he won last decade. More highlight-reel dunks and chase-down blocks and signature moments than any of his peers (no offense, Steph).
But beyond merely being the most dominant player of the decade, James was the figure around whom the rest of the league orbited. For potential title contenders, his presence -- in Miami, in Cleveland, in Los Angeles -- figured into every calculation other teams made. Which players could they acquire to help vanquish the King? Which picks could they package to trade for more depth, more star power, more scoring and defense?
Now in his 17th season, and on the cusp of a new decade, James is still going strong, positioning the Lakers for their first deep playoff run since the days of Kobe Bryant. Staggering but true: James's greatest feat may still be ahead of him.
The Landslide for Stephen Curry
Hall of Fame sportswriter
Stephen Curry. Heresy, right? Maybe not. Curry's impact on the way N.B.A. games are played now -- from deep and deeper -- has been more profound than James's impact, though the King was unquestionably the decade's best overall player and biggest newsmaker.
Just for the record, Curry was a two-time M.V.P., won as many titles (three) as James -- all against James's team -- and was the most dynamic talent for a Warriors team that set the record (73) for most games won in a season. He was the most breathtaking long-distance dialer of a far-out decade.
Hall of Fame sports reporter
This one is impossible. LeBron took his Miami and Cleveland teams to eight consecutive N.B.A. finals and ushered in the player-empowerment era with "The Decision" in 2010 -- followed by two more landscape-altering free agencies -- when he returned to the Cavaliers in 2014 and then bolted to the Lakers in 2018. Stephen Curry rewrote the boundaries of acceptable shooting distance as the 3-pointer became this sport's weapon of prominence, and he served as the face of a team that went to five consecutive finals and won three championships.
A tie is the fairest result here, but I grudgingly concede that ties aren't allowed. So I'm going with Steph, as the starriest force most synonymous with the Team of the Decade, by the narrowest of margins.
Sports business reporter
LeBron James was undoubtedly the best player of the decade, but Stephen Curry defined it. Writing about the 3-point revolution has become stale and trite, but Curry really did change the game. It was not all that long ago that shooting pull-up 3s, or shooting from more than a foot or two behind the arc, was verboten. But Curry and the Warriors redefined what needed to be defended, warping and breaking defensive schemes in the process.
Oh, and he also won three championships, two M.V.P.'s and led the Warriors to the best regular-season ever in 2015-16. Let's not talk about what happened next.
N.B.A. editor
It feels weird not to pick LeBron James here, what with him being the best player in the world and all, but Stephen Curry was the defining player of this decade. No one changed basketball the way he did, and no one captivated the world as he did. Suddenly, here was a player for whom there was no such thing as a bad shot. That's not true for anyone besides Curry. He's the one.
Senior staff editor
Try to imagine Stephen Curry playing in any other decade.
The record for 3-pointers in a season when Curry joined the N.B.A. in the 2009-10 season was 269 by Ray Allen, and only 21 players had ever topped 200. In the 11 seasons since, Curry has topped Allen's record five times, setting a potentially unbreakable record of 402 in 2015-16.
But Curry didn't benefit from this era -- he created it. Before him, it was unheard of to ignore the shot clock and hoist 30-footers off the dribble with ease. And even though he has his share of imitators (Damian Lillard, Trae Young, etc.), no one has mastered the art nearly as well.
Curry was at the heart of the decade's best team, winning three titles in a five-year period of total dominance, and his size and smile helped him become the face of the N.B.A. for a new generation of fans.

Texto completo: Multiple sclerosis forced Charles Glenn to step aside as the St. Louis Blues' anthem singer just as they were winning their first championship. He has both moved on and held on.
The New York Times Sports department is revisiting the subjects of some compelling articles from the last year or so. Here is our June report on Charles Glenn's final days with the Blues .
Charles Glenn misses the concession workers at Enterprise Center in St. Louis. He misses the custodial staff there and the crew that cleans the ice. He misses the Blues' players and management. He misses the energy that would pulse through the corridors before games where he sang the national anthem, his voice, a soulful tenor, resonating through the arena's uppermost reaches.
After 19 years as the Blues' primary anthem singer, Glenn informed them on Jan. 6 -- his 64th birthday, when the team ranked last in the Western Conference -- that he would retire at season's end. Even on better days, his multiple sclerosis left him fatigued and weak, and it was time to stop, it just was.
But Glenn promised that he would continue singing in the playoffs, if the Blues qualified. They kept winning, so Glenn kept singing -- through April and May and deep into June, with three home games in the Stanley Cup finals, the latest a Blues season had ever stretched.
Three days after St. Louis throttled the Bruins in Boston to win Game 7, Glenn and his band perched on a stage beneath the Gateway Arch, near the end of the victory parade route. Conducting with his cane, Glenn performed for about two hours, riffing during a soaring rendition of the team's traditional goal song, "When the Blues Go Marching In." He also belted out a different kind of anthem: "We Are The Champions." Several times that afternoon, overcome with emotion, Glenn paused to collect himself.
"I have never seen so many people at one place, just a sea of people, all united for one purpose," Glenn said. "It brought a tear to my eye."
The Blues completed the most improbable in-season turnaround in N.H.L. history to win the franchise's first Stanley Cup, a championship made ever more special by their relationship with people like Laila Anderson, the young superfan stricken with an immune disorder, and Glenn, a link between two of the city's passions -- hockey and music.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Months later, as a token of the Blues' appreciation, Glenn received the same gaudy championship ring that the players did, with 282 diamonds and 51 sapphires.
"When he saw it, I wish you could have seen his face," said Jason Pippi, the Blues' director of entertainment. "He was walking around opening night wearing that thing with the swagger that only Charles Glenn can command."
That night, Oct. 2, the Blues raised their championship banner and hoisted the Stanley Cup once more before playing the Washington Capitals. During a stoppage, Glenn was shown on the video screen, and introduced to a rousing ovation. He has not returned to Enterprise Center since -- not because he is avoiding it, but because he has been too busy.
In October, he sang the national anthem before two Cardinals playoff games at Busch Stadium, hoping to transfer his talismanic powers to the local baseball team. In November, he said, his wife, Nikki, had to ferry him out of town for Thanksgiving, absconding to Kansas City, so she could get him to herself. Between teaching vocal music and choir at Missouri Baptist University and performing at holiday parties with his band darn near every night, Glenn had not had a day off in two weeks when we spoke in early December. Nor did he foresee getting any time off soon.
"I'm supposed to be retired," Glenn said, "and I'm working harder than I ever have in my life."
But when his schedule does allow, Glenn tunes into Blues games on television, or radio, and he listens. He listens to his successors. Out of respect to Glenn, Pippi said, the Blues did not want to hire a successor so soon. Instead, they are relying on the bounty of local talent, some of whom Glenn judged during summer auditions.
"A lot of times they're on, and I'll say, 'Oh, I remember them. They were very good,"' Glenn said. "There's no weak link in the bunch."
In those moments, and others, Glenn misses singing the anthem. But he does not miss the long drives to and from the arena. Nor does he miss walking up and down all those concrete stairs. But the Blues are again a juggernaut, leading the Western Conference, and though Glenn's schedule this June is full -- his daughter's wedding, a deferred trip to New York for the Tony Awards -- he would cherish the opportunity to watch them repeat.
"If they want me back, I'm there," Glenn said. "I'll be well rested."

By and large, this country is served by a professional and dedicated group of public employees, whether you’re talking about the National Weather Service, the Foreign Service, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Defense Department ...

Texto completo: Not long ago, I was in a meeting to talk about a public policy issue. It was a little complex, and as we considered the various angles I began to think about what it would take to translate talk into change on the ground. I wasn’t analyzing the politics of it — I was focused on the types of people who’d have to roll up their sleeves.
What I came away with was a list of skills, none of them unusual, but all of them vital to getting things done in the increasingly complicated world that government faces. Here’s some of what it takes: * You need a legislative draftsman, someone who understands the specialized language of bill-writing and how to translate ideas into law; * You’ll almost certainly need several lawyers involved to steer clear of legal shoals, as well as budget experts who can handle cost estimates and projections; * It’s helpful to have someone who understands what constitutes ethical and unethical behavior in the field you’re addressing; * There are a lot of subject matters that play a role in almost any major problem: environmental, financial, security and military, logistics, health, education, international dimensions — and you’ll want to be able to consult with experts in all of them; * Because, almost invariably, you’re dealing with computer systems or actual machinery, it’s helpful to have the appropriate types of engineers on hand; * It’s often helpful to work with a historian or two who can put the problem in context; * You need people who are familiar with the private sector and understand what businesses and corporations can and cannot reasonably achieve, since so many issues today involve both the public and private sectors; * You have to be able to understand and cover the politics of your approach, meaning you need people who can bridge the White House and Congress or the governor’s office and the legislature; * Somewhere along the line you’ll need PR experts who understand radio, print, TV, and social media, since you’ll have to enlist the public, or at least win its support; * And, of course, you’ll need to figure out how to raise the money you’ll need, both through the public purse and from the private and nonprofit worlds.
My point is simple: To make our system and this country work, we need a lot of experts and competent bureaucrats to deal with the problems that come cascading down on government. And here’s what I can tell you, after decades of close contact with federal civil servants: We have them. By and large, this country is served by a professional and dedicated group of public employees, whether you’re talking about the National Weather Service, the Foreign Service, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Defense Department ... We’re blessed with a lot of talented people.
Which is why I’ve never shared the contempt and outright hostility toward federal bureaucrats that is so often expressed in the public arena these days. They deal with very tough problems and they’re usually good at what they do. They just don’t toot their own horns about it.
This was on full display in the recent House Intelligence Committee hearings on impeachment. As New York Times columnist David Brooks put it recently, "[T]he civil servant witnesses answering questions inspired a lot more confidence than the elected officials who were asking them." He went on to quote political scientist Hugh Heclo, "It is when you deal with someone who does not perform in a ‘professional’ manner that you learn to appreciate those who do."
This doesn’t mean that there aren’t some bad apples within the bureaucracy. There always are, but they’re rare. And most of the time, inspectors general, administrative processes, and, when it’s working, congressional oversight address the problems reasonably well. Attacking cabinet officials and civil service employees publicly, the way President Trump seems to enjoy doing, seems counterproductive. These are, after all, the very people he has to depend on to move his programs forward.
In the face of the many challenges we confront, the professionalism, talent, and competence of our civil servants matter. We’ve been fortunate: many of them have withstood attacks on themselves and the systems they depend on for support. So far.

Sarah Posner: That Christianity Today editorial won’t change anything

Texto completo: Thursday night, Christianity Today, long known as the “flagship” magazine of American evangelicalism, broke the internet with an editorial arguing for the impeachment and removal of Donald Trump from office. The piece, penned by the magazine’s outgoing editor, Mark Galli, implored evangelicals to consider the “unambiguous facts” of the impeachment case against the president, maintaining his actions not only violated the Constitution, but were also “profoundly immoral.”
The reaction — particularly from non-evangelicals — was excited and swift. “Whoa” and “big deal” led links to the piece on Twitter, suggesting that, after Mr. Trump spent four wildly successful years consolidating the support of white evangelicals, the magazine’s lofty stand would finally trigger a fatal exodus by this crucial demographic. The magazine’s website, apparently buckling under the unusual spate of traffic, was down for part of the evening, but that did not stop the avalanche of coverage on television, news sites and social media. “This is mainstream evangelical Christianity leadership,” remarked CNN’s Wolf Blitzer, reading segments of the “amazing” editorial on the air.
[ Read more: Christianity Today’s call for Trump’s ouster roils the evangelical waters ]
For many outsiders, Christianity Today seems to speak for millions of evangelicals. After all, the magazine was founded by Billy Graham, the pastor to presidents since Eisenhower. A pro-impeachment editorial would appear to be a game-changer — undermining the seemingly unmovable support for the president among white evangelicals.
That assumption, though, profoundly misapprehends American evangelicalism in the Trump era.
Since his 2016 election, in which 81 percent of white evangelicals voted for him, Mr. Trump continues to enjoy their unwavering loyalty. Three-quarters of white evangelicals approve of his job performance, and 80 percent of them remain opposed to impeaching him.
While many conservative evangelicals respect Christianity Today, it is read by a small slice of them, and is unlikely to make any significant dent in the president’s remarkable popularity. As even Mr. Galli conceded to The Atlantic’s Emma Green, “We speak for moderate, center-right, and center-left evangelicals. The far right — they don’t read us.”
The “far right” to which Mr. Galli referred is actually the dominant force in American evangelicalism, and it is stubbornly in Mr. Trump’s corner. It did not take long after the editorial was published for the president’s staunchest evangelical defenders, including Billy Graham’s son, Franklin, to react.
Writing on Facebook, Mr. Graham reproached the magazine for invoking his father’s name to support its position, maintaining that his father, who died in 2018, had supported Mr. Trump as “the man for this hour in history for our nation.” He even accused the magazine of being “used by the left for their political agenda,” and representing “the elitist liberal wing of evangelicalism” — a smear taken up, not surprisingly, by the president himself in a tweet.
As I reported the same day the editorial was published, Mr. Trump’s evangelical supporters have built a powerful network of political organizations, prayer warriors, televangelists, religious media, mega-churches and voter identification and mobilization efforts — a sprawling spiritual army with multifaceted battalions — that is defending him in the face of impeachment.
In this insular ecosystem, the president is seen as a divinely anointed leader, sent by God to save America at a critical moment in history, when, supporters claim, their religious freedom is under attack by secularists. For these evangelicals, the facts that Mr. Galli pleaded with them to assess are “fake news” planted by “deep state,” and even satanic enemies of the anointed president.
[ Read more: Friends of Christianity Today back anti-Trump editorial ]
Mr. Trump’s evangelical followers believe he will prevail because their prayers will vanquish the work of his enemies. In a recent conference call for the One Voice Prayer Movement, formed specifically to mobilize prayer warriors for the president, the televangelist Paula White, a top adviser to the White House Faith and Opportunities Initiative, prayed that “any persons, entities, that are aligned against the president” be “exposed and dealt with and overturned by the superior blood of Jesus.”
But Mr. Trump’s support is not just about anointings and prayers. It is also about personnel, policy and law — in other words, a government led by Christians who will undo, for example, advances in L.G.B.T.Q. rights. The Christian right enjoys not just regular and frequent access to the president, but virtual carte blanche on dictating policy, as top ideologues have been placed in cabinet positions and other political appointments in federal agencies.
Ralph Reed, a leading evangelical activist and supporter of Mr. Trump, has boasted to his followers, “There are more Christians serving” in the Trump administration “than all previous presidents combined.”
Mr. Trump’s evangelical defenders may truly believe he is anointed, or they may just relish the unparalleled authority he has granted them. Either way, this actual mainstream of American evangelicalism is not likely to give up on its divine leader, or on its newfound power, no matter what the impeachment proceedings uncover.

Texto completo: Readers respond to a front-page article on party members' unceasing fealty to the president.
To the Editor:
"Republican Party Under Trump Offers 2 Options: All In, or Out" (front page, Dec. 22) may be the catalyst for finding out why the Republicans are indebted to President Trump, who has, among other things, insulted his fellow Americans; cajoled and criticized his ally Mitch McConnell; lied about many subjects, including his impeachment; flattered America's most untrustworthy adversaries, Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong-un; and forced many Republicans not to seek re-election.
Yet he continues to hold a majority of the Republican Party captive, afraid to criticize his bizarre comments on Twitter or comment on his hateful speech.
We have allowed the bully to prevail -- and continue to do so.
Here is an immoral person with little concern for his fellow man or for the country he represents. A man who is putting our country at risk and into much debt. Will it lead to the bankruptcy that he has often faced?
What is his hold? Why do those who remain loyal to his whims stay?
Most of us do not understand what is happening. How do we convince his most ardent supporters that many of the president's choices undermine us all?

To the Editor:
I can understand that Republicans who wish to remain in office feel they must support the president no matter what he does. I am sorry that they choose party over country, but at least their fear and their motivation are clear to me.
What I can't understand is the silence of those who choose to leave or are forced out. These are the people who could begin to crack the veneer of the president's so-called power. And his abuse of power. They could be a voice for truth and decency.

To the Editor:
As a 15-year-old, I am terrified by how much control President Trump has over an entire party.
I've learned in school about how American government is supposed to work, about its founding ideals and the beauty of American democracy. I was looking forward to exercising my right to vote and being a part of my country's governance, but articles like these show how our governing system has become corrupted to the point that it is no longer functional.
Although I'm too young to vote right now, decisions are being made that affect me. I'll have to deal with the effects of climate change and our broken democracy, and I'm already living with constant fear of mass shootings, worsened by the metal detectors I walk through each day I go to school.
It concerns me that the current situation precludes our elected representatives from doing what they think is right, and that one person alone is able to exert so much influence.
It makes me more scared of the future than I already am.

To the Editor:
Progressives and moderates hold in their hands the key to ending President Trump's lock on the Republican Party.
Democrats, Greens and other like-minded citizens should -- en masse -- change their officially registered affiliation to Republican. Such a collective move would restore balance by diluting right-wing influence in closed primaries. Those who make the switch will still be able to vote for candidates from any party in general elections.

Texto completo: HAWORTH, N.J. - Opeyemi Sowore watched the videos on her phone in bed in her New Jersey home, the children still asleep, the Christmas tree twinkling downstairs.
The videos showed her husband - a former presidential candidate and the publisher of a website known as Africa's WikiLeaks - being wrestled to the floor in a Nigerian courtroom by a man in a black suit as lawyers in wigs and gowns crowded around shouting.
The court had ruled that her husband, Omoyele Sowore, should be free on bail while awaiting trial on charges of treason, money laundering and, for criticizing President Muhammadu Buhari on television, cyberstalking. But on Dec. 6, while his wife slept more than 5,000 miles away, Omoyele Sowore was taken from the courtroom back into detention, where he has been held for nearly all of the past five months.
Before he was led away by Nigeria's equivalent of the Secret Service, he was videotaped saying that these "might be my only words on record before they kill me." His wife has had no contact with him since.
When Buhari was elected in 2015 as president of Nigeria, Africa's most populous country and largest economy, it was hailed as a triumph for democracy. Since then, however, his government has turned toward authoritarianism, putting the country's thriving civic organizations and news media to the test.
Protests have been met with deadly force. The country's chief justice was summarily sacked. Humanitarian organizations that criticize the state were threatened with closure, and newspaper offices were raided. One journalist, Jones Abiri, has been in detention so long that for a time, he was thought to be dead.
One bill now making its way through Nigeria's Senate proposes the death penalty for some instances of "hate speech." A second, the Anti-Social Media Bill, modeled on a new Singaporean law, calls for government critics to spend as much as three years in prison.
Nigeria is not alone in clamping down on freedom of expression. A punitive new security law in traditionally media-friendly Burkina Faso, a proposed hate speech measure in Ethiopia, a harsh crackdown in Tanzania, and routine internet and social media shutdowns across Africa point to a wider trend toward censorship.
"The people in power just don't want to have to tolerate the voices of the people," said Ayisha Osori, head of the Open Society Initiative for West Africa.
African leaders feel emboldened to strangle the news media because of a perceived global rollback in democracy, she said.
Sowore founded a website in 2006, Sahara Reporters, that specializes in exposing corruption and government malfeasance. With funding from U.S. foundations and about 50 staff members working in Nigeria and the United States, the site's publication of leaked, often unfiltered information disrupted Nigeria's traditional media scene.
By basing his operation in New York, Sowore for years had a degree of protection from the consequences of publishing often scandalous information about Nigeria's most powerful people. He shuttled between his family home in New Jersey and Nigeria, where he is a citizen, without much interference.
Then on Aug. 3, in the middle of the night, he was arrested by Nigeria's Department of State Services, or DSS, in his Lagos hotel room.
At first, Opeyemi Sowore told no one in Haworth, a well-off suburb about 20 miles from midtown Manhattan, about her husband's arrest. None of them knew much about Nigeria, or what her husband, known as Yele, did for a living. As far as they were concerned, he was just a dad and a keen funner.
One day, though, texting with another mother with children at the local school, she explained why her husband had been away so long.
Word traveled fast in Haworth, a town of 3,500 people.
"One mom told another mom, told another mom, told another mom, and next thing we knew we had assembled what really is functioning as a crisis management team," said Alanna Zahn Davis, one of the mothers in that chain.
If Buhari's government had gotten tough, so would Haworth.
A core group of 10 women raised the alarm at the State Department. Then they reached Amal Clooney, the human rights lawyer, who demanded Sowore's release. They worked with Amnesty International, which declared him a prisoner of conscience.
Sometimes they prepared meals for Opeyemi Sowore, a marketing executive, or looked after the couple's two children. Inspired by an U.S. tradition of using yellow ribbons to remember hostages, they held "Yele ribbon" ceremonies in Haworth's treelined town center, attended by hundreds of people.
After the courtroom melee, they called members of Congress, engaging New Jersey Sens. Robert Menendez and Cory Booker. On Friday six members of Congress sent a letter to Nigeria's attorney general condemning the treatment of Sowore.
His detention "will only serve to tarnish Nigeria's international reputation and its standing as a leading African democracy," they wrote.
La Keisha Landrum Pierre, Sahara Reporters' chief operating officer back in New York, said the Nigerian government had frozen the site's financial account.
"There have been armed DSS men standing outside our offices" in Nigeria, Landrum Pierre said in between calls and meetings in Manhattan. She had to cut the staff by 70% and said that most of the remaining employees, feeling intimidated, were staying at home.
On Dec. 6, the court scheduled Sowore's trial for February, but he did not remain free on bail as previously ordered. Instead, his lawyers and family maintain, DSS agents attacked him in the courtroom and ultimately took him back into custody.
The DSS said in a statement that it had rearrested Sowore because of public comments it claims he made the prior night promising to pursue his cause. A DSS spokesman also contended that Sowore's supporters had staged the courtroom attack and were trying to frame its agents.
Opeyemi Sowore said watching the videos made her afraid for his life.
"The hardest part about it for me was, how do I tell my kids?" she said.

Texto completo: Headnote WORTHLESS. GUTLESS. LOSER.'
Mayor Satya Rhodes-Conway's inbox makes abundantly clear how personally venomous local politics has become.
"'Fat,' 'sick,' 'worthless,' 'gutless,' 'loser,' " she said, reciting some of the insults that have been leveled at her since becoming mayor of Madison, Wisconsin, in April.
She got a taste of the animo sity during her campaign, when she was criticized on blogs and social media not for her plans for housing, stormwater management or transportation, aut for not wearing makeup.
"People are angry, or airaid, and express themselves in mean ways," she said.
Rhodes-Conway is not alone in facing this type of abuse. As many as 79% of mayors in the United States report being the victim of harassment, threats or other psychological abuse, according to a recent study. Thirteen percent also reported instances of physical violence.
And one factor - gender - stood out above all others as a predictor of whether a mayor would be targeted. Using a statistical analysis that took in:o account factors like time in office, the researchers concluded that female mayors were more than twice as likely as their male counterparts to experience psychological abuse and almost three times as likely to experience physical violence.
The study, published in the academic journal State and Local Government Review, and interviews with current and former mayors, lay bare tocay's harsh political climate, in which threats of violence over social media are constant and speaking out can be perceived as a political weakness.
"We're seeing more women get elected into political office everywhere at the same time that there are increasing threats against all public officials," said Mona Lena Krook, a political science professor at Rutgers University who was not involved in the study. "Men also face violence, but women face more, and more types of violence."
And the ease of making threats on social media is driving the abuse, said Sue Thomas of the Pacific Institute for Research and Evaluation, lead author of the paper.
"Social media is absolutely toxic to women politicians. It's much more virulent to me as a woman than as an out lesbian," said Annise Parker, who was mayor of Houston for three two-year terms. "Remarks about the way 1 look, what I weigh or how I dress - aspects of femininity - escalate in:o threats of physical violence."
And when Karen Weaver made history in Flint, Michigan, by becoming its first female mayor-amid aburgeoning water crisis in 2015 - she telieved that she would have more support to discuss the issues facing the city, she said.
On social media, she said, "Theywent after me like I wasn't a person and had no feelings or family."
In all, 16% of the 238 mayors who responded to the survey said their experiences of abuse had them thinking about leaving their office, suggesting that the toxic environment also threatens to scare off mayor s who are interested in long careers and higher political office.
"Folks who have everything it takes to succeed, win an election and be a terrific public servant, that's why they say no," said Christopher Cabaldon, mayor of West Sacramento, California, since 1998. He added that on social media it's "open season on politicians and their families. It definitely warps what our local democracy looks like."
He said that he had been able to remain in office for more :han two decades, in part, because he is single and has not faced the discomfort of having a spouse or relative aťacked.
"People don't know it until i hey experience it," said Parker, who в now the chief executive of the LGBTQ Victory Fund, which helps train candidates for office. "It doesn't keep people out, but it burns people out once they're in it."
For Heather McTeer Toney, the first woman and the youngest person, at 28, to serve as mayor of Greenville, Mississippi, the menace arrived in her mailbox, not her inbox.
The words were written on a yellow sheet of paper, torn off from a legal pad, in black, blue and red ink, and the ones that explicitly threatened rape were written in red. It was more disturbing in a way, she said, that someone took the time to write a letter and mail it.
"It's 15 years later, and I can still remember that," said McTeer Toney, who was also the first Black person in the post. "Trust me, this is something that I want to forget."
While the many threats against McTeer Toney never escalated into violent actions during her two terms in office from 2004 to 2012, the threat of violence is not an abstract concern. Last year, a white man physically abused the first Latino mayor of Burien, a Seattle suburb, at a block party. The person arrested was charged with a hate crime.
"Every time you leave your house, you have to run into a constituent," Krook, the political scientist, said by telephone from a conference in Uppsala, Sweden, where the study was discussed this month. "People at the local level are left more vulnerable to attack, and it's more likely that people can reach you."
Mark Barbee, 29, a restaurant server who leads Bridgeport, Montgomery County, a city of 5,000 about 20 miles northwest of Philadelphia, said he received death threats after winning election in 2017. City Council meetings have been especially contentious. His proposal for an anti-discrimination policy only increased the ire directed at him.
Barbee, a gay African American, said that the difficult times - during which some supporters told him his advocacy was "not worth your life" - forced him to contemplate leaving office.
The survey also found that mayors who are younger, in strong chief executive systems, and in larger cities were more likely to be affected by violence and abuse.
And then there is the political calculation that comes with speaking out about the abuse: Will the public be sympathetic to a mayor who is complaining?
"Politicians have an image to keep up," Krook said. "That's particularly hard for women. If you potentially show some weakness, people can really jump on that."
While in office, McTeer Toney, the former Greenville mayor, never spoke publicly of the threats she received and wondered if her neighbors thought the police patrols around her home were a waste of taxpayers' money.
"What's terrifying is that unless something bad happens," she said, "you sit in limbo wondering or waiting for the next threat to occur. It's never a matter of if, but when."
Many mayors seemed to have reluctantly accepted the abuse as part of serving in office but have come up with their own methods of coping.
Rhodes-Conway does not engage with the attacks that come over social media, but her office reads everything, she said. "If I were reading this every day, it would be just awful," she said.
Instead, she combats the barrage of nastiness by visiting coffee shops around the city, where she and her staff buy drinks for residents, many of whom arrive upset and talk for an hour. "Even when people disagree with me face to face, they are polite," she said.

California businesses at the breaking point due to minimum wage hikes

Texto completo: California’s minimum wage rises to $13 an hour on Jan. 1, and a number of its localities now have wage rates above $15 an hour.
Labor groups promised that $15 would be an economic boon for the state, while then-Gov. Jerry Brown worried that “economically, the minimum wage may not make sense.” The state’s experience with rapidly rising wage rates show the former governor was right to be concerned.
Consider the impact on the state’s full-service restaurant industry, which faces a double-whammy when the wage floor rises. California is one of a handful of states that doesn’t count tips towards an employee’s income; even if a server earns $300 on a Friday night, an effective wage rate of $60 an hour, his employer can’t count one cent of it towards the minimum wage requirement.
Restaurant owners are forced to give a raise to top-earning employees who take home far more than the minimum, with few options to offset the cost.
Paul Fraga, who announced he’s closing Sacramento diner Original Perry’s after more than 50 years in business, explained the dynamic. “For every dollar that [minimum wage] goes up, it costs me around $40,000…I can’t raise menu prices fast enough to compensate [for] that.” He added: “If they could sign a waiver, 99 percent of my servers would be against a minimum wage increase…”
Fraga isn’t alone in feeling the pinch from a rising minimum wage. Another affordably-priced option in town, the beloved Greek restaurant Opa! Opa!, announced that after 14 years in business it would be shuttering its doors. The owner said that since he first opened, prices have increased over 50 percent as a result of burdensome mandates placed on him by the state. Now, fourteen employees are left jobless right before the holidays.
These aren’t just anecdotes. Census Bureau data suggests the state’s restaurant owners have reacted to scaled-up wage costs by scaling back on hiring. In Los Angeles County, for instance, year-over-year full-service employment growth topped seven percent as recently as 2012; it’s fallen every year since then, and dipped below one percent in 2018. In Orange County, growth last year was near-zero.
A similar trend is seen statewide, with sub-one percent growth replacing five percent growth from as recently as 2013. In San Francisco County, stagnant growth turned negative last year, with the city losing nearly 1,000 restaurant jobs. A study published by Harvard University Business School and Mathematica examined the impacts of wage increases in the San Francisco Bay Area. The results were startling. The research found that each one dollar increase to the minimum wage resulted in a 14 percent increase in the likelihood that a 3.5 star (the median rating) restaurant would be forced to close.
Another study, recently released by my organization, found that in states like California with a high minimum wage for tipped employees, full-service restaurants hired 18 percent fewer tipped workers as a share of the workforce. In practice, that means full-service restaurants embrace self-service alternatives where the customer provides much of the service themselves. (The New York Times chronicled a trend in San Francisco of fine-dining restaurants adopting elements of fast-food style service models.)
Will California legislators wise up? Don’t hold your breath.
The state’s Future of Work Commission, which was assembled by the governor to examine future workplace challenges for employers and employees, is stacked with some of the very parties responsible for those challenges. SEIU president Mary Kay Henry, who co-chairs the governor’s commission, has overseen more than $100 million in spending on the Fight for $15, a policy that has forced countless employers to replace human employees with automated alternatives. Another commission member, labor activist Saru Jayaraman, has encouraged other states to follow California’s failed payment model for tipped employees. She’s been opposed in that goal by thousand of tipped servers, who understand the consequences for their own bottom line should their states make California’s mistake.
Gov. Newsom boasts that California is setting an example for the rest of the country to follow. He’s right; the state is showing the rest of the country why a $15 minimum wage is a bad idea.

Texto completo: The ongoing growth of the natural gas industry in Pennsylvania and nationally has helped to reduce carbon emissions by more than 10% since 2007, even though carbon output spiked by about 3.4% in 2018, according to the Rhodium Group, a private sector research firm that used data from the Energy Information Administration and several other sources.
Carbon dioxide is the most abundant greenhouse gas but it is less potent than methane - the natural gas that is being used to supplant coal for power production.
It takes far less methane than carbon dioxide escaping into the atmosphere to worsen atmospheric warming. But as the gas industry grows it is clear that state and federal regulators do not have a good handle on just how much methane leaks during gas extraction, processing and transportation.
Monday, The New York Times reported that a new satellite, the first designed to detect from space methane emissions on the ground, had recorded a record methane release from a well blowout in eastern Ohio that was more than twice as large as the driller’s estimate. Dutch and American scientists analyzed data from the February 2018 blowout and said it had released more than 120 metric tons of methane an hour for the 20 days that it took to plug the well.
That blowout was atypical. But if the driller and regulators did not know how much methane such a major event produced, that raises the question of how much methane escapes undetected during routine operations.
To help answer it, the Wolf administration has proposed a rule to tighten the state’s methane regulation. It would end an exemption for methane monitoring and repairs on low-producing wells, and would require regular inspections of production facilities regardless of the results of previous inspections.
It makes little sense to press natural gas as a partial answer to carbon pollution if regulators cannot restrict methane, which is more damaging to the atmosphere. Several major producers have agreed to the proposed rule. The administration should implement it quickly.

Texto completo: NEW YORK - A chat app that quickly became popular in the United Arab Emirates for communicating with friends and family is actually a spying tool used by the government to track its users, according to a newspaper report.
The government uses ToTok to track conversations, locations, images and other data of those who install the app on their phones, The New York Times reported, citing U.S. officials familiar with a classified intelligence assessment and the newspaper's own investigation.
The Emirates has long blocked Apple's FaceTime, Facebook's WhatsApp and other calling apps. Emirati media has been playing up ToTok as an alternative for expatriates living in the country to call home to their loved ones for free.
The Times says ToTok is a few months old and has been downloaded millions of times, with most of its users in the Emirates, a U.S.-allied federation of seven sheikhdoms on the Arabian Peninsula.
Government surveillance in the Emirates is prolific, and the Emirates long has been suspected of using so-called "zero day" exploits to target human rights activists and others.
Zero days exploits can be expensive to obtain on the black market because they represent software vulnerabilities for which fixes have yet to be developed.
The Times described ToTok as a way to give the government free access to personal information, as millions of users are willingly downloading and installing the app on their phones and blindly giving permission to enable features.
As with many apps, ToTok requests location information, purportedly to provide accurate weather forecasts, according to the Times. It also requests access to a phone's contacts, supposedly to help users connect with friends. The app also has access to microphones, cameras, calendar and other data.
A security expert who said he analyzed the app for the Times, Patrick Wardle, said that ToTok "does what it claims to do" as a communications app, which is the "genius" of the app if it is being used as a spy tool. "No exploits, no backdoors, no malware," he wrote in a blog post. The app is able to gain insights on users through common functions.
In a blog post Monday, ToTok did not respond directly to Sunday's Times report, but said that with "reference to the rumors circulated today about ToTok," the one goal of the app's creators was to create a reliable, easy-to-use communications platform. The post said ToTok had high-security standards to protect user data and a privacy framework that complied with local and international legal requirements.
ToTok said the app was temporarily unavailable in the app stores from Google and Apple due to a "technical issue."
The Times says that based on a technical analysis and interviews with security experts, the company behind ToTok, Breej Holding, is most likely affiliated with DarkMatter, an Emirati cybersecurity company that has hired former CIA and National Security Agency analysts and has close business ties to the Emirati government.
Emails sent to ToTok through its website and to the Emirates embassy in Washington were not immediately returned.

Texto completo: Three readers take issue with Representative Jim Sensenbrenner's Op-Ed arguing that the impeachment process was hasty and partisan.
To the Editor:
Re "A Shamefully Hasty Impeachment," by Jim Sensenbrenner (Op-Ed, Dec. 21):
Please, Mr. Sensenbrenner, not more of the same rhetoric we heard over and over by a recalcitrant Republican Party during the impeachment hearings and right up to the vote.
How conveniently you leave out the fact that Republicans were also present at the closed-door hearings in the basement and had equal time to speak and question. And you have the audacity to ignore the overwhelming evidence put forward by highly credible witnesses (some appointed by your revered president).
The "vitriol and blind hatred" were certainly on display -- by the Republicans, who were determined to distract from the clear evidence presented, by yelling as loud and as often as possible "Hearsay!" as they attempted to turn the hearings into a circus.
Yes, Mr. Sensenbrenner, 63 million people voted for Donald Trump. But three million more voted for Hillary Clinton, and we finally had the satisfaction of witnessing this out-of-control president having to pay for his transgressions by being impeached and carrying that mark forever.
Ellen Shire
New York
To the Editor:
It was terrific that you gave Representative Jim Sensenbrenner the chance to express his views on the impeachment of President Trump. As he notes, by virtue of his experience, he is in a good position to comment.
I found what he had to say quite interesting, too. Suppose, then, that the Democrats, as he says, prioritized haste, robbed the president of his due process rights and made a mess. I would think then that he is also in a great position to see to it that we now do things right.
He could, for example, publicly urge his Republican colleagues in the Senate to show how to hold a fair and just trial, so Democrats, and indeed all Americans, can see how due process rights are honored. There would be no haste because each side would have the time to call witnesses with knowledge of the events.
The president could even testify himself and tell us, under oath, exactly why he has been falsely accused. Then the Senate jury can render a verdict, rather than have the quick trial that Senator Mitch McConnell is now promising.
If Mr. Sensenbrenner did that, he would perform a great service to the country, instead of just complaining about all the things he thought the Democrats did wrong.
Barry Rehfeld
New York
To the Editor:
Representative Jim Sensenbrenner must be trying to gaslight us. I remember the impeachment of Bill Clinton, too, and it was absurdly and blatantly political. It was undertaken for one reason: Republicans loathed Mr. Clinton, and Newt Gingrich in particular had a burning animus against him.
Donald Trump has committed crimes and misdemeanors that far outweigh Mr. Clinton's relatively insignificant perjury. If Mr. Sensenbrenner is trying to justify his vote to let Mr. Trump off the hook, he'll have to do a much better job than this.

Texto completo: Nothing to hide, nothing to fear? Think again.
The surveillance state is the stuff of dystopian novels and futuristic thrillers. Or, as revealed in the Video Op-Ed above, it's here now. With ad trackers on our phones, facial recognition cameras on our streets and N.S.A. agents listening in on our phone calls, Big Brother is watching.
Throughout 2019, The New York Times Opinion department's Privacy Project has been trying to make the conversation about privacy a little less boring, a little less complicated and a lot more real.
We keep hearing, "I've got nothing to hide" or "I can't actually do anything about it." But when the government fails to protect your privacy, it's up to you to set your limits.
It's time to decide: Are you really O.K. with being watched?

Justices Will Weigh In on Montana Conflict Over Aid to Religious Schools

Texto completo: The justices will hear arguments next month over whether states may erect walls between church and state high enough to exclude religious groups from some government benefits.
WASHINGTON -- Kendra Espinoza sends her daughters to Stillwater Christian School, in Kalispell, Mont. The girls are thriving, but the tuition bills are steep. Ms. Espinoza, a single mother, has worked three jobs, raffled off quilts and held yard sales to help make the payments.
She had also hoped to get some money from a state program enacted in 2015 "to provide parental and student choice in education." Soon after the program started, though, a state agency said students attending religious schools were not eligible.
Ms. Espinoza and two other mothers with children at Stillwater sued, and the Montana Supreme Court ruled against them, shutting down the entire program for all schools, religious or not.
The court relied on a provision of the state's Constitution that bars the use of government money to aid religious schools. Many state constitutions have similar provisions.
The United States Supreme Court will hear arguments in the case next month, and the justices will consider whether states are free to erect a wall between church and state high enough to exclude religious groups from some state benefits.
Ms. Espinoza and lawyers for the state agree on one thing: The case is a proxy battle over school choice.
"There's always that push to have every student in public education," Ms. Espinoza said.
Raph Graybill, chief legal counsel to Steve Bullock, the state's governor, agreed, to a point.
"I know there are a lot of human stories on the other side of this case," he said. "But I want to emphasize that this is personal to a lot of people in Montana."
"I'm a product of our public schools in Montana," he said. "I went to my local elementary school, publicly funded all the way, and ended up getting a Rhodes scholarship eventually. We have a great public school system, and the protection of that system is really at the heart of this case."
The central legal issue in the case, though, concerns the First Amendment's protection of the free exercise of religion. In 2017, in Trinity Lutheran Church v. Comer, the Supreme Court ruled that Missouri had violated the First Amendment by barring religious institutions from a state program to make playgrounds safer even though the state's Constitution called for strict separation of church and state.
"The exclusion of Trinity Lutheran from a public benefit for which it is otherwise qualified, solely because it is a church, is odious to our Constitution," Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. wrote for the majority.
At the same time, writing for four justices, Chief Justice Roberts emphasized the narrowness of the court's decision. "This case involves express discrimination based on religious identity with respect to playground resurfacing," he wrote. "We do not address religious uses of funding or other forms of discrimination."
A 2004 Supreme Court decision, Locke v. Davey, allowed Washington State to offer college scholarships to all students except those pursuing degrees in devotional theology. That case involved direct support for religion, Chief Justice Roberts wrote. Playgrounds, he argued, were a different matter.
The program at issue in the Montana case, Espinoza v. Montana Department of Revenue, No. 18-1195, is somewhere in the middle. It involves elements of religious instruction, but it does not concern a targeted exclusion of state support for vocational religious instruction.
The Montana program was financed by private contributions eligible for tax credits, and it provided scholarships to students in private schools. In Montana, that meant religious schools: 12 of the 13 schools that participated in the program were religious, and one was a school for children with disabilities. In one year, 94 percent of the scholarships went to religious schools.
The case has a curious element. The Montana Supreme Court struck down the entire program and so it is not obvious that it discriminated against religious groups.
No one contends that the state was required to enact the program in the first place. But the two sides differ about whether the state court was free to strike it down based on the State Constitution's prohibition of government aid to religion.
"The status quo ante is that the Legislature passed a choice program," said Richard D. Komer, a lawyer with the Institute for Justice, which represents Ms. Espinoza and the other plaintiffs. "Once it has passed a choice program, you have to ask, why has it been struck down?"
Mr. Graybill saw things differently. "It would be an odd outcome to say the First Amendment requires Montana to restart a program that doesn't exist and use that program to fund religious schools."
"You can't discriminate against churches because they are churches," he said. "But in a situation like the one the Montana Supreme Court faced, you have two choices: Offer a benefit neutrally or don't offer a benefit at all. Here they've gone a second a route."
Where Mr. Graybill saw neutrality, Ms. Espinoza detected bias.
"We're kind of seeing more of a push toward discrimination against people of religious backgrounds or religion in general," she said.
"There's nothing that says they have to have these programs available," she said. "But if the program was there and it was struck down simply so that people of religious faith could not access it, then that's discrimination."

Texto completo: The spill, which occurred after a crane toppled onto a barge, forced an emergency cleanup in one of the world's most revered natural destinations.
Hundreds of gallons of diesel fuel sank into the waters off the Galápagos Islands on Sunday after a crane toppled onto a barge and caused it to overturn, the authorities in Ecuador said, prompting an emergency cleanup in one of the world's most revered natural destinations.
The authorities said that 600 gallons were on the barge when it sank off San Cristóbal Island, threatening the nearby environment. They declared an emergency and said they had ordered an investigation.
It was not immediately clear how much fuel had leaked out of the ship, but photos posted on Twitter on Sunday by Ecuador's Ministry of the Environment showed officials with the Galápagos National Park and the country's Coast Guard on boats racing to contain the spill.
On Monday, Lenín Moreno, the president of Ecuador, said on Twitter that the spill was under control.
Dramatic video of the crane collapse shows workers trying to load a shipping container onto what appears to be a relatively small vessel called the Orca. As the crane hoists the container over the ship, the container comes crashing down onto the Orca, pulling the crane with it. The crane tumbles over the Orca and into the water, and the ship flips onto its side as people on board dive into the water.
It was not immediately clear if anyone had been injured in the episode or how significant the environmental damage was.
Government officials said in a statement on Sunday that emergency responders had placed hydrocarbon materials and containment barriers around the Orca to prevent leaks.
The Galápagos Islands, which are about 600 miles off the coast of Ecuador, are known for their role in inspiring Charles Darwin's theory of evolution after he visited there in 1835.
The islands have been designated a UNESCO World Heritage site. Their scenery and unique wildlife -- including marine iguanas, flightless cormorants and giant tortoises -- have made them increasingly popular with tourists, though scientists have warned that more visitors could threaten the area's fragile ecosystem.
Warming oceans increasingly threaten the islands. UNESCO has warned that they are one of the places most vulnerable to the effects of climate change.
Sunday's accident paled in comparison to a spill in the islands in 2001, when a tanker slammed into a reef off San Cristóbal Island and poured 150,000 gallons of diesel and bunker fuel into the water.
While winds sent much of the slick out to sea, sparing some Galápagos wildlife, scientists found that the population of marine iguanas on one island, Santa Fe, declined to 10,000 from 25,000 in the wake of the disaster.

Texto completo: My favorite podcasts of 2019 were those that seemed at first about one thing — Dolly Parton, the reality TV show “Cops,” the mysterious death of New York City punk rocker nearly four decades ago — and carried you away on tangents you never saw coming.
Which, mind you, is not to say I lost all of my ardor for the tried-and-true-crime podcasts, such as “In The Dark,” my favorite of 2018, which just this week resulted in the release on bail of Curtis Flowers, a Mississippi man tried six times who six times had his convictions overturned. There remain plenty of those, though I’ve perhaps become more discerning in my criminal tastes.
The list below presents the dozen podcasts that still resonate for me as the year comes to an end. They’re not in any particular order, so the numbers aren’t rankings, but the first two here are my favorites of the year.
1. Headlong: Running From Cops : Dan Taberski returned this year with his third great podcast in a row – “Surviving Y2K” and “Finding Richard Simmons” preceded this one – and this might be his best. A deep dive into the history of the reality TV series “Cops,” this podcast explores everything from the impact of the show on real-world policing to the way the series may interfere with the rights of the arrested in ways you’d never considered. Entertaining, and it makes you think.
2. The Ballad of Billy Balls : This podcast opens like a typical true-crimer – who killed punk rocker and small-time drug dealer Billy Balls in his East Village apartment in 1982 – but under the empathetic storytelling of host iO Tillett Wright it becomes something much more that incorporates love and grief, family and memory. Billy’s girlfriend Rebecca is an amazing presence throughout the podcast, which reveals one secret after another as Wright seeks the truth of the story.
3. 1619 : This podcast from the New York Times came on the 400th anniversary of the arrival of the first slaves in America. No dry history lesson, the anthology-style five-episode podcast looks at ways in which the impact of slavery has rippled across four centuries of our history tot he present day. Topics range from the economy to land ownership to health care. If you’d like to get a sense of it, dip your ears into the episode by the Times’ Wesley Morris who explores the ways in which black American music seeded every genre we listen to today — including yacht rock.
4. Dolly Parton’s America : Host Jad Abumrad grew up in Tennessee where Dolly Parton is everywhere, and, like many, he took her a little bit for granted. Then Abumrad noticed how in these divided times everyone from MAGA hat-wearers to drag queens loves Dolly, and he started to investigate. He got hours of interview time with Dolly, which is wonderful, but it’s the side trips into the stories of those who know her – in person, by her music, her career – that make this story a wonderful narrative about a singular woman.
5. Crime Beat: Mom vs. Murderer : The second season of this true-crime podcast by reporter Keith Sharon, our (full-disclosure) Southern California News Group colleague, tells the story of the murder of Cathy Torrez in 1994 and the 21 years her mother Mary Bennett fought to see the main suspect — who lived across the street — convicted. It’s a story about a terrible crime, the frustrating injustices of the justice system and a mother’s determination that her child not be forgotten.
6. Lost Notes : This anthology series from KCRW-FM/89.9 and host Jessica Hooper explores the lives and work of musicians in ways unlike any other podcast, digging deep into history and meaning with strong standalone narratives. A punk rock musician with a regional hit when he was 17 questions the sexism of its lyrics as a 56-year-old father. The sisters of the now mostly forgotten all-female rock band Fanny share their story. A writer narrates an audio letter to the musician Cat Power about the impact of her work on the lives of him and others. There are more in 2019’s second season.
7. The Clearing : April Balascio had feared for years that her father Edward Wayne Edwards was a murderer, and in 2009, her tip led to his conviction in a decades-old case. In this podcast, she teams with host Josh Dean to explore the legacy of her father’s life and crimes. These included more murders to which he admitted, several more that he likely committed and a few he almost certainly did not. It’s a fascinating tale of a sociopath father and a daughter brave enough to seek the truth.
8. Against The Rules with Michael Lewis : Writer Lewis is responsible for some of the great nonfiction of the past few decades with books such as “Moneyball,” “The Blind Side,” and “The Big Short,” all of which were adapted for film. This debut podcast brings his unique and questioning mind to the topic of fairness. He explores everything from sports to financial markets, law to media, and what happens in a world where fewer people accept the judgments of referees. Smart, funny, thought-provoking — what else you want?
9. Over My Dead Body:Tally : There’s a nasty divorce between two lawyers, and one of them ends up gunned down in the garage at his Tallahassee, Florida home. Host and co-reporter Matthew Shaer takes listeners through the story, which moves from a fairy-tale romance that made the New York Times to the split and crime that followed. This first season of the podcast makes it easy for listeners to come to their own conclusions about who is responsible, but justice isn’t so easily served.
10. Nice Try! : Host Avery Trufelman explores the history of intended utopian communities — the Jamestown settlement, the master-planned modernist city of Chandigarh, India, the Oneida religious commune in New York, among others — and why so often they have failed to find the perfection for which they were intended. Through history, architecture, culture, and beliefs, Nice Try! presents a cool new way of understanding the worlds in which we live.
11. The Thing About Pam : From NBC and “Dateline,” this Keith Morrison-hosted podcast peels back the layers of lies and deceit that led to the wrongful conviction of a Missouri man for the murder of his wife, and the ultimate discovery of whodunnit. “Saturday Night Live” used to skewer Morrison’s intimate style of narration, but it’s a pleasure indeed to listen to him tell this story, which never lags or feels padded like too many “Dateline” episodes do.
12. It’s a Pixies Podcast : The Pixies, one of the great modern rock bands, agreed to something few bands would consider and invited author-turned-podcaster Tony Fletcher into the recording studio for the weeks they worked on their new album, “Beneath The Eyrie.” It’s a fascinating look at the creative process, the collaborative nature of making a record, and the push-and-pull of personalities all working toward the goal of making music together. A must for Pixies’ fans, but almost as essential for fans of any band for the insights it delivers.

Texto completo: A Chinese researcher was arrested after he allegedly tried to smuggle vials of a “biological material” on a flight from the United States to Beijing.
Bags belonging to Zaosong Zheng, 29, were inspected on Dec. 9 at Boston Logan International Airport after agriculture specialists for Customs and Border Protection identified the Chinese national as “a high risk for possibly exporting undeclared biological material,” according to a redacted FBI affidavit.
Customs officers found 21 vials containing a brown liquid wrapped in a plastic bag and hidden in a sock. Officers also found a laptop belonging to a Chinese national whose name had been redacted from the affidavit.
“These vials contacted what appeared to be biological materials that were not properly declared or packaged for transportation in a commercial aircraft,” the affidavit said.
Officers approached Zheng before he boarded the plane to Beijing and asked if he was traveling with any biological or research materials. Zheng denied doing so but later acknowledged the bags carrying the vials were his.
When asked why he had not declared the vials, Zheng said, "They were not important and had nothing to do with his research,” according to court documents. He said he received the vials from a friend, Zhang Tao, but had no explanation for why he was taking them out of the U.S.
The affidavit said Zheng confessed to stealing eight vials from a research lab at Beth Israel Hospital, and no one else was aware he had done so. He said he had replicated 11 vials based on research by Tao.
“Zheng stated that upon his return to China, he was planning to immediately go to his lab in China and begin working on his research using the stolen vials. Zheng explained that if the results of his research were successful in any way that he planned to publish a paper in his name,” the affidavit said.
Zheng said he was carrying the laptop in his suitcase because it did not fit in the luggage of the person whose name had been redacted. The FBI said they found what appeared to be research material on the device.
He has been charged with making false statements to U.S. Customs. He remains in custody.
The biological samples are being examined, and their contents are not yet known.
In November, the New York Times reported that the FBI and the National Institutes of Health are trying to root out scientists suspected of stealing biomedical research for other countries. Nearly all of the incidents they under investigation involved scientists of Chinese descent.

Re "A Defense of Cursive, From a 10-Year-Old National Champion" (news article, nytimes.com, Dec. 17):
One of the vivid pleasures of my childhood is starting first grade and feeling excited that I would get to write on the blackboard. (It was 1950 so computers were not an option.) I loved making the letters. At the time, it didn't matter what I was writing; it was the physical act of shaping the letters that I liked.
Computers are practical, and I use one, but I have never felt any physical pleasure in tapping a keyboard.

Texto completo: Readers across the political spectrum praise an Op-Ed by four conservatives who are mounting a campaign against Trumpism.
To the Editor:
Re "Conservatives Against Trump," by George T. Conway III, Steve Schmidt, John Weaver and Rick Wilson (Op-Ed, Dec. 19), announcing their Lincoln Project, an effort to preserve American values and defeat the president:
I used to be a conservative and a Republican. Now I'm neither. However, the eloquent statement by four highly respected Republicans makes me look back at my past with less embarrassment.
The Party of Lincoln is no more. Craven Trumpistas, in and out of government, have made it a cult of personality. The president makes me squirm every time he goes abroad, and his party members fear to call him out lest they be primaried.
May the Lincoln Project stiffen the spines of real Republicans -- those who realize the only way to save the Grand Old Party, and our country, is to work for its defeat next year.
Harald M. Sandström
Bloomfield, Conn.
The writer is a former politics professor at the University of Hartford.
To the Editor:
I am one of those many who sadly suffer from what Michelle Goldberg recently described as "democracy grief." This Op-Ed article has lifted my spirits enough to be once again galvanized for hope and action. The authors' eloquent words are inspiring and appreciated in a time of terribly dangerous darkness for our country.
I am a Democrat, by the way, and deeply hope that I would place patriotism over party, as they have, were these horrors being visited upon us by a Democratic president. I thank them for their noble and important work promised over the next 11 months. I would like to learn about any ways in which ordinary people like me can be involved.
Lisa Sherwood
Trumbull, Conn.
To the Editor:
Finally, real conservatives are emerging to assume their very important role in the American democratic republic! I am a staunchly independent voter and have been searching for true conservatives to balance the far-left trend in the Democratic Party. The Lincoln Project founders and members are fine examples of true patriotism; they are putting country above party and deferring a short-term power play for long-term conservative principles.
Just as our Constitution established a balance of power, I believe that each party provides a necessary balance to each other. The absence of true conservatives in our political discourse has had terrible consequences.
Welcome back!
Elaine C. Herda
Sarasota, Fla.
The writer is a moderator for Better Angels, whose goal is to depolarize America.
To the Editor:
What a wonderful, thoughtful, well-written Op-Ed. I am a Democrat, but I would consider supporting Republicans of principle who are not afraid to let go of President Trump's coattails and gigantic tie and stand up for what they believe in.
Diana Westgate
Pittsfield, N.H.
To the Editor:
Thank you to the founders of the Lincoln Project. Today I am feeling hope for the first time in a long time. As a former Republican, I am proud to observe the old spirit of the party emerge to save our nation from foreign and domestic tyranny. I feel the spirit of America rising deep within me once again. National pride has always been at the forefront of our ability to defeat our adversaries.
Common sense and decency must prevail in this fight, the most serious and crucial of our country. Without it, I fear we are destined to lose what we have enjoyed and fought for over 200 years. In my 81 years on this planet, I have lived through many wars. This is a war that has to be won.

Lessons from Watergate on what impeachment should be for

Texto completo: After working nights and weekends in an attempt to throw President Trump out of office before the voters can re-elect him, House Democrats declined to send their two articles of impeachment over to the Senate. Instead, they recessed for the holidays and left town.
It looks like everybody got something out of it. Nancy Pelosi got a growling rebuke of the president to satisfy her far-left squad and calm the terrified incumbents who live in fear of a primary challenge from a squad wannabe in their own districts. Adam Schiff got the cover of Los Angeles magazine. And President Trump received a most unlikely Christmas present, Republican unity. He’ll also unwrap fundraising totals for the fourth quarter that will be higher than Trump Tower.
The week featured a lot of thundering about history, and a lot of wailing over what some people think is the unprecedented polarization in our country.
It’s not unprecedented. Drop by the Richard Nixon Library in Yorba Linda and walk through exhibits that bring to life the bitter divisions during the Vietnam War. There you can see a real impeachment inquiry, in a National Archives curated gallery that chronicles the events known as Watergate.
On display is a photograph of a page in an address book. It was the first hint of what would come from the 1972 break-in at the Democratic National Committee headquarters at the Watergate complex in Washington.
The address book belonged to one of the Watergate burglars. On the page marked “H” was the phone number of E. Howard Hunt’s White House office. But why?
The answer would eventually lead to a House Judiciary Committee vote to recommend three articles of impeachment, and to Nixon’s resignation. It’s often said that the cover-up was worse than the crime. You should see what Nixon was covering up.
In May 1971, the White House planned a “dirty tricks” operation. With Nixon’s knowledge, aides hired Donald Segretti to recruit operatives to disrupt Democratic rallies, forge letters on Democratic campaign stationery, and infiltrate rival campaigns with spies. In December 1971, Nixon authorized a phony “write-in” campaign for Sen. Ted Kennedy in the New Hampshire primary, to try to pull votes away from then-frontrunner Sen. Ed Muskie.
These operations were already underway when a former Pentagon analyst named Daniel Ellsberg, who had come to oppose the Vietnam War, leaked a classified study of America’s involvement in Vietnam. The Pentagon Papers were published in the New York Times in June 1971.
Nixon believed he was facing a conspiracy by holdovers from the previous administration who were trying to sabotage his Vietnam policy. He ordered a top aide to have the Internal Revenue Service launch special audits of “political enemies” on a list. The IRS Commissioner and the Treasury Secretary refused to launch the audits, but the attempt was later cited by the House Judiciary Committee.
The House also noted Nixon’s July 1971 order for an investigation into civil servants at the Bureau of Labor Statistics, when he thought they were intentionally misrepresenting monthly unemployment figures and demanded to know how many Jews worked in the unit. That was in the articles of impeachment, too.
In August 1971, the White House asked the FBI to find dirt on CBS News correspondent Daniel Schorr, but the bureau mistakenly thought the president wanted to appoint Schorr to a federal job and conducted a background-check interview. When Schorr complained, the White House put him on the list for IRS harassment, and the House later put that in the second article of impeachment.
In September 1971, the White House “Plumbers” (plumbers stop leaks) broke into the office of Daniel Ellsberg’s former psychiatrist to try to find the confidential notes he had refused to give the FBI.
In early 1972, G. Gordon Liddy and E. Howard Hunt pitched a plan to Attorney General John Mitchell for a $1 million program of counterdemonstrations, bugging and break-ins at the headquarters of the eventual Democratic nominee for president, the convention hotel in Miami, and the DNC headquarters at the Watergate in Washington, D.C. Mitchell told the finance chair of the Nixon re-election campaign to give them $250,000.
The Watergate burglars were caught in June 1972. When the FBI began to trace the money found in the burglars’ hotel rooms, President Nixon ordered the CIA to mislead the FBI into thinking the Watergate break-in was a CIA operation. Hush money was paid to the burglars from the White House’s secret $350,000 political fund.
In November 1972, Nixon won re-election in a landslide, carrying 49 states and 60.7% of the popular vote. But slowly the cover-up was unraveling. Judge John J. Sirica was overseeing a grand jury investigation, the CIA decided to tell the FBI that the burglary wasn’t their operation, Washington Post reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein reported doggedly on the story, and by early 1973, some of the conspirators were cooperating with prosecutors.
There were guilty pleas and convictions in the first trial, and the Senate voted unanimously to form a Select Committee on Watergate. Nixon passed up a chance to end the cover-up and decided that finding a million dollars in hush money for E. Howard Hunt was the better choice.
White House firings, resignations and denials followed. In May 1973, Watergate Special Prosecutor Archibald Cox was hired, and in October, Nixon ordered his firing. The attorney general and deputy attorney general resigned.
In March 1974, Judge Sirica handed over the grand jury materials to the House of Representatives, and in July the Judiciary Committee voted to recommend three articles of impeachment. In August, the public got the first look at transcripts of Oval Office tapes that Nixon had tried to keep secret. The nation learned that Nixon had ordered the CIA to obstruct the FBI’s investigation. Support for the president collapsed. He resigned on August 9, 1974.
A walk through the Watergate gallery at the Nixon Library shows the hazards of abusing the powers of the CIA, FBI and IRS to go after political enemies. But it’s not Trump who did that.
After a number of investigations, we have learned that during the Obama administration, the IRS targeted conservative groups and the FBI misled the FISA court to get authorization to wiretap a Trump adviser. The CIA’s actions are currently under investigation by special prosecutor John Durham.
One day, history will judge the House of Representatives’ vote to impeach President Trump. Maybe we’ll find out that the House’s aim was off by one president.

Texto completo: After working nights and weekends in an attempt to throw President Trump out of office before the voters can re-elect him, House Democrats declined to send their two articles of impeachment over to the Senate. Instead, they recessed for the holidays and left town.
It looks like everybody got something out of it. Nancy Pelosi got a growling rebuke of the president to satisfy her far-left squad and calm the terrified incumbents who live in fear of a primary challenge from a squad wannabe in their own districts. Adam Schiff got the cover of Los Angeles magazine. And President Trump received a most unlikely Christmas present, Republican unity. He’ll also unwrap fundraising totals for the fourth quarter that will be higher than Trump Tower.
The week featured a lot of thundering about history, and a lot of wailing over what some people think is the unprecedented polarization in our country.
It’s not unprecedented. Drop by the Richard Nixon Library in Yorba Linda and walk through exhibits that bring to life the bitter divisions during the Vietnam War. There you can see a real impeachment inquiry, in a National Archives curated gallery that chronicles the events known as Watergate.
On display is a photograph of a page in an address book. It was the first hint of what would come from the 1972 break-in at the Democratic National Committee headquarters at the Watergate complex in Washington.
The address book belonged to one of the Watergate burglars. On the page marked “H” was the phone number of E. Howard Hunt’s White House office. But why?
The answer would eventually lead to a House Judiciary Committee vote to recommend three articles of impeachment, and to Nixon’s resignation. It’s often said that the cover-up was worse than the crime. You should see what Nixon was covering up.
In May 1971, the White House planned a “dirty tricks” operation. With Nixon’s knowledge, aides hired Donald Segretti to recruit operatives to disrupt Democratic rallies, forge letters on Democratic campaign stationery, and infiltrate rival campaigns with spies. In December 1971, Nixon authorized a phony “write-in” campaign for Sen. Ted Kennedy in the New Hampshire primary, to try to pull votes away from then-frontrunner Sen. Ed Muskie.
These operations were already underway when a former Pentagon analyst named Daniel Ellsberg, who had come to oppose the Vietnam War, leaked a classified study of America’s involvement in Vietnam. The Pentagon Papers were published in the New York Times in June 1971.
Nixon believed he was facing a conspiracy by holdovers from the previous administration who were trying to sabotage his Vietnam policy. He ordered a top aide to have the Internal Revenue Service launch special audits of “political enemies” on a list. The IRS Commissioner and the Treasury Secretary refused to launch the audits, but the attempt was later cited by the House Judiciary Committee.
The House also noted Nixon’s July 1971 order for an investigation into civil servants at the Bureau of Labor Statistics, when he thought they were intentionally misrepresenting monthly unemployment figures and demanded to know how many Jews worked in the unit. That was in the articles of impeachment, too.

Texto completo: Wednesday’s impeachment of Donald Trump was neither a surprise nor a turning point. We’ve known for weeks that the House would vote to impeach. We also know that a Republican-controlled Senate won’t convict Trump and remove him from office; it may not even pretend to consider the evidence. So it would be easy to be cynical about the whole thing.
But that’s not how it felt. For me, and no doubt for millions of citizens, Wednesday was a very emotional day - a day of both despair and hope. The reasons for despair are obvious. We could so easily lose everything America is supposed to stand for. The birthplace of liberty may very well be just months away from abandoning all its ideals.
But there were also reasons for hope.
The enemies of freedom are, it turns out, as shameless and corrupt here as they are in nations, from Hungary to Turkey, in which democracy has effectively collapsed. But the defenders of American democracy seem more united and determined than their counterparts abroad. The big question is whether that difference - that true American exceptionalism - will be enough to save us.
Let’s look at what we’ve learned about America over the past three years.
There was never any doubt that Trump would abuse his powers; he telegraphed his contempt for rule of law, his eagerness to exploit his office for personal gain, right from the start. For a while, however, it was possible to imagine that at least part of his party would stand up for democratic principles.
But it was not to be. What we saw Wednesday was a parade of sycophants comparing their leader to Jesus Christ while spouting discredited conspiracy theories straight from the Kremlin. And as they did so, the object of their adoration gave an endless, rambling, third-world-dictator-style speech, full of lies, that veered between grandiosity and self-pity, interspersed with complaints about how many times he has to flush his toilet.
Republicans, in other words, are beyond redemption; they’ve become just another authoritarian party devoted to the leader principle. Like similar parties in other countries, the GOP is trying to rig future elections through gerrymandering and voter suppression, creating a permanent lock on power.
But if Trump’s supporters look just like their counterparts in failed democracies abroad, his opponents don’t.
One of the depressing aspects of the rise of authoritarian parties like Hungary’s Fidesz and Poland’s Law and Justice has been the fecklessness of their opposition - disunited, disorganized, unable to make an effective challenge even to unpopular autocrats as they consolidated their power.
Trumpism, however, faced determined, united, effective opposition from the beginning, which has been reflected both in mass marches and in Democratic electoral victories. In 2017 there were only 15 Democratic governors, compared with 35 Republicans; today the score is 24 to 26. And last year, of course, Democrats won a landslide victory in House elections, which is what made the impeachment hearing and vote possible.
Many of the new Democratic members of Congress are in Republican-leaning districts, and some observers expected a significant number to defect Wednesday. Instead, the party held together almost completely. True, so did its opponents; but while Republicans sounded, well, deranged in their defense of Trump, Democrats came across as sober and serious, determined to do their constitutional duty even if it involved political risks.
Now, none of this necessarily means that democracy will survive. Even as they have been losing elections, Republicans have been consolidating control over the courts and other national institutions. Democratic leaders in Congress have been unexpectedly, even shockingly impressive; the Democratic presidential field less so.
And the unity of purpose we saw Wednesday may not hold next November. If Democrats nominate a progressive like Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders, will wealthy Democrats decide that defending democracy is less important than keeping their taxes low? If the party nominates a moderate like Joe Biden, will some Sanders supporters express their frustration the same way they did in 2016, by staying home or voting for a third-party candidate? Given the stakes, I’d like to dismiss such concerns, but I can’t.
Add in the extent to which next year’s election will be rigged in Trump’s favor, both by voter suppression and by the skew introduced by the Electoral College - and the even greater skew created by a Senate map that gives small, mostly conservative states as much representation as liberal states with many times their population - and it’s all too possible that Trumpism will still triumph.
What we learned Wednesday, however, was that those who define America by its ideals, not the dominance of a particular ethnic group, won’t give up easily. The bad news is that our bad people are as bad as everyone else’s. The good news is that our good people seem unusually determined to do the right thing.

Texto completo: Cambridge Analytica scandal breaks March 17, 2018
The New York Times and The Guardian publish articles about how the political data firm with links to Donald J. Trump's 2016 presidential campaign had harvested personal information from the Facebook profiles of more than 50 million people. Aleksandr Kogan, an academic who used a personality quiz to harvest Facebook data for Cambridge Analytica: We were doing the project, collecting the data, and the idea was that there was basically a model where we could pass people's Facebook data -- their pages, "likes" -- through and generate predictions about their personalities and their politics.
But along the way we discovered that a lot of this data was not really useful as far as predictive accuracy. Even after delivering the data, we spent a lot of time trying to figure out if there is a way to make it better. We came to the conclusion that the answer is no.
In March 2018, The Times approaches Facebook after reviewing a copy of the data gathered by Cambridge Analytica and documents that showed the social network had sought to ensure the information was erased by Mr. Kogan, Cambridge Analytica and Christopher Wylie, one of the firm's co-founders. Facebook had until that point declined to acknowledge that Cambridge Analytica had collected the data.
The Times and The Guardian ran the story on Saturday. But my phone started to blow up Friday night. And the reason was that on Friday morning, Facebook took away my account. I just got logged out.
I asked my wife, "Can you, like, find me?" And she could not find me on Facebook. I was wiped off the planet. We had no idea why.
Then Friday evening, Facebook put out a press release saying it had banned Kogan, Cambridge Analytica and Wylie. They said we'd lied and engaged in fraud. So this was Facebook trying to pre-empt the articles The New York Times and The Guardian were about to run. And that opened up the floodgates.
At the time, Mr. Kogan believes that the revelations will not make a ripple.
I thought this was going to come and go: Who's going to really care? I completely made a mistake. Within a day, I was under siege. I was getting hundreds of emails from pretty much every media outlet in the world.
An old girlfriend of mine recently told me that when this all went down, her friends were coming to her and asking if she realized her ex-boyfriend had taken down the free world.
Tech giants had been running rampant for a decade, two decades, and now folks for the first time really cared. And that's what I think is the incredible, powerful legacy of Cambridge Analytica. It couldn't do anything useful with the data it collected. But because of the Trump connection, it did capture people's imagination. As told to MATTHEW ROSENBERG Congress grills Mark Zuckerberg April 10, 2018
Facebook's chief executive testifies before the Senate Commerce and Judiciary Committees about revelations that Cambridge Analytica had improperly used personal data from users' profiles. It foreshadows other questioning of tech executives. Senator John Thune, Republican of South Dakota, chairman of the Commerce Committee: He came in the day before the hearing. Of course he was very professional, had his team with him and talked a lot about, "We get it. We know we screwed up here and we want to fix it, and we're going to be a more responsible actor in the space."
It was just, sort of, to set the stage for what he said the next day.
He's not a real small-talk kind of guy. We joked a little bit because he was wearing a suit and tie. I don't think I'd ever seen him in a suit and tie before, so we made some observations about that. He kind of smiled and laughed and said it wasn't the first time he'd worn a suit and tie, or something to that effect. It was like, "So, where's the hoodie?"
At the public hearing on April 10, Mr. Zuckerberg says Facebook takes responsibility for its mistakes and will fix its problems.
We're not exactly sure what he meant by all that, because this is still an evolving story and there's still a lot of hands to play here. But I think he -- at least in that meeting and at the subsequent hearing -- was, I thought, very direct, very transparent, and genuinely sorrowful about what had happened and wanted to make it right.
On April 11, Mr. Zuckerberg testifies in front of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. Representative Greg Walden, Republican of Oregon, chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee: We do what we normally do doing these investigations. You send a letter, you ask specific questions, you set a deadline. And like some groups try to do, they send in staff or attorneys. And in this case, they send in staff or attorneys who said, "Oh, I don't know. I wasn't there then. Oh, I can't answer that. Yeah, I wasn't there then."
They didn't answer any of them. Because they couldn't, they said. Because they weren't there when X happened or Y happened. Well, that just made the case that we better know who was there. And who was in charge. And that'd be Mark Zuckerberg.
After the first break, I went back with him, and we were talking, and he was astonished at some of the comments and opening statements by the Democrats.
Just, "Are they always that way?" Kind of partisan. I said, "Yeah." It was one of those epiphany moments, I think, for him about where this could all head. As told to DAVID McCABE Europe shields personal data
May 25, 2018
The European Union enacts the General Data Protection Regulation, which provides sweeping new rights to keep companies from collecting and sharing personal data without an individual's consent. Helen Dixon, Ireland's data commissioner: We'd had a European-wide data protection law since 1995, but that was before the internet took off, pre the smartphone and pre many of the major apps and platforms that were to come in the 10 to 20 years that followed.
It didn't address social media and platforms. It was a law that required upgrading so that it could better regulate Big Tech. Vera Jourova, European commissioner for justice, consumers and gender equality, and a politician from the Czech Republic: My impression as somebody who lived half of their life in a totalitarian regime was that, in digital, the rights of the individual, and their ability to have under control their privacy, is very limited. I felt like people moved their lives to the digital sphere, but they didn't bring their rights with them.
With G.D.P.R., I knew we're doing something really big and something revolutionary. There must be respect of every individual that he or she must have the possibility to be the master of his or her privacy. Ms. Dixon: In March 2018, when the Cambridge Analytica story broke, it really opened up the minds of the public, politicians and others to the clear dangers of the misuse of personal data. That was a real turning point. Ms. Jourova: G.D.P.R. is an exercise of rebalancing power. I see it not only in terms of data protection, but also when we speak about the harmful content of the digital industry -- distributing terrorist content or child pornography or hate speech or disinformation that has the potential to distract societies and do public harm. Ms. Dixon: We said you had to really roll back here and start looking at the user at the center of this and what their rights are. It was being taken seriously from the perspective of defending against enforcement action and avoiding fines, as opposed to going back to first principles of protecting user privacy. Ms. Jourova: We are working intensively on exporting G.D.P.R. We have a deal with Japan now. We are advanced in negotiations with Korea. I was in Latin America some months ago. In Argentina and Chile, they are taking G.D.P.R. as a reference point. I am in intensive talks with some United States partners. As told to ADAM SATARIANO Google employees walk out Nov. 1, 2018
About 20,000 Google workers stage protests over how the company has given multimillion-dollar payouts to a former top executive, Andy Rubin, and other senior employees accused of sexual harassment. Claire Stapleton, a marketing manager at YouTube and protest organizer: The curious effect of the Andy Rubin story was that people started sharing stories of their own disillusionment or difficult experiences that they had had at Google. It was a huge conversation at Google that erupted.
I was closely following how the management responded to it, and I don't think that they met the sort of primal scream from the employee base with the accountability and urgency that we were asking for. So, I figured, you know what? Let's just make our voices a little bit louder, and even if we get 200 people to walk out, that would still make a statement.
That Friday night in the office, I sent an email to a group of moms at the company who had been sharing stories, with a link to a Google group for people who wanted to protest. When I woke up on Saturday morning, a couple hundred people had joined.
The idea of the walkout goes global.
Each office had their own rally, their own sort of way of going about it. In Singapore, they met in the cafe; in New York, we met in a nearby park. Mountain View, Calif., the site of Google's headquarters, was obviously the biggest one, and that was on campus. It happened at 11 a.m. local time, no matter what city or office you were in.
We were waiting in the park there. The park filled up. We had bullhorns, but they were so insufficient to project to the amount of people who came. People were shouting, "Time's up." People had signs.
It didn't necessarily feel like we were burning the place down from the inside. It felt like we were helping the company evolve. As told to KATE CONGER Meng Wanzhou is detained Dec. 1, 2018
Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer of Huawei and the daughter of its founder, is arrested in Vancouver, British Columbia, while in transit at the airport. Her arrest by the Canadian authorities at the behest of the United States kicks off a tech Cold War with China. Few principals are willing to discuss so sensitive a topic on the record, but the event can be reconstructed from court documents from Canadian immigration officials and law enforcement. 11:10 a.m.: During the disembarkation process border services officer Katragadda intercepted a female Hong Kong passenger Meng, Wanzhou.
He had concerns in regards to her admissibility to Canada. He conducted follow-up questions with her just outside the entry of the jetway.
(Sworn declaration of Officer Scott Kirkland, Canada Border Services Agency.) 1 p.m.: The subject was seeking entry to transit onward to Mexico City. The subject repeatedly asked why she had been selected for secondary inspection, and on this occasion, she had posed the same question to myself.
I asked Ms. Meng what she did for work. The subject stated that she was the chief financial officer (C.F.O.) of Huawei Technologies. The subject stated her father was the founder and current C.E.O. of the company. The subject went on to state that the company sold products in several countries around the world.
I asked the subject if her company sold products in the United States. The subject stated, "No we do not."
(Sworn declaration of Sanjit Dhillon, acting superintendent, Canada Border Services Agency.) 1:15 p.m.: Ms. Meng tells me she was stopped by U.S. immigration officials in New York four years ago. According to Ms. Meng the immigration officials told her she might have an issue with her visa. The officials took her to an interview room, and looked at her electronics.
(Sworn declaration of Officer Kirkland.) 2:04 p.m.: I have Ms. Meng provide me with the phone numbers for her cellphones.
She provides the PIN number for both phones as well.
(Sworn declaration of Officer Kirkland.) 2:12 p.m.: Talking to Meng in CBSA secondary room.
(Handwritten notes of Constable Dawn But, Royal Canadian Mounted Police.) 2:14 p.m.: So because in the United States, uh, you have committed fraud, uh, we're arresting you and then you will be sent back to the United States. Right, you.
(Constable But, in a transcript of an interview with Ms. Meng.) 2:21 p.m.: "You're saying, because of my company, you're arresting me," Meng Wanzhou said.
(Constable But, in a transcript of an interview with Ms. Meng) 3:04 p.m.: Cst. Dhaliwal seized (1) Huawei cellphone, (1) iPhone, (1) iPad/white rose gold, (1) pink MacBook, (1) Cruzer Glide 3.0 256 GB.
(Handwritten notes of Constable Gurvinder Dhaliwal, Royal Canadian Mounted Police.) 3:27 p.m.: Talked to company lawyer. Will find her a lawyer.

Texto completo: Democrats have one, too, and impeached the president on it.
President Trump's impeachment is the result of a conspiracy theory. Democrats and other supporters of the charges against Mr. Trump might be reluctant to accept that labeling. But a conspiracy theory is not necessarily crackpot or wrong: If the conspiracy is real, the theory may be correct.
Democrats are certain that President Trump, his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani and others really did conspire to get the government of Ukraine to open an investigation that would embarrass Joe Biden and thereby influence the 2020 presidential election.
Not a single House Republican was persuaded by this theory to vote for impeachment. A conspiracy, after all, is about not only acting in secret but also doing so for an illicit purpose. What President Trump and his associates did was not a crime in itself, but it could have been an abuse of power. Rival parties, however, can interpret almost anything their opponents do as an abuse of power -- and almost anything their own side does as innocent. Democrats had an obvious predisposition to find the president culpable; his own party had an equally obvious predisposition not to do so.
The combative attitude that Mr. Trump displays not only toward Democrats but also toward the media and much of America's own intelligence community may be an expression of his personality. But it is also his way of fighting back against what he perceives as a commonality of culture and interest, if not an outright conspiracy, on the part of those who object to the new course he aims to set in American politics -- in everything from international relations and trade policy to immigration and law enforcement.
The Trump years have seen rather too many conspiracy theories and counter-theories, when the reality is simply that President Trump and his voters want an America and a world that is very different from those their opponents want.
On the margins, one ex-Republican voted to impeach the president; two Democrats, one of whom switched parties the next day, voted against both articles of impeachment, while a third voted for the first article but against the second. Tulsi Gabbard, a Democrat running for president who nonetheless finds some support among antiwar Republicans, marked her vote as "present." Even these marginal cases reveal something of the overlap between party and a willingness to believe in the plot the Democrats laid out. Those who don't fit neatly into the parties fit less neatly into the impeachment vote, too.
If Republicans did not subscribe to the conspiracy theory behind the case for impeachment, they nonetheless have some conspiracy theories of their own, as does President Trump. The same July 25 phone call between President Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine that led a whistle-blower to allege that Mr. Trump was trying to get a foreign government to meddle in the 2020 election also revealed a belief on President Trump's part in a different kind of alleged conspiracy involving an American company, CrowdStrike. He asked Mr. Zelensky, apparently referencing the unsupported theory, to look into whether a computer server once belonging to the Democratic National Committee had wound up in Ukraine. In this view, it would have gotten there as part of a cover-up, aided by the company, of Ukraine's role in a 2016 hack of D.N.C. computers. (CrowdStrike investigated that hack and concluded, as most authorities did, that it was carried out by Russia.)
There is no evidence to support that theory, but the president seems to be sincere. Why would he believe the Crowdstrike-Ukraine story anyway? Presumably because it fits into a wider theory that Democrats and elements of the United States intelligence community conspired to sabotage Mr. Trump's 2016 campaign and thereafter his presidency. Mr. Trump has made clear he believes that F.B.I. investigations into alleged ties between his campaign associates and Russia were unjustified.
Democrats might have framed impeachment not about whether Mr. Trump wanted to solicit foreign interference in the 2020 campaign but whether he is too ready to buy into false conspiracy theories. That would not be a crime in itself, but it could be a serious enough matter to drive an impeachment effort, which is, after all, not a legal proceeding but a political one.
Quite apart from CrowdStrike or the lost contents of the private email server that Hillary Clinton used when she was secretary of state, President Trump is not wrong to question the investigations that have been directed against him and his associates and to wonder what role partisan innuendo played in supporting those investigations. In 2016, Mr. Trump's political enemies sought private intelligence -- "opposition research" -- that might damage his campaign, and one dossier purporting to connect Mr. Trump and his campaign to Russia that was put together by a former British spy, Christopher Steele, did play a role in F.B.I. requests for authority from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to wiretap the Trump campaign adviser Carter Page.
Intelligence agencies are meant to look for conspiracies, and in a sense they also trade in conspiracies. (Whether their activities are illicit depends in part on what exceptions to normal legal and moral rules you're willing to make in the name of an assumed greater good.)
There is a great deal to be concerned about when the barriers between politics and intelligence break down, and the mixture of elements involved in giving birth to the conspiracy theory that Mr. Trump and his campaign were tools of the Kremlin is troubling. Those elements include an intelligence community and foreign-policy elite predisposed to view as subversive dissent from their own traditional views on the proper relationship between the United States and states like Russia; opposition research firms whose roles in blackening reputations are little known or understood by the public; foreign intelligence operatives, past or present, like Mr. Steele, who may not be bound by the norms that apply to Americans with intelligence backgrounds; and a national media that may be biased against Republicans and in favor of the opinions of their sources in government and intelligence.
That Mr. Trump's agenda should be controversial and strongly opposed by those who disagree with him is to be expected. Sharp disagreements are not just proper but essential to a robust democratic system. However, especially where a transformative figure like Mr. Trump is concerned, it is important for those who resist the changes he would like to bring about to recognize that his sincere intentions are explanation enough for what he is doing. He does not have to be a Russian asset to do the things he is doing.
Political enemies will naturally impugn one another's motives. They can do that, holding their foes to be wrong and even wicked, without imagining that they are wrong or wicked only because they are part of a conspiracy behind the scenes. But even where intelligence is concerned, this season of impeachment would be a good occasion to remember the most serious lessons of Watergate. Richard Nixon's personal misdeeds paled in comparison to the intelligence community abuses uncovered by the Senate's Church Committee and the new spirit of suspicion about secret agencies' domestic activities, many of which were illegal and some of which were extraordinary abuses of human rights.
Conspiracy theories have been a feature of American politics since the beginning, as has the specter of foreign interference in our elections -- originally a reason to be vigilant against French and British influence. But the Trump years have been clouded by too many conspiracy theories and not enough open debate about differing visions for the country. These differences are the legitimate stuff of politics, and they are best worked out at the ballot box, because no investigation or impeachment can resolve them.

What friends are for; Trump needs a history lesson in how three Framers and a Frenchman forged an alliance to win the Revolutionary War

Texto completo: President Trump, it's clear, lacks the gifts of earlier U.S. presidents -- say, FDR or George H.W. Bush -- at forging international alliances. He pals around with autocrats and U.S. adversaries and squanders the goodwill of America's most loyal friends.
Consider Trump's initial cordiality with Emmanuel Macron. It dissolved as the U.S. president's "America First" unilateralism alienated his French counterpart. Sitting side by side at NATO's 70th anniversary celebration in London early this month, Macron and Trump were a study in chilly body language: "Tense," said the BBC; a relationship in "deterioration on live television," lamented the New York Times.
In the balance hangs the Franco-American alliance, the oldest in American history. Its origins stretch back to the infancy of the improbable republic declared in 1776 by disaffected British colonists in North America. Even before that year's Declaration of Independence, France had secretly provided supplies to the insurgent Continental Army.

That assistance had little to do with the promotion of Enlightenment-era values such as liberty and republican government. Rather, the kingdom of France was seeking revenge. Still smarting from its recent defeat by Britain in the Seven Years' War, the Bourbon court at Versailles saw in the American Revolution an opportunity to contribute to the defeat of a traditional enemy.
And yet it wasn't geopolitics alone that forged the connection. Just as personal ties among leaders secure, or threaten, our alliances today, the Franco-American bond was advanced by friendship -- notably, relationships between three Founding Fathers and a wealthy, high-born volunteer officer from France: Marie Joseph Paul Yves Roch Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette.
Without the mutual trust cultivated between Lafayette and successively George Washington, Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson, the American experiment might have ended in military defeat or failed in its quest for economic autonomy during its early years as a republic. The countless U.S. towns, streets, parks and schools bearing Lafayette's name commemorate his role in forging that Franco-American alliance.
Lafayette was just 19 years old when he arrived in America. A Patriot agent in Paris had promised him a commission as major general in Gen. Washington's army. Lafayette was wealthy enough to buy a ship to transport himself across the Atlantic, but when he presented himself to Washington in 1777, he'd never been in battle.
The commander in chief, aware of the marquis' influence and connections in France as well as his inexperience, accepted Lafayette's commission but refused him an actual command. Over time, however, the young officer, wounded at the Battle of Brandywine, won Washington's confidence and leadership of a division of the Continental Army.
Lafayette quickly became a symbol of Franco-American cooperation and a powerful advocate in his home country of the expansion of those links.
French assistance to the U.S. war effort, formalized in the Treaty of Alliance in 1778, eventually led to the mass deployment of French troops and its navy, and substantial loans. That assistance -- negotiated in Paris by a U.S. delegation led by Ambassador Benjamin Franklin -- proved decisive in the American victory.
Indeed, at the Battle of Yorktown in 1781, a Franco-American force of more than 15,000 soldiers and sailors -- including Lafayette -- forced the surrender of the army of Gen. Charles Cornwallis, Britain's chief commander, effectively ending the war.
Earlier that year, Washington had dispatched Lafayette to defend Virginia. He arrived just in time to spare the governor -- a beleaguered 38-year-old Thomas Jefferson -- the embarrassment of a second enemy raid on the state capital, Richmond, in a period of four months.
After Yorktown, Lafayette returned to France a war hero and a committed republican. Franklin, still in his ambassador's role but infirm, came to depend on the young officer as a surrogate in his diplomatic dealings with the French court. The Continental Congress later also sent Jefferson to Paris as an envoy (he would replace Franklin as ambassador), and between 1784 and 1789, Lafayette paved Jefferson's way in Parisian society and at the palace at Versailles.
The neophyte American diplomat was 14 years older than Lafayette, but the two shared similar backgrounds: Jefferson's native soil lay in Virginia's rural Piedmont. Lafayette hailed from the Auvergne, a mountainous region in south-central France that, even today, ranks among that country's least populated areas.
Both men were provincial aristocrats; neither was ever entirely comfortable amid the urbane precincts of their national capitals.
During Jefferson's Paris years, in letters to Philadelphia he and Lafayette each warned of the inadequacies of America's governing document, the Articles of Confederation. That pact had created such a weak national state that European leaders were hesitant to enter into commercial treaties with the fledgling republic. The Jefferson-Lafayette chorus from Paris strengthened the case of domestic leaders arguing for a stronger system of government, and the creation of the U.S. Constitution.
At the same time, Lafayette was plunging into the politics of his own country, serving in successive French national assemblies. Jefferson provided his friend with sound republican counsel, even serving as a sounding board as Lafayette drafted what became the French Revolution's signature document, the Declaration of the Rights of Man.
A frail Jefferson delivered his final public speech at a dinner in Virginia in 1824 honoring Lafayette: "When I was stationed in his country for the purpose of cementing its friendship with ours, and of advancing our mutual interests," he said, "this friend of both, was my most powerful auxiliary and advocate.... All doors of all departments were open to him at all times. In truth, I only held the nail, he drove it."
These men had their differences, and the Franco-American connection from the beginning faced challenges. But the Founders understood their republic would not succeed without allies. May Trump learn from their example, and reset the friendship that forged America's longest alliance.

Texto completo: On June 18, 2019, LNP celebrated its 225th anniversary.
The earliest newspaper to which today’s LNP traces its roots was the Lancaster Journal, first published on June 18, 1794, by William Hamilton and Henry Willcocks from a news office located in a tavern building at the King Street site of the current LNP building.
To celebrate 225 years of Lancaster newspapers, we present this series of 52 front pages from the history of the newspapers which would eventually become LNP.
------------
OMG it's Y2K
The notion that a computer glitch tied to the date would somehow lead to global unease that occasionally bordered on apocalyptic panic is the sort of thing that likely won’t make sense to anyone who didn’t live through it.
But that’s exactly what the Y2K scare was.
Founded on the very real possibility that the switch from ’99 to ’00 might cause glitches in computer systems that weren’t updated to account for the change, the scare quickly spiraled into end-of-the-world thinking.
Would the power grid go down? Would banks somehow delete your life savings? Would planes start dropping out of the sky?
These are the sorts of questions people were asking with growing frequency as 1999 drew to a close. The New York Times, reporting on the increasingly common links between Y2K fears and apocalyptic religious groups, mentioned the Rev. Jerry Falwell’s belief that the Y2K event would be evidence of God’s efforts to humble America, and that it might also incite a global Christian revival. Many fringe religious groups associated Y2K with the Rapture, and others – including Falwell, as well as non-religious survivalists – advised stocking up on food and guns.
But by the time New Year’s Eve rolled around in Lancaster, things were pretty peaceful.
This Intelligencer Journal front page from Dec. 31, 1999, features a local story that seems downright placid – municipal officials and emergency crews were to be on standby in case of any problems, but judging by the tone of the officials interviewed, the fear of something serious happening was remote at best.
This stood in contrast to places like Seattle, which canceled its entire New Year’s celebration because of fears of a terrorist attack linked to the new millennium.
Given that there were, in fact, no world-shaking disasters on Jan.1, 2000, the Y2K fears have been relegated to the realm of historical footnotes. Though there were occasional computer glitches as the millennium changed, they were widely scattered and very minor.
The cost of analyzing and rewriting millions of lines of computer code to avoid the Y2K bug, however, was far from minor – an estimated $308 billion worldwide, or nearly a half trillion 2019 dollars.

Texto completo: The congressional impeachment hearings are the equivalent of the hypnotist's shiny watch on a chain -- going back and forth, while the not so calming voice of Adam Schiff hums in the background.
Always making sure the attention of the wide-eyed, gullible citizenry is drawn away from the disastrous failings of both parties, and their corrupt D.C. political system. Keeping the people busy in this distraction is the goal and, it's working. They lead us down the rabbit hole, all but shouting out loud, "Hey dummies, look over here," but "Don't look over there."
As the masses hunker down in their ideological bunkers, issues like national debt, skyrocketing medical costs, drug prices, wars without end, uncontrolled immigration, etc., don't really matter.
Americans are duped (with media help) into playing this game and focusing 100% attention on the circus, fortifying positions, fighting to the death (figuratively) for their "side," so America suffers. We are too blinded by this manufactured hate to see clearly what is really going on.
Congress is impotent, neutered and deep in its swamp, with little hope of getting out. Sadly, they have adapted to this swamp; like a political version of Darwin's theory, they are thriving in it, at the expense of all Americans.
Perhaps when the Democrats say President Trump and the Republicans are evil, vile and corrupt, and the Republicans say the same about Pelosi, Schumer and the Democrats, they are both right?
Tim Kaczmarek, Natrona Heights

Comey should review his notes
The Washington Post and New York Times both marveled at the fact that James Comey was an obsessive and prolific note-taker who always took contemporaneous notes to preserve meeting discussions. However, when the Inspector General's report confirmed that Comey briefed President Barack Obama on the Trump-Russia investigation in August 2016 at a White House meeting, Comey could not recall exactly what he said, that being either two or four individuals with "some association or connection to the Trump campaign" were under surveillance. Also, Comey did not recall specifically when this meeting took place but believed it may have been in August 2106.
Maybe this copious note-taker should go back and review his notes so he can clear up those discrepancies prior to him being subpoenaed by Attorney General William Barr. I read somewhere that nobody has a higher loyalty than Comey. We will soon find out not only where his loyalty lies but if his loyalty lies.
Mark Black, Hermitage

Democrats' motives for removing Trump
I, for one, am sick and tired of the Democratic House of Representatives trying to remove a duly, lawfully elected president from office. I believe they started talking about impeaching President Trump the day after he was sworn in, after the election did not turn out in their favor.
When the so-called "Russian collusion" accusations did not work out, they opted for a plan to impeach Trump.
In my opinion, the only reasons they want to remove Trump from office are:
• They want to punish him for winning an election that he was not "supposed" to win.
• They are afraid of being prosecuted for their corruptness should he gain a second term.
• They are fearful that he will appoint another conservative Supreme Court justice, which will put the brakes on their liberal, socialist agenda, and keep them from destroying the United States Constitution and this great country for another two generations, thus slowing their "progressivism."
Wake up, America -- the futures of your children and grandchildren are at stake.
Tell me I am wrong.

Trump must be defeated
Only in a dream world would "Make America Great Again" be true. President Trump has disgraced the country. The multiple instances of obstruction of justice revealed in the Mueller report and in the impeachment process demonstrate real concern.
The impeachment hearings have proven that Trump and cohorts pressured foreign entities to interfere with a U.S. election, impeachable or not. He attempts to stop subpoenas, hides tax returns and lies. Fortunately there are those who do respect the rule of law and exposed the truth in written form and in public hearings.
In my opinion, Trump has done nothing that makes America great. His disparaging nicknames like Shifty Schiff, Little Marco, Low Energy Jeb and Little Rocket Man are shameful. This behavior is unbecoming of an adolescent. This is making America great?
Americans aren't habitual liars; we don't cozy up to dictators. We assist allies and denounce those who marched in Charlottesville, Va. Trump has disowned allies in need and tarnished America by withdrawing from numerous agreements. America's world position has been weakened by one who speaks via tweets that are often buffoonish, incoherent and immature.
Where do we go from here after Trump? Climate change, guns, trade, Middle East, immigration, health care, fair taxation, women's rights -- issues that are way over Trump's head. Many Americans believe Trump is unfit, as shown in 2016. He must be defeated in 2020.

Impeachment is cartoonish
The 'toon seemed to begin two days after inauguration with Maxine, the Squad and the pack calling for the impeachment cannon on Road Runner Trump, but the "hidden" episode showed Brennan, Clapper and Comey coyotes used the "Hillary paid for" dossier to try to torpedo the candidate RR.
Following "Stormy" and "Hollywood Access Video" episodes were well supplied with ammunition by Acme (mainstream media) and were amusing, but the four "Russian Collusion Investigation" ones ramped up the mirth and ended with the hilarious "Mueller on TV" scorched and so shell-shocked he didn't even seem to know what was in his own report! The saying about doing something over and over and looking for a different outcome might explain coyote "behavior."
The local "Acme" has been joining in on the show by supplying a platform for barrages of "Poison Pen" flechettes by the "globalist mouthpiece" Goldberg, Will, Cupp and Mistick coyotes, along with numerous local groupie coyotes.
The last 'toon had the wily Schiff and Pelosi coyotes on the sights of the impeachment cannon blasting away with "2nd/3rd hearsay you left me out boo hoo," flag-popping "bang" shells.
I can't wait to see the "Election" episode with their little coyote feet churning air over the cliff, and the next clever, devious ones that are surely being written.

Reparations for abuse are important
In his op-ed "Statute of limitations 'window' wrong path for past abuse cases," Rep. Paul Schemel notes that "the growing cost of legal settlements relating to old claims of child sexual abuse by Scout leaders" is causing the Boy Scouts of America to increase its annual dues by 80% next year. He ends his letter by asking, "Put simply, what justice comes when a young Boy Scout of today must pay for the long-ago actions of adults he never met"?
I argue that this is the very definition of justice -- an organization, liable and convicted of crimes against humanity, taking accountability for these crimes.
What that "young Boy Scout of today" (and his parents, who more likely pay the dues) learns is that such conduct -- sexual abuse, and the deliberate, systematic cover-up of decades of such abuse by an organization -- is wrong. That child learns that sexual abuse is damaging to individuals and their community -- and reparations can be expensive. That child also learns that people care and will stand up for what is right.
Susan Wilson, Greensburg

Businessman Trump is best at running country
Whether you like him or not, Donald Trump is our president. He is proving to me that a businessman can run this country better than any politician in spite of all of the resistance from the Democrats, RINOS, never-Trumpers and the Deep State.
There were 266,000 jobs added in November 2019 and over 7 million added since Trump was elected. In June 2016, "politician" President Obama said that manufacturing jobs "are just not coming back" and mocked then-candidate Trump by saying he would need a "magic wand" to bring back jobs.
Fast-forward to 2019. Unemployment is down to 3.5%. We have the best job numbers ever for African Americans, Hispanics, Asian Americans and women, and record-high stock-market numbers. He got rid of government regulations that were hindering small businesses: My brother-in-law had to sell off a few of his franchises and lay off employees or face bankruptcy; he said it was because of some of Obama's regulations.
Just think what Trump could do with even a little help from "the resistance" Ask yourself, are you better off today than you were in 2016? Today, I love my 401(k), and thank you, President Donald J. Trump.

Why We Love Social Security

Texto completo: Bold public programs, available to everyone regardless of need, are political winners.
Despite the diversity and number of candidates running for the Democratic presidential nomination, there has been a lot of agreement on a number of big policy ideas. All of the contenders want the government to guarantee paid parental leave. Nearly all want to significantly raise the federal minimum wage. Most support a Green New Deal to address climate change. Their agreement is notable, particularly on issues that in past contests were seen as radical.
But there is still a huge fault line in the field: Should big, new public programs be available to only those with the most need, or to all Americans? The argument has become most apparent as candidates have brawled over their plans to lower the cost of college. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren have proposed making public college free for all, while Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar want to direct aid solely to low- and moderate-income families.
This same philosophical split is in the background as candidates have debated whether to enact a "Medicare for all" single-payer health care system that provides government insurance for everyone, or to continue with something akin to the current one, where only some people get government subsidies and care. The issue also comes up in proposals for child care: Some candidates favor a universal solution, while others offer tax credits to help offset the cost for the poorest.
This is the most important argument to emerge from the 2020 Democratic contest so far: whether the party stands for giving public benefits only to people with the fewest resources, or for making them available for all. It's a worthy debate. But the winning argument, particularly for the big, important programs that candidates have proposed, is with those who want to provide them equally to everyone.
Those who favor making new programs available based on need typically do so to keep costs low. Mr. Buttigieg has explained that he doesn't want to provide relief from the high cost of college tuition to "the children of millionaires and billionaires." He wants to make sure that the wealthy, who can afford to pay for college tuition or child care, don't get assistance they don't really need, leaving more resources for the truly needy.
But there are administrative costs that come with delineating who gets benefits and who doesn't. Programs that are narrowly targeted can be less effective. And, most important for presidential candidates, they lack political support. Universal programs, on the other hand, not only cultivate strong support but also tend to get recipients more politically involved.
Social Security is an exemplar universal program. We all contribute to it, we all rely on it, and its broad scope has given it equally broad appeal and strength. President Franklin Roosevelt, who signed Social Security into law, designed it this way for this very reason. As he told an adviser, the taxes everyone pays in give people "a legal, moral, and political right" to the benefits, which means "no damn politician can ever scrap my social security program."
Social Security remains incredibly popular today, even with Tea Party members who want to dismantle many other government benefits. Social Security has also turned seniors into one of America's most influential political constituencies.
The G.I. Bill, passed during World War II, had a similar effect. Veterans who took advantage of education, job training and mortgage assistance under the law felt valued as citizens, and that, subsequently, made them more involved in politics and civic life.
The evidence is not just anecdotal. Two political scientists found, in a study of social programs in developed countries, that public benefit programs that rely more on universally distributing resources enjoy more political sustainability.
On the other hand, offering benefits through more opaque and income-reliant ways tends to dampen these effects. As the political scientist Suzanne Mettler has noted, in a 2008 poll, many people who had received benefits funneled through the tax code, such as the mortgage interest deduction, swore they'd never used a government program. They were therefore less likely to believe that the government had helped them get ahead.
People who receive cash assistance -- for which they must prove their poverty and their willingness to work, and in some states, even undergo a drug test -- are actually less likely to get involved in politics than those who do not. As the sociologist Jamila Michener has found, similarly punitive policies in Medicaid make people feel disempowered, causing them to withdraw from political participation.
The heavy administrative costs to determine who qualifies for a benefit aren't just a burden on governments. (States spend millions on drug screening for welfare recipients and rescind checks from those who screen positive.) The beneficiaries bear the administrative cost of repeatedly proving that they make little enough to qualify. Such paperwork often dissuades people from enrolling in programs at all. When Arkansas required low-income residents to report their work hours to stay enrolled in Medicaid, more than 18,000 people lost coverage in a span of seven months.
Universal programs also seem to be more effective at attaining the desired results: lowering poverty and reducing income inequality. Universal preschool programs, for example, improve reading scores for low-income students, while targeted programs do not. Universal child care systems in Quebec and Washington, D.C., have also significantly increased the share of women in the labor force.
The government doesn't need to make every single benefit universal. But the public goods that are essential to a full and healthy life -- health care, education and child care -- should be available to all. Some presidential contenders have finally realized the political benefits of designing them this way.

Texto completo: Readers assess Nancy Pelosi's decision not to send the articles of impeachment to the Senate right away.
To the Editor:
Re "Pelosi Puts Off Sending Impeachment to Senate, Leaving Trial in Limbo" (front page, Dec. 20):
I think putting off sending the impeachment to the Senate is a brilliant move by Nancy Pelosi. To allow the articles of impeachment to go to trial when the outcome is preordained would make a mockery of the impeachment process and offer an opportunity for President Trump to claim exoneration.
I would favor leaving the outcome of his impeachment in limbo indefinitely and letting the voters decide his fate in the 2020 presidential election.
John A. Viteritti
Laurel, N.Y.
To the Editor:
Why exactly does Nancy Pelosi think she's entitled to dictate terms to the Senate? The Constitution says the House has the sole power to impeach, and the Senate the sole power to hold a trial. Ms. Pelosi, Adam Schiff, etc. didn't seek consultation or permission from Mitch McConnell for their proceedings, including the star chamber tactics of anonymous accusations and secret evidence!
Now she is holding off on sending the articles of impeachment to the Senate. If this "impeachment" does not mean a trial in the Senate can commence, how is it impeachment? Some of the questions raised by Ms. Pelosi and the Democrats are manipulative games for political advantage.
Richard Sol
Los Angeles
To the Editor:
The latest delay tactic by the Democrats is distressing because I think it plays into the hands of the Republicans and gives them a platform to argue that the Democrats are afraid to pull the Senate trial trigger because the articles of impeachment are weak.
Fire away, Dems, and finish the process you started and stop strategizing. "Just do it."
Peter C. Alkalay

To the Editor:
Re "Can the Senate Hold a Fair Trial?," by Kamala D. Harris (Op-Ed, Dec. 20):
Donald J. Trump is, of course, the subject of the upcoming Senate impeachment trial -- but the essence of the impeachment is not the president but our country itself.
Mitch McConnell described the House hearings as "rushed and rigged." Anyone who watched them knows that was not the case. But partisanship prevails. Those who support Donald Trump watch certain TV stations, listen to their chosen broadcasters, and read publications that reflect their viewpoints. Those who oppose the president make very different choices, and never the twain shall meet.
Even among family and friends, political division corrodes. Earlier in this presidency it may have been possible to discuss differences, But no more. In the interest of harmony, the Trump topic is avoided. Yet, it is "the elephant in the room."
The Senate trial must not be "rushed and rigged." It must be a fair trial. Chief Justice John Roberts must ensure that the process is comprehensive and just. Witnesses must be mandated to testify under oath and previously withheld documents must be submitted. Senators, regardless of party, must judge the evidence as individuals of conscience -- not as Republicans or Democrats.
"Can the Senate hold a fair trial?" The answer must be "Yes." Senators, you hold in your hands the future of this country.

To the Editor:
Re "Evangelical and Calling for Ouster of Trump" (news article, Dec. 20):
The courageous editorial in Christianity Today calling for the removal of President Trump is a small fissure in his important evangelical bloc of support. That bloc has been holding its nose over the obvious amorality of Mr. Trump as the price of gaining conservative judges who support positions they favor. When they realize that if Mr. Trump is convicted, they will still have Mike Pence in place to continue judge appointments, their fervor in support of the epitome of moral turpitude may wane, and they may urge their senators to at least allow witnesses to corroborate the claimed innocence of Mr. Trump.

Re "With a Steady Hand, the Speaker Forges a Legacy She Never Wanted" (news article, Dec. 19):
I have now, in sadness, witnessed my third impeachment proceeding against a president of the United States, and I commend Speaker Nancy Pelosi for the way she handled the process with strength, courage, grace and integrity. Not only is Ms. Pelosi the highest-ranking woman in Washington and the second in line to the presidency, she has become the most powerful woman in the world. Brava, Madam Speaker, brava.

Texto completo: SAN DIEGO - When Orioles executive vice president/general manager Mike Elias addressed the team's affiliates at their recent annual dinner in San Diego, he touted the player development progress made in the first year of the team's rebuild and the momentum toward continuing that.
All that development, however, could be happening in a vastly different environment considering Major League Baseball's proposal to cut 42 minor league teams, reorganize the affiliate structure and change the way prospects get to the major leagues. It's all a part of sweeping change to the Professional Baseball Agreement that governs the relationships between MLB and Minor League Baseball and expires next year.
Many of the Orioles' affiliates have come out against the plan, with the Triple-A Norfolk Tides, Double-A Bowie Baysox and High-A Frederick Keys issuing statements praising Congress forming the "Save Minor League Baseball" task force to protect the threatened MiLB teams. Frederick is on the initial list of teams in jeopardy, according to The New York Times.
The proposal was a big part of commissioner Rob Manfred's annual winter meetings press conference, and Elias' final media session last Wednesday. Where it didn't really come up was at the affiliates dinner, which celebrated the successes of the farm system at a time when it is receiving more attention than ever. And more attention means more money.
"For us, we've found success in the current setup and we really like the way our minor leagues are situated with Baltimore, with all of them so close," Elias said. "It's all a big part of our fanbase. To us, 'Birdland' is this entity that extends beyond Baltimore and includes our minor league facilities. We like our setup. We think it's helpful for us, but any time there's new regulation, you certainly have to tailor your strategy towards it.
"Unless that happens, it's hard to know what that looks like. But I think we know how to succeed in the current setup and the current environment as well as anyone."
Ken Young, owner of Norfolk, Bowie, and Frederick and president of the Tides, said the affiliates have gotten that same impression, and he's hopeful none of those teams end up on the outside of whatever agreement is reached.
He posited that the published list of possible teams to cut was compiled by some who "didn't have a great knowledge of the minor leagues," while expressing hope that MLB "will see that it's in their best interest to do something different than the cut they were planning."
"The Orioles, and Mike may have told you this if you ask him, really like where their affiliates are right now, including Frederick," Young said. "They think they have a great situation, so Frederick being on that list wasn't caused by the Orioles, because the Orioles' desire is still to play in Frederick. Eventually, that's the way it's going to continue to be."
Elias didn't address the plan in the full-group setting of the annual dinner.
"I think there's some anxiousness on all of our parts when there's ideas floating around out there, but it hasn't been a topic of conversation," Elias said. "We're focused on the current setup. We had a terrific year. ... I think we have a lot to celebrate there, and some really good relationships across all of our affiliates between the front office and each minor league affiliate."
Manfred said last Wednesday that the negotiations between the two sides had been "a little more positive" while noting that the initial reporting of the proposal is "by no means a fait accompli as to what the agreement is going to look like."
He also said that MLB would be flexible, while MiLB "has taken the position that they're not willing to discuss anything but the status quo or any changes that would provide for upgrades in adequate facilities, better working conditions for our players." He added that the minor league side's actions in breaking the confidentiality of the negotiations created some ill will from the major league owners. Earlier this fall, MiLB representatives presented the same kind of intransigence about their major league counterparts.
MLB subsidizes minor league baseball "to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars every single year," Manfred said when asked whether he appreciated that teams in small towns across the country are a conduit to growing the game.
"Given that we are already subsidizing at the level that I've previously referred to, I think it is unreasonable to come to a bargaining table and say, 'Yeah, we got some facilities. We know they're substandard. In fact, they may not be fixable, but we're not willing to do anything about that.' That's unreasonable."
MiLB, for its part, issued a lengthy statement Friday to dispute most of what Manfred claimed, pushing back on everything from facilities issues to travel and player welfare while noting what's overseen by the major league clubs versus the minor league affiliates.
Part of the issue of facilities standards applies to the player development conditions at the Maryland stadiums that house Orioles affiliates, too. Some of the charms and quirks of a minor league stadium are less so when it comes to taking batting practice and building professional athletes.
There's an expectation at some affiliates that investment toward upgrades that best align with the organization's player development goals are on the horizon. And while each side has painted the other's negotiators as stubborn at one turn or another, the scope of what's been proposed and what significant changes could mean should be plenty to allow for an agreement.
"This has been one of the great relationships in American sports history," Bowie general manager Brian Shallcross said. "It's the reason our sport covers every corner of the United States, the system between Major League Baseball and Minor League Baseball. Look at any other sport. It just doesn't work like the baseball model works.
"I think that at the end of the day, that's still going to be intact, and we've got to make sure that we respect the wishes of our major league partners and certainly that the game of baseball takes top priority, for what's good for the game."

Local news is dead; long live local news

Texto completo: For the Valley News
When I was growing up, one of the favorite expressions in my family was, “no news is good news.” Or, to put it another way, “ignorance is bliss.”
That was then and this is now. With apologies to my parents, no news is definitely not good news. And remaining blissfully ignorant can be a recipe for civic disaster.
Imagine if you will, waking up in a desert, parched. Scanning the horizon, you see no relief in sight, no means to quench your ever-growing thirst. Unfortunately, this is the situation that now confronts Americans in more than 1,300 communities across the country who live in “news deserts,” places that have lost their local news coverage.
While we in the Upper Valley continue to live in a virtual news oasis, many of our compatriots are not so lucky. According to a 2018 study by the University of North Carolina School of Journalism and Media, 1,800 metro and community newspapers have either gone out of business or merged in the past 15 years. In the same period, the number of reporters, photographers and editors has plummeted almost 50%, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Driving this trend has been a precipitous decline in advertising revenue and changing demographics, not to mention changing reading habits.
It is no wonder, then, that New York Times Executive Editor Dean Baquet sounded an alarm earlier this year. At a gathering of media colleagues, Baquet asserted, “the greatest crisis in American journalism is the death of local news. ... I think most local newspapers in America are going to die in the next five years.”
So where does this leave us? And why should we care?
I turn first to no less an authority than cartoonist Garry Trudeau. In a recent Sunday strip, Trudeau had his main character, Michael Doonesbury, pose the question, “Do I really need local news?” In response, he was told that “cities that lose their local paper suffer a big drop in civic engagement” and “lose a host of connections with their community.”
Then, in a scenario reminiscent of It’s A Wonderful Life, Trudeau walked Doonesbury through a bleak landscape of lost opportunities caused by the disappearance of local news. With tongue permanently planted in cheek, Trudeau cited missed concerts, bake sales and board meetings.
Painting a much darker picture of what happens in the absence of the traditional watchdog role played by local newspapers, the UNC study asserts that when government actions are no longer covered, citizens are left without critical information about everything from proposed tax increases to who is running for office.
“The stakes are high,” the UNC researchers conclude. “Our sense of community and our trust in democracy at all levels suffer when journalism is lost or diminished. … We need to make sure that whatever replaces the 20th century version of local newspapers serves the same community-building functions.”
And there’s the rub. Ultimately the issue is less about the protection of print and more about the preservation of local news gathering operations, whatever form they take.
We’re lucky. In the Upper Valley, in addition to the Valley News, we have access to such well-respected news outlets as Vermont Public Radio and New Hampshire Public Radio, Burlington’s weekly Seven Days and the nonprofit digital news outlets VTDigger and InDepthNH, not to mention online news aggregators (please note the distinction).
Given this abundance, surely there can be no immediate threat to our local news landscape. Yet even casual observers recognize that, in response to declining advertising revenue, profound changes have been taking place. For example, among other cost-saving measures, this newspaper has changed its format to reduce newsprint costs and its full-time staff of reporters, editors and photographers has been reduced by about a third since 2012. Even an expanding online presence — which means revenue counted in digital dimes instead of print dollars — won’t turn the tide.
What is most needed, in my humble opinion, is a change in the mindset of readers. More of us need to come around to thinking of organizations that gather local news as essential civic institutions, like fire departments, which we cannot do without.
Personally, after reviewing any number of rearguard actions that have been taken around the country to combat news desertification, the one I think has the greatest potential is philanthropy.
Already, in places as far flung as Seattle and Salt Lake City, civic-minded individuals are being asked to go beyond just being subscribers and become financial contributors as well. Such estimable publications as The Seattle Times and The Salt Lake Tribune have determined that, given the headwinds traditional journalism is facing, it can no longer be business as usual. In fact, by recently becoming the first daily newspaper in the country to be granted nonprofit status by the IRS, The Salt Lake Tribune has decided it can no longer be a business at all.
As we have learned in the Upper Valley, trends that start on the West Coast often slowly work their way east. The day may not be far away when VPR and NHPR aren’t the only local news organizations asking for and deserving our unwavering support in end-of-the year fund drives.

Why a Museum in the Netherlands is Making Its Storage Entirely Accessible to Visitors

Texto completo: For private collectors and for ever-expanding mega-galleries, art storage has gotten increasingly more sophisticated and complicated over the last couple of years. High paying customers can now expect fingerprint-scanning technology to be protecting their possessions at facilities like UOVO, and Pace Gallery’s latest expansion at 540 West 25th Street includes a storage facility able to accommodate 600 paintings. The rise of fancy storage has also affected museums at large, and certain institutions are more often finding themselves broadening their perceptions when it comes to the types of spaces that casual visitors are allowed to occupy. On Wednesday, the New York Times reported that the Boijmans van Beuningen Museum in the Netherlands is working on the construction of a $95 million storage facility that will be accessible to visitors and which will contain all 151,000 of the museum’s artworks.
The facility, which is less of a “facility” and more of a new-century playground designed by MVRDV architects, is projected to be open to the public by 2021 and will include a movie theater and restaurants in addition to the standard prerequisite curator’s offices and conservation studios. The project also represents a radical reimagining of how exactly a museum should serve its audience: usually big institutions only let visitors see a tiny fraction of what they actually have in their coffers, leaving people wondering just how much they’re missing. At the new storage division of the Boijmans van Beuningen, which will be titled Depot, attendees will theoretically be able to engage with work in an entirely different way by seeing how it’s cataloged and designated for viewing.
Looked at another way, museums being more “transparent” with their collections is a means for these institutions to ingratiate themselves with audiences who might still think of museums as stuffy or out of touch. During a time when museums increasingly are finding themselves at the center of cultural and political debates, this is a prescient strategy.

Trump impeachment trial in doubt as Democrats weigh withholding articles

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — The day after the House cast historic votes to impeach President Trump, Democrats grappled Thursday with when to send the charges to the Republican-led Senate, hoping to gain leverage in a bicameral clash over the contours of an election-year trial.
Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi insisted Thursday that Senate Republicans must provide details on witnesses and testimony before she would send over the charges for Trump's trial. No deal, replied Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell after meeting with his Senate Democratic counterpart.
“We remain at an impasse," he said.
It became increasingly likely that the limbo could persist until the new year. The House is poised to leave town Friday for the Christmas and New Year's holidays, possibly without taking the votes that would be required to start the process in the Senate.
“We are ready," said Pelosi, who said Wednesday night that she was reluctant to send the charges or name the lawmakers who would prosecute the case against Trump until she was certain of a fair process for a Senate trial. “When we see what they have, we will know who and how many we will send over."
McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, has complicated the picture for Democrats by asserting that he has no intention of acting as an impartial juror in a Senate trial of Trump but would instead do everything in his power, working in concert with the White House, to quickly acquit the president.
But if Pelosi was angling for an upper hand in negotiations about how the trial would proceed, McConnell quickly squashed the notion Thursday in a scathing speech in which he denounced her and Democrats for impeaching Trump.
“The vote did not reflect what had been proven; it only reflects how they feel about the president," McConnell said from the Senate floor. “The Senate must put this right. We must rise to this occasion. There is only one outcome that is suited to the paucity of evidence, the failed inquiry, the slapdash case."
And in comments that underscored the risks Pelosi faces in withholding the articles, McConnell effectively argued that the delay reflected a weak case against Trump, a blink by the Democrats in their standoff with the president.
“The prosecutors are getting cold feet in front of the entire country and second-guessing whether they even want to go to trial," McConnell said. “They said impeachment was so urgent that it could not even wait for due process, but now they're content to sit on their hands. This is comical."
Trump, echoing McConnell's remarks, took to Twitter to attack what he called a “pathetic" case.
“Pelosi feels her phony impeachment HOAX is so pathetic she is afraid to present it to the Senate, which can set a date and put this whole SCAM into default if they refuse to show up!" Trump wrote. “The Do Nothings are so bad for our Country!"
The angry tone of the comments reflected what people close to the president have said is a keen desire by Trump to be publicly vindicated in a Senate trial, a prospect that Pelosi appears to be placing in jeopardy.
Meanwhile, the fallout from the impeachment of Trump continued.
The Nielsen company reported Thursday that at least 15 million television viewers watched the House of Representatives vote to impeach Trump.
Both Fox News Channel and NBC had roughly 5 million viewers during the hour, starting at 8 p.m. Eastern, when the House took separate votes Wednesday on two articles of impeachment, Nielsen said. MSNBC had 3.2 million viewers and CNN had 2.84 million.
In another development, a magazine for evangelical Christians, whose support for Trump has been ardent and unshakable, called for his removal from office.
Christianity Today, which was founded by the late Rev. Billy Graham, said in an editorial published on Thursday that “the president of the United States attempted to use his political power to coerce a foreign leader to harass and discredit one of the president's political opponents. That is not only a violation of the Constitution; more importantly, it is profoundly immoral."
“The reason many are not shocked about this," the editorial added, “is that this president has dumbed down the idea of morality in his administration."
Meanwhile, in Washington, nerves were raw on both sides of the aisle the morning after the House voted to impeach Trump. He was impeached for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress related to his campaign to pressure Ukraine to smear Democratic rivals, making him only the third president to be impeached.
Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York, the Democratic leader, called McConnell's speech a “30-minute partisan screed." Later, he met with Pelosi behind closed doors to plan strategy.
In the House, Pelosi shot back at McConnell: “I don't think anybody expected that we would have a rogue president and a rogue leader in the Senate at the same time."
And even as the next step in the process remained murky, she said Democrats had been receiving accolades from people across the country who were buoyed by the House action to charge Trump with high crimes and misdemeanors.
“Seems like people have a spring in their step because the president was held accountable for his reckless behavior," Pelosi told reporters on Capitol Hill. “No one is above the law, and the president has been held accountable."
Some leading Democrats have cast doubt on whether a Senate trial will happen at all.
On Thursday morning, Representative James Clyburn, Democrat of South Carolina, the No. 3 House Democrat, said he was willing to wait “as long as it takes" to transmit the two impeachment articles approved Wednesday night.
“Until we can get some assurances from the majority leader that he is going to allow for a fair and impartial trial to take place, we would be crazy to walk in there knowing he has set up a kangaroo court," Clyburn said Thursday morning on CNN.
In her own news conference in the House Thursday, Pelosi played down the delay over pressing charges in the Senate but declined repeatedly to offer a timeline for when the House might file its case. Pelosi has indicated she will work with House chairmen and Schumer to determine when the articles should be submitted and what meets her standard for fairness.
Schumer has already set forth his own detailed plan for a trial. In a letter sent Sunday night to McConnell, Schumer proposed a trial beginning Jan. 7 that would give each side a fixed amount of time to present its case, and called for four top White House officials who have not testified — including Mick Mulvaney, Trump's acting chief of staff; and John Bolton, the president's former national security adviser — to appear as witnesses.
McConnell quickly rejected the plan.
“Is the president's case so weak that none of the president's men can defend him under oath?" Schumer asked in a speech on the Senate floor Thursday morning.
A top ally of Trump's, Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, called the possibility that the House could hold back the articles a “constitutional extortion mechanism that is dangerous for the country."
Graham, who is chairman of the Judiciary Committee, said he spoke Thursday morning with Trump, who asked him, “What's happening?"
“He's puzzled," Graham said. “I tried the best I could to explain it. I'm puzzled, too."

Texto completo: Marvin Miller Elected to Baseball HOF
MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL Players Association founder Marvin Miller, who helped players gain free agency instead of being tied to one team, was elected Dec. 8 to the National Baseball Hall of Fame, JTA reported.
Miller, who is in the National Jewish Sports Hall of Fame, was the son of a Lower East Side salesman and school teacher. He served as union chief from 1966 to 1982.
During his tenure, Miller also introduced salary arbitration.
Miller, who died in 2013 at 95, fell short of hall entrance seven times before the Modern Baseball Era Committee gave him the 75% needed for admittance.
"Players are pleased that Marvin will now take his rightful and long overdue place in the Hall of Fame," MLBPA Executive Director Tony Clark said.
Miller will be enshrined in the Cooperstown, New York-based museum in July.
Philanthropist Funds Campaign Against Anti-Semitic Political Candidates
Ronald Lauder, a billionaire philanthropist and president of the World Jewish Congress, announced Dec. 9 a $25 million campaign against United States political candidates supportive of anti-Semitism or its normalization, JTA reported.
The campaign will be called the Anti-Semitism Accountability Project and include a nonprofit organization and a super РАС.
The New York Times reported that Lauder will determine which politicians (federal, state or local) will be targeted. Although he is a longtime Republican donor, Lauder said he would go after both Democratic and Republican candidates.
In addition, ASAP said in a statement that it would "also respond and take action against institutions and cultural figures who support anti-Semitism."
Jews Nominated for Numerous 2019 Golden Globes
Several Jewish actors, writers and songwriters received Golden Globe nominations on Dec. 9, JTA reported.
The film "Marriage Story," which was written and directed by Noah Baumbach, led the way. Aside from being up for best drama, Baumbach was nominated for best screenplay. Co-star Scarlett Johnansson was nominated for best actress in a drama, and Randy Newjnan was nominated for the movie's score.
"Jojo Rabbit," which is Taika Waititi's anti-hate satire about a German boy who wants to be a Nazi toward the end of World War II, is up for best musical or comedy film. Waititi wrote and directed the film.
Sam Mendes was nominated for best director for World War I drama "1917," which is also a nominee for best film.
Although she's not Jewish, Rachel Brosnahan - who plays Jewish Midge Maišei - was nominated for best actress in a TV comedy for "The Marvelous Mrs. Maišei."
Sacha Baron Cohen received a nomination for best actor in a miniseries or TV movie for the Netflix series "The Spy" about Israel spy Eli Cohen.
Jonah Hill's sister Beanie Feldstein got a nomination for best actress in a comedy film for "Booksmart."
Ben Platt's role in Netflix's "The Politician" got him a nomination for best actor in a TV comedy.
In the same category is Paul Rudd, who played two versions of the same character in "Living With Yourself."
Michael Douglas and Alan Arkin were nominated for their roles in "The Kominsky Method," the former for lead actor in a TV comedy series and the latter for supporting actor in "a series, limited series or motion picture made for television."
And "The Fonz" himself, Henry Winkler, is competing against Arkin for his role in HBO's "Barry." *

Here's the real reason why Democrats impeached Trump

Texto completo: President Trump made history by becoming the third U.S. president to be impeached by the House of Representatives.
The House voted to impeach Trump on two charges: 1) abuse of power and 2) obstruction of Congress. Not a single Republican supported either impeachment article, making the impeachment a completely partisan affair. A handful of Democrats did break with their party. Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, a Democratic presidential candidate, voted “present” on both articles, while Minnesota Rep. Collin Peterson and New Jersey Rep. Jeff Van Drew voted against both articles. A fourth congressman, Rep. Jared Golden of Maine, split his vote between the two articles.
This was arguably the most predictable thing to happen in an otherwise unpredictable presidency. Democrats have been calling for impeachment ever since Trump took office and since they gained control of the House.
Now that Democrats got their wish in impeaching Trump, surely the walls are closing in on him, right? Enter Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.
On the Senate floor on Thursday, McConnell criticized House Democrats for their impeachment efforts, saying, “This particular House of Representatives has let its partisan rage at this particular president create a toxic new precedent that will echo well into the future.”
McConnell has been clear on the subject of impeachment: It’s a shoddy argument that doesn’t meet the threshold for impeachment or removal of a president.
So, what happens now?
As House Speaker Nancy Pelosi delayed the process of sending the articles of impeachment to the Senate for a trial, it could end up that the articles are never sent at all and the Democrats' impeachment effort dies. If it is sent to the Senate, it is almost guaranteed that a Republican-controlled legislative body will vote along party lines and acquit Trump of both charges.
So, if impeachment is doomed to fail in the Senate, why even impeach Trump to begin with?
MSNBC’s Katy Tur pretty much gave away the Democratic playbook after Trump was impeached, writing on Twitter, "No matter what happens next, even if the Senate acquits him, even if he is re-elected, he will forever have an asterisk next to his name.”
Tweet
All this talk from Democrats about defending the Constitution is a fallacy. Impeachment was always about getting under Trump’s skin, if not defeating him in the 2020 presidential election. Democrats are banking on the electorate being too ignorant to understand the whole impeachment process is a partisan hack-job that lost its credibility. The only question that remains is, "How soon will this backfire on Democrats?”

Ballet Taos plans traditional 'Nutcracker'

Texto completo: In 2010, Alastair Macaulay, then dance critic for The New York Times , said, "Over the last 70 years [The Nutcracker] ballet-- conceived in the Old World -- has become an American institution. Its amalgam of children, parents, toys, a Christmas tree, snow, sweets and Tchaikovsky's astounding score is integral to the season of good will that runs from Thanksgiving to New Year."
One would be hard-pressed to disagree. Even those who have never seen a performance are likely familiar with the score of "The Nutcracker," and its characters and imagery, all of which have permeated the holidays for several generations. But whether you've seen it or not, treat yourself this weekend with tickets to Ballet Taos' third annual production of the beloved holiday tale, presented on the stage of the Taos Community Auditorium, 145 Paseo del Pueblo Norte.
"In our past two productions of the ballet we chose to put a New Mexican spin on the story but this year we'll present the traditional, full-length production based upon E. T. A. Hoffmann's 'The Nutcracker and the Mouse King,'" said Megan Yackovich, artistic director of Ballet Taos.
Hoffmann, a Prussian author, penned the iconic story in 1816 but its adaptation by Frenchman Alexandre Dumas is what caught the attention, toward the end of that century, of choreographers Marius Petipa and Lev Ivanov and, notably, composer Pyotr Tchaikovsky. The ensuing libretto lovingly captured the gift of dreams and the landscapes across which dreams dance.
"It's Christmas Eve and a young girl named Clara receives a nutcracker doll from her Uncle Drosselmeyer. After a lively party at the Stahlbaum's, Clara retrieves her Nutcracker from in front of the Christmas tree; she nods off and her true gift of a dream begins," explained Yackovich.
"Overnight, her Nutcracker Prince comes to life and battles larger-than-life mice and a Rat King. In the second act, Clara and the Nutcracker Prince travel to the magical Land of Sweets where they meet the Sugar Plum Fairy, and a celebration of dancing is held in Clara's honor. At the end of the ballet, Clara awakens from her dream holding her toy nutcracker. Never wanting her adventure to end, she realizes that her dream is the beginning of many adventures," Yackovich continued.
The stellar casting of this Ballet Taos production includes internationally recognized dancers Zac Bigbee and David Maurice, who will be partners to Clara, the Snow Queen and the Sugar Plum Fairy. Guest artist Adam Overley will appear as Herr Drosselmeyer, Kate Martin as Mrs. Stahlbaum, Serena Smith as the Governess and Rich Greywolf as Grandpa, debuting their dancing and acting skills. (Yackovich will also appear as Grandma.)
Ballet Taos students Willow Bowman, Bodhi Fogden and Jamie Jensen will perform as Clara, the Snow Queen and the Sugar Plum Fairy, respectively.
The production's elegant set design for Act I came to life under the extraordinary hands of Greywolf who, in addition to his featured role, "manages to nevertheless find the time for his 'real' job as principal of Taos Integrated School for the Arts (TISA)," Yackovich said, laughing. "He has also been instrumental in facilitating our use of other set pieces and the Act II Land of Sweets set, which was designed by International Ballet School of Denver and loaned to us for the production."
The whimsical and imaginative costumery is likewise a collaboration between Sandra Carlson of International Ballet School of Denver and Yackovich herself, whose own extensive experience as a classically trained ballerina is responsible for the rigorous and unsparing dedication to the high-spirited production values audiences will be fortunate to experience.
This year's performances are scheduled for Friday (Dec. 20) at 7 p.m., Saturday (Dec. 21) at 2 p.m. and 7 p.m. and Sunday (Dec. 22) at both 2 p.m. and 6 p.m. Sunday's shows also include two special events.
"At the conclusion of Sunday's matinee, we'll be hosting a holiday party, giving our guests the chance to meet Clara and the Sugar Plum Fairy," Yackovich said. "And after the evening's performance we'll be judging the ugly sweater contest. So wear your best ugly holiday sweater to the ballet, and you could win some Ballet Taos swag or gift certificates from local restaurants."
Over the last several years, Ballet Taos has offered programs in both classical and contemporary disciplines, from beginning levels for ages 4 to 6 years to adult and professional levels.
"In our mission to foster the whole artist, our programs are intensive and focused," said Yackovich. "But if our students truly want to pursue a dancing career, then that's what we need to do to provide them with the skills they need to navigate the professional world." Indeed, Ballet Taos seeks to ensure their artists are coached to be "technically precise, rhythmically sound, artful and spirited in movement."
The school's professional approach is what consistently attracts guests artists such as Bigbee and Maurice to their productions, collaborations and fundraising events. "Zac [Bigbee] is a Taoseño and began his training here, but he has gone on to study throughout Europe and Russia," Yackovich said. "And David [Maurice] has trained with the renowned contemporary dancer Cesar Degollado." Both are now associated with nationally recognized companies.
Yet Ballet Taos is equally engaged in public awareness on which Project Relevé, another component of the company's expanding repertory, is focused. Serving as the educational outreach program for the school, Project Relevé travels to different venues and gives audience members a behind-the-scenes look into the rigors of classical ballet excellence.
As it did last year, Yackovich noted that Project Relevé will host a special event on Friday (Dec. 20) from 10-11:30 a.m. "We sent invitations to all of the local schools, who have quickly reserved the available auditorium seats. Our guest artists will both perform, and our ballet students will then work with them on 'The Nutcracker' pas de deux known as 'Dance of the Snowflakes.' This gives the students in the audience a chance to understand how training is conducted."
A production of this magnitude requires many helping hands, Yackovich noted. "The success of our productions has to be laid at the feet of so many people outside of Ballet Taos," including the town of Taos, the Taos Center for the Arts and, particularly, the Taos Arts Council under whose umbrella Ballet Taos has grown.
"Credit must also be given to local performers like Adam [Overley], who put so much of themselves into making our magic happen. Then there's theater director Chelsea Reidy, filmmaker, lighting designer -- and, now, performer -- Kate Martin, graphic designer Emily Wilde and our public relations team of Anwar Kaelin, Jennifer Roderick and Ashley Kent-Fields," Yackovich concluded.
Tickets for the evening shows are $20 in advance and $22 at the door for adults; $14 in advance and $16 at the door for youth under 18. Matinee shows are $16 in advance and $18 at the door for adults; and children under 18 are $12 in advance and $14 at the door. They may be purchased in advance online at tcataos.org or at the box office of Taos Community Auditorium of the Taos Center for the Arts.

Texto completo: Start Making Sense: Talking Heads Tribute
9 p.m. Friday. Port City Music Hall, 504 Congress St., Portland, $18 in advance, $20 day of show, $35 preferred seating, 18-plus. portcitymusichall.com
If you're a fan of Talking Heads and you don't go to this show, you will wake up the next day screaming, "My god, what have I done?!" Start Making Sense has been paying homage to Talking Heads for a decade, and its live show is phenomenal. The tribute band will be playing the entire set from the Talking Heads' legendary 1980 show in Rome, Italy, and then another set of classic Heads tunes. Expect plenty of time for dancing and lovey dovey. The second you walk through the door at Port City, you'll turn to your friends and say, "This must be the place."
Winter Solstice Mini-Fest with Matt Flinner and Low Lily
8 p.m. Saturday. One Longfellow Square, 181 State St., Portland, $20 in advance, $25 day of show. onelongfellowsquare.com
Here's a way to make the darkest day of the year shine brightly. The Winter Solstice Mini-Fest is an evening of music from award-winning bluegrass mandolinist Matt Flinner and American roots band Low Lily. You'll hear a seasonal blend of instrumentals and vocal tunes featuring mandolin, guitars, fiddle, banjo and double bass. And don't forget about the harmonies, as they'll be served up in three- and four-part glory.
Eileen Ivers' A Joyful Christmas
7:30 p.m. Sunday. Chocolate Church Arts Center, 804 Washington St., Bath, $42 in advance, $47 at the door. chocolatechurcharts.org
Don't fiddle around too long and miss out on getting a ticket for this show. Eileen Ivers is a world-class fiddler of the Irish and American roots music persuasion, and the holiday show she and her band put on every year has been dazzling audiences for two decades. You'll hear story-filled folk, ancient Wren Day songs, some jiggy Bach, fiddle looping and plenty of foot-stomping seasonal joy. Lest there be any doubt about Ivers, the New York Times called her "the Jimi Hendrix of the violin."

Texto completo: Anne Hathaway didn't have to dig deep for her latest role in "Dark Waters."
In Todd Haynes' whistleblower drama, the Oscar winner plays the real-life Sarah Bilott, whose husband, lawyer Rob Bilott (Mark Ruffalo), helped expose decades of environmental contamination by chemical company DuPont.
"It's heartbreaking and infuriating on a human level," Hathaway says. "There wasn't really any acting required, in terms of playing someone who was learning of (corruption) and was equal parts aghast and terrified and angry and emotional."
Based on a 2016 New York Times Magazine article by Nathaniel Rich, "Dark Waters" begins with Rob taking on a new client: a West Virginia farmer (Bill Camp) who believes his cows' mysterious deaths are caused by a toxic runoff from a DuPont landfill, which contaminated a creek on his land.
Rob's work eventually leads to a study that finds roughly 70,000 people were drinking tainted water with traces of PFOA, a toxic chemical used in the production of Teflon products such as non-stick pans until 2013. DuPont was allegedly aware for years that PFOA exposure is linked to illnesses such as kidney cancer and thyroid disease, and the company was forced to pay out $671 million in personal injury lawsuits in 2017.
The story hit close to home for Hathaway, 37, already a mom to son Jonathan, 3, with husband Adam Shulman, and now "a thousand months pregnant" with a second child, she says good-naturedly by phone.
After reading the script, "I opened the drawer where I keep my pans and pots, and there was a non-stick pan," Hathaway says. "And despite reading an article when I was pregnant with my first child that said 'don't use non-stick,' there was one that had somehow slipped through the cracks and I'd been feeding my family with it for years.
"I try not to blame myself too hard in those circumstances, because I believe that we as human beings and as Americans should never be put in that position where we're just trying to do our best, and we're inadvertently poisoning ourselves and the people we love."
Hathaway has always had an activist spirit, which is part of the reason why Haynes thought of her to play Sarah.
"Anne has this incredible vitality and intelligence and compassion, and you see that in her work," says the director, best known for the Oscar-nominated "Carol" and "Far from Heaven." "Sarah is an essential part of the story of Rob and how he was able to do what he did, but also how hard it is on a domestic relationship when somebody takes on the system."
A vocal member of the Time's Up movement against sexual harassment and workplace discrimination, Hathaway credits her activism to her parents, who instilled the importance of equality and inclusivity from an early age.
"I was born in the early '80s, and there were still things I was told I couldn't do because I was a girl," Hathaway says. "I was really lucky I was raised in a household where that sentence was never uttered. It seems strange to me that anybody would try to put me in a box based on the way I was born, when it's so much easier to just accept other people for how they are. So I guess that was my first awareness that the world wasn't a fair place for everyone."
The actress says she is grateful for her "Dark Waters" co-star Ruffalo, who has long spoken out about climate change and fracking. She also feels encouraged by the work of 16-year-old Greta Thunberg and other young environmental activists.
"I'm so inspired by them – their priorities are exactly right," Hathaway says. "They are focused and doing all the things we tell young people to do. So I don't understand people's negative reaction to this generation, except to say they must be very comfortable with the greed innate in the status quo."

Texto completo: The printing operations at The News-Press and Naples Daily News will move to Sarasota in mid-February.
Stopping press operations at the Naples Daily News off Immokalee Road will eliminate 49 full- and part-time jobs.
The presses in North Naples are used to print multiple newspapers, including The News-Press in Fort Myers, as well as several community publications — such as The Banner, Marco Eagle and Collier Citizen.
The announcement comes after the combination of New Media Investment Group, including the Sarasota Herald-Tribune, and Gannett, including the Naples Daily News and The News-Press.
In Sarasota, there's more and larger printing equipment, which factored into the decision, according to a news release.
"The Daily News team remains deeply committed to serving Naples and the greater Southwest Florida region, as we have for 97 years," Gannett regional president Bill Barker said. "We will continue to deliver outstanding news and information and effective advertising solutions to the Southwest Florida region as we continue to tell your stories, give a voice to the voiceless and hold the powerful accountable."
The combination of New Media and Gannett, the parent company of USA TODAY and more than 100 other dailies, in a deal valued at more than $1 billion in November created the largest news organization in the nation. The merger of the two companies is expected to result in a combined savings of some $300million a year. However, Michael E. Reed, the New Media chief executive since 2006, told the New York Times that the bulk of the savings "is not going to come from editorial."
Barker announced the closure of the local printing operations at a town hall meeting with Daily News employees late Monday afternoon. The transition, he said, is expected to be seamless for readers and advertisers.
Barker described the move as "economic," resulting in a cost savings that will allow the local newspapers to preserve "vital journalism jobs."
The change in printing locations is not expected to affect local news coverage or delivery times, but the newspaper pages will be a bit bigger, Barker said.
In the news release, Barker described Naples' production employees as "best-of-class," saying they're "dedicated to high quality production, our readers and our community."
"This is an important, but difficult decision," he said. "We recognize its impact on these professionals."
Sarasota will hire more employees for its press room and in packaging as a result of the consolidation, and employees in Naples will be invited to apply.
Management is also connecting the local employees who will lose their jobs with local services to assist them in finding work elsewhere.
The consolidation of production operations has become commonplace within the newspaper industry as it looks for ways to survive and compete in an increasingly digital world.
In 2016, printing for The News-Press and its affiliated publications moved to Naples from Fort Myers following Gannett's purchase of the Naples Daily News and its community publications, which put them all under the same parent company.
What will become of the printing press in Naples is still unknown.

Texto completo: There's something about Mayor Pete.
As the Midwestern political upstart climbs in Democratic presidential primary polls, Pete Buttigieg also has managed to get deep under the skin of progressive activists.
Social media networks now light up with the latest Buttigieg-induced controversy over his policy positions, his turns of phrase, even the swanky locales of his private fundraisers. The Gen Z crowd mocks him as "Mayo Pete," his events have been disrupted by liberal protesters and his fresh-faced newness is seen as a drawback.

The acrimony has spilled over onto the campaign trail with rivals increasingly sniping at Buttigieg by name. On Thursday, six of his opponents will have the chance to level their critiques in person when they share a stage with him at the sixth Democratic debate in Los Angeles.
As a relative unknown, Buttigieg wowed Democrats as an openly gay, multilingual wunderkind with Rust Belt bona fides. But as the novelty of his trajectory -- going from a mayor of South Bend, Ind., a city of 100,000 people, to a top-tier presidential candidate -- has worn off, a sneering tone among the Democratic left has crept in.
"Of the people at the top of the race ... you have three very accomplished people with gravitas," said Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, an activist group aligned with Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren. Green was referring to Warren, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and former Vice President Joe Biden.
"That does not extend to a 37-year-old mayor who won his last race with 8,000 votes." (Buttigieg won 80% of the roughly 10,500 votes cast in his 2015 reelection.) In a year when Democrats fielded their most diverse slate of candidates ever, some are frustrated by him outperforming women and candidates of color with longer resumes. Compounding that sting is his meager support among black and Latino voters, a core of the Democratic base.
The hype around Buttigieg is "very hard to stomach," said Aimee Allison, founder of She the People, a group that promotes women of color in politics.
"He's been given a lot of space," she said.
"We have other candidates who are carrying the hopes and dreams of millions who haven't been given that."
Rebecca Katz, founder of the progressive consulting firm New Deal Strategies, put it bluntly: "There is frustration that Pete is the living and breathing embodiment of white male privilege."
Mainly, progressive complaints about the mayor boil down to a simple refrain: They just don't trust him.
"Right now, people don't really know who Pete Buttigieg is," Katz said. "He's different at the end of 2019 than he was at the start of 2019."
Katz pointed to the mayor's past support for "Medicare for all" as an example. Buttigieg now runs on "Medicare for all who want it," which would create a government-run public option to compete with private insurers, and has branded Medicare for all as too disruptive and politically toxic.
The tussling over healthcare was the first fissure between Buttigieg and the left. It's now cracked open into a mile-wide gulf, as the mayor has charted a more moderate course, which he says is necessary to win over the voters needed to beat President Trump.
Progressives were enraged when Buttigieg released a commercial that touted his college affordability plan, which would provide tuition-free public higher education for 80% of American families, and panned more sweeping proposals by Warren and Sanders.
Buttigieg said making college free "even for the kids of millionaires" amounted to an unrealistic promise. Detractors said Buttigieg was undermining the push for more universal programs, a top progressive priority.
"This is a GOP talking point used to dismantle public systems, & it's sad to see a Dem candidate adopt it," tweeted New York Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a Sanders supporter.
Many on the left also got angry when Buttigieg, responding to a voter question in New Hampshire about the federal deficit, said that his party was "not known for worrying about deficits and the debt too much, but it's time for us to start getting into that business." He then went on to slam the GOP for growing the deficit under its watch.
Liberal economist and New York Times columnist Paul Krugman tweeted his dismay, wondering, "Is Buttigieg just Howard Schultz in disguise?" -- linking Buttigieg to the ex-Starbucks chief who pondered a third-party centrist bid that was derided by Democrats.
Allison said these more moderate tacks are most galling for progressives, who believe the Trump era demands a forceful, sweeping response.
"His perspective on what the political solution is in this moment is too middle of the road," she said.
Buttigieg has played down the policy rifts, emphasizing his support for hiking taxes on the wealthy, raising the minimum wage and boosting union membership -- all of which have wide-ranging support in the Democratic Party.
"It is a little strange because I think I broadly share the same values and goals as a lot of these folks. It's a little hard to have a conversation with them, so I don't know for sure," Buttigieg said last week in an interview broadcast by the Washington Post.
Aside from the policy squabbles, Buttigieg opponents have dinged him for his ties to corporate America, pressuring him to release his client list when he was a junior employee at McKinsey, a consulting firm, and the names of elite donors who are raising money for him. The mayor disclosed both sets of information last week.
The friction is especially high between Buttigieg and Warren, whose polling numbers have dipped as the mayor's have risen. In a speech in New Hampshire last week, her criticism was thinly veiled.
"Unlike some candidates for the Democratic nomination, I'm not betting my agenda on the naive hope that if Democrats adopt Republican critiques of progressive policies or make vague calls for unity that somehow the wealthy and well-connected will stand down," she said.
Buttigieg hit back, alluding to Warren's history of doing closed-door fundraisers, which she has largely eschewed in this race.
"The thing about these purity tests is the people issuing them can't even meet them, right?" he said in the Washington Post broadcast. "If doing traditional fundraisers disqualifies you from running for president, then I guess neither one of us would be here."
Many of Buttigieg's supporters, and some top aides, are quarreling with critics on Twitter, but a campaign spokesman was more restrained.
"While the attacks from our competitors continue to escalate, Pete's vision for the future of the country is resonating with voters," Tess Whittlesey said. "His focus remains on defeating Donald Trump and uniting the country by offering bold solutions to the challenges our country faces."
The good news for Buttigieg, perhaps, is that he's been here before. Nanci Flores, a supporter who works at a Latino community center in South Bend, recalled that the mayor's youth initially led to some skepticism.
"When he first started as mayor here, people were not really taking him seriously. We really didn't know him," Flores said. "But it only took a year to get to know that this guy was serious and he was effective and he cares."
Nowadays, there are signs that the anti-Buttigieg rhetoric is distinctly more mellow on the ground in Iowa, even among backers of rival campaigns. Some, like Nate Rivers, who attended a Sanders town hall in Iowa Falls, echoed many of the progressive concerns.
"A lot of the backlash is about him being a guy who was like, 'I will support Medicare for all' to where he is now, basically a debate assassin trying to shoot down progressive talking points," said Rivers, a 20-year-old student at the University of St. Thomas in Minnesota.
Others reacted to Buttigieg with more of a shrug. Laura Foley, 37, attending a Sanders canvassing event in Des Moines, said she had no problem with the mayor.
"He's a great person," Foley said, "and I hope the best for him."

Texto completo: To the Editor:
Re "Migrant Children Pay Price as Trump Seeks to Extend Detention" (news article, Dec. 9):
The evidence is clear: Family detention is a harmful and costly mechanism to punish women and children whose only "crime" is fleeing persecution. That's why, as an American, I was distraught to see that the administration is planning to expand this detrimental practice.
Luckily, there is a straightforward and sensible alternative. The Family Case Management Program, part of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, offered community-based case management and ensured that asylum seekers complied with immigration requirements. The Trump administration abruptly and inexplicably terminated the program in 2017.
In its nearly two years of operation, the program demonstrated that it was just as effective as detention in ensuring that asylum seekers showed up to court and adhered to our immigration requirements.
The Family Case Management Program allows the United States to ensure that asylum seekers are complying with our laws while treating them with the dignity and respect they deserve.
The United States should restart the Family Case Management Program immediately and abandon these ill-informed plans to expand family detention.

Texto completo: Ted Swisher, who helped build Habitat for Humanity into a massive international nonprofit - which now operates in 1,400 U.S. cities and 70 nations - had stepped away from the organization when he moved to Santa Fe in 2006.
He didn't intend to work with the local branch.
In his first four years here, he ran the city of Santa Fe's affordable housing office and was a construction manager for Centex, an Albuquerque homebuilder. But a longtime friend who was executive director of Santa Fe Habitat for Humanity, Maggie Monroe-Cassel, persuaded him to return to the nonprofit.
"She recruited me," Swisher said, adding, "Habitat has been my life."
Now Swisher, who became executive director of Santa Fe Habitat for Humanity in 2010, is stepping away for good. He plans to retire at the end of the year from the organization, which recruits volunteers to build homes for low-income people.
"I'm 70 years old," Swisher said. "It's time to relax a bit."
His successor, Kurt Krahn, who has been shadowing Swisher since late October, will take over Jan. 1. Krahn, 52, has housing experience in the Cincinnati and Chicago areas.
Swisher had ties to Habitat even before it was established in 1976. Co-founders Millard and Linda Fuller were close friends. He spent most of his first stint with the organization, 23 years, at its headquarters, then located in Americus, Ga.
He and the Fullers had worked together at Koinonia Farm, a communal farm in Americus in the early 1970s. Koinonia inspired the Fullers to launch Habitat. Swisher, meanwhile, stayed on at Koinonia as executive director until 1983, when he joined the Fullers at Habitat.
After the couple were fired in 2005 over disputes with the board of directors and allegations against Millard Fuller of sexual misconduct, the new leadership decided to move the nonprofit's headquarters to Atlanta.
"I would have had to move to Atlanta," Swisher said. Instead, he thought, "I might as well move to Santa Fe."
He had fallen in love with the Rocky Mountains as a high school student when he attended a church-affiliated camp in Colorado, he said.
Swisher came to Santa Fe Habitat for Humanity fluent in the organization's legacy and wanted to use that knowledge to increase its reach in the community.
Volunteers have built 53 homes under Swisher's tenure - about 44 percent of the homes built since the office was established more than three decades ago. He also added a home repair and renovation program for low-income homeowners after the local nonprofit Open Hands, which had provided such services, shut down in 2012. Habitat now does about 15 to 20 home repairs a year, often roof work, with the help of state and city funding and by tapping into repair programs through The Home Depot, Wells Fargo Bank and U.S. Bank.
Swisher instituted solar panels as a standard feature of Santa Fe Habitat homes in early 2018.
Habitat board President Randy Hibben praised Swisher. "He has brought to the forefront the affordable housing issue," Hibben said. "He has made the point that affordable housing has become more critical."
Board member Kim Shanahan, a former executive director of the Santa Fe Home Builders Association and a private consultant for sustainable development projects, is particularly impressed with Swisher's solar initiative.
"I would say we have really embraced sustainability," Shanahan said. "... Our clients are more stressed by utility bills. Getting utility bills as close to zero is something Ted has uniquely embraced."
In his earlier work with Habitat, Swisher played a central role in developing the nonprofit into an international presence. When he joined the corporate team in Americus in 1983, Habitat had affiliates in 20 cities. He oversaw the creation of more than 500 offices, including in Australia, where he ran the Sydney office and helped establish other affiliates.
Upon Swisher's return to Americus from Australia, Millard Fuller wanted to eliminate substandard housing in the world, starting with Sumter County, Ga. Swisher became executive director of the Sumter County Initiative from 1992 to 1995.
Plains, Ga., in Sumter County, is the hometown of former President Jimmy Carter, who had gotten involved with Habitat in 1984 just after Swisher came on board.
Swisher worked on several home construction projects with Carter.
"Before Carter, people didn't know what Habitat for Humanity was," Swisher said. "Then when you told them about it, they would say it's a bad idea. Jimmy Carter changed all that. Because he was supportive of it, people thought it was a great idea. We went to New York City. We were on the Today Show and in the New York Times."
Tina Redondo knows firsthand the effect Habitat can have on a struggling family. Eight years ago, she and her two daughters moved from a single-wide mobile home in Santa Fe into a new three-bedroom house with a garage and three covered patios built by Habitat volunteers.
Redondo, a certified nursing assistant for more than 10 years, makes monthly payments of $438 for the 1,200-square-foot home, which cost $130,000.
She knows the house inside and out.
She was required to put in 350 hours of construction labor on the home but ended up logging more than 1,000 hours, she said. For six years, she also took part in Habitat's Women Build, a one-week program each year in which teams of women work on a home.
"I overcame the fear of going on a roof," she said. "I was leaning over the edge of the roof with a hammer in my hand."
Redondo doesn't believe she could have ever become a homeowner without Habitat, something she said "has been life changing."

Texto completo: President Trump could address a joint session of Congress in the middle of a Senate trial weighing whether to eject him from office.
The president’s annual State of the Union address is traditionally scheduled for late January or early in February. This year, the Senate is likely to be in the midst of a trial weighing two articles of impeachment against Trump that accuse him of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress.
The scheduling clash could afford Trump a unique opportunity to stage a defense from the House chamber, or to criticize the impeachment process before the entire Congress and a national television audience.
Republican strategist Ron Bonjean, a former top aide to House and Senate GOP leaders, said the president could denounce impeachment as an impediment to his successful agenda.
“Trump never lets an attack go unanswered, so it’s a strong possibility that he could use his address to point out the progress he has made while going after the House Democratic leadership for putting themselves first politically instead of solving problems for American voters,” Bonjean told the Washington Examiner.
The State of the Union address takes place in the House chamber with an audience that includes House and Senate lawmakers, the president’s Cabinet, the diplomatic corps, Supreme Court justices, and the media.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat, holds the authority to invite the president to address Congress each year. She hasn’t announced a date yet, but the president’s annual address almost always takes place before mid-February.
Pelosi last year postponed Trump’s State of the Union address by one week because of a spending impasse between Democrats and the president that had caused a partial government shutdown.
Trump delivered the address to Congress on Feb. 5.
The House is all but guaranteed to send the articles of impeachment to the Senate this week, setting up a January trial.
But it’s not clear how long a trial would last. The Senate took six weeks to deliberate on two articles of impeachment against President Bill Clinton in 1999.
Senate Republicans, including Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican, have signaled they are pushing for a quick dismissal.
"This thing will come to the Senate, and it will die quickly, and I will do everything I can to make it die quickly," Graham told CNN International on Sunday.
But Democrats are calling for witnesses who will bolster the case against Trump, including former national security adviser John Bolton and acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney.
Trump has signaled interest in compelling testimony from his own list of officials, including Hunter Biden and House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, a California Democrat, who Trump and Republicans believe orchestrated the whistleblower complaint that led to the impeachment investigation.
If Trump is invited to deliver his State of the Union speech during his Senate trial, it would not be the first time a president addressed Congress while it was deciding whether to throw him out of office.
Clinton delivered his State of the Union address to a joint session of Congress on Jan. 19, 1999. At the time, the Senate was conducting a trial that weighed perjury and obstruction of justice articles of impeachment against Clinton.
Clinton didn’t mention the impeachment at all in his speech and instead focused on Social Security, education reform, and “a new dawn for America” on the cusp of the 21st century. The Senate acquitted him of both charges on Feb. 12, 1999.
Clinton called on Congress to “let it be said … that we put aside our divisions and found a new hour of healing and hopefulness; that we joined together to serve and strengthen the land we love.”
Jim Manley, a Democratic strategist and former top aide in Senate leadership, said Trump may not want to address Congress after impeachment, but he should be invited.
“Assuming he has the courage to show up for a State of the Union address after being impeached by the House, which I don't think is a given, I believe that he should absolutely be given the chance to give the address,” Manley told the Washington Examiner. "He is still the president, after all.”

Trump is closing the 2020 gap: Poll

Texto completo: As the economy continues to grow and support for impeachment dwindles, President Trump’s reelection is looking more and more likely.

A new IBD/TIPP poll has Trump leading every Democratic candidate except front-runner Joe Biden, who leads the president by 5 points.
Compare the results to last month’s IBD poll. In that survey, Biden led Trump by 10 points, and Elizabeth Warren beat him by 8 points. Now, Trump is leading Warren by 4 points and cutting into Biden’s lead.
If there’s one thing 2016 taught me, it’s that polls are rarely trustworthy. But to its credit, the IBD/TIPP poll had one of the only accurate predictions in 2016. While every other poll concluded that Hillary Clinton would beat Trump by a wide margin, IBD/TIPP warned that the race would be close, with Clinton at 42% and Trump at 40%. That's not at all far from the national popular vote result.
No poll is perfect, but this month’s results do seem to reflect a common sentiment across the electorate. The Dow Jones Industrial Average’s recent surge has left investors content, and the gradual economic growth in important swing states will undoubtedly influence these regions more than Washington’s political maneuvering.

Many of the blue-collar workers who turned out for Trump in 2016 did so for economic reasons. Regardless of whether Trump is directly responsible for the recent economic boom, many of these voters will attribute it to his presidency for the same reason they associated the 2008 recession with former President George W. Bush.

Impeachment, too, has soured in the swing states. A recent New York Times poll showed Trump taking leads in key states such as Florida, Wisconsin, and Michigan, a data point consistent with the idea that Democrats took things too far, as my colleague David Freddoso wrote at the time.

Biden is still the most popular Democratic candidate, hairy legs and all. Unlike Warren and Bernie Sanders, he appears to be reasonable, and his support has yet to drop. The individual faults of the Warren and Sanders campaigns have certainly contributed to their recent drops, but Biden’s narrowing lead proves that this isn’t a problem with any individual Democrat — it’s a problem for all of them.

The real reasons the US government is so secretive about UFOs

Texto completo: Two years ago Sunday, the New York Times broke the stunning story of a secret Pentagon program to study unidentified flying objects. That story led me to delve into this strange world. I've learned some interesting stuff about UFOs ("unidentified aerial phenomena," or "UAP," as the Pentagon refers to them) since then. But there's one problem.
The United States government makes it very hard to figure out what and where UFO-related stuff is going on.
Is that because the government is behind some great conspiracy to cover up the proof of alien visitation to Earth? Is it because the government is in cahoots with alien species to create human-alien hybrids?
Perhaps, but I suspect not.
What I believe is really going on here is that the few individuals in the U.S. government who know about this issue believe the phenomena might be a threat. And that they don't know how to deal with it.
So, what informs the government's fear?
Well, first off, the nuclear issue.
If you ask a Pentagon representative about a specific UFO incident, as I did most recently last week, you'll get a boring response like: "Our aviators train as they fight. Any intrusions that may compromise the security of our operations, tactics, or procedures is of great concern. As the investigation of unidentified aerial phenomena sightings is ongoing, we will not discuss individual sighting reports or observations."
By "aviators," the Pentagon is referencing the particular frequency with which UFOs tend to interact with U.S. naval aviators operating off aircraft carriers. But what the Pentagon is leaving out is why the UFOs tend to run into those naval aviators. And that cuts to the heart of why the Pentagon is concerned about UFOs.
Because the government's assessment, though they won't admit it, is that the UFOs are popping up near the aircraft carriers due to those carriers being nuclear-powered. Note also that UFOs also like to pop up near nuclear submarines and Air Force nuclear weapons bases. Now recognize that this paradigm has been occurring since the Manhattan Project operations at Los Alamos, New Mexico, and also at nuclear sites in the Soviet Union and Russia.
Oh, and as Robert Hastings documents, these UFOs have sometimes even temporarily shut down U.S. nuclear weapons systems. Interesting, right?
Now recall what I just said: The modern UFO phenomena really gets going at exactly the same time as the Manhattan Project. Has humanity's perfection of nuclear energy piqued someone or something's curiosity in us?
Don't get me wrong.
This isn't to say that these UFOs are hostile (although it must be noted that the diverging shapes, behaviors, and capability patterns of UFOs suggest more than one originating source). On the contrary, UFOs appear to be quite friendly, except when rather ill-advised Russian aircrews attempt to engage them.
But pretend you're a senior military or intelligence officer.
You see the nuclear connection point, and you're struck by something odd going on. Now, add to the nuclear issue that some UFOs are intelligently operated machines capable of instantaneously reaching hypersonic speeds. Oh, and that they're also anti-gravity and invisibility capable, and they have been tracked moving in and out of Earth orbit, the atmosphere, and underwater. Suddenly, you have something that is making the U.S. military's most advanced capabilities, and those of every other military on Earth, look like an absurd joke in comparison.
You're left with an unpleasant conclusion: If whatever is controlling these things intends harm, we don't have a chance.
Again, put yourself in the military officer's shoes. Something has repeatedly shown it can easily find carrier strike groups, which are designed and operated to be hidden in the far oceans, and to find nuclear ballistic missile submarines running near totally silent deep under the water. Something can penetrate the most securely guarded areas of the most important areas in the U.S. military and render our most critical deterrent platforms improbable. For Pentagon planners, this is Armageddon-level stuff.
But the truth is clear: If it wanted to, something strange could defeat America without raising a sweat.
The extension is that even if the U.S. government believes, as it does, that these UFOs aren't Chinese or Russian, publicizing the issue itself risks another danger. Namely, that if the U.S. shares what it knows about UFOs, China or Russia (the Russian government has long been very interested in UFOs) might learn enough to replicate the associated technologies behind UFOs for themselves. And seeing as those technologies are almost certainly built around space-time manipulation, if Beijing or Moscow figures it out before the U.S. does, we have a rather large problem.
This isn't to say that the U.S. government is sitting idle. Whatever one thinks about the claims of those such as Bob Lazar, who says he worked on crashed UFOs at Area 51, and I'm not convinced of his story, civilian and military government agencies retain active programs to ascertain the source, capabilities, and intent of UFOs. Indeed, at least some material from crashed UFOs is in U.S. government possession.
Just don't count on the military to share more of what it knows anytime soon. Their understanding of the phenomena and professional instincts weigh heavily toward more secrecy.
What of the politicians?
President Trump has admitted he has been briefed on UFOs, and Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama likely were too. Interestingly, when asked about it, both former presidents jump to joking nondenials. But seeing as they have few good answers, they likely believe there's no point in scaring folks and scarring social norms absent a solution.
Where does this leave us?
Well, with the need to keep pushing this issue. But also with confidence. It will take time, but we'll get to the truth eventually. After all, the UFOs keep popping up. And considering their ability to cloak, there's only one obvious answer as to why they let themselves be seen.
At least sometimes, they want to be seen.

Media don’t completely ignore racism and anti-Semitism by Black Hebrew Israelites following Jersey City terrorism

Texto completo: The national media’s response to news that a Jersey City, New Jersey, gunman was connected to the Black Hebrew Israelites has not been as bad as I feared. It has not been great, but it also has not been terrible.

That is about the nicest way I can put it.

As predicted, there have been none of the usual attempts by the press to jumpstart a national conversation about the dangers of radicalization and weaponized rhetoric, a curious and seemingly selective silence. Also, as predicted, one of the newsrooms that provided the Black Hebrew Israelites with friendly coverage in the past has gone totally silent following news last week that the cult is connected to a targeted shooting spree that left three dead inside a Kosher grocery market and another dead elsewhere.
The Washington Post, for example, published a glossy profile in January titled, “Who are the Black Israelites at the center of the viral standoff at the Lincoln Memorial.” The profile came as the whole of the news media was promoting a story alleging falsely that students from Covington Catholic High School had harassed an elderly Native American protester at the Lincoln Memorial. The Washington Post's January profile is sure to mention the time the fringe group was mentioned by name on a popular rapper’s album. The Washington Post profile even claims the group’s presence in January at the Lincoln Memorial “was, for the group, quite mundane,” adding further that “Israelite street preaching in parts of D.C., Philadelphia and New York is commonplace, a familiar if odd accent to city life.” What the profile does not mention is the group’s history of over-the-top racism and anti-Semitism.
Since the publication of that Washington Post article, the Black Hebrew Israelites have been implicated in a deadly attack that is being investigated now as an act of domestic terrorism. As of this writing, the Washington Post has published only a single, fleeting mention of the group since the Dec. 10 shooting spree. A Dec. 15 report mentions the Black Hebrew Israelite connection, adding further that its members “often preach anti-Semitism.” That’s it. That is the full extent of the Washington Post’s efforts to investigate the fringe group that law enforcement officials say is connected to the Dec. 10 attack. All other references that appear on the Washington Post’s pages have been aggregated from competing newsrooms, including the New York Times and the Associated Press.

The Covington Catholic event deserved an entire original profile from the Washington Post, but not the Jersey City attack?
Uh, OK.

That said, the news coverage of the Black Hebrew Israeli connection to the Jersey City attack has not been all terrible. Despite its disgraceful coverage before the attack, the New York Times has done a decent job since the Jersey City attack of reporting on both the cult's connection to the Dec. 10 event and its deep anti-Semitic and racist roots.

The Black Hebrew Israelites are “an extremist sect that espouses anti-Semitism,” reads one report. A separate report similarly refers to the cult as an “extremist sect,” adding further that it believes “Jews are impostors and espouses anti-Semitism.” Yet another report is careful to mention that the Black Hebrew Israelites have “been described as a hate group.” Another report calls it a “fringe religious group that has expressed hostility to Jews.” A New York Times editorial is even sure to mention that the Black Hebrew Israelites cult “is hostile to Jews.” Many of the reports are also a bit too insistent on notifying the reader that the cult is not known for acts of violence, but that can be defended easily as the New York Times merely providing relevant context.

Compare that to the friendly profile of the Black Hebrew Israelites when the Times was engaged in the broader effort to smear the Covington Catholic students. Better late than never.

Texto completo: Erica Tishman, arquitecto y vicepresidente de una compañía de gestión de proyectos, murió trágicamente esta mañana al caerle en la cabeza un escombro que se desprendió de un edificio en Midtown West.
La policía dijo que Tishman caminaba por la calle 49 y 7ma avenida , alrededor de las 10:45 a.m., cuando fue golpeada por un trozo de fachada del edificio. Fue declarada muerta en la escena, informó New York Post.
Los registros del edificio de la ciudad muestran que la propiedad, 729 7th Avenue, fue citada en abril por “no mantener la fachada exterior del edificio y los accesorios”.
Los inspectores de construcción observaron que “la terracota dañada en áreas por encima del piso 15 en varios lugares representa un peligro de caída para los peatones”.
Tishman, de 60 años, era vicepresidenta de Zubatkin Owner Representation LLC. Recibió una licenciatura en la Universidad de Princeton en 1981 y una maestría en arquitectura de la Escuela de Graduados de Diseño de la Universidad de Harvard, según su perfil en LinkedIn.
Nacida como Erica Lindenbaum, se casó con el analista financiero Steven Tishman el 20 de junio de 1982, según el anuncio de la boda de la pareja en The New York Times.
También era la nieta de Abraham Lindenbaum, ex presidente de Brooklyn Law School.
Los Tishman han sido miembros de la Sinagoga Central en Manhattan desde 1992, y Erica sirvió como síndica en el templo.

Trump threatens to bypass Commission on Presidential Debates

Texto completo: White House Roundup
WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump made clear Monday that he intends to participate in at least three general election debates, but he is threatening to sidestep the nonprofit group charged with running them.
"I look very much forward to debating whoever the lucky person is who stumbles across the finish line in the little watched Do Nothing Democrat Debates," Trump tweeted Monday morning after the New York Times reported that he was considering skipping them entirely.
Trump said his record "is so good" that "perhaps I would consider more than 3 debates." But he also complained, without evidence, that the Commission on Presidential Debates is "stacked with Trump Haters & Never Trumpers" and threatened to bypass them.
"As President, the debates are up.......to me, and there are many options, including doing them directly & avoiding the nasty politics of this very biased Commission," Trump wrote, adding that he would "make a decision at an appropriate time."
Trump tussled with the commission as well as Fox News about the debates during the 2016 election cycle.
He incorrectly claimed Monday on Twitter that the commission was "forced to publicly apologize for modulating my microphone" in the first general election debate against Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in September 2016.
The commission acknowledged after the September 2016 debate at Hofstra University in New York that "there were issues regarding Donald Trump's audio that affected the sound level in the debate hall," but it did not apologize.
In a statement, the commission said, "The televised general election debates are an important part of our democratic process." It said the commission has conducted 30 general election presidential and vice presidential debates since 1988.
"Our record is one of fairness, balance and non-partisanship," the statement said.
The commission has scheduled three presidential debates and one vice presidential debate for the 2020 election cycle. The University of Notre Dame, the University of Michigan, and Belmont University have been tapped to hold presidential debates. The commission selected the University of Utah to host the vice presidential debate.

Texto completo: The United States expelled two Chinese Embassy officials after they drove onto a military base near Norfolk this fall without authorization, according to a report in The New York Times on Sunday.
The report, which cited anonymous officials, did not specify which installation the Chinese officials drove onto, but it said the base includes special operations forces. Joint Expeditionary Base Little Creek and Dam Neck Annex in Virginia Beach are home to Navy SEALs, who also train and use other bases in the region.
Navy Region Mid-Atlantic in Norfolk is in charge of security at Navy installations in the state. It referred questions to the State Department.
"We take the security of all our installations very seriously. We don't have any information to provide about the alleged incident," the command said in a statement.
The State Department did not immediately comment.
The New York Times reported that the Chinese officials and their wives drove up to a checkpoint to enter the base, but a guard told them to go through the gate and turn around to exit after realizing they weren't permitted to be there. Instead, the group continued onto the base, evading military personnel who were pursuing them, according to the Times. The vehicle finally stopped after fire trucks blocked its path.
The Times reported that Chinese officials indicated the group had not understood the guard's English instructions and had simply gotten lost. Others familiar with the incident told the newspaper that the expelled officials were on a sightseeing tour when they accidentally drove onto the base.
The FBI, which conducts counterintelligence investigations, declined to comment.
"As a standard rule, the FBI does not confirm or deny the existence of an investigation," said Christina Pullen, spokeswoman for the bureau's Norfolk field office.
Responding to the New York Times report, a spokesman for China's foreign ministry in Beijing called on the United States to reverse its decision.
"The U.S. accusations against Chinese personnel severely disregard reality," Geng Shuang said, according to Reuters.
"We strongly urge the U.S. to correct its mistake, cancel the relevant decision and protect Chinese personnel's proper rights according to the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations."

'Birdland' approach combats contraction talks Orioles

Texto completo: SAN DIEGO - When Orioles executive vice president/general manager Mike Elias addressed the team's affiliates at their recent annual dinner in San Diego, he touted the player development progress made in the first year of the team's rebuild and the momentum toward continuing that.
All that development, however, could be happening in a vastly different environment considering Major League Baseball's proposal to cut 42 minor league teams, reorganize the affiliate structure and change the way prospects get to the major leagues. It's all a part of sweeping change to the Professional Baseball Agreement that governs the relationships between MLB and Minor League Baseball and expires next year.
Many of the Orioles' affiliates have come out against the plan, with the Triple-A Norfolk Tides, Double-A Bowie Baysox and High-A Frederick Keys issuing statements praising Congress forming the "Save Minor League Baseball" task force to protect the threatened MiLB teams. Frederick is on the initial list of teams in jeopardy, according to The New York Times.
The proposal was a big part of commissioner Rob Manfred's annual winter meetings press conference, and Elias' final media session last Wednesday. Where it didn't really come up was at the affiliates dinner, which celebrated the successes of the farm system at a time when it is receiving more attention than ever. And more attention means more money.
"For us, we've found success in the current setup and we really like the way our minor leagues are situated with Baltimore, with all of them so close," Elias said. "It's all a big part of our fanbase. To us, 'Birdland' is this entity that extends beyond Baltimore and includes our minor league facilities. We like our setup. We think it's helpful for us, but any time there's new regulation, you certainly have to tailor your strategy towards it.
"Unless that happens, it's hard to know what that looks like. But I think we know how to succeed in the current setup and the current environment as well as anyone."
Ken Young, owner of Norfolk, Bowie, and Frederick and president of the Tides, said the affiliates have gotten that same impression, and he's hopeful none of those teams end up on the outside of whatever agreement is reached.
He posited that the published list of possible teams to cut was compiled by some who "didn't have a great knowledge of the minor leagues," while expressing hope that MLB "will see that it's in their best interest to do something different than the cut they were planning."
"The Orioles, and Mike may have told you this if you ask him, really like where their affiliates are right now, including Frederick," Young said. "They think they have a great situation, so Frederick being on that list wasn't caused by the Orioles, because the Orioles' desire is still to play in Frederick. Eventually, that's the way it's going to continue to be."
Elias didn't address the plan in the full-group setting of the annual dinner.
"I think there's some anxiousness on all of our parts when there's ideas floating around out there, but it hasn't been a topic of conversation," Elias said. "We're focused on the current setup. We had a terrific year. ... I think we have a lot to celebrate there, and some really good relationships across all of our affiliates between the front office and each minor league affiliate."
Manfred said last Wednesday that the negotiations between the two sides had been "a little more positive" while noting that the initial reporting of the proposal is "by no means a fait accompli as to what the agreement is going to look like."
He also said that MLB would be flexible, while MiLB "has taken the position that they're not willing to discuss anything but the status quo or any changes that would provide for upgrades in adequate facilities, better working conditions for our players." He added that the minor league side's actions in breaking the confidentiality of the negotiations created some ill will from the major league owners. Earlier this fall, MiLB representatives presented the same kind of intransigence about their major league counterparts.
MLB subsidizes minor league baseball "to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars every single year," Manfred said when asked whether he appreciated that teams in small towns across the country are a conduit to growing the game.
"Given that we are already subsidizing at the level that I've previously referred to, I think it is unreasonable to come to a bargaining table and say, 'Yeah, we got some facilities. We know they're substandard. In fact, they may not be fixable, but we're not willing to do anything about that.' That's unreasonable."
MiLB, for its part, issued a lengthy statement Friday to dispute most of what Manfred claimed, pushing back on everything from facilities issues to travel and player welfare while noting what's overseen by the major league clubs versus the minor league affiliates.
Part of the issue of facilities standards applies to the player development conditions at the Maryland stadiums that house Orioles affiliates, too. Some of the charms and quirks of a minor league stadium are less so when it comes to taking batting practice and building professional athletes.
There's an expectation at some affiliates that investment toward upgrades that best align with the organization's player development goals are on the horizon. And while each side has painted the other's negotiators as stubborn at one turn or another, the scope of what's been proposed and what significant changes could mean should be plenty to allow for an agreement.
"This has been one of the great relationships in American sports history," Bowie general manager Brian Shallcross said. "It's the reason our sport covers every corner of the United States, the system between Major League Baseball and Minor League Baseball. Look at any other sport. It just doesn't work like the baseball model works.
"I think that at the end of the day, that's still going to be intact, and we've got to make sure that we respect the wishes of our major league partners and certainly that the game of baseball takes top priority, for what's good for the game."

Another partisan divide: The Frank Party versus the Polite Party

Texto completo: The political temperature seems at a boiling point. Online, on TV, even in our living rooms, we see constant political conflict over matters both consequential and frivolous. A recent New York Times article sought to pinpoint what exactly divides us. As it points out, partisanship involves deep differences of principle. But it notes other distinctions as well: Our divide, for instance, extends to markers of identity, particularly defining ourselves in distinction from our political opponents.
This analysis needs at least one more point of comparison: temperament. We are witnessing a sorting of the electorate between two dispositions: a Frank Party and a Polite Party.
This distinction was pinpointed long ago by an 18th-century French thinker, Montesquieu. Montesquieu held great sway over our Founding Fathers. The Federalist Papers refers to him as the “celebrated Montesquieu” and as the “oracle” regarding the principle of separation of powers.
The Frenchman discusses our temperamental divide in his seminal work, The Spirit of the Laws (1748). He argues that all men, despite many differences, pursue honor. Therefore, “the world is the school of what is called honor, the universal master that should everywhere guide us.” This honor originates in our self-love, manifesting in demands for “preference and distinction.”
But honor does not guide all in the same fashion. Montesquieu claims that honor’s education brings “a certain frankness in the mores, and a certain politeness in the manners.” From these two tendencies spring part of our partisan divide.
The Republican Party is our Frank Party. Its partisans claim to value “straight talk,” caustically delivered. Sometimes, giving offense here becomes the point, itself a claim to truthful simplicity. Some do so, Montesquieu explains, out of a devotion to what they consider truth and simplicity. Others act it out for the preference and the distinction it provides from adoring watchers. Since “speaking the truth appears to be daring and free,” they want its attendant reputation for courageousness. In fact, Montesquieu observes what we often see said by Republicans in praise of President Trump: “Such a man seems dependent only on things and not on the way another receives them.” Regardless of intent, this independence shows its power in rejecting the seemingly stifling etiquette of “woke” and “politically correct” cultures.
The Democrats much more exemplify the Polite Party. Many of them observe and enforce a rigorous decorum in political discourse. “Cancel culture” shows this policing in full force, ever ready to descend on those ignorant of or unwilling to observe its dictates. This temperament, too, can originate from something noble: We need to observe basic proprieties to live together and to pursue social goods in common.
But this “pure source” is rarely the real one, Montesquieu observes. Instead, he grounds it in arrogance. This arrogance itself is a yearning for distinction at the expense of others. “We flatter ourselves,” Montesquieu observes, “that our manners prove that we are not common and that we have not lived with the sort of people who have been neglected through the ages.” In other words, Democrats’ polite decorum seeks to separate them in perception from the uncouth “deplorables” out there. “Virtue-signaling” can approximate this pursuit, seeking to showcase one’s enlightened moral refinement in comparison to the rubes.
Neither tendency is going away, just as is neither party. Nor should we desire either frankness or politeness to do so, given the need both for some form of honesty and decorum. But perhaps both require interaction with a third characteristic Montesquieu discusses: civility. Our Frank and Polite parties each, at times, criticize the quality.
For the Frank Party, civility entails deception and weakness. For the Polite one, it might mean letting crass prejudice pass.
But Montesquieu’s civility rightly moderates each temperament where they need it. Civility’s rules restrain all from displaying our own vices in the hope of not further corrupting each other. To the Frank Party, civility guards against “the vices that come from a harsh spirit.” To the Polite Party, Montesquieu counsels against the tendency to flatter the vices of the powerful, thereby also inflaming one’s own ills.
As 2020 looms, the parties’ distinct temperaments will only intensify. Civility surely will not be what partisans want in their political discourse. But Montesquieu shows it might be what we need.

Texto completo: While saying that he intends to debate the Democratic Party nominee in 2020, President Donald Trump on Monday raised the possibility that he might refuse to join in debates run by a special commission which hosts those gatherings, claiming on Twitter that the Commission on Presidential Debates was biased against him.
"The problem is that the so-called Commission on Presidential Debates is stacked with Trump Haters & Never Trumpers," the President said on Twitter, but not naming any specific names at the CPD.
"3 years ago they were forced to publicly apologize for modulating my microphone in the first debate," as the President again fumed about a technical malfunction which temporarily caused issues for his microphone in 2016.

I look very much forward to debating whoever the lucky person is who stumbles across the finish line in the little watched Do Nothing Democrat Debates. My record is so good on the Economy and all else, including debating, that perhaps I would consider more than 3 debates.....
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 16, 2019
....The problem is that the so-called Commission on Presidential Debates is stacked with Trump Haters & Never Trumpers. 3 years ago they were forced to publicly apologize for modulating my microphone in the first debate against Crooked Hillary. As President, the debates are up...
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 16, 2019
....to me, and there are many options, including doing them directly & avoiding the nasty politics of this very biased Commission. I will make a decision at an appropriate time but in the meantime, the Commission on Presidential Debates is NOT authorized to speak for me (or R’s)!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 16, 2019
The President's tweets confirmed the basics of a New York Times story from last Friday, which said Mr. Trump is concerned about who the Commission will choose as debate moderators.
In a statement issued Monday which did not reply directly to the President, the Commission gave no sign of abandoning its role from the past eight Presidential elections.
"The televised general election debates are an important part of our democratic process," read a statement issued by the group.
"Since 1988, the Commission on Presidential Debates has conducted 30 general election presidential and vice presidential debates. Our record is one of fairness, balance and non-partisanship," the statement read.
The non-profit group was formed in the late 1980's, and has helped run the Presidential and Vice Presidential debates every four years since then.
The leaders include members of both parties - like Frank Fahrenkopf, Jr., a former chair of the Republican National Committee, and former Democratic National Committee chair Paul Kirk, Jr. - plus a number of former members of Congress from both parties.
The commission has already set the dates for three Presidential debates and one Vice Presidential debate in 2020:
The three 2020 Presidential debates are scheduled for:
September 29 - University of Notre Dame
October 15 - University of Michigan
October 22 - Belmont University (Nashville, Tennessee)
The sole Vice Presidential debate is set for October 7 at the University of Utah.

“Los cerdos salvajes son destructivos de muchas maneras, impactan varios sectores”, dijo al diario neoyorquino Dale Nolte, en referencia al daño que pueden hacer en las poblaciones de aves, anfibios y reptiles .

El reporte dice que los animales han sido llevados por humanos desde Texas a otros estados con el fin de estimular a los cazadores. El problema es que son especies bastante prolíficas. Una hembra puede tener dos partos de seis crías por año.
En Canadá también fueron traídos para la caza en la década de los ochenta. Se creyó que no iban a resistir el invierno, pero expertos comprobaron que los cerdos aprendieron a hacer madrigueras para aislarse del frío. Otros han desarrollado pieles gruesas.
El gobierno de Estados Unidos hace seguimiento a la situación en la frontera norte y respondería con un ataque aéreo contra los animales.
Los cerdos son portadores de al menos 33 enfermedades , entre ellas la tuberculosis bovina. A los animales se les culpa de los brotes de E. Coli en lechuga y espinaca ya que los cerdos estarían defecando en las granjas.

Texto completo: TORONTO -- Before you walk inside Another Story Bookshop, you will see a poster featuring the John Lennon lyric "A Working Class Hero Is Something to Be" in the window. During a visit in the spring, the books on display included "Policing Indigenous Movements" and "Peaceful Fights for Equal Rights."
The guiding principle of the bookstore, located in Toronto's Roncesvalles Village neighborhood, is social justice, and it makes itself known right away. That was a goal of its founder, Sheila Koffman, who opened Another Story in 1987 in an effort to place, as she put it, "diverse books into diverse hands."
"She wanted to give a platform for those voices," said Eric McCall, a longtime employee, "to really champion new authors that were people of color and queer authors."
The store was originally located in the basement of a building on Danforth and Broadview, and employees remember Koffman, who died of cancer two years ago, helping customers with children carry their strollers up and down the stairs.
Her brother, Joel Koffman, now owns the store with McCall and another employee, Laura Ash. Together with Anjula Gogia, who serves as the events coordinator, the four of them see themselves as continuing her legacy.
"'Ownership' doesn't mean much to us, but the responsibility and workload does," McCall said. "The work never really stops, so it just feels like a continuation of what our jobs were before in a lot of ways."
Children's books are a major draw, and half of the store is devoted to them. It also operates a wholesale business, supplying children's titles to schools and libraries.
For adults, there is a mix of fiction and nonfiction, with a focus on Canadian authors, who represent about two-thirds of the selection. The owners also look for writers of color, queer authors and indigenous writers. "We don't really worry about best sellers. That can be acquired elsewhere. We really want to promote those marginalized voices," McCall said.
Readings and other bookstore events typically begin with "land acknowledgment," identifying the indigenous people who lived there first. In Another Story's case, that includes the nations of Huron-Wendat, Petun, the Haudenosaunee Confederacy and the Mississaugas of the Credit River. The Porcupine Warriors, a local indigenous collective, held a teach-in in January at the store to raise money for the Wet'suwet'en First Nation, whose members have fought the TransCanada pipeline expansion.
Because the owners also own the building, that has helped keep Another Story afloat amid Toronto's increasingly expensive real-estate market. Sales and profits have grown steadily, Ash said, and all eight full-time and five part-time workers earn at least 15 Canadian dollars an hour (about $ 11.38), reflecting the store's support for the "15andFairness" campaign to raise the national minimum wage to that rate.
That the bookstore has held onto its roots would have made its founder happy, McCall said.
"I still notice every time when a customer comes in who's clearly never been here before. They look around for a minute and say out loud to whoever they are with, 'Oh, it's a lefty bookstore,"' McCall said. "Sheila would have liked that. We must be doing something right if people are still saying that."
Correction : Nov. 18, 2019An earlier version of this article misstated Another Story's original location. It was at Danforth and Broadview, not Bloor and Broadview.

Gesture of 'White Power'? Academies Want to Know

Texto completo: The Army and Naval academies said they were looking into whether hand symbols by cadets and midshipmen at a football game on Saturday were related to hate groups.
United States military officials said they were investigating whether Army cadets and Navy midshipmen had flashed hand symbols associated with hate groups during a nationally televised pregame show before their football matchup on Saturday.
A broadcast showed cadets from the United States Military Academy and midshipmen from the Naval Academy in the stands displaying the sign at least five times behind ESPN broadcaster Rece Davis before the game, which was held at the Lincoln Financial Field in Philadelphia on Saturday.
President Trump attended the game and met with players in both locker rooms before the game.
The United States Military Academy announced on Sunday night that it had started an investigation into the use of hand gestures by a "few" cadets during ESPN's "College GameDay" broadcast.
"The United States Military Academy is fully committed to developing leaders of character who embody the Army values," Lt. Gen. Darryl Williams, the academy's superintendent, said in a statement. Naval Academy officials have appointed a "preliminary inquiry officer to conduct an internal investigation into the hand gestures," Cmdr. Alana Garas, an academy spokeswoman, said on Sunday evening. "Based on findings of the investigation, those involved will be held appropriately accountable. It would be inappropriate to speculate any further while we are conducting this investigation."
The gesture, which looks like an O.K. sign, is formed by "the thumb and forefinger joined together in a circle, the remaining three fingers splayed out behind," according to the Southern Poverty Law Center.
The center, a nonprofit group that monitors hate groups, noted last year that white nationalists, neo-Nazis and Klansmen "have increasingly begun using the use of the symbol both to signal their presence to the like-minded, as well as to identify potentially sympathetic recruits among young trolling artists flashing it."
The Anti-Defamation League also described the symbol as a hate sign that forms the letters "WP" for "white power." Officials of the United States Coast Guard reprimanded a service member who flashed a similar gesture in the background of a television interview on MSNBC last year.
Viewers of the pregame show on Saturday noticed the gestures and shared clips on social media.
"Please someone tell me I didn't see what I thought I just saw," one user wrote on Twitter, asking "white power sign?"
"They are well aware of what they are doing and think it's funny. Disgusting," another Twitter user wrote.
Though the intent behind flashing the symbol was unclear, the gesture is also part of a juvenile prank popular in junior military ranks called the circle game: A person makes the O.K. symbol below the waistline, and if another person looks at it, the person making the gesture is allowed to punch the other, often in the arm.
On Twitter, Mr. Trump congratulated the Navy Midshipmen, which defeated the Army Black Knights, 31-7, in the annual rivalry game.
The episode at the game comes after West Point announced that it had removed a racist slogan from its team's spirit flag. The flag had a skull and crossbones and "G.F.B.D.", which stands for "God Forgives, Brothers Don't," a slogan that has been associated with white supremacists. The team is continuing to use the flag without the letters.

Texto completo: An entrepreneur took over a venerable Berlin daily, saying he wanted a new conversation about East Germany. Then his own past became the news.
BERLIN -- When a wealthy married couple bought the Berliner Zeitung, a distinguished but ailing survivor of the East German press, they timed their newspaper's big revamp for the 30th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall last month.
In an attention-grabbing two-page editorial, the entrepreneurial couple, Silke and Holger Friedrich, urged a reimagining of history since German reunification. They argued that 30 years after the wall came down, East Germans should wrest back control of their own narrative from the West, and stirred controversy by defending the last East German leader.
But there was an essential piece of information that they left out.
A week later, a rival newspaper reported that Mr. Friedrich, 53, had been an informant for the Stasi, the feared secret police of Communist East Germany in the late 1980s.
Instead of apologizing, Mr. Friedrich chose to come out fighting.
He argued that he was coerced into being an informant and that he worked with his supposed victims to ensure that he disclosed little of value. He insisted that he has little, if anything, to be sorry for. But at the same time, he acknowledged that he could not be sure whether anyone was harmed as a result of his actions.
"I'm not an Easterner who has to apologize. I'm not an Easterner who needs to grovel," he said in an interview at his newspaper's offices.
In the hope of telling his side of the story, Mr. Friedrich granted access to his copy of his Stasi files to The New York Times and The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper. He also had the former head of the Stasi Archives and a historian write an official report on his files.
In their report, the archivist and the historian verified the authenticity of the files, although they noted that there was no way of knowing whether the hundreds of pages represented all that the Stasi ever had on him.
The case reflects the debate within Germany over the legacy of the Stasi and those who collaborated with it and how some perceptions are evolving.
In its final throes, the Stasi used an estimated 189,000 informants to help maintain its grip on a Communist state of about 16 million. It was a source of terror in East Germany and of deep shame after its fall.
But in recent years, many Germans have taken a more nuanced view of those who collaborated with the secret police as it has become clearer that many of them were blackmailed or otherwise coerced.
"People are more willing to discuss the ambiguities surrounding those individuals who were acting as informers," said Ned Richardson-Little, a historian at the University of Erfurt, in the former East Germany.
These changing perceptions have also been reflected in popular culture.
In 2006 the Academy Award-winning film "The Lives of Others" focused on the Stasi's coldhearted methods. But last year, the film "Gundermann" was somewhat sympathetic in its portrayal of a real-life story of a Stasi informant, a coal miner turned popular singer. It won national awards and drew large audiences in the east in particular.
Mr. Friedrich's file has more than 700 pages, more than 500 of them related to surveillance of him, rather than by him.
He was eventually dropped by his Stasi handlers, who noted in his file that he was proving unproductive.
The extensive report by Marianne Birthler, a former head of the Stasi archives, and the historian Ilko-Sascha Kowalczuk, noted that even if Mr. Friedrich was trying to avoid harming others, there is no way to be certain that he didn't.
Asked why he had not disclosed his Stasi past earlier, Mr. Friedrich said, "We felt it was better to get the business going before this came out to be better able deal with it."
His interactions with the Stasi began after he joined the East German Army in 1986. In 1987, after being arrested on suspicion of planning to flee the country and held in a Stasi facility, he was given a choice between prison or collaboration.
"It didn't take me 30 seconds to make up my mind," Mr. Friedrich said in the interview, adding that he had always been honest with his family and friends about his involvement.
In Mr. Friedrich's file, it said his handlers instructed him to befriend several specific people. But he appeared to have returned with little valuable intelligence.
The storm around Mr. Friedrich's Stasi file has become a public spectacle.
It capped a turbulent introduction to public life for a couple who were little known until it was announced that they had bought the Berliner Verlag newspaper group, which publishes the Berliner Zeitung and several smaller titles.
Mr. Friedrich made his money in tech in the past decade or two, including a stint at the consulting firm McKinsey, and Ms. Friedrich founded an English-German private school in Berlin. They promised to bring technological and business expertise to bear on reviving the newspaper company. Its titles retain only a small fraction of the combined 2.5 million circulation that they claimed before the wall fell.
But several missteps brought controversy in the following weeks.
In one instance, they ran a glowing article on a business which Mr. Friedrich owned a stake in without noting the connection.
Still, the Friedrichs' purchase of Berliner Verlag, for a price that is not publicly known, made it the only major newspaper publishing house in Germany in the hands of independent Easterners.
Their debut editorial attacked the bedrock of the official German narrative about the fall of the wall on Nov. 9. 1989 and reunification. For example, the couple suggested that keeping President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia closer to Germany might have been a wise move.
But it was another remark that provoked more intense controversy. They suggested that East Germany's last dictator, Egon Krenz -- who was part of efforts to repress the peaceful revolution of the 1980s -- should be thanked for not violently cracking down on protesters.
While some said they went too far, others welcomed the call for a rethink.
"I might not share his opinions, but it's about the question of who has the authority to interpret East German history and the history of the fall of the wall, and that is justified," said Mandy Tröger, who teaches media and communication at the University of Munich. "Especially if you look at conventional media narratives, this op-ed can be seen as an act of emancipation."
Robert Ide, the managing editor of the paper's biggest local competitor, the Berliner Tagesspiegel, said that as an East German and a senior editor, "I think it's really a good thing that the Berliner Zeitung is being revived with new impulses."
Mr. Ide, who was 14 when the wall fell, did not criticize Mr. Friedrich for his actions as a young soldier -- but he was less indulgent of Mr. Friedrich's decisions as a rookie media owner.
"We can't presume to know how we would have acted under those circumstances, but we can ask ourselves how would we have dealt with it today as publishers," Mr. Ide said. "He could have come out with it on the 9th of November, and it could have been part of that new frank discussion."

Texto completo: Mario Sandoval was extradited from France to his native Argentina to face charges of crimes committed during the dictatorship. In France, many wonder why it took so long.
A former police officer from Argentina who has lived for more than 30 years as a university lecturer and security expert in France is being extradited on Sunday to his native country, where he is wanted for crimes against humanity, including torture, committed during the country's dictatorship, Argentine authorities said.
The news of the extradition of the former police officer, Mario Sandoval, was welcomed in Argentina by human rights activists and relatives of victims of the military regime, which killed up to 30,000 people, according to estimates, between 1976 and 1983.
But even as Mr. Sandoval was arrested at his home in a Paris suburb on Wednesday, many in France tried to fathom how a suspected torturer was able to live there for decades, teaching international affairs, participating in security conferences on Latin America and working with French security officials.
Prosecutors in Argentina have accused Mr. Sandoval, 66, of having participated in the death of an architecture student, Hernán Abriata, who disappeared in 1976 at a notorious secret detention center in Buenos Aires.
Argentine prosecutors believe he may also have be connected to the disappearance of many other civilians while he was a police officer in his 20s.
Argentina requested his extradition in 2012, but Mr. Sandoval denied the accusations and appealed every decision until he ran out of legal options. Last week, France's top administrative court approved his extradition.
Mr. Sandoval appealed the decision to the European Court of Human Rights; his appeal was rejected.
"It's a relief and a delight to see Mr. Sandoval finally extradited," said Sophie Thonon-Wesfreid, a French lawyer who has represented Argentina in the proceedings. "Hernán Abriata's mother is 92, she's been waiting for 43 years."
Mr. Sandoval's lawyer, Jérôme Rousseau, said the trial his client would face in Argentina would be "political," in a country that he said was undergoing a "purge."
Since 2006, Argentina has undergone an enormous effort to punish former military officers and their accomplices. Courts have convicted 962 of the almost 3,300 people who have been accused of crimes against humanity, including murder, torture, and stealing babies from pregnant detainees and giving them up for adoption.
Mr. Abriata was one of about 5,000 people who disappeared at the Higher School of Mechanics of the Navy, or ESMA, which was converted into Argentina's largest clandestine detention center.
The former detention center is now a human rights memorial.
Some of those suspected of these crimes, like Mr. Sandoval, moved abroad after the end of the dictatorship, delaying their prosecution and extending the wait of family members who sought justice for their missing relatives.
"This means the beginning of the end to his impunity, an impunity he enjoyed since the day he was in charge of a gang at the ESMA and kidnapped my brother," said Laura Abriata, Mr. Abriata's sister.
�After Mr. Sandoval moved to France in 1985, he taught at the Université of Marne-la-Vallée, outside of Paris, and at the New Sorbonne University. He obtained French citizenship in 1997, according to his lawyer.
At the New Sorbonne, he worked at the Institute of High Studies for Latin America, a highly regarded institution known for welcoming exiles who fled the dictatorships in Argentine, Brazil or Chile. Many of his colleagues felt Mr. Sandoval's presence there had left a stain on the institute.
"It is pathetic that someone accused of crimes against humanity, a torturer, was allowed to train young people at university," said Denis Merklen, a professor at the institute who, like Mr. Sandoval, holds French and Argentine citizenship.
Mr. Sandoval was hired as a lecturer at the institute in 1999, when France's current education minister, Jean-Michel Blanquer, ran it. Through an aide, Mr. Blanquer denied knowing at the time Mr. Sandoval was hired, about the charges he is now facing.
For more than 20 years after the end of the dictatorship, two amnesty laws in Argentina protected officials involved in the regime's crimes. The laws were overturned in 2005 -- the same year Mr. Sandoval was dismissed from the New Sorbonne, although for reasons unrelated to the accusations he currently faces.
His name was connected to the crimes committed by the dictatorship in 2008, when the Argentine newspaper Página 12 published an investigation about him.
Olivier Compagnon, a professor of contemporary history who ran the institute from 2015 to 2019 and taught an introductory class on Venezuela with Mr. Sandoval in 2003, said students complained that Mr. Sandoval was obsessed with weapons and security issues. He also questioned how the institute could have recruited someone who had so few qualifications.
Mr. Sandoval's resume from the late 1990s, which The New York Times saw, starts in 1985 and states that he taught at a dozen institutions, but didn't specify which universities he had attended.
"It's nonsensical," Mr. Compagnon said. "Today we would never hire someone with such a vague profile and resume."
Mr. Abriata's relatives said they hoped justice could now be done.
"We expect a fair trial with all the legal guarantees so his constitutional rights are respected, which none of the 30,000 who were disappeared enjoyed," Ms. Abriata, Hernán Abriata's sister, said.
Elian Peltier reported from London, and Daniel Politi from Buenos Aires.

Texto completo: It might not be true that you have relied on books to rescue a jinxed vacation, as I recently did when I tried to go hiking during a veritable monsoon. But it is definitely true that you view books and vacations as inextricably and happily linked.
Reader responses to my column of Oct. 25 drew a tight connection between a good vacation and a good book.
Some years ago, Bev Bachel of Minneapolis spent a month in Paris, "most mornings in the Jardin du Luxembourg sipping coffee, taste-testing croissants and reading books set in the City of Light. 'The Paris Pilgrims,' 'Paris to the Moon,' 'A Moveable Feast' and 'Sylvia Beach and the Lost Generation' remain top of my mind. I then spent the afternoons wandering through the neighborhoods and museums I'd read about, all the more delightful due to details I'd learned while reading."
Joanne Stohl also likes to match books with destinations. "One of my favorite pairings was to the Amazon River in Peru. I spent many an afternoon rocking in a hammock reading 'Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter' by the Peruvian author Mario Vargas Llosa. Wonderful memory and a wonderful book."
Others, such as Angela Scaletta of Minneapolis, choose books specifically for their cabin trips. "I love Helen Hoover's books, and for several years I saved them to read when we were Up North," Scaletta said. "Usually I burn through an author's work all at once, but it was more fun to read her books near where they took place."
Nancy Vernon said that books have long been a "critical part of the cabin experience. … Guests would often abandon books there, and we accumulated a small, random library.
"One summer, we ran a 'worst book of the summer' contest. Among the finalists was the book that a New York Times reviewer described as 'the worst thing written since man first scratched in the sand with a stick.' And that wasn't even the winner!"
(Sadly, a cursory Google search does not reveal which book this is.)
On her way to "a remote resort in the Caribbean," Robin Lenz panicked. Worried that she wouldn't have enough to read, she shipped a box of books to the place where she was staying.
"Needless to say, it did not arrive, and I had carried only one book with me, which I read three times that week: 'Outlander.' The box finally showed up the day I was leaving, and I left them all (and 'Outlander') for the folks who worked there."
Meanwhile, Stephanie Wilbur Ash deeply needed books to get through a Vegas vacation when she was six months pregnant and unable to partake in most of the Vegas-style fun.
"Though there was the pleasure of five-dollar buffets, everything else was obviously off-limits. No free drinks. No amusement park rides. No raw shellfish," she said.
"I spent most of the time digesting buffet calories in hotel beds reading 'Goodnight, Nebraska' by Tom McNeal. It's about the agony and ecstasy of life and loss and redemption in a small rural town. I remember lying in a crappy motel room on Lake Mead crying my eyes out when the protagonist gives his children each a small mint before they go to bed (while the rest of my party drank rum and Cokes in the blistering heat).
"It was a bummer of a vacation for me, but it was a lovely book that taught me how rural Midwestern stories are full of drama and love, just like other people's stories. It was unforgettable and influential, and it kept me from mindlessly pulling slots and losing my (maternity) shirt in the process."

Michael A. Kalm: When lies are easier to believe than the truth

Texto completo: “Who remembers the Armenians?” said Adolf Hitler to dismiss claims that the World wouldn’t let him get away with his “Final Solution.” Hitler was referring to the near genocide of the Armenian people by Turks during World War I, which by 1939, the world seemed to have forgotten.
Hitler was counting on two peculiar aspects of human nature: That people are all too ready to believe, without any real evidence, even an outrageous lie, so long as it is repeated many times and as loud as possible. And that no matter the horror of the atrocity, people just forget over time.
To these, I’ll add a third, the sometimes overwhelming temptation to tune out a barrage of continuous conflict, protecting against our own discomfort by coming to some conclusion like, “They all lie (politicians),” or, “It’s just a hoax (climate change).” With these three characteristics, truth disappears.
Which brings us to some history from just 17 years ago. Joe Wilson was a career diplomat who in 1990, was called “a true American hero” by President George H.W. Bush for his actions in Iraq. In February, 2002, Wilson was sent by the CIA to Niger to investigate a claim that Iraq was buying nuclear fuel from Niger to make weapons of mass destruction.) He found no such thing, but in March, 2003, the U.S. invaded Iraq, claiming, among other things, that the purchase happened.
Wilson, incensed, wrote an op-ed, “What I didn’t find in Africa,” in The New York Times. The administration retaliated by smearing Wilson and illegally outing his wife, Valerie Plame, blowing her secret cover with the CIA and jeopardizing covert operations she was involved in around the world. Ironically, Plame’s main job with the CIA was counter proliferation – preventing the spread of nuclear weapons!
Not only did the administration commit a federal crime by releasing Plame’s identity, they doubled down on their attacks, calling Plame a “glorified secretary,” who somehow used her “influence” to gain a “boondoggle/vacation” for her husband to go (unpaid!) to Niger. The constant smear attacks successfully distracted the public from the false reasons for going to war to the fictional story about Wilson and Plame.
Eventually, Scooter Libby would take the fall for the administration, being convicted of four of five counts stemming from his role in leaking a covert identity. President Bush commuted his sentence and the affair was forgotten.
But just as with Hitler, it is not a stretch to imagine Republicans saying, “Who remembers Joe Wilson and Valerie Plame? We can get away with anything. Just make the lies constant, repetitive, big and chock full of “conspiracies.” Blame the Democrats. Blame Obama. Blame Hillary. The American public will either believe us, or get so worn out by the barrage, that they will turn a blind eye to whatever we do.”
And thus “Never Trumpers” become “Always Trumpers,” ready to stand by their man no matter how many crimes he commits, no matter how destructive his actions are to democracy and the World.
And truth dies.
This is indeed the danger I see now. Truth is fragile. I know some very sincere Turks who insist that there was never a massacre of Armenians. And of course there are always Holocaust deniers who swear that there was never a genocide of Jews during World War II.
If this article gets printed, I am certain that in the comments section, there will be those who will thank me for bringing to light this incredible danger, and there will be others who condemn what I write as deluded liberal propaganda – or worse.
How do we determine what is true? How do we satisfy the paradox of finding truth that we can trust, while simultaneously knowing that truth, whether it is scientific truth, or the results of skillful analysis by intelligence agents, is not, and never can be, 100%?
Moreover, how do we deal with the paradox that it is much easier to believe a coherent lie, presented as an absolute truth, than it is to believe real truth, which has shades of gray, and is never 100%?
This is what I consider one of the central questions of our generation. I think our only answer is persistent remembering, and persistent speaking the truth. In 1953, Ray Bradbury wrote “Fahrenheit 451,” a novel about brave people memorizing books that were otherwise being burned. Hopefully, we will never fall to that extreme, but to guard against that nightmare, it is imperative that we all act now.
Michael A. Kalm , M.D., is a Utah psychiatrist, both of whose parents died from Alzheimer’s Disease. Remembering has always been extra important to him.

Texto completo: Felix Rohatyn, una importante figura de Wall Street a quien se adjudica haber salvado a Nueva York de la bancarrota murió el sábado a los 91 años de edad en su casa de Manhattan, anunció su hijo citado por The New York Times.
Este refugiado judío nacido en Austria y naturalizado estadounidense se hizo conocido en el campo de las finanzas acumulando éxitos en el sector de fusiones y adquisiciones y escalando lugares del prestigioso banco de inversión Lazard Frères (ahora Lazard).
Hábil negociador, se convirtió en un asesor escuchado por las élites políticas estadounidenses e innumerables hombres de negocios, construyendo una reputación como un hombre capaz de encontrar una solución aceptable para los problemas más difíciles. Lo llamaban “Felix, el reparador”.
Esta cualidad le valió la misión de salvar a Nueva York de la bancarrota en la década de 1970 , cuando la ciudad se estaba desmoronando. Una tarea que llevaría a cabo mucho más tiempo de lo inicialmente planeado, supervisando las finanzas de la ciudad durante 18 años.
“La vida extraordinaria de Felix Rohatyn es una historia emblemática de Nueva York”, dijo el alcalde de la ciudad, Bill de Blasio.

Texto completo: "Sesame Street," Earth, Wind & Fire and Sally Field are honored for their achievements in the arts, and Peter Sarsgaard is a sound-obsessed house tuner in "The Sound of Silence."
What's on TV
THE KENNEDY CENTER HONORS 8 p.m. on CBS. In addition to celebrating 50 years on television this year, "Sesame Street" became the first TV program to receive a Kennedy Center Honor. The ceremony, which also honored the R&B group Earth, Wind & Fire, the actress Sally Field, the singer Linda Ronstadt and the conductor Michael Tilson Thomas for their lifetime achievements in the arts, took place in Washington on Dec. 8, and will be broadcast for TV audiences Sunday night. LL Cool J hosted the star-studded event, which featured performances by Carrie Underwood, Thomas Rhett, Yuja Wang and the Jonas Brothers, as well as spoken tributes from Emmylou Harris, Tom Hanks, Joseph Gordon-Levitt and David Foster.
WATCHMEN 9 p.m. on HBO. Damon Lindelof has suggested that the season finale of "Watchmen," his adaptation of the influential comic, could also wrap up the series, telling The Hollywood Reporter that he and his writing team "plotted these nine episodes with every mystery and question being resolved." Either way, the fate of Dr. Manhattan (and the future of his powers) hangs in the balance, while the threat of white supremacy and the Seventh Kavalry rages on.
RICK AND MORTY 11:30 p.m. on Adult Swim. Fans of Justin Roiland and Dan Harmon's animated sci-fi series waited years for Season 4. Now, after five short episodes, the season will take a hiatus and pick back up in 2020. Until then, catch Morty and his mad scientist grandpa, Rick, take one last adventure through the multiverse in 2019, after spending this season battling dating apps, a dragon and death itself.
What's Streaming
THE SOUND OF SILENCE (2019) Stream on Hulu. Finding an apartment in New York City can be enough of a nightmare without noise pollution to contend with. But in this film, Peter Sarsgaard plays a sound-obsessed eccentric who can help. As a professional house tuner, he travels around the city with his tuning forks to assess "the ambient noise in people's homes (electrical appliances, wind patterns) to pinpoint the source of their anxiety, depression or fatigue," Aisha Harris wrote in her review for The New York Times. When a woman suffering from chronic exhaustion (Rashida Jones) hires Peter, they strike up a friendship. "The movie swells with grand ideas about our relationships with sound and with one another, often put forth through Peter's soft-spoken voice, which oscillates between calming and eerie, or through the quiet and hum of city noises and orchestral music," Harris writes.
KILL BILL FILMS (2003-2004) Stream on Hulu and Tubi; rent on Amazon, Google Play, Vudu and YouTube. Before Rick Dalton and Cliff Booth took on members of the Manson Family, before Lt. Aldo Raine exacted revenge on Nazi soldiers, there was Bill, his Deadly Viper Assassination Squad and his vengeful would-be bride, Beatrix Kiddo (Uma Thurman). Quentin Tarantino's epic samurai revenge saga puts a heroine in the driver's seat, giving "the suffering an emotional core that a masculine protagonist wouldn't provide," Elvis Mitchell wrote in his New York Times review.

Texto completo: On a Monday evening in September, seven people gather at the Rhizome, a house that has been converted into a community arts space in the District's Takoma neighborhood. They range in age from late 20s to early 70s, and come from an array of professions " nonprofits, woodworking, think tanks. They're all here tonight for an unusual writing exercise: one where people " typically of the healthy, non-dying variety " hammer out the text for their own obituaries.
The group's facilitator is Sarah Farr, 43, a trained death doula who provides companionship and guidance to the dying. In the spring of 2017, she formed Death Positive DC and began hosting regular events: 'death cafes,' where people sit around and chat about death, often over cake; and obituary writing workshops like this one. (Death cafes are free or donation based; obituary writing workshops cost $10.) She also operates a Facebook group with about 600 members.
Farr opens the workshop by tracing the history of obituaries in American journalism and outlining their shifting cultural significance through major events such as the AIDS crisis and 9/11. She encourages the group to think about how the advent of social media and memorial websites like Legacy.com have changed the way deaths are reported. (She notes that one-third of people who die in America get a Legacy.com page.) She shares examples of funny, viral obituaries " one simply reads, 'Doug died' " and dives into the ethics of adult children publishing unflattering obituaries of their parents.
She also brings up the role that race and gender have historically played in the obituary sections of prominent newspapers. She mentions the New York Times project Overlooked, which started in 2018 and features obituaries of women and people of color whom the newspaper neglected to write about when they died. (Entries include journalist and anti-lynching advocate Ida B. Wells, transgender activist Marsha P. Johnson and poet Sylvia Plath.)
Then, educated about obituaries and ready to craft their own, the participants are set loose. They wander to different corners of the house or outside to the porch " and they begin to write.
Obituary writing workshops are part of an expanding suite of events and activities that fall under the umbrella of the 'death positive movement.' Based on the belief that cultural avoidance of discussing death is harmful, the movement encourages people to speak more openly about dying. It had been rumbling for several years before it gained a name and solidified into an official movement. In 2011, a man named Jon Underwood " who would later die at age 44 " held his first death cafe in his basement in London. He envisioned the meetings as a refuge from what he saw as a pathologically death-averse culture.
That same year, a self-described 'hipster mortician' named Caitlin Doughty started a popular YouTube channel, 'Ask a Mortician,' which she used to spread information about death acceptance and to combat death anxiety. It was Doughty who, in a tweet, coined the term 'death positive' as a play on the phrase 'sex positive.'
After Underwood and his mother published an online guide for holding death cafes, the idea quickly spread and was enveloped into the growing death positive movement. Since then, according to Death Cafe's official website, there have been more than 9,700 death cafes held in 66 countries. Anyone can host their own death cafe, as long as they abide by the official guidelines set out by Underwood.
The movement is growing here in Washington as well. Farr has seen attendance at her death cafes rise markedly over the years. Her first death cafe, held in November 2016, saw about 15 attendees. Recently, her meetings have topped out at 50, even in the rain and during the cold winter months. She remembers that just two years ago, there were very few death cafes in the region. Now, the Death Cafe website lists up to four or five per month in the D.C. area.
After about 20 minutes, Farr calls the group back together. Attendees take their seats and Nadia Raikin, 60, volunteers to share what she's written. As she reads, her dry, cool humor is palpable: 'Well. I am dead now. But at least I lived for a while, which is better than nothing.' She pauses to smile as a chuckle goes through the room. 'But I'm happy I got to experience life and that my mom, upon blessings of my grandma, decided to keep me. I was born out of a force of nature. I guess I died when nature or God called me back.'
An older man named Chris is next. 'Chris lost his life in a car accident on November 1st, 2020, nine days before his birthday. He was 75,' he says as the others listen attentively. Tall with gray hair, he speaks in a gentle, straightforward voice, sketching out the story of life, marriage and work.
'He was a humorous, easygoing man who drank a little too much but never caused any trouble when the drink got the better of him. He always felt intense empathy with the underdogs of the world, which he felt a member of. But he was happy and comfortable with this identity.' He stops reading abruptly and looks up from the page. 'Anyway, blah, blah, blah. What did you all think?'
'I loved it,' Farr says. 'I think it could be a great jumping-off place for a memoir.'
After a few more people share their obits, the group breaks for another round of writing. For the middle-aged and younger participants, writing their own obituaries can be a forward-looking exercise. Jill Eckart, 40, says, 'I took it as an opportunity to create what might be possible in the next half of my life. I have about hopefully 45 to 50 more years left. With the end in mind, what do I want that space to look like?'
By now, the sun has set behind the apartment complex across the street. Seated on the old wooden porch, Carter Rawson, 50, speaks of how the impulse to document his life seems to come naturally to him. 'I'm biased because I'm a historian,' Rawson says. 'I like to read about a life well-lived.' He continues: 'I'm not the most interesting person in my family, and I'm never going to be. But if you go to a yard sale and see disembodied old pictures, you wonder what their lives were about. I just felt I would want to do someone the favor of actually giving a narrative " being that one photo that had a story taped to the back of it.'

'Short, simple and damning': New York Times editorial board backs impeaching Trump

Texto completo: The New York Times editorial board is supporting President Trump's impeachment, it announced in an opinion piece Saturday.
The House of Representatives is scheduled to vote this week on two articles of impeachment: abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. The New York Times called the articles of impeachment "short, simple and damning" while arguing that the president has "made it impossible for Congress to carry out fully its constitutionally mandated oversight role."
The editorial board went on to describe Trump requesting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to launch an investigation into his political rival, former Vice President Joe Biden, as a "textbook example of an impeachment offense," arguing that it's exactly "as the nation's framers envisioned it." They also pointed to the White House's decision not to participate in the House's inquiry, alleging that that decision "left Congress with no choice but to press ahead to a Senate trial."
Should the articles pass in the House, which is expected, it will then go to the Senate, where the chamber will hold a trial. It takes a two-thirds vote in the Senate to remove the president from office.
The editorial boards of the Los Angeles Times, the Boston Globe, the New York Daily News, and the Philadelphia Inquirer have also called for Trump to be impeached.

Owning a car means you're wealthy?

Texto completo: Other Voices
I grew up on food stamps. As a child of the '90s, some of my earliest memories are of my family getting food vouchers in the mail each month, the colorful slips of paper coming in different denominations and featuring historical figures such as Thomas Jefferson, just like real money. We stopped needing food assistance by the time I got to middle school. I was never ashamed of how my mother (on her own, employed full-time, with limited child care) managed to raise me and my sister, using the help of government programs. But with a college degree, and on my way to a thriving career, I never expected to need it again.
Then I got sick. I contracted myalgic encephalomyelitis, a debilitating chronic illness that left me too weak and in too much pain to report to a conventional job. Working from home for 45 hours a week as an editorial assistant, I earned $2,000 a month after taxes - barely enough to pay my rent and bills each month. Reluctantly, I signed up for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), and got approved for nearly $200 a month in food assistance. Since then, my condition has worsened. My inability to walk or speak above a whisper makes it impossible for me to work. I rely on welfare programs to survive. The only question is: Will the government let me?
Recently, the Trump administration finalized a rule to limit who can receive food assistance. It imposes new work requirements on able-bodied adults without dependents, and will remove almost 700,000 people from the federal food-stamp program. "The changes reflect the belief that more Americans can enter and reenter the workforce," a government official told reporters, "so they can know the dignity of work."
They have also suggested a new rule: rejecting households with more than $2,250 in assets, or, for households with a disabled adult, more than $3,500 in assets, according to the New York Times. Lawmakers have justified this change by claiming that it closes a loophole allowing people of high net worth who have a low income - wealthy retirees, for example - to receive assistance. But in effect, the change will mean any disabled person who owns a used car of even modest value would be ineligible for food assistance. In total, the administration's restrictions would remove benefits from 3 million people, and free or discounted school meals from 1 million children.
Under this new rule, I could be ineligible for food stamps. Between what little cash I have on hand and other modest assets such as my smartphone and electric wheelchair, I would almost certainly cross over the $3,500 threshold. Being ineligible for food stamps would force me to use most of my monthly disability disbursement to buy groceries. It might even force me to sell the very same assets that rendered me ineligible for food stamps in the first place.
I'm one medical bill away from being unable to cover rent or utilities. Putting a $3,500 cap on my assets prevents me from building a financial foundation to protect me from unexpected expenses, much less improve my quality of life. That's another harsh reality of the proposal: It makes it much easier for households to fall off what's called the "benefit cliff," in which a small boost in their circumstances - like getting more work hours, or a slightly higher hourly wage - causes them to lose government assistance, leaving them worse off than before. The rule has a deep irony: In the name of encouraging self-sufficiency in people on food stamps, it undercuts what little stability we have.
The war on the social safety net, and those who need it, is not new. When I was growing up during Clinton-era welfare reform, it was waged with strict work requirements and time limits. It manifested in the rhetoric that cast recipients as shiftless, lazy and lacking "personal responsibility" - in the dirty looks that my mother got from grocery store clerks and fellow shoppers whenever she pulled out that booklet of brightly colored food vouchers.
Now it takes the form of some mythic loophole - the idea that there are hundreds of thousands of well-off people, sitting on property and big bank accounts, taking advantage of the welfare system. And soon, this logic may lead to a future in which millions of vulnerable people like me will have lighter food carts, and emptier stomachs.

Texto completo: ASHEVILLE – Korey Wise had two key words for young Asheville residents of color.
"Take heed," Wise advised the young person of color before him at a Dec. 12 event at Asheville Mall. The world can be tough, he said, but prison is harder, he said.
Over a matter of days in April 1989, Wise, now 47, went from a typical 16-year-old in Harlem to the oldest member of the notorious Central Park Five. He is one of five teenagers of color who stood accused of assaulting and raping a white female jogger in Manhattan's famous park.
The crime captivated the city, seizing headlines and the community's outrage. Donald Trump took out a full-page ad in The New York Times calling for the boys to be executed. Instead, each earned jail sentences. The four younger boys were tried as minors. Wise, tried as an adult, received 5 to 15 years in the state penitentiary system.
More than a decade later, the truth came out. A confession and DNA evidence linked another man to the crime, as courts exonerated the Central Park Five. In 2002, Wise walked free, having spent parts of 14 years behind bars.
Earlier this year, Oscar-winning director Ava Duvernay dramatized the Central Park Five story in the Netflix miniseries, "When They See Us," which earned the actor portraying Wise an Emmy award.
Now, Wise tours as a public speaker and criminal justice reformer. In Asheville, he fielded questions with a pondering look, pointer finger pressed to his closed lips. He then delved into his answers with an urgency backed by both experience and statistics.
Prison pipeline in Asheville Americans of color, particularly young men, are incarcerated at exceedingly higher rates than whites.
This imbalance extends to North Carolina: For every white youth incarcerated in the state, there are five incarcerated young blacks. Wise says a lack of recreational opportunities pushes children to slip into illegal pursuits.
"Pretty much not really have nothing to do in your community to keep your focus," he told the Citizen Times.
While Wise spoke through a general lens, those listening say the prison pipeline persists locally. In a city transformed by gentrification, accessible outlets for youth have disappeared.
"I see Asheville has stripped us of things for our kids to do, places for our kids to go, activities," said Keynon Lake, 42, who helped coordinate Wise's trip. "There's nothing left for our kids to do expect to get in trouble."
Others in attendance pointed to Asheville's isolated public housing developments, which they say police heavily monitor, as contributing to higher arrest rates among a certain demographic.
"We're secluding the people of color," said Kimiai Timbers, 25, who grew up in the old Lee Walker Heights development.
Local school discipline mirrors the justice system's lopsided racial ratios. In 2017-18, black students received 68% of short-term suspensions in Asheville City Schools, even though total black enrollment stood at 20%. In Buncombe County Schools, only 6.7% of the student body is black, yet those students received nearly a quarter of all suspensions. Disproportional suspension rates are common across districts.
Timbers says more direct involvement from teachers and role models could help stem the prison pipeline, motivating students to make better choices.
Wise gave his second talk, titled "Reality check: Pipeline to Prison," on Dec. 13 at the Mountain Area Health Education Center in South Asheville. Ticket proceeds went to My Daddy Taught Me That and My Sistah Taught Me That youth groups.
Lake said he hoped this second talk would be attended by local decision-makers, including politicians and law enforcement.
"The mindset is that people in leadership positions who attend can go back to their organizations and say this is what we learned," Lake said. "This is how we can align our goals to change the dynamics of what's going on."
Many hope every adult in the audience, like the children, "take heed."

To the Editor:
Re "Maybe a Political Plus, but Certainly a Personal Humiliation" (news article, Dec. 13):
On Thursday, the president of the United States, Donald J. Trump, wrote and sent out 123 tweets. This is an amazing and disturbing statistic and a window into the president's mind and mood.
Mr. Trump uses twitter like a "mind dump" to empty the contents of whatever is in his head in the moment. The president's tweets show a mind and a man obsessed with a litany of personal grievances, perceived injustices being perpetrated against him and an impeachment mania. As always, it is all about him. No other presidents would find the time to do all of this tweeting; they would be too busy doing the people's work, not attending to their own personal agenda.
Arguably, this huge wave of tweets, this veritable tsunami of words pouring out of the president, is one more manifestation of a mind in disarray, a mind in a state of deterioration. While no one can deny that having a strong economy and a booming stock market is unabashedly a good thing, having an unhinged, unraveling president most assuredly is not.

Lessons for the U.S. From the British Election
To the Editor:
Re "British Vote Seen as Big Win for Johnson and Brexit" (front page, Dec. 13):
Let's see if the Democrats draw any lessons from this. The Conservatives in Britain nominate someone widely seen as a buffoon. But British voters hold their noses and vote for him. He wins by a large margin.
This is because the Labour Party refused to nominate a moderate and instead ran a far-left democratic socialist with social programs costing large sums of money. The party also tolerated some of its members who made what were perceived by many to be anti-Semitic and anti-Israel statements.
History awaits the interpretation of this by Democrats.

Message to Democrats
To the Editor:
Re "In Speech, Warren Sharpens Attacks on Rivals" (news article, Dec. 13):
Please, Democrats, resist the snide attacks and nasty sound bites. Any one of the Democratic primary candidates is so much better than the current occupant of the White House.
Focus on one goal: winning in 2020!

Texto completo: The comments came days after The New York Times published a report detailing allegations of racism at branches of JPMorgan in the Phoenix area.
Jamie Dimon, the chairman and chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, on Friday tackled allegations of racism at the banking giant, telling employees that such behavior "does not reflect who we are as a company and how we serve our clients and communities every day."
In a memo sent to employees that was obtained by CNBC, Mr. Dimon said he was "disgusted by racism and hate in any form." He said the company had "done some great work on diversity and inclusion, but it's not enough."
"We must be absolutely relentless on doing more," he added.
Mr. Dimon told employees that he had instructed his management team to "continually look into our policies, procedures, management practices and culture."
"Racism has existed for too long -- in our country, in our communities -- and unfortunately, at times, even at our company," he added. "But this is not who we are. We want all of you to be active in making needed progress."
The memo came days after The New York Times published a report detailing allegations of racism at Phoenix-area branches of JPMorgan.
In one instance, one of at least two black men who recorded their interactions with bank employees after they were discriminated against was told he was essentially too black to obtain "private client" status.
Black employees said the company was prejudiced against them as well, The Times reported.
Last year, JPMorgan agreed to pay $ 24 million to end a class-action lawsuit brought by other black employees who said the company had discriminated against them.

Texto completo: NEW HAVEN — She was born in Alabama and arrested in 1961 for refusing to leave the whites-only section of a Jackson, Miss., bus station, but Lula Mae White, New Haven’s last Freedom Rider, would become known to generations of students as a beloved teacher.
White, who died Sept. 10 at 80, will be celebrated Sunday at a memorial service at Southern Connecticut State University by those who worked with her, protested with her and loved her as a wise, peaceful presence.
Joan Cavanagh of New Haven knew White as a fellow member of the Greater New Haven Labor History Association. She said White should be remembered for her “extreme courage under duress and under the worst of circumstances” and for “her ability to calm a situation down.”
White taught at the old Richard C. Lee High School and Hill Regional Career High School for 28 years, retiring in 1986. She was a graduate of Hillhouse High School and head of the NAACP at the University of Chicago. When she saw a photo of a Freedom Riders bus set on fire, she joined the groups of black and white civil rights activists who rode buses into the South to fight segregation.
Sentenced to four months in jail for her bus station protest, White served for one month. She was arrested again during the New Haven teacher strikes in 1975 and a during a union protest against Yale University in 2002.
“She had the courage of her convictions and also a very calm demeanor that really helped keep things on track,” Cavanagh said.

White’s sister, Dorothy Johnson of Hamden, with whom White lived at the end of her life, said she hoped White would be remembered for her teaching ability and for keeping the flame of the civil rights movement. She said life for African Americans has improved because of the work of the Freedom Riders and others, both black and white.
“It has changed, and I don’t think people really understand that because, back in the day, black folks didn’t have the right to vote in the South. You couldn’t go into the white waiting rooms and you couldn’t go into the white restaurants to eat,” Johnson said. “If people didn’t stand up, God knows what we would be like.”
She said she would always remember White’s love of reading. “She started when she was very young. She was always a reader,” Johnson said. “Even when she went to college, she wrote to me, ‘Are you going to the library? Are you keeping up with your reading?’”
White also loved the New York Times. “I said, ‘Are you going to read every page?’ and she said ‘As much as I can get.’”
Paula Panzarella of New Haven knew White through the Labor History Association, which Johnson and Cavanagh also were involved in.
“For me personally, the real capper was in 2011. The Labor History Association had a program to introduce labor history into the New Haven school system. … Lula was the practice person for them to interview,” she said.
“It was wonderful for her to tell her story and then the kids to discover their newly found interviewing skills,” Panzarella said. “It was amazing to me to see how she was in the classroom and to relate to the kids and to see the students’ wonder when they realized what she did and overcoming fear to do the right thing. That generational barrier was overcome when the students realized what she did.
“She was just a beautiful, sharp, loving person who really tried to stretch the limits of everybody’s humanity.”
The memorial service and fellowship will be held from 2 to 5 p.m. Sunday in Ballroom B of the Michael J. Adanti Student Center, 345 Fitch St. SCSU journalism professor Frank Harris III will show a documentary he made from an interview with White.

The liberal freakout over Trump’s anti-Semitism executive order was ridiculous, but it isn’t perfect either

Texto completo: On Dec. 11, President Trump issued an executive order that ignited controversy among political observers, Jews, and religious liberty advocates. While the order claims to combat anti-Semitism, many immediately criticized its language, largely based on the New York Times’ initial interpretation, which claimed Trump was somehow re-defining Judaism as a nationality or race.TweetTweetThe hot takes quickly exploded in liberal media outlets. Take, for example, a piece (bizarrely labeled “perspective” rather than opinion) in the Washington Post accusing Trump of erasing American Jewish people. And there was the Slate piece that jumped the gun and had to be updated.
Despite the outcry, the original text of the executive order reads, in part:
While [the Civil Rights Act] does not cover discrimination based on religion, individuals who face discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national origin do not lose protection under Title VI for also being a member of a group that shares common religious practices. Discrimination against Jews may give rise to a Title VI violation when the discrimination is based on an individual’s race, color, or national origin. It shall be the policy of the executive branch to enforce Title VI against prohibited forms of discrimination rooted in anti-Semitism as vigorously as against all other forms of discrimination prohibited by Title VI.
Language aside, the timing of this executive order is pertinent, and it seemingly demonstrates a genuine desire to protect the Jewish community from anti-Semitic attacks. This desire is well-warranted. For example, there’s video evidence showing the recent anti-Semitic attack in Jersey City, New Jersey, could have been far worse, as the perpetrator might have been targeting 50 Jewish children who escaped victimization through sheer luck. This order is meant to help this problem, not stigmatize Jews in any way.
Trump has pleased some conservatives by issuing similar executive orders that support religious liberty, particularly the one he issued in May which expressly vowed that it would be the “policy of the executive branch to vigorously enforce Federal law’s robust protections for religious freedom.”
But Trump’s fondness for executive orders is troubling. I’m not a huge fan of executive orders handed out like candy coming from any president, Democrat or Republican. Why? Well, sometimes power is in the hands of the opposing party, and then progress that was made via executive order can instantly be undone. So, too, future Democrats can and likely will abuse any executive power Republicans expand.
And attacks on people of faith for their faith are already illegal and unconstitutional. That said, it’s a sad state of affairs when an executive order like this is issued with such careful specificity to protect people of Jewish faith and nationality, yet invokes outrage, criticism, and disdain. It’s sad the liberal media really hates Trump that much.
Concerns about executive power aside, it does appear in this instance, Trump was trying to help quell the onslaught of anti-Semitic incidents. And for that, all lovers of liberty, particularly religious liberty, should be grateful.

Texto completo: A 13-year-old boy was arrested and charged in connection with the stabbing death of 18-year-old Barnard College student Tessa Majors.
The juvenile was charged with murder, robbery, and criminal possession of a weapon, a law enforcement official told the New York Times.
The official said the 13-year-old had implicated himself in the crime but did not confess. Sources told CBS2 that the boy had confessed.
The boy was caught while allegedly trespassing in a building on Thursday. He was wearing clothes matching the description of the suspect in the murder, and police found a knife on him.
He told investigators he and two friends stabbed Majors while trying to rob her.
A second person is in custody in connection with the attack but has not been arrested or charged as of Friday afternoon, a law enforcement source told CNN.
Majors was stabbed repeatedly on Wednesday night as she was walking through Morningside Park in Manhattan, which was close to the small women’s liberal arts campus she attended.
A witness reportedly saw a group of people running from the area where she had died.
A campus security guard found Majors and she was taken to Mount Sinai St. Luke’s hospital, where she died from her injuries.
Barnard sent out a text message alert to students after the stabbing warning of a suspect wearing a green hat and green jacket.iFrame ObjectiFrame Object

Texto completo: Sometimes the old expression “it takes a village" applies very much to investigative journalism.
Today's report on America's stalled war against child abuse required the combined efforts of not only The Boston Globe and New York-based ProPublica, but also financial support from four outside funders, including Participant, producer of the Academy Award-winning movie “Spotlight."
And none of it would have happened if not for the relentless efforts of two Spotlight Fellows and a crew of interns who didn't give up during the more than two and a half years they needed to collect extensive information about child abuse from all 50 states, Puerto Rico, and the District of Columbia.
Emily Palmer, who writes about courts and crime for The New York Times, and Jessica Huseman, who writes about elections at ProPublica, were selected to be Spotlight Investigative Journalism Fellows in May of 2017 on the strength of their proposal to prove that virtually every state was violating the nation's primary law against child abuse. The judges were impressed with their ambition as well as the importance of the topic.
After all, Participant, founded by Jeff Skoll and dedicated to entertainment that inspires social change, created the Spotlight Fellowship in 2016 as a way to champion tough investigative reporting in the wake of the enormous success of its film “Spotlight."
But the fellowship was designed to provide funds for a one-year investigation, and Palmer and Huseman's task proved much taller than they initially expected as many states were reluctant to provide details, especially about children who died from abuse. So the investigation continued into a second and then a third year.
Along the way, three other organizations provided financial support to the project, starting with the Massachusetts-based Freelance Investigative Reporters and Editors, or FIRE, which provided initial funding. Later, The Toni Stabile Center for Investigative Journalism at Columbia University as well as Investigative Reporters and Editors, a professional organization, provided funding as well. (No funding went to Huseman, a full-time staff member at ProPublica, or to ProPublica itself)
Through it all, Palmer and Huseman just kept going.
In the end, working with interns from Columbia Journalism School, Palmer and Huseman were able to demonstrate that not a single state follows every major provision of the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act — but the federal government has taken virtually no enforcement action. The reporters also showed that the federal government simply does not know how many children die each year from abuse and neglect.
Their report, “A cry for help," is in the spirit of The Boston Globe Spotlight Team's history of long-term investigations, including Spotlight's investigation of sexual abuse in the Catholic Church, the topic of the 2016 movie. And it certainly makes us all appreciate why investigative reporters need a team behind them.

The danger of invoking 'national origin' Sun Sentinel Editorial

Información de publicación: South Florida Sun - Sentinel ; Fort Lauderdale, Fla. [Fort Lauderdale, Fla]. 13 Dec 2019: A.13.

Texto completo: To be Jewish is to share a religious faith, or an ethnicity, or both. Many people who consider themselves Jewish are strictly secular. Some are atheists or agnostics. Many Jews by Choice, as converts are known, have no known ancestors in the Middle East.
It is not in any sense a nationality.
Therein lies the danger in the executive order President Trump signed Wednesday to invoke the term "national origin" against alleged anti-Semitism on college campuses. Although it does not in so many words call Judaism a "nationality," it has that practical effect. Moreover, it comes perilously close to implying that Jewishness is a racial characteristic, as believed by many, if not most, anti-Semites.
Nothing could be more potentially dangerous to American Jews than to imply that they share a nationality that is anything other than that of the United States. It suggests divided loyalty, a favorite trope of anti-Semites everywhere.
Trump himself has fueled that fire on several occasions, most recently on Saturday in Hollywood, where he told a gathering of the Israeli American Council that some Jewish people "don't love Israel enough." He referred to "your neighbors" in the context of hoping for peace between Israel and the Arab world. The people to whom he was speaking were predominantly Americans, not Israelis.
In the same speech, he evoked another staple of anti-Semitism by saying that wealthy Jews "have to vote for me" because Sen. Elizabeth Warren's proposal for a wealth tax would "take 100% of your wealth away."
It's as inappropriate for a Republican president to speak of Jews and money as for a Democratic Muslim congresswoman to do it. More so, in fact. He has by far the larger pulpit.
In August, Trump accused American Jews who vote Democratic of "either a total lack of knowledge or great disloyalty." Disloyalty to him? Or to Israel? Or to America?
The executive order is aimed at a significant omission in Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which forbids discrimination on the basis of race, color or national origin at educational institutions that receive federal money. Although a potent weapon against racial segregation, it is inapplicable to religious discrimination or anti-Semitism.
The executive order interprets "national origin" to cover real or perceived discrimination against Jews. According to The Washington Post, it "will have the effect of embracing an argument that Jews are a people or a race with a collective national origin in the Middle East, like Italian Americans or Polish Americans."
Those comparison are inapt. Relatively recent European immigration patterns don't compare to the Jewish Diaspora, in which most Jews had left their ancient lands before the end of the First Century CE. They dispersed over the known world, taking their faith with them in the face of history's oldest bias, anti-Semitism, which was rooted in the religious intolerance of early Christianity. It long ago mutated from its religious roots to become hatred of anything or anyone with a Jewish identity or background.
The neo-Nazi mob at Charlottesville, Virginia, two years ago, with its display of weaponry outside a synagogue and its chants of "blood and soil" and "Jews will not displace us," gave full voice to that bigotry, yet Trump declared there were "fine people" among them.
On its own, the Department of Education has been interpreting the law in the same manner as the executive order, with investigations of several elite universities. A case involving the appearance of a Palestinian rapper at the University of North Carolina has raised reasonable fears of censorship under the guise of combating anti-Semitism.
Trump's professions of opposition to anti-Semitism fall on many skeptical ears.
Media sources say the order was developed by Jared Kushner, the president's Jewish son-in-law, responding to overtures from a former aide to then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, who had tried to get Congress to act against anti-Semitism. For his part, Kushner wrote in a New York Times op-ed that "anti-Zionism is anti-Semitism." If the executive order is to be applied that way, it would be a profound violation of the First Amendment's guarantee of freedom of speech.
The administration says the order is not intended to throttle criticism of Israel's conduct toward its Arab citizens and neighbors. But that remains a valid concern among civil rights organizations.
The order incorporates a definition of anti-Semitism, as adopted by the State Department, that includes "denying the Jewish people their right to self-determination" or "claiming that the existence of a State of Israel is a racist endeavor."
In large part, the order is a response to the BDS - boycott, divestiture and sanctions - movement that is active on many college campuses in protest of Israel's treatment of the occupied West Bank. It is not inherently anti-Semitic to object to Israel's policies in that regard. J Street and some other American Jewish voices do so openly and often. There is little doubt, however, that anti-Semites are involved in the BDS movement.
Jewish organizations disagree over the executive order. Jonathan Greenblatt, of the Anti-Defamation League, welcomed it because "we see Jewish students on college campuses and Jewish people all over being marginalized. The rise of anti-Semitic incidents is not theoretical, it's empirical."
But Jeremy Ben-Ami, the president of J Street, denounced it.
"It is particularly outrageous and absurd for President Trump to pretend to care about anti-Semitism during the same week in which he once again publicly spouted anti-Semitic tropes about Jews and money," he said.
The proper approach would be for Congress to amend Title VI to specifically ban any acts based on ethnic discrimination, and leave the interpretation to be decided case by case.
Anti-Semitic incidents have swelled to record proportions since that Charlottesville "Unite the Right" rally two years ago. They have included murderous attacks on two synagogues and, just this week, on a kosher market in Jersey City. New York police announced a new unit to concentrate on racially and ethnically motivated hate crimes.
Instead of demonizing the FBI, Trump should be encouraging it to elevate its concern with hate crimes. Above all, he should take better care to not encourage them.

Texto completo: Vice President Mike Pence will attend the "Merry Christmas" rally at Kellogg Arena next week. Prior to the rally, Pence will take part in a bus tour that will stop in Saginaw and Battle Creek. In Saginaw, the vice president will deliver remarks at a "Workers for Trump" event. Following his stop in Saginaw, Pence will travel to Battle Creek to speak at the Trump campaign rally here.
This will be the vice president's second visit to west Michigan this month. Earlier in December, Pence made stops in Portage and Holland to meet with faith leaders and participate in community round table discussions. During that visit, he also spoke at a "Keep America Great" event in Holland.
Pence also visited Michigan in September, when he attended a Republican Party conference on Mackinaw Island.
Michigan is seen as an important swing state in the 2020 election.
Trump won Michigan by 10,704 votes in 2016, less than 1% of the 4.8 million votes cast, but recent Sienna College/New York Times Upshot polls show him trailing Democratic candidates Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders here in head-to-head matchups, but ahead of Elizabeth Warren.
The rally will be held at 7 p.m. Dec. 18 at Kellogg Arena in downtown Battle Creek. Tickets are available online.

DUCK SOUP? NAH. DEVLIN HODGES HAS DUCK PIZZA

Texto completo: In 2004, the Steelers improbably surged to a 15-1 record behind a rookie quarterback who solidified his legend and created an absolute mania for the team arguably not seen since the 1970s.
Peppi's honored Ben Roethlisberger with the "Roethlis-burger," a massive ground sausage and beef sandwich with fried egg and American cheese that was featured on CBS, ESPN, Sports Illustrated, The New York Times and the Food Network.
Now another rookie quarterback has captured the heart of Steelers Nation. Devlin "Duck" Hodges, a former third-stringer who is leading the Steelers on an improbable playoff run, has inspired hats, shirts, duck calls and, now, a pizza.
"We wanted to do a pizza that represents Pittsburgh and our great aquatic friend, Duck Hodges," said Ricci Minella, owner of the Brick n' Mortar restaurant in Heidelberg.
The new pie is topped with Parmesan cheese, pierogi fixins (mashed potatoes, scallions and pickled and caramelized onions), kielbasa and - wait for it - duck confit.
"We have been working on duck confit for a while, so that was easy," Mr. Minella said of the cured duck cooked in its own fat.
"We've done a pierogi pizza in the past, and it turned out great, so we wanted to mash both and tie in a little bit more Pittsburgh. So that's when we decided to go with the pierogi idea, add some kielbasa and bring in a touch of the unordinary with the duck."
Now he's asking Pittsburgh to help name it. Suggestions include "Duck Hodges Humble Pie," "Pittsburgh Quackerback Pizza" and "Quack and Gold Pizza."
"Our main goal is to have the Duckman himself come in and try one," Mr. Minella said.
The as-yet-unnamed pizza is $13 for a small and $15 for a large, and Mr. Minella said it will be available "until the end of the [Steelers] season - hopefully through the Super Bowl!"

Texto completo: Two things have long obsessed President Trump: Time's person of the year and the 16-year-old climate activist Greta Thunberg.
This week they collided when Time picked her for its annual cover. It was never in doubt that the president would tweet about it. The only question was when.
Early Thursday, the answer arrived.
“So ridiculous," Trump tweeted. “Greta must work on her anger management problem, then go to a good old fashioned movie with a friend! Chill Greta, Chill!"
Thunberg was quick to respond.
“A teenager working on her anger management problem," read a new version of her Twitter biography. “Currently chilling and watching a good old fashioned movie with a friend."
Trump wasn't the only person to criticize Time's 2019 selection.
“No matter your political leaning, whether you love her or hate her, whether you're for Trump or against him," Speaker Nancy Pelosi “has had a much bigger impact," Jake Sherman, a senior writer at Politico, said on Twitter on Wednesday.
Thunberg was selected over Pelosi, Trump, the Ukraine whistle-blower, and the Hong Kong protesters, who won Time's 2019 person of the year in a reader poll that had more than 27 million votes.
Thunberg said she was “surprised" to learn she had been selected as Time's person of the year, but said the accolade should be shared.
“It should be everyone in the Fridays for Future movement because what we have done, we have done together," she said.
New York Times
Senate recognizes Armenian Genocide
WASHINGTON — The Senate, without fanfare and over longstanding objections from President Trump, unanimously passed a resolution Thursday officially recognizing the Armenian Genocide, joining the House in condemning Turkey's mass slaughter of 1.5 million people early last century.
The move follows a Wednesday vote in the Senate Armed Services Committee to impose sanctions on Turkey over its recent purchase of a Russian missile system and its offensive against the Kurdish minority in Syria.
Turkey's actions have caused great frustration in Congress, putting fresh momentum behind efforts to revive the issue of Armenian Genocide recognition, which languished for decades in Congress as presidents and lawmakers warned that such a vote would disrupt relations with NATO ally Turkey.
The Senate's resolution cannot force the Trump administration's hand, nor does it require the president's signature; it merely expresses "the sense of the Senate" that it is US policy to recognize the Armenian Genocide and commemorate it.

Warren's tax estimate misses mark, study says
Senator Elizabeth Warren is overestimating the proceeds of her wealth tax by at least $1 trillion, according to a new study, raising questions about the Democratic presidential candidate's plans to fund her sweeping proposals to reshape the US economy.
Warren's tax would raise $2.3 trillion to $2.7 trillion over a decade, far short of the $3.75 trillion her campaign has said the levy on the accumulated wealth of millionaires and billionaires would raise in that period, according to new estimates from the Penn Wharton Budget Model.
The estimate calls into question the Massachusetts senator's frequent assertion that taxes on the wealthiest Americans would be sufficient to cover her plans for universal child care, college tuition, and erasing student debt, with about $1 trillion allocated toward paying for her $20.5 trillion Medicare for All health care plan.
Economists on the right and left have cautioned that she may be relying on overly generous estimates of her taxes and low-balling how much the new programs could cost.
Warren has dismissed any suggestion that she would need to raise taxes on the middle class to finance her proposals.
The key reason for the difference between Warren's estimate and the one from the Penn Wharton Budget Model is that the authors of the new study have factored in what they believe is a likelihood that more people than Warren expects will avoid the tax, whether legally or illegally, said Kent Smetters, a professor of business economics and public policy at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School.

Texto completo: The education secretary said "many students" got "a valuable education" from for-profit colleges as officials planned a round of notifications to applicants for full relief, 95 percent denials.
WASHINGTON -- Education Secretary Betsy DeVos on Thursday vigorously defended her decision to grant partial or no loan relief to tens of thousands of students who were misled by for-profit colleges, blaming the Obama administration for overpromising debt relief.
Appearing before the House Education Committee, Ms. DeVos faced Democrats who have accused her of unjustly denying relief to cheated students left with worthless degrees, who sought debt forgiveness. A once-obscure rule, called "borrower defense to repayment," has become one of the most embattled at the department after the collapse of two for-profit college chains, Corinthian Colleges and the ITT Technical Institute.
The Education Department found the chains to have misled students with false claims about their job prospects and salaries, and the Obama administration determined that students were entitled to full relief.
According to an internal document reviewed by The New York Times, and first reported by U.S. News & World Report, the department will begin notifying about 17,000 borrowers -- roughly 6,000 from Corinthian -- whether they will get full loan relief; 95 percent will be denials.
Ms. DeVos said her department's overhaul of the debt-relief rule marked a "course correction" from the previous administration, which she claimed "weaponized" it to target for-profit colleges, and award "blanket" relief to borrowers who may not have deserved it.
"I understand that some of you here just want to have blanket forgiveness for anyone who raises their hand and files a claim, but that simply is not right," Ms. DeVos told lawmakers.
The hearing was convened as the Education Department began notifying borrowers who claimed they were defrauded how much debt they will have to pay back. Her new rule, which takes effect in July, will require applicants to demonstrate personal financial harm, even if their colleges were proved to have misled students. This week, the department announced a new methodology that grants relief to applicants based on their classmates' earnings.
"If somebody went into one of these programs hoping to become a nurse, for example, and now they're selling clothes at a department store, it doesn't mean that they weren't defrauded," protested Representative Suzanne Bonamici, an Oregon Democrat and a former consumer protection lawyer.
Committee members used their constituents to illustrate the effect Ms. DeVos's policy will have: a Corinthian borrower who died waiting for her loan to be forgiven; a single mother with a sick son who has to take out loans for his hospital visits because she is still saddled with debt from a defunct education program; a disabled veteran who attended an ITT program using his G.I. bill funding but was left with a $ 50,000 student loan, no job and no degree.
"Does a university not have a responsibility to provide what it claims it will?" asked Representative Susan A. Davis, Democrat of California. "There is literally no other consumer protection that does not restore full repayment of a fraudulent product."
Ms. DeVos maintained that it was "probably the case" that Corinthian Colleges deceived students, but she also said she believed that the "prior administration basically forced schools like Corinthian out of business" with onerous financial restrictions. She rebuffed questions about an investigation by career staff, unveiled in January 2017 memos published by NPR on Wednesday, that concluded that Corinthian students deserved full loan forgiveness because they received no educational benefit.
"I don't agree with that narrative," she said. "I think there are many students that received a valuable education, just like they do from many other institutions. The question is what students among them were financially harmed."
Ms. DeVos said her Education Department inherited 65,000 claims from the Obama administration, and nearly 300,000 are still waiting to be decided. She said she was frustrated by the backlog, which she blamed on litigation. The Obama administration, she added, was "encouraging claims to be filed when it knew it lacked the ability to track them" and had no process to approve them.
That was false, Democrats responded. A 2017 report from the department's inspector general described the agency's process for evaluating claims -- the Obama administration approved around 32,000 -- but staffing dwindled to zero after Ms. DeVos took office. A federal judge ordered the department to halt using the Social Security Administration to adjudicate the claims, they said, but that did not preclude the department from processing approved applications or issuing denials.
While the Office of Inspector General noted deficiencies in the Obama administration's process, it said it was "pleased to note that O.I.G. did not identify any errors in the adjudicated claims, and that the review for each of the sampled claims was properly documented."
Republican members came to Ms. DeVos's defense, echoing that she had "inherited a mess" and was protecting taxpayers.
Ms. DeVos could not provide data for the number of claims she believed to be invalid, but told the committee that "your jaw would drop" at some of the complaints. She cited an example of a borrower who filed a claim because "they did not like their professor."
Representative Virginia Foxx of North Carolina, the top Republican on the committee, pointed out that over two decades, only a few dozen claims had been filed under the borrower defense rule, until 2015 when Corinthian collapsed.
"So obviously something happened," she said. "Yes, those schools closed, but there's been a culture change, I believe in our country, in terms of what people believe they're owed."
Representative Greg Murphy, Republican of North Carolina, agreed. "I do think the federal government has led to some of the problems we're having in higher education right now because the money is so -- free."

Texto completo: A 16-year-old Guatemalan boy's lifeless body was left near a toilet on a cold hard concrete cell floor from approximately 1:30 a.m. until 6 a.m. in May this year. He was supposed to have been taken to a hospital with a 103 degree fever, but instead was chucked into a cell at the McAllen immigration detention center in Texas.
Footage from an immigrant detention center in Texas obtained by Pro Publica and published online on Thursday, Dec. 5, showed the final hours of the young soccer player, Carlos Gregorio Hernandez Vasquez, who died from complications of the flu while in U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (US ICE) custody.
The teen was the sixth migrant child to die after being detained while entering the U.S. in less than a year. His death comes on the heels of another report-on Dec. 3, also by Pro Publica-which showed that McKinsey & Company, an international consulting firm brought on under the Obama administration to help engineer an "organizational transformation" in the ICE division charged with deporting migrants who are in the United States unlawfully had proposed major cuts in spending on medical care and supervision of detainees as well as food for migrants. All, they claimed, to save money.
According to Pro Publica, the money-saving recommendations the consultants came up with were so harsh tha: even some career ICE staff were reportedly uncomfortable.
As the report stated: "The consulting team became so driven to save money, people involved in the project said that consultants sometimes ignored-and even complained to agency managers about-ICE staffers who objected that McKinsey's costcutting proposals risked jeopardizing the health and safety of migrants."
The New York Times reported 1 ast year that McKinsey ultimately did more than $20 million in consulting work for ICE. All this while recommending money be cut from food and medical care for innocent, poor immigrants.
And the firm's work has continued supporting the Trump administration's immigration with McKinsey recently signing a $2 million contract to advise U.S. Customs and Border Protection as it drafted a new border strategy to replace the Obama administration's approach and another $8.4 million contract-also with ???- that will keep the firm at the agency through September 2020 at least.
So, all is well wi:h these fat cats while immigrants like Carlos are dead and their parents left with a scar that will never heal.
While McKinsey increases its profits and fattens its bank accounts with U.S. taxpayer dollars, it's happy to let immigrants like Carlos and other children like Felipe Gómez Alonzo, 8, and Jakelin Caal Maquin, 7, die in the name of cost-cutting and cost-saving.
McKinsey should be held directly responsible for the deaths of these children; their blood is on their hands and they must be taken to task for it, beginning with a thorough Congressional investigation.
These innocent children deserve that at least. And since we are in the holiday season-let's also hand them The Scrooge Award for 2019 as well. They so deserve it!

Texto completo: U.S. Rep. Conor Lamb said Thursday he plans to vote in favor of both impeachment articles Democrats plan to lodge against President Donald Trump.
The Mt. Lebanon Democrat -- a rising-star politician serving his first full year in Congress -- said the last few weeks of evidence and testimony in Washington convinced him that Trump should be removed from office for abusing his power and endangering the American people.
"I did not come to Congress to impeach the President," Lamb said in a statement. "But, I took an oath to protect our country and defend the Constitution. What the President did was wrong. It made our country less safe."
Lamb, 35, who ascended to office by winning over areas where Trump clinched victories in 2016, joins at least seven House Democrats who now say they will support the impeachment articles expected to go before the full House next week.
"I believe that the evidence is overwhelming that the President abused his power and obstructed Congress, both of which are impeachable offenses under the Constitution," U.S. Rep. Mike Doyle, a Democrat from Forest Hills, said in a statement echoing Lamb's concerns.
Two House Democrats, northeastern Pennsylvania Rep. Matt Cartwright and Rep. Chrissy Houlahan of the Philadelphia suburbs, have declined to say how they will vote as of late Thursday, the Associated Press reports.
Meanwhile, all nine Republican House members from Pennsylvania have asserted they will vote against impeachment.
Political backlash at stake
Lamb flipped an historically red region blue by ousting two Trump-backed candidates in back-to-back special and general elections in the spring and fall of last year. The former prosecutor and Marine campaigned as a moderate willing to cross party lines.
Around the country, federal lawmakers in highly polarized, politically divided districts like Lamb's tend to be less vocal about hot-button issues for fear of political repercussions, said Adam Schiffer, associate professor of political science at Texas Christian University.
"Ultimately, everybody has to take a vote, and it's hardest for somebody like Lamb," said Schiffer, whose focus areas include electoral behavior, the national news media and U.S. presidential politics. "People like Lamb obviously are cross-pressured. Folks like that often tend to not want to comment on things like this, they'd rather work on passing bills that are good for their constituents or taking relatively non-controversial stances."
If Lamb had decided against impeachment, "he would almost certainly have primary challengers lining up against him" and face staunch backlash from fellow Democratic supporters and funders, Schiffer said.
But by being vocal about his support for impeachment, Lamb risks alienating voters who continue to support Trump, as well as those who dismiss impeachment as neither pragmatic nor necessary.
"The parties need those moderates the most," Schiffer said. "They're the ones who are determining the majority control of Congress."
Impeachment 'extremely important' to both parties
A recent New York Times survey based on responses from more than 110,000 people found that "impeachment is extremely important to both parties" -- just for very different reasons, Schiffer said.
A majority of Democrats view impeaching Trump to be a policy priority. Devoted Trump supporters say impeachment absolutely should not happen, that Trump is "great, he's totally innocent, the other side is out to get him, they're lying," Schiffer said.
"But for the more ambivalent Republicans -- say, the suburbanites who voted for Trump somewhat reluctantly -- it is probably more of a sense of what Democrats said during the (former President Bill) Clinton impeachment. They may be thinking, 'Yeah, this was wrong, but it doesn't rise to the level of an impeachable offense,'" Schiffer said.
To those questioning whether the impeachment inquiry is a waste of time, Lamb said that it "is not stopping us from getting good, bipartisan work done." He cited bipartisan collaboration on a recent trade deal and a planned vote on a bill to slash prescription drug prices and add dental and hearing benefits to Medicare plans.
Thursday night's anticipated party-line vote by the House Judiciary Committee tees up a full House vote next week.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi sounded confident that Democrats will have the votes to impeach the president without Republican support, but she said it is up to individual lawmakers to weigh the evidence.
Democrats pointed out that the investigations go back to special counsel Robert Mueller's probe of the 2016 election that put Trump in the White House. They say his dealings with Ukraine have benefited its aggressive neighbor Russia, not the U.S., and he must be prevented from "corrupting" U.S. elections again and cheating his way to a second term next year.
Lamb said he believes "the President withheld weapons from the Ukrainians, even though Congress agreed that the weapons were needed to fight the Russians."
"Instead of using his office to oppose Russian aggression, the President used it to oppose his political opponent," Lamb said. "This served his personal interests, but not our national security interests. The President has admitted these facts and refuses to acknowledge that he did anything wrong."
Trump has refused to participate in the proceedings, tweeting criticisms as he did Thursday from the sidelines.
The Judiciary Committee session drew out over two days, with both sides appealing to Americans' sense of history. Democrats described a sense of duty to stop what one called the president's "constitutional crime spree," and Republicans decried what one referred to as a "hot garbage'' impeachment attempt.
Trump, apparently watching the live proceedings on television, tweeted his criticism of two Democratic women on the panel, Reps. Veronica Escobar and Sheila Jackson Lee, both of Texas. He called their comments about his actions inaccurate.
"Very sad," Trump tweeted.

Texto completo: El Comité Judicial de la Cámara de Representantes se reunió este miércoles a las siete de la tarde (hora del este) para argumentar a favor o en contra de el juicio político contra Donald Trump y proponer modificaciones a los cargos de los que se acusa al presidente. Pero el horario de este encuentro en el Congreso, que podría acabar después de media noche, tiene a muchos desconcertados.
Esta sesión nocturna forma parte de una reunión de varios días en la que los 41 miembros del Comité Judicial debaten, enmiendan y votan los cargos del juicio político que han propuesto los demócratas. En la mañana del jueves, el comité se volverá a reunir para y se espera que durante la tarde apruebe los cargos y los envíe a la Cámara de Representantes para su votación.
Los 24 demócratas y 17 republicanos que se reúnen la noche de este miércoles tendrán cinco minutos para hacer sus declaraciones de apertura, algo que les podría llevar varias horas. El plan de los demócratas para el día siguiente es, según publica The New York Times, pasar realmente al trabajo de modificación de las acusaciones con propuestas y enmiendas que pueden llevar a cambios importantes o a alteraciones menores. En principio, no se esperan grandes giros.
The Times explica que en este proceso legislativo, conocido como markup (anotaciones), los republicanos pueden quejarse incluso sin cambiar los artículos. ¿Cómo? Proponiendo gran cantidad de mociones que obliguen al comité a votar y que, por tanto, demoren los procedimientos . En cualquier caso, dichas enmiendas serán simbólicas para demostrar a los votantes de Trump que los republicanos están luchando contra el juicio político.
En estas reuniones no habrá testigos. Solo estarán presentes los miembros del comité aunque puede haber aportaciones puntuales de los abogados y de otros asistentes.

Texto completo: Gov. Ned Lamont chided the administration of President Donald J. Trump on Wednesday in a letter affirming that Connecticut welcomes the resettlement of refugees as “a bedrock principle of the United States of America.”
The letter sent to Secretary of State Michael Pompeo is a response to an unusual executive order Trump issued in September that curtails the ability of the State Department to place refugees in a community without the consent of state and local officials.
“I think, more to the point, President Trump was giving some states the option of opting out as far as I could see it,” Lamont said, speaking to reporters after a climate change event where he also distanced himself from the president. “And again, like I talked about with the environment, I want Connecticut take the lead by example.”
No governor or mayor has a right to deny any legal resident, including refugees who enter the U.S. legally after extensive vetting by the State Department, from settling in their state or city, and Trump’s executive order is already being challenged in court.
“There is no basis for this. They have permanent legal status,” said Ann O’Brien, the director of community engagement at Integrated Refugee & Immigrant Services, the New Haven-based resettlement agency known as IRIS. “There is no legal precedence for this.”
Refugees represents a minuscule portion of the more than 35 million immigrants living legally in the U.S. Hardly a torrent before he took office, Trump has slowed their admission to a trickle, setting a ceiling of 18,000 in 2020 — the lowest in the history of the U.S. refugee program.
The ceiling was 45,000 in 2018 and 30,000 in 2019, according to the Congressional Research Service.
In Connecticut, IRIS helped resettle 530 refugees in 2016, 330 in 2017, 120 in 2018 and 269 in 2019, typically in partnership with a local church or other community institution, O’Brien said. They now live in 50 communities, ranging from the state’s largest cities to the small rural communities in the state’s Quiet Corner.
“It is literally a family here and there,” O’Brien said.
O’Brien said the president’s executive order places local officials in the middle of a debate over immigration, effectively challenging them to oppose or welcome their resettlement.
On Monday night, the Burleigh County Commission in Bismarck, N.D., debated whether to become the first local government in the U.S. to formally deny its consent to refugee resettlement. Instead, it voted 3-2 after a packed public hearing to affirm they are welcome.
O’Brien wondered if a presidential order that invites communities to refuse refugees will have the the opposite effect.
“We are very optimistic this actually is going to backfire on them,” O’Brien said. “Every town is going to have to have some kind of conversation about this.”
The mayors of Hartford, New Haven and West Hartford already have written the State Department consenting to resettlement in their communities, and IRIS welcomed Lamont joining them, O’Brien said.
“We are over the moon with the strength of Gov. Lamont’s statements,” she said.
In a formal statement released with his letter, Lamont cast the executive order as an element of a larger anti-immigrant campaign.
“Attacking immigrants and refugees does nothing to make our communities stronger, and in fact only achieves the exact opposite,” he said. “Connecticut will continue welcoming those escaping persecution and upholding the long tradition of the United States as a place that treats every human being with dignity and respect.”
Trump also signed an executive order in October barring the entry of immigrants who might be a financial burden to the health care system.
Trump has used costs to the U.S. as his rationale for limiting the admission of refugees, but a study by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services found in 2017 that refugees produced more for the U.S. economy than they consumed. The White House rejected the study, according to the New York Times.
Lamont, a Democrat nearing the end of his first year in office, has been working with the Trump administration on a plan to finance transportation infrastructure in Connecticut, and generally has carefully chosen when he criticizes the president. But he did so twice in one day Wednesday.
In addressing a meeting of the Governor’s Council on Climate Change, Lamont said, “I think climate change is an existential threat. It’s a real threat, and if they don’t understand that in the White House, we understand it here in Connecticut.”

Texto completo: Harvey Weinstein and his former film studio's board have reached a tentative $25 million settlement that would end nearly every sexual misconduct lawsuit brought against him and his company, The New York Times reported Wednesday.
The Times cited a half-dozen lawyers in its report, some of whom spoke about the proposed terms on the condition of anonymity.
More than 30 actresses and former Weinstein employees, who have sued the movie mogul for accusations ranging from sexual misconduct to rape, have agreed to the deal, according to the lawyers.
Weinstein would avoid paying any of his own money and he would not be required to admit any wrongdoing as part of the deal. Insurance companies representing The Weinstein Co.. would cover the settlement's cost, the Times reported.
Representatives for Weinstein declined to comment.
The proposed settlement has gotten preliminary approval from the major parties involved. It would require court approval and a final signoff before moving forward. The settlement's terms remain uncertain.
Eighteen of the alleged victims would split $6.2 million, with no individual receiving more than $500,000. A separate $18.5 million would go toward those involved in a class-action case, the New York attorney general's suit and any future claimants, the Times reported.
Actress Katherine Kendall, 50, said she agreed to the terms of the settlement because she didn't want to stop other plaintiffs from receiving recompense. "I don't love it, but I don't know how to go after him," she said. "I don't know what I can really do."
The deal does not, however, resolve a separate criminal case against Weinstein over multiple accusations of sexual assault. Weinstein, 67, is scheduled to be tried on rape and sexual assault charges Jan. 6. His bail was increased from $1 million to $5 million for allegedly mishandling his electronic ankle monitor.
He has pleaded not guilty to charges that he raped a woman in a Manhattan hotel room in 2013 and performed a forcible sex act on a different woman in 2006.

Hate ’em? Holiday foods can actually be delicious

Texto completo: Since 1913, when the first one was mail-ordered in the U.S., fruitcake has been the symbol of the holiday gift you give away as soon as you receive it.
The weighty brown cake, studded with neon colored chunks of fruit that could decorate a house if they were strung alongside some lights, has been around for centuries — it was banned in Europe in the 1700s not because it was too awful but because it was too rich due to all the butter and sugar. Its punchline status started soon after it was dispatched across the country.
Fruitcake is one of a list of holiday foods whose bad reputations precede them. Among them: dry panettone, equally dry maraschino-cherry studded holiday hams and medicinal eggnog.
But just as some bad food is being rendered obsolete, in part by millennials (bye bye, American cheese), others have had their reputations restored by artisans anxious to redeem them. Here are five foods that have turned the tables courtesy of Kentucky monks, New York bartenders and expert bakers.
Yule log
Cake fashioned to look like a tree stump is a delicacy in its native France and invariably a mess when it’s recreated in the U.S. With stale crumb and impenetrable frosting armor, it’s the classic example of a dessert that should be seen and not consumed — till now. Bakers offer stellar versions at spots such as Brooklyn’s Bien Cuit (almond cake, dark chocolate mousse) and Bi-Rite in San Francisco (salted caramel buttercream is their secret), although they’re too delicate to mail order. Sweet Pies Bakery in Napa Valley makes one that ships. Their tender flourless chocolate cake is wrapped around bittersweet truffle filling, then coated with fudge frosting and sprinkled with gold dust. $99; Sweet Pies Bakery via Goldbelly
Holiday ham
Spiral-cut, alarmingly pink hams, brined in enough sodium nitrate that they don’t spoil, anchor no small number of holiday meals. They’re often injected with so much salty water there’s not much else to taste and a lot of leftovers for sandwiches. The esteemed Edwards Virginia Smokehouse is known for their country hams as well as an incredible peanut-fed Surryano jámon, but they also sell a terrific bone-in ham that’s been lightly smoked in hickory. The honey-brown sugar glaze gives the porky meat a sweet fruity edge. From $99; Edwards Virginia Smokehouse
Fruitcake
Despite its reputation for being gleefully bad, good fruitcake is readily available. From Texas, the Collins Street DeLuxe Fruitcake is packed with candied cherries and a surprise ingredient — papaya — and nicely infused with honey. RedTruck Bakery’s Havana Fruitcake is tropically spiced with a mix of fruits, pecans and coconut; it’s soaked in dark rum for months before it’s done. But one of the best representatives of genuinely delicious fruitcake is handmade by Trappist monks at a monastery deep in Kentucky whiskey country. Gethsemani Farms’s Kentucky Bourbon Fruitcake has a high ratio of pineapple, cherries, raisins, citrus zest, and pecans, bound together just enough sticky batter and doused with no small amount of local bourbon. From $40; Gethsemani Farms
Panettone
Panettone has long had a reputation as fruitcake’s stale Italian cousin. Now, the yeast-based dough that takes hours and hours to make has become the “Mount Everest of baking” according to the New York Times. “Great craft bakers have learned about panettone’s unique processes and turned it from a holiday terror to treat,” says Sullivan Street Bakery owner Jim Lahey who makes a superior one. His New York bakery specializes in bread ( such as this sourdough you can make at home), but over the holidays it’s transformed into a mini panettone factory; bakers make about 300 a week. Besides a traditional raisin and citron loaf, there’s a special version studded with tart cherries and chocolate — if you serve it slightly warm the chocolate melts into the fluffy interior. $50; Sullivan Street Bakery via Goldbelly
Eggnog
George Washington had his own incredible indulgent recipe for the high-cholesterol holiday beverage that included a heady mix of brandy, rye, Jamaica rum, and sherry, along with the namesake whipped eggs, cream, and spices. On the opposite end of the spectrum are the one-note, sweet-as-sugar commercial options. For bartenders, eggnog is their “Everest,” a maligned specialty worthy of redemption (consider this pumpkin version). “Like piña coladas, egg nogs have a bad rap, but when they’re done right and given some dimension, they can be some of the best drinks out there,” says Ryan Chavis, Union Square Café’s beverage manager. His stellar version is based on a recipe from the restaurant’s pastry team; it had too much high-proof alcohol to freeze into ice cream, so it became a popular order at the bar.
Four Spirit Eggnog
Adapted from a recipe by Ryan Chavis of Union Square Café
Serves 12-15
• 6 egg yolks
• 1 cup sugar
• 1/2 cup honey
• 1 1/2 cups milk
• 1 1/2 cups heavy cream
• Scant 1/2 teaspoon salt
• Pinch each of ground cloves, nutmeg, and cinnamon
• 1 cup overproof American whiskey, such as Wild Turkey
• 1/2 cup dark rum, preferably pot-still, such as El Dorado Smith & Cross
• 1/2 cup amaro, such as Montenegro Averna
• Large ice cubes, for serving (optional)
In a large mixing bowl, combine the egg yolks, sugar, honey, milk, cream, salt, and spices. Whip until light in color and very thick; a loose ribbon will form when you drizzle a little of the mixture on top. Chill until serving.
Before serving, gradually beat in the spirits until incorporated.
Serve in small glasses or cups with a large ice cube, if desired.
Editor’s note: Spirits can be adjusted taste; recipe includes raw eggs.

Jamelle Bouie: Two articles of impeachment for Trump are nowhere near enough

Texto completo: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was essentially forced into impeachment. Now, after a little less than two months of investigation, she hopes to bring the process to a close. On Tuesday, House Democrats revealed their articles of impeachment against the president. One focuses on abuse of power, the other on obstruction of Congress.
“Our president holds the ultimate public trust,” Rep. Jerrold Nadler, the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, said. “When he betrays that trust and puts himself before country, he endangers the Constitution, he endangers our democracy and he endangers national security.”
Pelosi promised a narrow, expedited impeachment, and that’s what the House will deliver: a targeted effort centered on a single act of malfeasance. It’s been a fast-paced process meant to satisfy liberal activists without alienating moderate members worried about support from swing voters. Once it’s completed, Pelosi can say that Democrats ran a sober investigation and found definitive evidence of wrongdoing. She can even say that this wasn’t an obstacle to getting things done — it was hardly an accident that after announcing the articles of impeachment, Pelosi also announced that the House would vote to approve the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, President Donald Trump’s renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement.
Pelosi wants to get to the bottom of the president’s wrongdoing and she wants to protect her moderate members. But a quick, narrow impeachment isn’t the way to go. On the substance, there’s still a lot to learn about the president’s behaviors, hints of corruption and illegality that should be pursued. And on the politics, the fate of the House majority — and the fate of the eventual Democratic nominee’s presidential campaign — rests more on the national political environment than the particulars of each swing congressional district. Individual Democrats might have run on health care in 2018 and other “kitchen table” issues, but it was anti-Trump energy that put these districts within reach, and it will be anti-Trump energy that drives the outcome next year. If the president is unpopular — if he’s mired in controversy — Democrats will likely win. If it’s the reverse, if Trump can overcome scandal and recover ground with some voters, he’ll win reelection. And those vulnerable House Democrats? They’ll lose, along with the party’s nominee.
The quick impeachment has another, critical weakness: It hands the process to the Republican Senate and its majority leader, Mitch McConnell. Even if Senate Republicans decline to call witnesses, they still have an opportunity to use the proceedings to try to inflict political damage on Democrats. Trump, for example, wants the Senate to litigate his anti-Biden conspiracy mongering.
The better alternative — the stronger alternative — is to wait. Pursue new investigations to support additional articles of impeachment. Expand them beyond Ukraine: Investigate corruption and wrongdoing throughout the administration and accomplish as much as you can before handing the process over to the Senate.
On Ukraine, for example, Democrats could pursue testimony from figures who appear to have direct knowledge of the extortion scheme, including the president’s lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, his former national security adviser John Bolton and his secretary of state Mike Pompeo.
Democrats should also pursue other violations, like the president’s open attempt to enrich himself through the presidency. This summer, for example, Trump tried to steer next year’s G7 meeting to his luxury golf resort in Doral, Florida, a blatant attempt to profit from the Oval Office. And last week we learned that Trump all but steered a $400 million contract for border wall construction to a North Dakota-based company, Fisher Sand and Gravel, whose chief executive, Tommy Fisher, has been a staunch defender of the president on Fox News. If the Ukraine scheme was an attempt to corrupt our foreign policy to help his re-election, then both incidents represent an attempt to corrupt the presidency for personal gain. This, too, demands investigation and public scrutiny.
Then there are the call transcripts. In his complaint, the whistleblower who set off the Ukraine investigation accused White House officials of hiding the transcripts of politically sensitive calls with foreign leaders in the same restricted computer system that is used for highly classified information. It’s possible that the Ukraine conversation is part of a pattern of similar behavior.
To that point, Democrats could investigate the relationship between Trump and the president of Turkey, Recep Tayyip Erdogan. We know Trump’s sudden decision to abandon America’s Kurdish allies in Syria stemmed from an “off-script moment” during a phone call between the two. We know that a gold trader connected to Giuliani was charged in a scheme with a Turkish bank to evade American sanctions on Iran. And we also know Trump has personal business interests in Turkey. Absent investigation, there’s no way to know if any of this influenced the president’s decision-making on Syria. But if it did, it, too, would constitute another impeachable offense. There’s a similar case for investigating the president’s highly solicitous relationship with Saudi Arabia, which is so unusual that his response to the shooting of American service members by a Saudi national on American soil was to promise compensation from the Saudi royal family and otherwise dismiss the situation, acting more like the press secretary for the kingdom than the president of the United States.
If Democrats aren’t compelled by the reality of broad, pervasive corruption, then they should be compelled by the politics of a longer, more deliberate impeachment process. The White House and its Republican allies have struggled to address the Ukraine investigation. The president’s approval hasn’t fallen, but it also hasn’t grown, despite the strong economy. Impeachment has consumed Trump’s energy and put him on the defensive. It’s done the same to Republicans, forcing them to explain and account for his behavior. It’s mired the entire party in scandal, with no apparent cost to Democrats — the party just won a governing trifecta in Virginia, held the governor’s mansion in Louisiana and beat an incumbent Republican governor in Kentucky.
There’s no reason for Democrats to end things now. They have enough material to keep the pressure through the new year. They can show the country what Trump has done with his power, and why he shouldn’t be allowed to wield it any longer. Close scrutiny will also discourage the president from new attempts to leverage his office for personal gain, and if nothing else, an extended impeachment process will keep the process away from Mitch McConnell.
Democrats, in other words, can use the power of impeachment to set the terms of the next election — to shape the national political landscape in their favor. In a political culture governed by negative partisanship and hyperpolarization, restraint won’t save the Democratic majority. But a relentless anti-Trump posture — including comprehensive investigations and additional articles of impeachment — might just do the trick.

Texto completo: The stylistic and ideological rift between Democratic camps is clearly deep and dangerous.
Last month, employing my best kumbaya tone, I highlighted the many ways in which the party's far left and more moderate camps fundamentally agree.
The two are on the same page, I wrote, on the need to combat climate change and wealth disparities, to embrace health care as a right and confront unresolved issues around race and gender, to regulate firearms and enact compassionate immigration policies, and, more generally, to see government not as a "swamp" but as a force to improve the lives of ordinary Americans.
Today I am less sanguine. As a left-of-center pragmatist, I have wearied of the self-righteousness of many on the far left who apparently see themselves as smarter and more courageous than the rest of us.
There it was again a week ago Sunday, on the front page of the New York Times, an article framing the Democratic presidential contest as one between the "pugilists" and the "peacemakers."
In it, pragmatists are maligned as "too cautious, naïve and quick to assume good will from Republicans." One far-left journalist even told the Times that pragmatists mistakenly see the path to beating Donald Trump as embracing a "form of corrupt passivity."
One especially outrageous theme is the notion that pragmatists are less passionate in their dislike - no, make that hate - for everything Trump has wrought.
Most pragmatists hold Trump and his Republican enablers in as much contempt as the most shrill and combative on the far left. Just because Joe Biden said he thinks he could work across the aisle as president like he did as a senator in another century doesn't mean most pragmatists agree.
This idea that Democrats must be led by an Elizabeth Warren or a Bernie Sanders or an Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez fighting the big fights and not, as Warren likes to say, nibbling around the edges, is nonsense.
Just how do Democrats benefit from bigger margins in places like the Bronx and Queens, which AOC represents in Congress, if Trump slips into a second term thanks once more to narrow margins in Ohio, Pennsylvania and, yes, Wisconsin?
Do you really think some strident AOC-type politician could have ended the Scott Walker nightmare in Wisconsin the way Tony Evers - a moderate - managed to do? Evers is now pushing all sorts of progressive buttons, but you know what? He first had to actually win an election in a 50-50 state.
Now we even have the far left social media crowd lambasting Barack Obama for extolling the merits of intelligent pragmatism in the presidential campaign.
Obama told donors recently: "I don't think we should be deluded into thinking that the resistance to certain approaches to things is simply because voters haven't heard a bold enough proposal and if they hear something as bold as possible then immediately that's going to activate them. People rightly are cautious because they don't have a lot of margin for error.
"This is still a country that is less revolutionary than it is interested in improvement," Obama added. "They like seeing things improved, but the average American doesn't think we have to completely tear down the system and remake it."
The far left pounced, which one can understand, given that many of its members apparently regard their own political acumen as superior to that of the twice-elected former president.
The "On Politics" column in the New York Times reported how "Mr. Obama got a resounding chorus of 'O.K. boomer' from liberal activists, who questioned his record on issues like health care, climate change and immigration."
While Obama appears unbothered by such critiques, I was astonished at the arrogance of these Twitter Democrats.
Oh, if only these social media critics could have been in White House strategy sessions a decade ago when Obama got the historic Affordable Care Act passed. Their passion and stridency would have yielded something far better, right?
David Axelrod, the former Obama strategist, told the Times that the size of this far left contingent may be exaggerated: "I think sometimes the populist left is overrepresented in places where reporters sometimes spend a lot of time, like on Twitter."
Political reporters, drawn to covering campaigns through the prism of conflict, have predictably been shining a hostile spotlight on Pete Buttigieg, whose pragmatic presidential candidacy has surged as he talks of being eager to turn to governing and healing a deeply divided nation following the election.
A Buttigieg campaign ad targeted pledges by Warren and Sanders for free tuition at public colleges and universities. "I believe we should move to make college affordable for everyone," Buttigieg says in the ad, adding later, "But I only want to make promises that we can keep."
That brought a stinging Twitter rebuke from Ocasio-Cortez, who has endorsed Sanders: "This is a GOP talking point used to dismantle public systems, & it's sad to see a Dem candidate adopt it."
Yes, it's a travesty when a politician dares to distinguish between a pipedream and the best case for progress in a deeply divided nation.
And what about those drawn to Buttigieg's practical and non-hysterical style? It must be because they are old.
A recent New York Times story explored his appeal among older white Iowa Democrats under the snide headline: "O.K. Mayor: Why the 37-year-old Pete Buttigieg is attracting boomers." The article, by a young reporter, portrayed Iowa Democrats as liking Buttigieg mostly because they find him, well, sort of cute and unthreatening.
"He reminds everyone of their favorite grandson," one prominent Democrat said. Another said: "I have to think that some older voters see Pete as the son they'd want to have - very smart, respectful of traditional institutions like the church and the military, and relentlessly cheerful and optimistic about what America can be."
Oh, and here was the closing quote by another Democrat: "He reminds us a ton of our son."
Might there be an explanation not tied to such tired generational stereotyping?
Many, I suspect, regard Buttigieg not only as smart but also the most charismatic and nuanced among the candidates - agile on his feet when unscripted in the way Obama was and is.
He doesn't yell and wave or try at every turn to prove himself the most pugnacious, which, I gather, is a big disappointment to some.

Texto completo: In a recent column, I argued that Democrats looking for someone to unify their fractious coalition should take another glance at Bernie Sanders - on the grounds that he's more popular across the party's different factions, more unifying, more exciting and more potentially appealing to non-liberals than his critics tend to assume.
There was one point I gestured at but didn't stress, which is that in nominating Bernie, the Democrats would be embracing one of the key forces in American politics right now - the distrust of technocracy, the sense that the smartest guys in each political coalition can't really be trusted, the feeling that the whole model of credentialed meritocracy is corrupt and self-dealing and doesn't deliver on its promises.
In the Democratic coalition more than the Republican one, meritocracy and technocracy have long been unifying forces. Bill Clinton and Barack Obama represented somewhat different party factions, but they both embodied wonkery, a vision of competence and expertise governing to some extent above ideology, in which there are assumed to be "correct answers" to policy dilemmas that a disinterested observer could acknowledge and the right technocrat achieve.
The candidates carrying on this tradition in the Democratic primary are Pete Buttigieg, Elizabeth Warren and the late-entering Michael Bloomberg - Buttigieg and Bloomberg as center-left figures, Warren as the progressive promising to direct her "I've got a plan for that!" wonkery to more ambitious ends.
But Sanders is different; he has policy plans, too, but he's fundamentally a moralist arguing for a politics of righteous struggle, in a way that separates him from Warren as well as from Buttigieg or Bloomberg. And just as Donald Trump benefited in 2016 - and figures like Ted Cruz and Jeb Bush suffered - from a sense that the GOP's libertarian and neoconservative intelligentsia bore some responsibility for the double disasters of Iraq and the financial crisis, Sanders benefits from a widespread left-wing disappointment with what the Obama-era politics of expertise produced.
This disappointment has been strongest on health care, where Obamacare's most popular provision was the simple socialism of the Medicaid expansion rather than the complicated, expert-fashioned architecture of the exchanges. But it's also palpable in education policy, where after two decades worth of technocratic experiments - Race to the Top, Common Core, etc. - we have chronically disappointing test scores, persistent racial gaps, the same basic stagnation despite reformers' best-laid plans.
On both issues and others, the appeal of Sanders has less to do with the details of his plans and more to do with a simple formulation: The experts had their chance; let the moralists and radicals have theirs.
However, that's only one possible response to disillusionment with technocracy. The other response is to prefer a return to transactional politics, to dealmakers who keep the system running rather than optimizing for efficiency, to machine politicians who aren't going to dramatically improve the status quo but also aren't likely to embrace clever plans that accidentally make it worse.
This is clearly the appeal of the other non-technocrat in the Democratic field, the still-front-running Joe Biden. Of course the former vice president also has plans and policy papers - no Democrat lacks them - but even more than Sanders he's running as a non-wonk, an anti-technocrat, the guy who'll shout "malarkey!" when the clever McKinsey guy shows up with the white paper and says you need to overhaul a popular program because there's a more efficient way.
Despite his constant invocations of Obama, Biden no less than Sanders (and much more than Buttigieg and Warren) is running against the Obama governmental style, and especially the first-term Obamanaut confidence in intelligence and expertise as the essential oil of governance. If Sanders woos voters by saying, why not elect a moralist instead of an expert, Biden woos them by saying, how about we just elect a [expletive] politician?
In this contrast Sanders comes out ahead with the many Democratic voters who don't think old-fashioned dealmaking is really possible anymore, and also with the important swath of disaffected voters who don't like politicians or the Democratic Party, but do want to experiment with radicalism in Washington, D.C.
But Biden's status quo-oriented version of the anti-technocratic pitch is better suited to the economic moment. America has systemic problems, certainly, but institutional sclerosis and futility are much more tolerable when the GDP is running hot and unemployment is at a generational low. As long as that environment persists, there is an obvious constituency, in Biden's party and in the country, for pushing out Trump but otherwise eschewing grand ambitions, and just letting the expansion run as long as it can go.
So if the exhaustion with technocracy makes a socialist a viable nominee, that exhaustion plus a solid economy explains why the socialist may yet fall to an even more archaic breed - a party politician.

Texto completo: JERSEY CITY, N. J. – A shooting spree that killed a police officer and three others targeted a kosher market and could have been far more deadly had officers on patrol nearby not quickly intervened, city officials said Wednesday.
"We now know this did not begin with gunfire between police officers," city Public Safety Director James Shea said. "It began with an attack on civilians in the store. "
In an afternoon news conference, New Jersey Attorney General Gurbir Grewal said a pipe bomb was recovered at the scene, and he identified the attackers – who were killed by police officers in a long shootout – as David Anderson, 47, and Francine Graham, 50.
Grewal identified the victims as Mindy Ferenz, 32; Miguel Douglas, 49; and Moshe Deutsh, 24. Ferenz and Deutsh were believed to be cousins and members of an Orthodox community. Chabad Rabbi Moshe Schapiro said Ferenz and her husband owned the market.
Grewal said a fourth person in the store, whom he did not name, escaped the attack.
Authorities suspect Anderson and Graham gunned down police Detective Joe Seals around noon Tuesday at a cemetery before heading to the market a mile away. They're also the lead suspects in the killing of a Jersey City man found beaten to death in the trunk of a car Saturday night.
Shea said surveillance video shows two people pull up in front of the JC Kosher Supermarket in a stolen van, slowly exit the vehicle armed with long guns and "immediately begin firing. " Shea, noting that the market is surrounded by schools and other stores, said the officers "heroically placed themselves in the line of fire. "
"Both of them received gunshot wounds as a result," Shea said. Officers Ray Sanchez and Mariela Fernandez were treated at a hospital and released.
Bodega shooting: Victim includes owner or targeted bodega; suspects identified
Initially, Shea and Mayor Steven Fulop declined to characterize the attack as an anti-Semitic hate crime. Multiple media outlets, including The New York Times, reported that one of the suspects published anti-Semitic posts on social media.
The Associated Press, citing a law enforcement official who was not authorized to speak publicly, said investigators believe the two dead attackers – who were thought to be a couple – identified themselves in the past as Black Hebrew Israelites, a movement whose members have been known to rail against whites and Jews.
Later on Wednesday, Fulop posted a series of tweets denouncing the attack as a hate crime motivated by anti-Jewish sentiment, and he repeated that contention at a late-afternoon news conference in front of the market.
“It should be viewed as a hate crime and called out aggressively . . . and quickly,” Fulop said. “There’s no question it was an attack on the Jewish community. There’s no other way to interpret it when you look at the facts. As a Holocaust survivor family, it’s important for me to recognize it for what it is. ''
"When you look at all of their actions during the day,'' Fulop added, "it's very clear what they tried to do and where they went and why they went and how they acted. ''

Grewal said the shooters' motivation remains under investigation, and he urged the media not to speculate about any ideology that might have prompted the assault.
The attorney general highlighted the diversity of Jersey City and the area where the market sits, next to a Catholic school and near a Dominican bodega.
"Yesterday that city came under attack, not just the city but the values this city stands for, and we will respond as we have responded in the past,'' he said. "And we recognize many in the community are coming together by working together and by grieving together and showing that we are stronger than the hate that fueled this terrible tragedy. ’’
During that same media briefing, the authorities warned about scams seeking to take advantage of people trying to help those affected by the shooting.
Craig Carpenito, U. S. attorney for the District of New Jersey, said fake GoFundMe pages have been set up purporting to raise money for victims' relatives. He said no legitimate pages had been established as of Tuesday night.
"I can't find the words for how disgusting this conduct is,'' Carpenito said, urging those exposed to the fraud to contact the FBI.
Evan Bernstein, regional director of the Anti-Defamation League, said he nervously awaits details on the attack.
“The Jewish community is shaken,” Bernstein said.
Residents were rattled by the violence.
“I just think that everyone wants to leave,” said Khalis Harris, 37, who has lived in the neighborhood his entire life. “If it’s not yesterday’s shooting, it’ll be another one. "
Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams said two of the victims were borough natives. Authorities said anti-Semitic hate crimes have risen 22% in the city in 2019.
“History isn’t trying to talk to us right now – it’s screaming at us,” Mayor Bill de Blasio said at a news conference. He warned Americans not to discount the possibility that a Holocaust could happen again: “It is not the distant past. It’s right here with us. ”
Rabbi David Lederman, who spoke on behalf of the Jewish community, thanked de Blasio for “having the courage” to call the shooting an act of anti-Semitism. Lederman fought back tears as he recounted the lives of the Jewish victims.
"May all communities, including us in the Jewish community, feel that we are safe," Lederman said.
Jersey City shooting: Police officer killed was a 15-year veteran and father of five
Still unclear is the connection between the market shooting and the killing of Seals in the cemetery in another section of the city of 270,000 people.
Shea did not address that information Wednesday. Jersey City Police Chief Michael Kelly said Tuesday that the officer was trying to stop some “bad guys” near Bayview Cemetery.
Seals, a married father of five, was part of a department tasked to get guns off the city's streets. Seals was on duty and in plainclothes when he was shot by at least one of the suspects, Kelly said.
The suspects then drove a stolen rental van about a mile and engaged police in the shootout from inside the kosher market. The shootout lasted two hours before police killed the suspects around 2:30 p. m. The suspects and three other people were found dead inside the store.
The store is in a section of the city that has become home to about 100 Orthodox Jewish families. The front of the market was destroyed, the storefront in ruins. Bullet holes riddled the walls and windows of Sacred Heart School that face the market.
New York Police Commissioner Dermot Shea, the brother of James Shea, said Jewish sites throughout the city are getting extra security.
"There is an escalation" in anti-Semitic hate crimes, Shea said. "It's ignorance, it's hate and it has to be denounced. "

More Women Say They Were Groped By Gooding

Texto completo: The additional accounts bring to 22 the number of women accusing Mr. Gooding, who faces charges he groped three of them.
Seven more women have come forward with accounts of unwanted sexual touching by the actor Cuba Gooding Jr. going back to 2003, prosecutors said in court documents, bringing the number of his accusers to 22.
Mr. Gooding, 51, has been charged with groping three of the women at Manhattan restaurants and nightclubs in 2018 and 2019. The other 19 have accused him of unwanted contact; those accusations, which come from several states, have not resulted in charges because, for the most part, they took place too long ago. But prosecutors in Manhattan are hoping to persuade a judge to allow the women to testify.
Prosecutors had previously revealed 12 additional accusers, and in a court filing obtained Monday by The New York Times, they listed seven more. In one accusation detailed in the court filing, a woman said that after she met Mr. Gooding at the Sundance Film Festival in Park City, Utah, in 2009, he took her to a concert, where he began to kiss her in a secluded hallway as she was attempting to leave.
Mr. Gooding then placed his hands on her buttocks, and pushed onto her crotch so forcefully that her tights ripped, according to the court filing. The woman bit Mr. Gooding's cheek so she could escape, the filing said.
Another woman accused Mr. Gooding of sliding his hand down her pants and cupping her buttocks at a restaurant in Atlanta in 2011, and a different accuser said that he grabbed her vagina twice at a restaurant in Malibu, Calif., in 2016, according to the court filing. The other four women said Mr. Gooding had groped or kissed them without their consent in Manhattan, Los Angeles and San Francisco, and at a nightclub near the Sundance festival in 2003.
A lawyer for Mr. Gooding, Mark J. Heller, did not immediately provide a response to the new allegations on Monday. Mr. Heller has previously said that Mr. Gooding denied any criminal wrongdoing and that when a celebrity is charged, people often "come out of the woodwork with allegations that are all over the place and, for the most part, aren't provable."
A spokeswoman for the Manhattan district attorney's office declined to comment on whether any of the additional accusers had gone to local police with their accusations against Mr. Gooding.
Prosecutors want permission from a judge to admit the 19 women as witnesses against Mr. Gooding, even though he has not been charged in those instances. An assistant district attorney, Jenna Long, said in the court documents, which were filed on Nov. 18, that allowing a jury to hear from these witnesses will help show a "pattern of behavior."
A judge will decide on Jan. 22 whether to admit any of the additional witnesses. Prosecutors in Manhattan are attempting a similar strategy in the coming sexual assault trial of the Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein. Decisions on whether to admit such witnesses generally depend on how similar their accounts are to the behavior the defendant is formally charged with, and whether admitting them would prevent the defendant from receiving a fair trial.
Mr. Gooding has been formally charged in three reported incidents, each resulting in misdemeanor charges of forcible touching and third-degree sexual abuse. He has pleaded not guilty. The maximum penalty for the top charge, forcible touching, is a year in jail.
In the court filing, the district attorney's office also detailed for the first time the circumstances behind the third pair of charges against Mr. Gooding. Prosecutors said that on the night of Sept. 9, 2018, at Lavo, an Italian restaurant on East 58th Street with a downstairs nightclub, Mr. Gooding kissed the cheek of a server without her consent and then later grabbed her neck to try to kiss her mouth, touching her tooth with his lips as she tried to turn her head away. That same night, Mr. Gooding licked another server's hand, the court filing said.
Mr. Gooding was previously charged with grabbing a woman's breast at a rooftop bar near Times Square in June and pinching the buttocks of a woman who served him at a nightclub in October 2018.

Texto completo: Houston Police Chief Art Acevedo called out prominent Texas Republicans on Monday for opposing gun restriction legislation to close the so-called "boyfriend loophole" after one of his officers was killed over the weekend responding to a domestic violence call.
Arturo Solis, who according to The Houston Chronicle had a previous misdemeanor domestic violence charge against a former girlfriend, should have never had access to a gun in the first place, Acevedo said in a press conference video. Sgt. Christopher Brewster was responding to the 911 call that reported Solis had assaulted his girlfriend and was armed with two guns. Solis fatally shot Brewster as soon as the officer got out of his car, authorities said.
Acevedo reproached Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, and U.S. Sens. Ted Cruz and John Cornyn, both Texas Republicans, for failing to support the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act and not supporting a provision that would prevent dating partners convicted of domestic violence, like Solis, from owning firearms.
The police chief said the Republican elected officials were too afraid of retaliation from the National Rifle Association to support the provision.
“You’re either here for women and children … or you’re here for the NRA,” Acevedo said.
The Houston Police Officers' Union condemned Acevedo's remarks and said he owes the Houston Police Department an apology for "hijacking this somber moment," reported Newsweek. Cruz shared the union's sentiment.
“It's unfortunate the chief of police in Houston seems more focused on trying to advance his own political ambitions than on supporting the brave men and women of HPD," the senator said in an email.
A spokesperson from Cornyn's office said in an email that the boyfriend loophole provision didn’t apply to Solis’ case since there are already laws in Texas preventing people convicted of misdemeanor domestic violence from buying guns within five years after they are released from jail.
The Violence Against Women Act, first passed in 1994, provides funding for the investigation and prosecution of violent crimes against women as well as services for domestic violence and sexual assault survivors.
When the Violence Against Women Act was up for reauthorization in 2013, Cruz, Cornyn and McConnell all voted no, though it passed the Senate in a 78-22 vote.
"Unfortunately, important legislation like this has fallen casualty to impeachment mania. We will keep trying to pass a bipartisan bill but it takes two (parties) to tango," Cornyn said in a tweet Thursday.

— Senator John Cornyn (@JohnCornyn) December 5, 2019
The Violence Against Women Act expired again in February and is now at an impasse in the Senate, which is at odds over which version of the act to pass. Although the House authorized an expanded version of the VAWA to close the boyfriend loophole, the NRA strongly opposed the House’s version, calling the provision a “poison pill” that’s “too broad and ripe for abuse” in an interview with The New York Times.
State Sen. Royce West, D-Dallas, who’s running for the U.S. Senate, said if elected, he’d vote to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act
“The NRA doesn’t own me. They never have and they never will. I will sit down at the table and hash out an agreement. I will help lead it to passage, like I’ve done for Texans many times in the Texas Senate,” West said.

Education in American Prisons

Resumen: According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics sixty-eight percent of convicts return to prison within three years and seventy-seven percent return within five years. According to Time magazine, thirty-nine percent of prisoners commit low level crimes that are not worthy of prison time and are better served doing community service or probation. According to the Center for American Progress, educating prisoners would be more cost effective because the more we educate prisoners, the less prisoners return, letting us save from not having to put them in prison and all of the costs that come with that.

Texto completo: Many would argue that jail’s purpose is to punish convicts for their crimes in order to teach a lesson and to rehabilitate them back into society. If that is so, then jails have not been fulfilling their purposes. According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics sixty-eight percent of convicts return to prison within three years and seventy-seven percent return within five years.
Many convicts after being released are unable to find employment, support from family and have to face unjust public scrutiny for crimes they have already paid. For these reasons, many return back to a life of crime to pay for basic needs, resulting in convicts returning back to jail. The poor convicts released have no pathway to gaining back their dignity and return to society. This pattern of harm is not only disadvantageous to the prisoner released but also to the nearby community. Convicts released who have no choice but to commit crimes hurts the community by giving people violence and fear. If we want to see convicts come back into society and communities not living in fear, then the system of locking someone up just to put them on the streets with no help must stop.
According to Time magazine, thirty-nine percent of prisoners commit low level crimes that are not worthy of prison time and are better served doing community service or probation. The Vera Institute of Justice released a study stating that the average cost of an inmate is $31,286. Instead of using these funds on low level crimes, we can spend these funds educating inmates who actually need to be in prison. According to the Center for American Progress, educating prisoners would be more cost effective because the more we educate prisoners, the less prisoners return, letting us save from not having to put them in prison and all of the costs that come with that. Several programs exist to help prisoners with education such as The Hudson Link for Higher Education in Prison, the Bard Prison Initiative and the Pell Grant.
However programs like these are in jeopardy because many people don’t think that others deserve second chances and that punishment is enough. Punishment without rehabilitation is clearly not an option as the statistic from the Bureau of Justice Statistics mentioned above states, "An estimated two-thirds (68 percent) of 405,000 prisoners released in 30 states in 2005 were arrested for a new crime within three years of release from prison, and three-quarters (77 percent) were arrested within five years." For ignorant reasons people want programs that are helping others defunded. This will affect prisoners who need help, communities that need to feel safe and taxpaying Americans. These programs educating prisoners must continue because they are working. Attorney General Eric Holder and Secretary of Education Arne Duncan reported research findings that inmates who participated in education programs had 43 percent lower odds of returning to prison than those who did not participate. Tell your local politicians that support education for prisoners and spread awareness about prison reform for your wallet, communities in danger and for those who need a second chance.

LEADING OFF
Happy Monday and welcome to Rhode Map, your daily guide to everything happening in the Ocean State. I'm Dan McGowan and even I can admit the Patriots got robbed last night. Follow me on Twitter @DanMcGowan or send tips to Dan.McGowan@globe.com.
First, a big thanks to Ed Fitzpatrick for writing Rhode Map all of last week. I'm just crossing my fingers that a trip to Florida won't be my Wally Pipp moment.
If you think you know how Rhode Island's two members of the US House of Representatives feel about impeaching President Trump, think again.
With the House expected to begin drafting articles of impeachment this week, Representatives David Cicilline and James Langevin are taking different approaches when it comes to deciding whether they'll support removing Trump from office.
In an appearance on “Fox News Sunday," Cicilline left open the possibility that lawmakers may include allegations made against Trump in the Mueller report in the articles of impeachment, on top of their claim that the president asked Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden.
In a follow-up email, Cicilline made it clear he intends to vote to impeach Trump, calling the facts against the president “uncontested."
“Donald Trump abused the power of his office for personal and political gain," Cicilline said. “His actions damaged our national security, undermined the integrity of the next election, and violated his oath of office."
So what about Langevin?
“Congressman Langevin will make a decision after the articles are referred to the full House," said spokesperson Victor Morente . He confirmed that Langevin is still undecided on impeaching the president.
It's worth noting that Langevin waited until August to announce his support for an impeachment inquiry into Trump, so it's not entirely surprising to see him holding his cards close to his chest. But it would be downright stunning if he were to defect from the Democrats on impeachment.
As for the upper chamber, US Senators Jack Reed and Sheldon Whitehouse have said they want to allow the process to play out on the House side. Of course, with Republicans controlling the Senate, it is unlikely Trump will be convicted.
NEED TO KNOW
Rhode Map wants to hear from you. If you've got a scoop or a link to an interesting news story in Rhode Island, e-mail us at RInews@globe.com.
The week's edition of Ocean State Innovators is with Navyn Salem , founder and CEO of Edesia Nutrition. Have an idea for someone Ed Fitzpatrick should talk to for his weekly Q&A? Email him at edward.fitzpatrick@globe.com.
A recent Globe editorial made the case for Ivy League institutions to end their legacy admissions policies. But Brown University professor and Pulitzer Prize winner David Kertzer argues the idea would not address the goal of greater economic diversity.
It looks like Rhode Island television stations have their first local advertising buy in the presidential race. Tom Steyer purchased a dozen 30-second spots with WPRI beginning Nov. 28, according to a filing with the Federal Communications Commission.
The Globe's editorial board calls for American voters to make climate change a priority at the polls in the 2020 elections.
US Senator Elizabeth Warren has a plan for just about everything, but the Globe's Larry Edelman reports the price tag on the Democratic presidential candidate's proposals is in the trillions of dollars.
The New York Times is the latest national outlet to profile Representative Cicilline's effort to regulate the world's largest tech companies. The Times also ran a story on Brown graduate Rob Sand , the Iowa state auditor whose endorsement is being sought by every Democrat running for president.
Winner : The two most common responses to our question about what to do with McCoy Stadium: Build a new school or create a public park.
WHAT'S ON TAP TODAY
Each day, Rhode Map offers a cheat sheet breaking down what's happening in Rhode Island. Have an idea? E-mail us at RInews@globe.com.
The Central Falls City Council is expected to approve an ordinance tonight that would spell out the police department's policies when it comes to working with federal immigration law enforcement. Most of the ordinance codifies existing policies in departments around the state, but Central Falls would be one of the first communities in Rhode Island to pass an immigration-related ordinance.
The Rhode Island Board of Elections has a lengthy agenda for its afternoon meeting, including another discussion about its plan to move to a new headquarters in Cranston. The board is also set to discuss the possibility of hiring a consultant to help it craft a social media policy for its members and staff.
Governor Gina Raimondo and first gentleman Andy Moffit will be at Rhode Island PBS this morning to promote a mental health awareness campaign that is set to launch.
A House advisory committee on veterans' affairs is scheduled to meet at the State House this morning at 10.

Start Living Your New Year's Resolutions Now

Texto completo: Stick with us here -- consider the next few weeks a dry run for a habit you'll start the New Year fully engaged with.
New Year's resolutions seem like a great way to take stock of the last year and set goals for the next one. Unfortunately, by February around 80 percent of people have failed to stick to theirs. Life-changing commitments are just hard to, well, commit to. If most people can't stay at it for six weeks, something must be wrong with the whole process.
It starts with the resolutions themselves. Both wishy-washy promises, like "lose some weight" or "write a book," and over-the-top commitments, like "drop 20 pounds by the start of March" or "become a New York Times best seller," are bad kinds of New Year's resolutions. They're either too vague to be useful or too hard to get done, so they don't motivate you at all. Instead, resolutions work best when they are specific, measurable, achievable, relevant and time-bound.
And while making good resolutions is important, you still have to stick to them -- which is hard. One way, however, to give yourself a leg up come Jan. 1 is to stop waiting around and start practicing your New Year's resolutions right now. Here's why.
Why people fail to stick to New Year's resolutions.
There's no single reason that most people fail to stick to their New Year's resolutions. It's a combination of factors and life just getting in the way.
A big part of it is that many people take on too much, too fast. By resolving to eat nothing but salads, run five miles to work every day and get three gym sessions in a week -- plus write that novel they always wanted to -- in January, the month right after the holidays, they are setting themselves up to fail dramatically, burn out and finish the month binge-watching Netflix and binge-eating Twinkies.
Another reason is that, at least at the start, sticking to resolutions tends to stink. One 2016 study from the University of Chicago found that the biggest predictor that people would keep to their long-term goals was whether they received an immediate reward. Delayed gratification just wasn't much of a motivator. Everyone swears they're going to the gym for the health of their future self, but if they're not enjoying it in the moment or seeing quick results, they tend to drop out. Those first few weeks of doing something new are almost always the worst. You're unfit, unpracticed and just unable to cope. Combine that with the often-miserable January weather, post-holiday blues and work stress, and almost nobody is having any fun until at least St. Patrick's Day.
A lot of people also approach New Year's resolutions with an all-or-nothing attitude. They go straight from zero to 100 with no warm-up or consultation with reality. If someone hasn't run in years, resolving to run five days a week is a ludicrous goal -- it's practically unattainable. And when they (entirely predictably) don't meet it, instead of reassessing their goal, they chalk it up as a failure. There's always next year, right?
It's a quirk of human nature that we're so obsessed with these hard start lines. Every exercise program begins on a Monday or the first of next month -- or on Jan. 1. It's understandable: The New Year is a good time to reflect and set goals. But it also makes things harder. When we mess up, we tend not to get back up and continue where we failed; we reset at the next hard start line.
If you have found yourself falling into any of these binds, you're not alone. But let's consider a solution.
Why you should start now.
No marathon runner ever steps up to the start line in a big race without putting in the training miles. He or she has been practicing for months, if not years. You should do the same with your New Year's resolutions. It will make it much easier to stick to them.
Decide that, after finishing this article, you're going to start practicing your New Year's resolutions now. Use the remaining weeks of the year as a trial period. It doesn't matter if you mess up or miss a day, you haven't committed to anything yet -- you literally can't fail.
By starting now, you will get a much deeper understanding of what you're resolving to do. It's better to find out in December that a five-mile run is a bit optimistic for your current fitness level, so you can dial it back and start with two-mile runs in January. And to make sticking to your New Year's resolution even easier, with a few weeks of occasional warm-up jogs, you won't be starting from scratch on Jan. 1. You'll already have gotten over the worst of the starting period. You might even be beginning to see results.
Whatever your resolutions, there is a lot to be said for using the next few weeks before the holidays as a practice period. If you're planning to eat healthily in January, use the time to find meals that you love and that are easy to cook. If you want to write a journal or take a photo every day, start now, and sticking to your resolution will already be part of your daily routine. If you want to write the next Great American Novel or Hollywood hit, get the plot worked out and the outline written; in the New Year, you'll be ready to go.
And, if you miss a few days or binge over the holiday period, what does it matter? You're just practicing. The big event doesn't start until Jan. 1. And by then, you'll be ready.

Texto completo: Easy-to-use technology straight from Moscow for any aspiring strongman -- at a low price.
Huawei, the Chinese telecommunications company and the largest telecommunications equipment manufacturer in the world, has helped African governments spy on political opponents. Beijing has also sold mass video surveillance to Ecuador and is advising a growing number of autocratic regimes on "information management." There's good reason to be worried about the exportation of Chinese technology.
But China isn't the only merchant offering digital surveillance tools to strongmen. It may be tempting to dismiss Russia as irrelevant in this domain, but that would be a mistake. In fact, Russia's low-tech model of digital authoritarianism could prove to be more readily adaptable and enduring.
A lot more countries look more like Russia than China: resource strapped aspiring authoritarians without "Great Firewalls" to filter data and block content. The Chinese surveillance model rests on the principle of wholesale integration of offline and online data, linking everything from closed-circuit television footage to social media activity to medical records. This requires vast administrative resources. Few states can afford the level of investment needed to obtain them.
That may be the strength of Russia's model.
At home, Russian surveillance technology relies less on mass filtering -- or, as is the case in China, the blocking of information before it reaches citizens -- and more on post-hoc monitoring, a repressive legal network and intimidation of private companies and nongovernmental organizations. That's much easier to replicate.
While Beijing instituted government control over the internet in the 1990s, the internet in Russia (as in most countries) penetrated society relatively unencumbered. Facebook, Twitter and Google -- all blocked in China -- are accessible in Russia. That's why the Russian government had to build a digital surveillance infrastructure that could sit on top of an open digital space, using fewer state resources than are used by China.
Enter the System of Operative Search Measures, or SORM, which is based on a Soviet-era surveillance system for monitoring telephone calls. In 1995, the system was resurrected and expanded to monitor email traffic and online browsing. Today, a growing list of companies, including telecommunications companies, internet service providers and social media platforms, are legally required to install SORM equipment.
SORM doesn't block information. Instead, it allows the security services and government agencies to access all the data that flows on the internet and on telecommunications networks. SORM basically works as a government's "backdoor" to the internet. It can be used to track personal details like Internet Protocol, or I.P., addresses, social media user names and the email addresses of, for example, protest leaders or opposition politicians.
Russian companies have been selling SORM-related technologies to Belarus, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan and Ukraine -- and further afield to countries in Latin America, Africa and the Middle East. MFI Soft, one of the largest SORM providers, offers a variety of packages and 24-hour customer service, and it claims a decade of experience providing equipment. One of MFI Soft's most popular packages, SORMovich, can be purchased for approximately $ 20,000. In 2017, MFI Soft became part of a growing consortium of so-called "information security" companies known as the Citadel group. The move to consolidate the surveillance technology market under one umbrella holding suggests the Kremlin intends to scale up capabilities and harmonize pricing.
SORM pales in comparison with China's "Sharp Eyes" initiative, which aims to be a fully omniscient system integrating artificial intelligence and data input from video and online surveillance. It's also not secure. Recently, a Russian programmer found that SORM devices were leaking Russians' personal data, including geolocation coordinates and telephone numbers. But unlike the complex Chinese vision of complete surveillance, SORM technologies are relatively easy to install and integrate with other systems.
Russia has not been the industry leader in exporting high-tech digital surveillance, and it is unclear to what extent Russian companies are directly competing with Chinese firms for the same markets. For Chinese companies, Russia's small market share in surveillance technology is unlikely to be seen as a competitive threat. As more countries adopt other Chinese technologies, such as Huawei's 5G systems, compatible Chinese-made surveillance equipment will become increasingly cheaper and easier to install. As the cost of Chinese-made technologies decreases, the window for Russian exports to get a foothold in the market will narrow.
But Russia is also exporting ideas. The so-called "sovereign internet" law, signed by President Vladimir Putin earlier this year, came into effect on Nov. 1. Theoretically, the law enables the government to cut off the Russian internet in whole or in parts from the global internet in order to prevent, for example, protesters from communicating, organizing or broadcasting their messages. It also requires internet service providers to automatically block banned websites and monitor (and block as required) international communications.
Even before the law came into effect, the Russian government had already experimented with targeted mobile internet shutdowns during anti-government protests in Moscow this summer. Other countries have followed Moscow's lead: In November, amid widespread protests, Iran successfully shut down the internet across the country. Such shutdowns are part of a growing trend: Authoritarian regimes are learning from each other how to weaponize technologies.
Past Russian behavior suggests that when the West is preoccupied elsewhere, Russia seeks out new opportunities to advance its influence. As the United States grows skeptical of Chinese technology companies and tries to pressure other countries to join a crackdown, Russian surveillance technology exporters may step in to offer an alternative, and perhaps more affordable, model of digital authoritarianism.

Texto completo: Federal regulators took woefully inadequate action recently on fake online reviews of a consumer product. Such action needs to be more aggressive and tougher on bad players.

The Federal Trade Commission accused Houston-based Sunday Riley Skincare with directing the posting of glowing online reviews of its products on the website of Sephora. The leader of the beauty-products maker instructed her employees to do so, and then used technology to hide the IP addresses of the posters to mask that employees were writing the four and five-star reviews.

The FTC's settlement put an end to the bogus review posting but imposed no financial penalties. Two commission members objected, with one saying the settlement was unlikely to deter other would-be wrongdoers.

And that's true.

An increase of one star in a rating on Amazon.com correlates with a 26 percent increase in sales, the New York Times reported that a recent e-commerce analysis found. That cha-ching is what entices manufacturers and distributors to consider such shady dealings.

Reviews are available on nearly every product website and frequently are examined by would-be buyers. Fake reviews are unfair and can be dangerous to the unsuspecting public.

In the Sunday Riley case, the brazenness is jolting. Ms. Riley, the chief executive, sent an email to her staff to post reviews, saying in part: Make sure to NOT compare the product to other products, to not use foul language, and to be very enthusiastic without looking like a plant.

The FTC found multiple fake reviews, going on for years, but its settlement with Sunday Riley called for the practice to end without fines. If the firm posts more fake reviews, civil penalties will kick in.

Saoud Khalifah, the head of Fakespot, a company that analyzes the authenticity of reviews on various websites, told the New York Times: It was the most blatant case of fake reviews, and this is how the government responds to it. Now everybody is like, OK, if that's the penalty, then why not write more fake reviews and pump ourselves through the roof?

Fakespot tells the Wall Street Journal that more than a third of reviews on major websites such as Amazon.com and Walmart are fake, generated by robots or people paid to write them.

Retailers, such as Sephora and Walmart, have an obligation to monitor product reviews on their websites. Some companies remove those that aren't signed by a verified customer. Amazon said it prevented more than 13 million bogus reviews on its website last year.

Self-policing is fine, but federal regulators need to step up their game so as not to leave consumers on their own in assessing the value of online reviews.

The FTC should take online commerce seriously to protect the public and to punish the cheaters. That means implementing a we-won't-tolerate-this approach and vigorous sanctions.

Texto completo: One of the most striking moments in Sarah M. Brooms enthralling memoir, The Yellow House, comes near its end. Brooms indomitable mother, Ivory Mae Broom, was born and raised in New Orleans, as were her 12 children. Broom describes Ivory Mae staying overnight in her daughters apartment in the citys iconic French Quarter:  Im seventy-one, she announced from the balcony the day after I moved in. And this is the first time Im sleeping in the French Quarter. 

If, like many visitors, you think the French Quarter is New Orleans, Broom has another story to tell you. It is a rich and deep one, not just the story of her own life (although that is a rich enough tale) but the story of several generations of her family and of the city that is indelibly their home, both before and after what Broom calls the Water.

The Water, of course, is Hurricane Katrina, the devastating storm that inundated the city in 2005, and from which it has not fully recovered. The French Quarter had minimal damage, but some neighborhoods, like New Orleans East, the site of the Broom family home that gives the book its title, were all but erased from the map.

New Orleans East, Broom tells us, often didnt show up on maps of the city even before Katrina. Wedged between the Industrial Canal, the Intracoastal Waterway and Lake Pontchartrain, its the newest part of one of the oldest U.S. cities, hopefully promoted as suburbs in the 1960s. Ivory Mae bought her shotgun house on Wilson Avenue in 1961 for $3,200, when she was a 19-year-old widow. (Her first husband was hit by a car as he walked along a road near the Army base where he was stationed.) She had two children and another on the way.

The house needed work; by the time Ivory Mae moved in three years later, she had married her second husband, Simon Broom Sr. Each of them had three children from first marriages, and they would have six together. Sarah is the youngest, born 30 years after her oldest sibling.

She begins the book long before her own arrival, recounting the lives of her siblings, parents, grandparents and great-grandparents. Throughout the book, that family history is interwoven with the history of New Orleans East, which goes from an integrated suburb to a largely black neighborhood that was already beginning to turn into an industrial district before the Water.

Broom writes lovingly but unsentimentally about her familys complex relationships. Ivory Mae is for years a devoted stay-at-home mom, a meticulous housekeeper and fine cook who sews all the clothes for her family. Simon works in the maintenance department at the nearby NASA installation and is as devoted to their family as Ivory Mae is.

But six months after Sarah is born, Simon dies at 56 of an aneurysm, leaving Ivory Mae a widow for the second time at 39. Some of her children will go to college, others will go to prison. Over time, the Yellow House she was so proud of will deteriorate, with too little money or time to make repairs.

And then, the Water. By 2005 Broom was living in Harlem, working as a journalist. About half of her family still lived in New Orleans, and most, including Ivory Mae, fled the storm, in three different directions.

But Sarahs brother Carl would stay in the Yellow House as it drowned, armed with an ax to chop his way out when the attic flooded. He perched on the roof with his two Pekingese dogs, occasionally swimming down the street to check on other stranded residents, until rescuers arrived seven days after the flood.

Broom writes movingly about how her siblings reach out to help each other and their mother, and about the traumas that dont entirely heal. Their grandmother dies not long after the storm, and few people come to her funeral because the family is unable to put an obituary in the Times-Picayune; they make dozens of phone calls but in the floods wake, the line stayed busy; no one ever answered.

Broom, too, has a dramatic emotional response, even though she was far away from the storm. She quits her magazine job and goes to Burundi (a sort of African New Orleans East that few Americans can readily locate) to work for a nonprofit for several months.

Then she jumps back into New Orleans with both feet, working as a speechwriter for Mayor Ray Nagin during storm recovery. She ping-pongs back to New York, then to that apartment in the French Quarter, sandwiched between former residences of Tennessee Williams and William Faulkner, still wrestling with her own identity.

Along the way, Ivory Mae struggles with mountains of paperwork to try to repair and return to her beloved Yellow House, but it will meet a melancholy fate.

Brooms writing has appeared in the New Yorker, Oxford American, O magazine and the New York Times Magazine. This memoir is her first book; in November it won the National Book Award for nonfiction.

The Yellow House is the story of a uniquely American family and a uniquely American city, beautifully told.

Texto completo: Winning a war is not only about killing  its also about saving lives, especially if those lives are wounded soldiers fighting on your side.
Its safe to say that no McLean County resident saved more lives in World War II  or any other war, for that matter  than Dr. Edward Delos (E.D.) Churchill. Born and raised in the small northern McLean County community of Chenoa, Churchill played an instrumental role in improving medical care for U.S. and Allied troops  especially in the area of wound management and whole blood transfusions.
Before and after the war, Churchill  with his deep professional ties to Harvard Medical School and Massachusetts General Hospital  garnered laurels for achieving a series of medical advances.
His accomplishments included groundbreaking thoracic surgery relating to the lung, and the use of lobectomies (the removal of part  or all  of an organ) in the treatment of lung cancer and tuberculosis. And he performed the first operation in the U.S. for relief of constricting pericarditis (whereby the membrane sack around the heart interferes with blood flow.)
Churchill credited his Central Illinois upbringing for shaping his character and instilling positive traits such as self-confidence and steadfastness. Because it was of this stuff we were all made, he said. Fortunate breaks in opportunity did the rest.
Born Christmas Day 1895, he was the third and youngest child of Ebenezer Delos (who also went by E.D.) and Maria Farnsworth Churchill. The family was in the grain business, operating elevators in Chenoa and outlying communities and railroad sidings.
Although Dr. Churchill went on to achieve fame in the rarefied air of the Boston-Cambridge medical establishment, he was just another kid when growing up in Chenoa. Other of his friends remember that he was usually one of the gang when they raided apple trees and grape vines, reported The Pantagraph in a 1955 feature titled That Freshman of Yesteryear. His staunch Presbyterian parents would probably have been appalled had they known this, it was further observed. But who knows? Experiences with green apples and grapes might have started his medical career.
A sixteen-year-old Pete Churchill (as he was known) graduated from Chenoa High in 1912  not a valedictorian, it was said, but ranking high in his class. At the graduation exercises, he wore knee-length trousers, while the other, older boys sported long pants. A few classmates remember him as being rather small in stature and spritely. Another remembered him as mischievous.
From Chenoa, Churchill headed to Northwestern University, earning a B.S. in 1916 and an M.S. the following year. After that it was a medical degree at Harvard, graduating cum laude in 1920.
In 1943, with war raging across the globe, Churchill left the comforts of his Harvard professorship and the privileges of his Massachusetts General practice for the North African and later Mediterranean theaters of war, serving as a surgical consultant with the rank of lieutenant colonel.
During his time in uniform, he was a major figure in the medical and bureaucratic struggle to increase the use of whole blood on the front lines. Plasma could be transported much more easily than whole blood, but while it increased blood pressure, it lacked the oxygenating properties of red blood cells, As such, plasma was a stopgap measure at best.
Whole blood transfusions saved more lives, but demanded a complex system entailing the collection, transportation, and storage of refrigerated blood. Churchill and others led the charge to force recalcitrant Army and Navy brass to undertake the changeover  despite the daunting logistical challenges.
On Aug. 27, 1943, The New York Times ran an article headlined Live-Blood Banks Save Soldiers Lives in Sicily When Plasma Proves Inadequate. Datelined Allied Headquarters in North Africa, the article reported on the programs unqualified success in the recently concluded Tunisian campaign.
As such, Churchill hoped the article would convince others  from political leaders to regular folk  of the need to expand the use of whole blood in surgical units and military hospitals. There is need for whole blood transfusions in the treatment of a significant proportion of wounded, The Times quoted Churchill. Plasma is not an adequate substitute in these cases.
Donors were sought among noncombatant troops, convalescent and mildly wounded patients and solders from medical detachments. The article also noted that the British had used volunteer POWs, paying them $10 for each donation.
The successful use of whole blood in North Africa led to its expansion during the Allied slog up the craggy Italian Peninsula (known as the Forgotten War).
We got the blood from the troops in the rear areas, Churchill recalled after returning stateside in January 1945, adding that in two or three months after we started at the beginning of 1944, we had delivered nine tons of whole blood for use in the Italian campaign.
Interviewed by the Boston Globe newspaper, Churchill also touted the pioneering work done in the area of wound management. Successes included the establishment of field hospitals near the front lines to provide forward surgery before wounded soldiers were sent further back to undergo additional care. This two-stage approach to surgery saved untold lives during the war  and in the countless wars that have followed.
After the war, Churchill remained an influential figure in American medicine, serving as chief of surgical services for Massachusetts General until 1962, and holding the John Homans professorship of surgery at Harvard for 31 years.
Edward Delos Churchill passed away in 1972 at the age of 76, near his summer home in Strafford, Vermont.
Although Churchill  through his long and productive affiliations with Boston General and Harvard  was the epitome of the East Coast professional elite, he never forgot his Corn Belt roots. People back home think those who go to other areas of the world and become surrounded by the busy affairs of a different life forget their childhood, Churchill said in his later years. But there are no more vivid memories.

Texto completo: The FBI is presuming the Pensacola shooting to be a terrorist attack after a Saudi national killed three at a Naval base in Florida.
“We work with the presumption that this was an act of terrorism,” Rachel Rojas, FBI special agent in charge, said at a news conference Sunday.
Rojas and Defense Secretary Mark Esper also confirmed that two of the other Saudi nationals being investigated in connection to the recent shooting were filming the attack.
Six Saudi nationals had been arrested after Mohammed Saeed Alshamrani, also a Saudi national, opened fire at a Naval base in Pensacola, Florida, killing three and wounding seven others on Friday morning.
The New York Times reported that sources said other Saudi nationals had filmed the horrific shooting, which Esper confirmed Sunday. It is not yet clear why the individuals were filming.
“So some [Saudi Nationals] were detained; friends of his that were also on that base as I understand it. And I also was told that someone, or two, were filming it. What's unclear is were they filming it before it began, or was it something where they picked up their phones and filmed it once they saw it unfolding. That may be a distinction with or without a difference, but again that is why I think we need to let the investigation play out.” he told Fox News Sunday.
Authorities noted that that the FBI is investigating the shooting as an act of terror.

Texto completo: La llegada de Donald Trump a la Casa Blanca y su discurso en contra de la inmigración impulsó a quienes habían sido sus empleados a denunciar públicamente a su antiguo jefe . El mismo Trump que criticaba a los extranjeros que llegaban a Estados Unidos por supuestamente robar el trabajo a los nacionales o que generalizaba apuntándoles como criminales, se había aprovechado en sus propiedades de la inmigración indocumentada .
Durante el año pasado, el Washington Post habló con 48 personas que habían trabajado para Trump sin tener permiso de trabajo . La ahora primera familia había usado los servicios de esta gente en 11 instalaciones de Florida, Nueva Jersey, Nueva York y Virginia. Estos trabajadores habían pasado años -algunos incluso dos décadas- manteniendo limpios los resorts Trump y alimentando a sus invitados.
La mayoría de estos empleados indocumentados perdieron su trabajo o lo abandonaron después de que se hiciera público el escándalo laboral que los salpicaba . Sin embargo, la organización Trump -aún propiedad del presidente aunque dirigida por su hijo mayor-, asegura que no sabía si los inmigrantes tenían permiso para trabajar o no. Por su parte, la Casa Blanca desprestigió las investigaciones del diario llamándolas “basura de tabloide”.
Margarita Cruz, una de las limpiadoras de la familia presidencial, dijo que Trump preguntaba a cada inmigrante que trabajaba para él su nombre, cuánto tiempo llevaba en el lugar y si le gustaba. Tras la pequeña conversación, Trump les daba un billete de $50 o $100 dólares.
El miedo se extendió entre el personal de la organización Trump cuando su jefe llegó a la presidencia hasta que un día, Sandra Díaz y Victorina Morales -ambas en algún momento limpiadoras en Bedminster- decidieron hacerse visibles y hablaron con the Post, The New York Times y otras publicaciones. Lo hicieron, según ellas mismas explicaron, para sacar a la luz la hipocresía del presidente .
Un año después de estos contactos con la prensa, Díaz y Morales ya no trabajan para Trump y las denuncias no han tenido repercusión legal para organización Trump . Tampoco se conoce ningún caso de deportación derivado de lo que revelaron las mujeres pero, aún así, amigos y colegas las han tachado de traidoras por poner sobre la mesa un tema que afecta a la economía sumergida de EEUU. Aún así, ellas insisten en que valió la pena.

Texto completo: MIAMI – La policía investiga este sábado si el saudí que mató a tres personas la víspera, en un tiroteo en una base militar de Florida donde recibía formación, actuó solo o contó con cómplices.
“Vamos a esclarecer esto”, afirmó el presidente Donald Trump, desde los jardines de la Casa Blanca. “Intentamos averiguar qué pasó, si se trata de una persona o de varias”.
The FBI has dedicated resources from both our Joint Terrorism Task Force and our criminal investigative programs to the NAS Pensacola shooting investigation. The shooter's motivaton is still being determined. pic.twitter.com/Miwjt5Yhk6
— FBI Jacksonville (@FBIJacksonville) December 7, 2019
Según el diario The New York Times, que cita a una fuente anónima, seis ciudadanos saudíes fueron interrogados en el lugar del ataque, entre ellos dos que habían lo filmado.
El periódico añade que el tirador había enseñado videos de tiroteos masivos durante una fiesta celebrada el jueves por la noche, según una fuente conocedora de la investigación.
“Los motivos del tirador todavía se desconocen”, indicó en Twitter la oficina de Jacksonville de la policía federal estadounidense (FBI), que investiga el caso junto con una unidad especializada en antiterrorismo.
Un miembro del Ejército del Aire saudí mató a tres personas e hirió a siete el viernes cuando abrió fuego con un arma corta en una sala de clase de la base de Pensacola, antes de que la policía lo abatiera.
Antes de su ataque había tuiteado mensajes hostiles hacia Estados Unidos, informó el grupo de vigilancia de movimientos yihadistas SITE.
“Estoy contra el mal, y Estados Unidos se convirtió en su conjunto en nación del mal”, escribió el asaltante, que SITE identificó como Mohamed al Shamrani.
Según medios estadounidenses, los investigadores tratan de comprobar si el autor del ataque publicó realmente aquellos mensajes, en los que se citaba al saudí Osama bin Laden, exdirigente del grupo yihadista Al Qaida muerto a manos de militares estadounidenses en 2011.
Quince de los 19 pilotos que desviaron aviones y provocaron la muerte de unas 3,000 personas en los atentados del 11 de septiembre de 2001 en Estados Unidos eran saudíes.
Tras condenar ese tiroteo “atroz”, Riad intentó el sábado distanciarse de su ciudadano.
“Como muchos miembros del Ejército saudita, he sido formado en una base militar estadounidense y nos hemos beneficiado de ese entrenamiento (…) para combatir el terrorismo y otras amenazas, junto a nuestro aliados estadounidenses”, afirmó el sábado en Twitter el viceministro de Defensa, el príncipe Jaled bin Salmán.
Trump, que habló por teléfono con el rey Salmán sobre lo ocurrido, afirmó este sábado que los dirigentes saudíes estaban “muy afectados” por los hechos de la víspera.
“Creo que [los saudíes] ayudarán mucho a las familias”, dijo el presidente estadounidense.
El gobernador de Florida Ron DeSantis sugirió el viernes que el reino saudí debería ofrecer una indemnización a las víctimas.
“Obviamente, el gobierno de Arabia Saudita necesita aliviar a estas víctimas. Y pienso que tendrán una deuda aquí puesto que [el atacante] es uno de sus ciudadanos”, dijo.

Zirkin's conduct on gun bill showed he wasn't a good legislator Andrea Chamblee

Texto completo: I'm ashamed that my high school in Howard County, Glenelg High, was the place where Grace McComas was bullied until she saw no other way out than suicide. The law in her name, Grace's law, was an important accomplishment, even it was too late for Grace.
State Sen. Bobby Zirkin, D-Montgomery County, splashed that accomplishment all over a Facebook page that he would later claim was not related to his public position as a state senator when he started deleting polite requests from constituents for him to explain his position on another life-saving bill that he "slow-walked" through the Senate until the clock ran out last year: the bill that would make it illegal for already disqualified people to obtain rifles and shotguns at gun shows and other transfers.
Although Gov. Larry Hogan was publicly shamed and paid a fine for the same kind of deletions just before this, the constituents who were deleted had no such option. This is because Zirkin is so petty and vengeful that we knew other important bills would be slow-walked by him again. He had already done this with a bill that would encourage undocumented people to report crimes and cooperate with police, and a bill that would allow patients with painful, fatal diseases to end their lives early.
Our option was to write to Zirkin and copy the Maryland Democratic Party. Once the Party indicated Zirkin would have to pay his own legal fees for his unconstitutional action, Zirkin claimed not to remember deleting our posts, but he promised not to do it again. To avoid his retaliation in 2020, we decided to keep it secret.
To the extent Zirkin blames "hostile social media" for his woes, he was the hostile player in that game.
Zirkin did contact me to offer a truce, of sorts, to meet in person. He declined my suggestions of any Saturday or Sunday. I suggested a Friday, and he said no. I asked him to chose a day, and despite the front-page stories in The Capital almost daily with the upcoming trial schedule, he suggested Nov 4, the opening day of the trial of my husband's murderer.
After making sure he really meant that day, I accepted his dare to meet me Nov 4.
We have not met.
While it is true that a good legislator votes against bad legislation, Zirkin did not do that. He did not attack the flaws in these bills. As chair of the most powerful committee, he didn't try to amend the bills to improve them. He didn't even discuss them.
Instead, he stood between the chosen representatives of Maryland voters and their chance to do their jobs and vote at all, Yes or No. That is not democratic. That is petty, vindictive, and authoritarian.
Andrea Chamblee is a co-author of The Capital of Basketball, by John McNamara. McNamara was killed in the June 28, 2018 attack on the Capital Gazette newsroom. Their book has been recommended by the New York Times. She lives in Silver Spring.

Salvation in upending an entire system

Texto completo: "Knives Out," one of the more interesting and entertaining movies of 2019, attempts something that has never really been done before: adapting the classic murder mystery, an inherently conservative genre, to modern progressive discourse rebuking casually expressed racism, latent sexism and classicism. The film even expresses overt political resistance to the current administration's draconian immigration policy. All while rattling your cage with scary noises and teasing your brain with devious schemes.
Rian Johnson's film -- the plot involves the murder of an aged mystery novelist inside his own country house with various heirs and staffers as the chief suspects -- surely is the most woke murder-mystery movie ever made.
Which begs the question: Does it win the battle with the form? Has it changed something very familiar, and maybe very regressive, for the good? Or has it fallen into its own trap?
To answer all that, it's helpful to consider Agatha Christie. In the popular imagination, this British author is the mistress of the clever mystery plot, usually involving a perplexing murder, numerous potential suspects and an enigmatic detective with unconventional methods. As the keepers of her flame like to say, Christie gets outsold only by William Shakespeare and the Bible. Her detective novels and short stories have sold more than 1 billion copies. You can bet that when Johnson was pitching his movie to studio executives, Christie's name came up.
Christie mostly was following a template mastered by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, the creator of the Sherlock Holmes detective fictions and the man who popularized the form. (He didn't invent it; the likes of Wilkie Collins and Edgar Allan Poe have claims there, and some would say the whodunit genre dates back to the stories inside the ancient Arabian epic "One Thousand and One Nights.") But Holmes and Watson were stuffy dudes; Christie's Hercule Poirot was a lot more fun, and her stories of guests trapped in some confined environment (a house, a train, an island) proved hugely popular in Hollywood for decades. "Murder on the Orient Express" offers five words everyone knows.
But those Christie stories now often are viewed as problematic. There have been charges of racism, especially involving "And Then There Were None," one of her biggest hits and a work that once carried a very different title when first published in Britain. Some have seen a whiff of anti-Semitism and Orientalism in her writing, although that was hardly uncommon in her era. Of course, it is never as simple as that. Christie wrote domestic thrillers, mostly; her stories involved people getting killed off while at a party or at home and she has plenty of defenders who argue that she was advanced in her psychological thinking and even quite radical in her dissemination of the decay inside the mid-20th century family, and by extension, the patriarchal society at large. It all depends on your point of view, and whether you believe in incremental progress.
As with horror, crime fiction relies on positing an "other," something terrifying that both captivates and scares a reader or an audience member and that, eventually, can be beaten back into submission and send the consumer back to normalcy wiping a brow. Christie's "others" tend to be things at variance with a traditional power structure: dangerously exotic locations, for example, or overly passionate people or mentally unstable individuals. They act up, and they get taken down by the majority.
Johnson challenges all of that, not the least by casting actors like Christopher Plummer and Daniel Craig, stars previously associated with celebrations of patriarchal authority, from Captain von Trapp to James Bond. In "Knives Out," Johnson thoroughly upends the Christie model of fundamentally decent people trying to repel the murderer in their midst. His characters are complacent and self-serving, casually racist in their dealings with the film's central character, a Latina home care nurse (richly played by Ana de Armas) who is especially vulnerable due to the immigration status of her own family. Johnson makes her a near-perfect person, a shining beacon of integrity in stark contrast to all the flawed characters surrounding her.
At times, "Knives Out" feels a murder-mystery version of the HBO series "Succession," another example of a hugely successful drama that feeds our current desire to ogle at the horrific behavior of those whose power flows from inherited wealth. Such people are the chief villains of 2019, the year of the college admissions scandal.
In "Succession," and many similar shows, the establishment is widely seen as morally corrupt, and the whole notion of being a rightful heir is viewed as a kind of moral pollution, indicative of the last gasps of a dying and non-meretricious American aristocracy of the economically privileged. In both "Knives Out" and "Succession," we watch example after example of insensitivity, self-absorption, personal fragility and elitism. The only hope for salvation, both these neo-socialist works say, lies not with finding an individual villain (there will just be another) but upending an entire system.
Of course, "Succession" is a satire and it thus can focus entirely on powerful white people behaving badly. Like a progressive complainant on Twitter, it does not have to offer a solution to how a kinder and gentler capitalist society might figure all this out.
"Knives Out," though, has to resolve the disruption. Murder mysteries need endings. The puzzle must be solved. And that's where Johnson hits other issues.
In a shrewd New York Times column, critic Monica Castillo described her experience watching "Knives Out" as a kind of "emotional whiplash," not least because the subplot involving immigration issues, and the fear of deportation, was, she wrote, mostly played for laughs, this being a comedy thriller. Castillo saw that as the unintended consequences of well-intended art, as made by someone who did not share those fears himself.
Exactly.
It's also indicative of a hoary old genre repelling reinvention. Murder mysteries were born in a world and a time where the establishment rules were seen as positives, even in domestic settings; people consumed them to be comforted by the notion that Poirot or Miss Marple would restore order.
Order restored? We are no longer in that time. Much more complicated now.

Texto completo: Portsmouth, New Hampshire residents are lucky that, almost six years ago, Julie Cutting unknowingly lived out a famous quote from "The Picture of Dorian Gray."
When Oscar Wilde wrote that "the only way to get rid of temptation is to yield to it," his characters intended something more hedonistic than real estate, but listen to Cutting, the sole owner and head chef at Cure Restaurant, tell her business's backstory, and you can tell how hard she fell for the seductive curves of one particular brick storefront.
Cutting had just appeared on Food Network's competition program Cutthroat Kitchen, which meant locals were buzzing about her.
"The woman who owned this building told her broker she wanted a female business owner to go into the space. More than that, she wanted me." Cutting said. "I had committed to work at another restaurant in Kittery. But the building's owner wouldn't let up. She knew I'd fall in love with the space and kept urging me just to do a walk-through. I mean, what young chef doesn't want their own restaurant? So I went and saw it and said, 'Let's sign the papers tonight!'"
Although the space was already outfitted as a restaurant, the formal, pseudo-ProvenÃ§al vibe did not match Cutting's more casual vision for the shotgun-style duo of interconnected dining rooms. So she mounted curvilinear metal sculptures and oversized photos of cattle on the walls, concealed the "drastic" yellows and greens with powdery, desaturated tones and made features of exposed brickwork and tin ceilings.
Today (apart from characterless chairs that look like they were nicked from a Chipotle), the space reads as homey and rustic, in harmony with a menu focused on comfort food - dishes that evoke Cutting's New England and French-Canadian heritage, but frequently with an impressionistic twist or two.
Take her duck confit poutine ($11), a sensible, fist-sized portion of crisp fries topped with oozy Maine cheese curds and glistening shreds of duck leg slow-poached and cured overnight in its own fat. Despite an unnecessary drizzle of white truffle oil, it's a terrific dish, one Cutting dreamed up as a whimsical Restaurant Week special to riff on the confit duck drumettes she serves buffalo-wing-style on the permanent menu ($12).
Or Cure's autumnal hand-pie filled with local apples simmered with brown sugar, lemon juice and allspice ($6). As traditional as the filling sounds, the rest is anything but. In place of a short pastry crust, the kitchen swaddles the stewed fruit in a white-flour tortilla, then flash-fries the bundle like a Chimichanga before rolling it in cinnamon sugar. Thanks in part to an accompanying scoop of Shain's of Maine vanilla ice cream, it's an oddball reimagining of a classic American dessert that actually works.
When infrequent blunders occur, they tend to be mistakes of proportion rather than conception, like a goopy excess of gorgonzola-and-mayonnaise dressing on the grilled romaine wedge ($10) - a deconstructed salad of charred lettuce, cherry tomato, hard-boiled egg and crunchy Kellie Brook Farm bacon ends from Greenland, New Hampshire. Or the red wine floater that capsizes the balance in Cure's Bulleit-bourbon-based New York Sour cocktail ($12), introducing too much sweetness and an unpleasant tannic astringency.
Service also offers a mixed bag of genuine warmth and enthusiasm combined with (almost certainly) unintentional misinformation. My server raved about how the perfectly enjoyable grilled bread with butter and rosemary salt ($2.50) was prepared with local sourdough (it is not), then incorrectly ventured that the salted caramel cider (a cocktail special, $10) "might not actually have any cider in it."
On the other hand, the host that evening doted on nearly everyone in both dining rooms. When a couple nearby thanked her for her attention, she let slip that recent online reviews had also mentioned her stellar service. "I don't need Yelp to validate me, but I like it when it does," she said, adding with a laugh, "And Yelp does it a lot!"
Generally, that's because Cure delivers on its comfort food promises, especially when it comes to larger format dishes. Pork tenderloin ($26) is not always on Cutting's menu, but it deserves to be, particularly when she marinates it in maple syrup and bourbon and roasts until the interior surrenders only a memory of rosiness. Buttery whipped sweet potatoes and Brussels sprouts that resist the tines of your fork ... barely ... signal the season in the most appealing fashion I can imagine.
Still, Cure's best menu item is practically a culinary collage of Cutting's childhood memories growing up on a cattle farm in Pittsfield, New Hampshire, where she would sometimes play her flute to the black angus cows grazing nearby. Boneless beef short ribs, slow-braised for eight hours in onions, red wine and beef stock ($24) are the star of the dish, yielding and suffused with umami. But just as wonderful are butter-slick tendrils of broccolini and a bacon-sprinkled disk of cheesy, mandolin-sliced Yukon potatoes bathed in cream.
My dinner guest was the one who ordered the short rib when I visited last week, and now is my chance to admit that, when we swapped plates for a taste, I convinced him to let me keep it. Temptation, after all, is the only thing I can't resist.

Texto completo: Catch Noah Baumbach's story of a marriage's collapse, and a televised performance of the colorful Broadway musical.
What's Streaming
MARRIAGE STORY (2019) Stream on Netflix. The director Noah Baumbach told The New York Times's Reggie Ugwu that during the process of writing his latest film about a crumbling marriage, he leaned on his friends and his actors for their perspectives on relationships to get inside the minds of the uncoupling couple Charlie (Adam Driver) and Nicole (Scarlett Johansson). The result, as A.O. Scott writes in his New York Times review, is a film that is "funny and sad, sometimes within a single scene, and it weaves a plot out of the messy collapse of a shared reality, trying to make music out of disharmony."
What's on TV
THE SPONGEBOB MUSICAL: LIVE ON STAGE! 7 p.m. on Nickelodeon. Are ya ready, kids? If you weren't able to witness what Ben Brantley, co-chief theater critic for The New York Times, described as a "ginormous giggle of a show" during its Broadway run, you'll now be able to see much of the original company bring the colorful stage adaptation of the kids' program to TV. The cast -- which includes Ethan Slater as the titular sponge, Gavin Lee as his grumpy neighbor Squidward, Danny Skinner as his BFF Patrick Star and Brian Ray Norris as his fast-food employer Mr. Krabs -- has reunited for the televised live performance, which follows SpongeBob and his mates as they learn that a volcano is threatening to destroy their underwater wonderland. Along with music written by John Legend, Cyndi Lauper and the Flaming Lips, the TV musical will also see Tom Kenny, the actor who voiced characters in the original animated series, perform the original song "Poor Pirates," which was written by Sara Bareilles.
CRIMINAL CONFESSIONS 6 p.m. on Oxygen. In one of the more chilling murder cases from 2018, Chris Watts pleaded in a TV interview for his pregnant wife and two young daughters to come home following their mysterious disappearance, before later admitting to killing them and dumping their bodies at the oil site where he worked in Colorado. Just over a year ago, Watts was sentenced to serve life in prison after pleading guilty to what the judge called "perhaps the most inhumane and vicious crime I have handled out of the thousands of cases that I have seen." In the 90-minute season premiere of this true-crime series, the case's lead investigators will reveal the tactics they used to secure a confession from Watts.
GIVE A DOG A HOME LIVE! 8 p.m. on Animal Planet. If you're thinking of gifting your family or yourself a new pet this holiday season, catch this two-hour special edition of Animal Planet's biweekly animal adoption series. Kit Hoover of "Access Hollywood" and Dan Schachner of "Puppy Bowl" road trip across the United States to meet rescue dogs and cats and then share information about them on social media so that audiences at home can find out how to adopt them.

Texto completo: Alanis Morissette's "Jagged Little Pill" musical debuted on Broadway Thursday, more than 25 years after the Grammy award-winning album released to critical acclaim.
Written by Diablo Cody and directed by Diane Paulus, the pop-rock musical centers on a fictional family in Connecticut that puts on a perfect facade but secretly grapples with tough issues such as addiction, sexual assault and gender identity.
New York Post's Johnny Oleksinski writes wryly that "more social issues are addressed in 'Jagged Little Pill' than at a Democratic presidential debate," arguing that it was difficult to identify the central story line throughout the over-complicated plot.
"Like trying to shove Elizabeth Warren’s entire platform into a single evening, nearly every topic gets short shrift," he adds. "The overflowing buffet of controversial subjects borders on ludicrous. "
More: 'You Oughta Know' these new Broadway shows, featuring music from Alanis Morissette and more
Oleksinski, however, says the riveting cast made up for it by perfectly embodying the "rage, angst and bluntness" of Morissette's hit album, a common view among critics.
The Hollywood Reporter's David Rooney says that although "our investment is stretched thin until midway through the second act," the musical was "ultimately (an) affecting show" with powerful moments.
Like actress Lauren Patten's showstopping rendition of Morissette's heartbreak anthem, "You Oughta Know," for example, which displayed the "visceral charge in the anger of the wronged Jo. "
New York Times' Jesse Green says the play passed the "the low bar of jukebox success" with flying colors.
"'Jagged Little Pill' never feels like a coy concert or a greatest hits medley," he writes. "Rather, it feels like a summation: of our world’s worst ills but also the way song can summon resistance to them. "
Variety's Marilyn Stasio writes that the "story seems to emerge organically from the music. "
"What makes this musical so seriously smart is the way that some of the most beloved songs from Morissette’s iconic album come right out of the dramatic content, rather than being slapped on top of a wobbly book scene," Stasio says.

Texto completo: Anne Midgette's reviews are always must-read for me. In her Nov. 23 Style review, 'In-between spaces and gaps in the NSO's growth,' she wrote, 'Thursday night's concert was my last as classical music critic of The Washington Post.' It hit me like a blow to the stomach. I reread it to make sure I got it right. I've always compared her to the great music critics: Olin Downes of the New York Times, Virgil Thomson of the New York Herald-Tribune, Deems Taylor of the New York World and, of course, The Post's own Tim Page, among others. She and her reviews will be sorely missed.

Why Being “Woke” Without Doing the Work Is Detrimental

Texto completo: Representative LaKeshia Myers
I am admittedly an “old millennial”. My contemporaries and I are part of a hybrid generation that lived before the advent of readily accessible technology, but we are also the generation that invented and popularized mediums like Facebook. We are also the cultural curators of being “woke”; being or staying “woke” is a political term which refers to an awareness of issues concerning social and racial justice. It literally means to always be awake, or to be ever vigilant.
With its modern iteration stemming from Erykah Badu’s song Master Teacher, in which the artist repeats the phrase “I stay woke”, the phrase has since been adopted by new thought intellectuals and activists alike to call out instances of racial injustice. Amanda Hess, in her 2016 New York Times article entitled “Earning the ‘Woke’ Badge” quotes Dr. David Stovall, a professor of African American studies at the University of Illinois-Chicago who said, “She [Erykah Badu] means not being placated, not being anesthetized. She brought out what her elders and my elders had been saying for hundreds of years.”
While I agree with Dr. Stovall about the historic significance of our elders passing the baton of activism on to the next generation, the work ethic associated with being “woke” has been lost. It is not enough to just call out racist behavior, but real work must be done within organizations and institutions to deconstruct the policies that allow the behaviors to exist. In the bible James writes, “faith without works is dead” (James 2:26); the work of this generation cannot be reduced to simple sound bites, tweets, or Instagram likes. It will take time, membership, and activity in well-established spaces to push for change. The leaders of old said, “keep your hand on the plow”; but today I encourage my generation to not just be “woke” when it’s convenient, but to stay woke even when it is most difficult or even dangerous. Being woke is more than a hashtag, being “woke” must be a committed lifestyle.

After impeachment announcement, another round of Nancy Pelosi hero-worship from the press

Texto completo: It seems as if every month we have at least one news cycle dedicated entirely to singing House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s praises, lauding her all the way as a fierce icon of style and politics.
You can practically set your watch to it.

We are seeing another round of Pelosi hero-worship this week from our firefighting news media following her announcement that she had asked the “chairman to proceed with the articles of impeachment” against President Trump.

“The president has engaged in abuse of power, undermining our national security and jeopardizing the integrity of our elections,” the speaker maintained during a news conference.

Members of the press wasted no time printing up stories marveling at her iron will and determination.

“Speaker Nancy Pelosi never wanted to impeach President Donald Trump,” reads a Politico report bearing three bylines. “But now that it’s happening, she’s doing it her own way — in 4-inch heels and with an iron grip.”

Hoo-boy.

It is not even four paragraphs before the Politico report quotes a Democratic lawmaker, Rep. Anna Eshoo of California, who lovingly says that Pelosi “has a very, very deep faith, and next to that deep faith is her rock-solid faith in the Constitution.”

Okay, that’s enough of that. Moving on!

Over at the New York Times, there is a stirring profile explaining Pelosi’s tough but heroic road to impeachment. The story includes a lot of the usual pablum one has come to expect from these pro-Democratic hagiographies, including details of Pelosi's alleged shock and dismay that our core democracy is under attack and — you know the rest. The report's opening paragraphs read:
For months, Ms. Pelosi had resisted calls for impeachment. It would be nearly another week before the release of a whistle-blower’s complaint detailing Mr. Trump’s push for Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his son — and days before nervous moderates told her they were ready to back an impeachment inquiry they had shunned all year. But the news of Mr. Trump’s repeated entreaties for Ukraine to investigate a leading political rival was too much for Ms. Pelosi. The speaker’s mind was made up to embark on proceedings that could lead to the impeachment and removal of the 45th president of the United States. […] The decision, delivered in a somber tone punctuated by unusual flashes of emotion … demonstrated how thoroughly Ms. Pelosi had transformed from impeachment skeptic to impeachment warrior.
Like Politico, the New York Times also gives space to glowing quotes from Democratic lawmakers, including Rep. Adam Schiff of California, who claims Pelosi is “fond of quoting Thomas Paine, ‘The times have found us.' But they have found no one more than her. She really was made for this hour, but I think she also recognized when that hour was right for the country to go down this road to impeachment.”

Ugh. That’s enough of that. Moving on.

At Pelosi’s impeachment press briefing, she also dressed down Sinclair reporter James Rosen after he asked her if she “hates” the president.

“As a Catholic, I resent your using the word hate in a sentence that addresses me,” said the speaker, who opposes efforts to outlaw abortion during the final four months of pregnancy (with exceptions for the life and health of the mother). “I don’t hate anyone. I was raised in a way that is a heart full of love and always pray for the president. And I still pray for the president. I pray for the president all the time. So don’t mess with me when it comes to words like that.”

Certain members of the press swooned.

“Don’t ‘mess’ with Nancy Pelosi,” read the headline to a particularly gushy Washington Post op-ed.

The New York Times published a straight-new report also titled, “‘Don’t Mess’ With Nancy Pelosi." (The headline has since been adjusted.)

Later, during an interview with CNN’s Jake Tapper, Pelosi kept up the attack against Rosen.

“Was that a reporter?” she said sarcastically. “Was that what reporters do? Is [Sinclair] a news [organization]?”

CNN promoted her remarks later on social media with the headline: “House Speaker Nancy Pelosi casts shade on a member of the media whose questions about hating Pres. Trump elicited a strong response from her this morning.”

I remember when it used to be considered a heinous affront to our core democracy for powerful politicians to accuse reporters of being “fake news.” I remember when it was called a dangerous attack on our very freedoms. Now, it is apparently just casting "shade."
Isn't it funny how things change depending on political affiliations?

Texto completo: Right on time, the Virginia Stage Company has unveiled its traditional presentation of Charles Dickens' "A Christmas Carol," showing how even the worst of misers can become a good Samaritan.
No "bah, humbugs!" allowed.
In 1993, The New York Times wrote that Dickens was inspired to write the story after a visit to a ragged school, which were common in nineteenth-century Britain.
These schools were often set up in working-class neighborhoods and dedicated to providing free education to poor children.
Dickens, who grew up in poverty himself, felt a connection to those children, which he described hiding in the robes of Christmas Present as "yellow, meager, ragged, scowling, wolfish; but prostrate too in their humility." He thought his now-historic tale might help to help lift them up.
"A Christmas Carol" is 176 years old, but the book has never gone out of print and Dickens' story is performed on thousands of stages across the world every year. The Virginia Stage Company has been performing the tale since 1996.
Nearly everyone knows the story: a cold-hearted curmudgeon, Ebenezer Scrooge, journeys through Christmas past, present and future.
By the end of his miraculous time travels and hard-learned lessons, Scrooge - who had just refused to help the needy and scolded his loyal employee for expecting a day off for Christmas - decides to turn his life around and use his wealth to do good.
The story still delivers all the holiday warm-and-fuzzies and, as Dickens hoped, inspires many to pay it forward.
Virginia Stage Company has been presenting this play for xx years. This year features a new director, Marianne Savell; a new Scrooge, Steven Minow; and a new character, Dickens himself, as narrator, played by John Forkner.
In the spirit of the season, we asked some of the cast members to share their Christmas traditions and fondest memories.
Adalee Alt, playing Tiny Tim
On Christmas Eve, my mom reads us "'Twas the night before Christmas." After that, we set out cookies and carrots for Santa and his reindeer.
Rhys West, playing Boy Scrooge
I have a lot of favorite holiday and winter traditions that I love. When it snows outside I love to go sledding, but not in Virginia Beach because there are no hills. I also love to make snow cream with my family. I love picking out our Christmas tree at the Christmas tree farms. One of my favorite things to do is to watch people's reactions when they get their gifts. Spending time with family and no homework is also a plus! My family and I love to listen to Christmas music and sing Christmas carols on the record player.
Steven Minow, playing Ebenezer Scrooge
I am from Sacramento, Calif. For a time we had a philanthropic group called Christmas Promise whose mission was to provide a magical Christmas Eve visit from Santa himself. Because I am an actor, my sister's mother-in-law who was very much involved with the group asked if I would be interested in playing one of the Santas. Because they would endeavor to bring Christmas to as many destitute families as possible, it required about 50 Santas. Each of us were assigned three to four families to visit, unannounced on the eve of the big day. We each had our own elves, drivers and beautifully wrapped packages of toys, clothing, and even brand new bicycles for the children. One especially heart-warming visit, I got to give a little boy a brand new skateboard. He ran outside immediately. When he came back inside I asked, "Peter, where'd you go?" He responded, "I went outside to see the reindeer!"
Tre'Veon Porchia, playing Dick Wilkins
Every year, my immediate family, my grandma, my aunt, and my uncle on my mom's side meet at my house. Before I turned 18, all of the kids were upstairs while everyone brought in the presents and we stayed upstairs until they told us we could come down. My grandma always brought humongous red stockings full of food and clothes and presents. My aunt and uncle always brought the most delicious cookies that they only make at Christmas time. My mom would make a breakfast casserole, lasagna, and mimosa (non-alcoholic, of course). After that, we take a few hours to enjoy our presents and hang out before going to my aunt's house to see the rest of the family. I've come to expect the same routine every year and I enjoy it.
Lynn Kenny Richards, playing Mrs. Cratchit
Our family celebrates the German tradition of St. Nick's Day on the morning of Dec. 6 with a stocking of goodies, opening an advent calendar each day of the month and presents under the tree on Christmas morning. We like to serve at our church as well as helping to collect food for local food pantries and toys for The Salvation Army.
Ryan Clemens, playing Jacob Marley
My fondest Christmas tradition has become performing in VSC's "A Christmas Carol." For the past eight seasons, I have been honored and blessed to be a part of this story. I've played Bob Cratchit, Fezziwig, the Charity Man, Old Joe and Marley, too! This production is one that is so meaningful to me, our company, our community, and countless children who've come to enjoy the magic and wonder of live theater. Each new year and each performance, there is a shared joy that brings every person in the Wells Theatre together with full hearts and lifted spirits.

The Climate Crisis Is a Political Crisis

Texto completo: I don't want to look back and wonder what more I could have done to save our planet.
It should come as no surprise that I believe in the power of protest. That's why I moved to Washington to start what I call Fire Drill Fridays, joining the millions of young people around the world who turned out in the fall for protests to demand that our leaders act to save their futures.
We must all face the harsh reality that our planet is rapidly approaching an irreversible tipping point, beyond which the unraveling of our ecosystems will be beyond our control. Scientists have made clear that we now have less than 11 years to reduce fossil fuel and other greenhouse gas emissions roughly by half, and 20 years after that to cut them to net zero, to stabilize the rise in temperatures by the end of the century and meet the goal of the Paris agreement on climate change.
Last summer -- as the wildfires wreaked havoc on my home state, California, and young people like Greta Thunberg so powerfully reminded us that we are the last generation that can prevent an unthinkable global catastrophe -- I decided it was time for me to do more.
There are many things we can all do. We can join protests, engage in civil disobedience and risk arrest, but we must also see this as the uniquely critical political moment it is.
Despite widespread agreement among the world's scientists that we are living through a climate emergency requiring profound economic and social change, the United States government is failing to act. It's not that the American public doesn't want an end to wars over oil, or a stable climate, clean oceans, safe and abundant water and healthy air.
No. Let's be clear: Over decades the fossil fuel industry has hijacked our political system, and we have failed to elect enough leaders who are not beholden to the industry's interests. The Center for Responsive Politics has documented that the oil and gas industry alone has spent some $ 218 million on lobbying in 2018 and 2019. In addition, oil and gas interests have contributed about $ 27 million to Senate and House candidates and party committees in the 2020 election cycle. Fossil fuel interests are subverting our democracy.
In just the past year, the United States has experienced deadly wildfires, devastating flooding and the hottest month ever recorded, all driven, at least in part, by climate change. What is President Trump's response? He's pulling the United States out of the Paris agreement and rolling back 85 environmental safeguards, including important and consequential climate initiatives. This should not be surprising; he once called climate change a "hoax." The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, is also blocking efforts to deal with the climate crisis.
We have reached a time in this fight when the only way forward is to organize, mobilize and vote politicians who won't act out of office. We must overcome the power of the fossil fuel industry and elect an environmental champion for president and a congressional leadership ready to move forward aggressively with a Green New Deal to save us and the planet, starting the day they take office.
Winning at the ballot box is how we will succeed in building a more just and equitable economy, one thriving from good clean energy jobs. It's how we will secure a habitable planet for future generations. It's how we will protect our cherished public lands and species, and ensure all Americans have safe water and clean air -- especially low-income communities and communities of color who for too long have borne the brunt of inaction.
The good news is that a growing number of voters understand the urgency of the challenge we face. Two-thirds of Americans say the government is doing too little to reduce the effects of climate change, including 90 percent of Democrats and 39 percent of Republicans, according to a recent Pew Research Center survey. Some Democratic presidential candidates have released climate plans that match the urgency of the crisis. We must pressure others to do the same. We must not vote for any candidate who accepts money from the fossil fuel industry.
Greenpeace is ranking the candidates based on their support for the Green New Deal and ending new fossil fuel extraction immediately. Through the Change the Climate 2020 program, the League of Conservation Voters is tracking what every candidate is saying about climate change. The group's political committee, the LCV Victory Fund, is scaling up campaigns in battleground states. I've seen the details of the strategy and I'm telling you we can win on climate.
We must start to live our lives as if this is an emergency, because it is. Each of us one day will have to answer this question: What did I do to protect the planet for our children, grandchildren and so many precious species while we still had time?
I've still got a lot of fight left in me. I will not look back on Nov. 4, 2020, the day after the election, and wonder what more I could have done.

Texto completo: The novelist Rachel Kushner also writes about art. Her collection is a reminder of those essays and features.
LOS ANGELES -- Few of Rachel Kushner's artworks were purchased outright. While her Angelino Heights Craftsman-style home, where she lives with her husband, Jason Smith, and their son, Remy, may be an intimately scaled who's who of contemporary art -- including West Coast painters like James Hayward and Laura Owens and New Yorkers like Seth Price and Richard Prince -- most of these pieces were received in exchange for her writing.
Ms. Kushner is best known for her wryly brooding novels -- "Telex From Cuba" and "The Flamethrowers," as well as "The Mars Room," whose prose Dwight Garner of The New York Times compared to a "muscle car oozing down the side roads of your mind." But she has simultaneously built a sideline as a feature writer on artists for publications like Artforum, as well as an essayist for exhibition catalogs.
When she came to New York from San Francisco in 1996, at 27, she became friends with the painter Alex Brown and subsequently took a deep dive into the downtown art scene. Even after entering Columbia's M.F.A. writing program, she maintained this affinity: "Artists just seemed more fun and interesting to hang out with," she said. "They knew a lot about music, they read architecture criticism, they read philosophy. I just felt like I always learned more from being around them socially."
Barely veiled stand-ins for some of these artists -- including Mr. Prince and the painter Ben Morea -- appear in her fiction. Accordingly, Ms. Kushner doesn't see her role as that of a traditionally objective critic: If she trades her writing for artwork, it's because the artist is someone she admires, or already a friend.
"It's not a coincidence that a lot of the work has a personal connection," she said in an interview, gesturing to the drawings, photographs and collages in her living room.
These are edited excerpts from the conversation.
Tell me about this Wade Guyton piece.
I was at the LA Art Book Fair looking for a birthday present for my husband [a professor at the ArtCenter College of Design in Pasadena]. I saw this on the wall behind the table for Karma Books. It's a page torn from a book Wade Guyton did -- a reprint of a gay porn magazine which he then printed on [in color]. I asked about the price and it was a bit extravagant. Or, like, a lot extravagant. They called Karma's owner, who said I could take it as long as I did some kind of project with them in the future. Well, that demonstrates my love to my husband. I'm signed on to do ... something.
You have two paintings by Brown in your dining room, one of a slightly blurred tree and the other of the AT&T building in TriBeCa. What about this work appeals to you?
Well, what about Gerhard Richter's work appeals to you? Not to be coy, but it's very German. Alex's grandfather was a German aerospace engineer, and they made a deal with him like they did with Wernher von Braun. He got to come to the United States and design rockets -- and not be prosecuted for [World War II] war crimes. Alex was aware he carries the mantle of this inherited trauma. So I think he thought about Richter's work a lot. But he's also just an incredible painter with the nimble, delicate way this windowless "communications" building is rendered.
On that wall is a work by Kerry James Marshall with images of assassinated civil rights activists. Is it on cloth?
It's a limited-edition pillowcase [laughing]. I bought it partly because I can't afford a Kerry James Marshall painting, and partly because I saw the painting it's taken from at LACMA [the Los Angeles County Museum of Art] with my father. My dad was looking at the faces, and he goes, "Oh, gee, that's Mickey!" Mickey was his friend who went to Mississippi and was murdered by either state troopers or the Ku Klux Klan, or a combination.
Wait, was Mickey Michael Schwerner , who was killed in 1964 with James Chaney and Andrew Goodman?
Yes, they worked together in the civil rights movement, along with my mother. That's why I loved this painting so much, because Marshall is a caretaker of history and of the sacrifices of these martyrs. I had it here with Alex's paintings above it, before he died. And now it's like she [the angel in the piece] is also tending to the ghost of my friend.

North Carolina Children's Hospital Is Sued Over Death

Texto completo: The parents of a 3-year-old who died after heart surgery at North Carolina Children's Hospital in 2016 are suing the institution, saying it failed to disclose internal concerns about the quality of its care.
Tasha and Thomas Jones, the parents, also allege that doctors didn't warn them about problems with the heart surgery program, and "instead chose to protect their own reputational and monetary interests" by continuing to refer patients to the Chapel Hill hospital, according to a complaint filed on Thursday in North Carolina state court.
In 2016, Skylar Jones underwent was considered a relatively low-risk procedure to repair a heart defect. Soon after leaving the operating room, the girl suffered complications that led to her death two months later at the state-owned hospital, which is affiliated with the University of North Carolina.
At that time, doctors were becoming increasingly troubled that their patients seemed to fare poorly after heart surgery. A New York Times article in May revealed the turmoil, and included secret audio recordings of doctors questioning whether to keep sending patients there.
In one meeting, according to a recording provided to The Times, the head of the hospital told cardiologists to "do what your conscience says," but also said that reducing surgeries could hurt revenues and lead to job cuts.
According to the lawsuit, doctors at UNC told Skylar's parents that the hospital offered "state-of-the-art care for pediatric cardiac patients."
The Joneses filed two claims on Thursday: one in state court, against four doctors; the other with a state commission that hears cases against state-run agencies, including the University of North Carolina health system.
Named in the state complaint were Drs. Kevin Kelly, head of the children's hospital until his retirement last year; Michael Mill, the surgeon who operated on Skylar; Timothy Hoffman, the chief of pediatric cardiology; and Pamela Ro, a cardiologist.
In meetings in 2016 and 2017, all nine of the hospital's pediatric cardiologists -- who diagnose and treat heart conditions but don't perform surgeries -- expressed concerns about the program's performance.
Some of them had tried to get mortality data to help decide where to refer patients, but the hospital did not have the information to share at the time, even internally.
This June, after a yearlong legal battle with The Times, the hospital released data showing that its death rate was nearly 50 percent among children with the most complex heart conditions. The data also showed that the hospital's overall mortality rate for pediatric heart surgery was higher than those of most of the 82 hospitals in the United States that publicly reported such information.
The Joneses' complaint against the hospital system alleges that its leaders knew the pediatric cardiac surgery program "fell far below acceptable standards, yet UNC systematically failed to disclose this fact to current and potential patients, and failed to take reasonable measures to improve the system."
After the Times investigation was published, the hospital temporarily suspended its most complex heart surgeries -- a measure some doctors had urged years earlier -- and introduced an external advisory board and other initiatives to "restore confidence" in the program. That board has since said that the hospital can resume complex surgeries, noting that "significant investment and progress" has been made.
In August, state and federal regulators determined after a monthslong investigation that the hospital was in compliance with federal rules, but "significantly different than it was during 2016-17," according to a spokesman for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.
UNC administrators have denied that there were problems affecting patient care in those years, saying only that difficult team dynamics had been resolved by staffing and leadership changes.

Texto completo: A deal with LG Chem of South Korea will further the automaker's plans for electric vehicles and fulfill a pledge made after its Lordstown plant was idled.
After idling its car plant in Lordstown, Ohio, this year, General Motors promised that it would bring jobs back to the once-mighty manufacturing region.
On Thursday, its plans began to take a shape: It will build a factory to make electric-vehicle batteries along with a South Korean partner, LG Chem.
The companies said they planned to invest a total of $ 2.3 billion in a joint venture that would produce battery cells. G.M. and LG Chem would have equal stakes in the business.
Executives said the venture would set up a plant in the Lordstown area that would create more than 1,100 jobs. Groundbreaking is expected in the middle of next year.
"We think as we do this in a joint fashion it is going to accelerate our ability to win in the electric vehicle space," G.M.'s chief executive, Mary T. Barra, said at a news conference. "I absolutely believe this is a critical point, with LG Chem and G.M. working together to drive affordability."
The cost of battery packs is one of the major challenges of luring mainstream consumers to electric vehicles. Tesla, the leading seller of electric cars, makes its own battery packs in a joint venture with Panasonic at a giant factory in Nevada. Even with the economies of scale of that plant, however, most Tesla cars still sell for $ 10,000 or more above the average new-car price of about $ 35,000. And Tesla has yet to show it can make money consistently.
"It's not at all clear there is going to be much demand for E.V.s, at least in North America," said Sam Abuelsamid, an analyst at Navigant Research. "There's probably going to be more demand in Europe and China, but if they can get the cost down to parity with internal combustion vehicles, then there may be potential."
LG Chem is a major supplier of lithium-ion batteries to the auto industry and other sectors, with clients including Volvo. A financial filing in South Korea indicated that its investment in the joint venture would occur over four years.
G.M. is making a major push into electric vehicles, including 20 battery-powered models by 2023. It aims to sell one million such vehicles globally by 2026. Ms. Barra said G.M. expected to introduce a new Chevrolet electric car next year and an electric truck in 2021.
Its current model, the Chevrolet Bolt, is a compact car that has attracted modest interest from car buyers. G.M. sells roughly 1,500 Bolts a month in the United States, compared with the 30,000 cars Tesla tends to sell monthly around the world.
Other traditional automakers are also looking to expand their electric vehicle offerings. In November, Ford Motor unveiled an electric sport utility vehicle styled to resemble its Mustang sports car. Called the Mustang Mach E, it will be assembled at a plant in Mexico, with battery packs from a factory in Poland. Ford is planning to introduce more than a dozen electric models over the next five years, including a battery-powered version of its popular F-150 pickup truck.
Ms. Barra said G.M. was working to offer electric vehicles to help combat climate change. "G.M. believes in the science of global warming," she said.
G.M. had repeatedly announced its intent to set up a battery-making plant with a partner that would bring back jobs to the Lordstown area, where it abandoned production in March.
The shutdown of the Lordstown plant, which most recently made the Chevrolet Cruze, was traumatic to Ohio's Mahoning Valley, between Cleveland and Pittsburgh. President Trump, who promised to increase factory jobs and has called on automakers to move production from Mexico to the United States, has heaped criticism on G.M. for closing the plant.
Ms. Barra said on Thursday that G.M. had informed the White House of its battery-plant plans.
Peter Navarro, the director of Mr. Trump's Office of Trade and Manufacturing Policy, said G.M.'s announcement would help create an ecosystem of electric-vehicle manufacturing in the region.
"We expect that plant will not only do very well but grow in size over time so that it becomes a useful anchor of employment in Lordstown," he said.
While many Lordstown workers accepted jobs at other G.M. plants, the factory's fate hovered over rancorous contract talks with the United Automobile Workers union. The contract impasse resulted in a 40-day nationwide walkout in the fall, the longest against G.M. in almost half a century.
The union's settlement allowed the company to close the plant permanently, but G.M. committed investing in other American factories. The jobs foreseen at the battery plant are far fewer than the 3,000 that the G.M. assembly plant once employed.
Earlier accounts said the pay at the battery plant was likely to be about $ 17 an hour, well below the $ 31 that many assembly workers made in Lordstown. Ms. Barra said wages at the battery plant would be around the same levels U.A.W. workers earned at component plants, which tend to fall between $ 10 and $ 15 an hour, below the top union wage of $ 32 an hour.
"We have to be competitive," she said. "But these will be very good paying jobs."
After the Lordstown plant was idled, G.M. reached an agreement to sell it to a start-up, Lordstown Motors, which plans to produce electric pickup trucks. Lordstown Motors has said it expects to hire about 400 workers next year at wages comparable to what U.A.W. members make at major auto companies.

Texto completo: A reader says he can dish it out but can't take it.
To the Editor:
Re "Stung in Europe, and Finding No Balm at Home" (White House Memo, front page, Dec. 5):
How refreshing to see Donald Trump receive a dose of his own medicine.
Unprotected abroad by the force field of Fox News and Republican sycophancy, he flees early, sniveling and humiliated. Yet again, he has confirmed that he can dish it out, but he can't take it.
Grow up, Mr. President. Or stay home.

This week in Mormon Land: Yes to suffrage, no to ERA, and a measles outbreak disrupts church services

Saluting sister suffragists
A new exhibit at the Church History Museum works as a sweeping vote of thanks to Latter-day Saint women who pioneered the suffrage movement in Utah.
“Sisters for Suffrage: How Utah Women Won the Vote” tells the story through artifacts (including a copy of Susan B. Anthony’s biography) apparel (19th-century dresses) photographs (such as Martha Hughes Cannon, the nation’s first female state senator) and more.
“Utah women were very active in the early suffrage movement,” Jean B. Bingham, general president of the Relief Society, said. “From the time women in Utah received the right to vote, the Relief Society organization was involved in the fight for women’s suffrage on the national stage.”
The exhibit, which will be on display at the downtown Salt Lake City museum through January 2021, celebrates the 150th anniversary of Utah women becoming the first women to cast ballots in the United States.
“Historically, our state’s early achievements in women’s rights have gone unacknowledged,” said state Sen. Deidre Henderson, R-Spanish Fork, “and until very recently, they’ve been largely forgotten.”
Next year also marks the centennial of the 19th Amendment, which granted women the right to vote across the country.
Church no longer MIA in ERA debate
The ERA may be DOA at the Utah Legislature after the church broke its recent silence on the issue and reaffirmed its historic opposition to the proposed constitutional amendment.
When asked earlier this year for its current position on the Equal Rights Amendment, the church declined to comment. Latter-day Saint feminists took heart in that response — or the lack of one — surmising that the faith may now be neutral on the decades-old measure seeking to guarantee equal rights regardless of sex.
But after a rally Tuesday at the Utah Capitol in a renewed and revved-up push for ratification of the ERA, the Salt Lake City-based faith, seen as the most powerful political force in the Beehive State, stated that its “position on this issue has been consistent for more than 40 years.”
Translation: The church remains opposed to the ERA.
In the 1970s and ’80s, when the issue was on the nation’s front burner, the church steadfastly, stridently and prominently fought the ERA. Latter-day Saint authorities (women and men) preached against it, published articles against it, distributed pamphlets against it, launched letter-writing campaigns against it, lobbied against it and urged its members to do the same.
“It’s disappointing,” Sara Vranes, a Utah leader of Mormons for ERA, said of the church’s latest statement.
Arizonan Anissa Rasheta, a national organizer for the group, told The Salt Lake Tribune she hopes that the church won’t use its resources — as it did years ago — to actively work against ratification.
God’s love awaits you, apostle says
Apostle Dale G. Renlund, a cardiologist by profession, harked back to a time as a first-year student at Johns Hopkins Hospital when he had stopped praying every day, Provo’s Daily Herald reported.
“I had allowed my receptors for God’s love to become dull, so that the things of the Spirit were less urgent and less important,” Renlund told students at a Brigham Young University devotional this week.
“If you have dysfunction of your receptors for God’s love,” he said, “you can lose your way and succumb to dangers, such as hopelessness, helplessness and loneliness.”
The young medical student then vowed to change, the paper reported. He found time to read the Book of Mormon at the hospital and put prayer back in his daily diet.
Physical and mental illness also can block the ability to feel God’s love, said Renlund, urging sufferers of clinical anxiety and depression to get professional help.
Reyna I. Aburto, second counselor in the Relief Society general presidency, gave a widely praised sermon in the fall General Conference about depression, anxiety and other forms of mental illness.
Response to measles outbreak
A deadly measles outbreak in Samoa prompted Latter-day Saint leaders to take extraordinary measures to help prevent the spread of the disease.
For starters, only individuals age 19 and over could attend worship services Sunday. No other classes were held. The sacrament was to be taken in homes where possible.
The Apia Temple and church schools have been closed.
“In support of the government of Samoa’s declaration of a state of emergency, we have asked our members to not bring children or youth (up to 18) to church meetings,” K. Brett Nattress of the church’s Pacific Area Presidency said in a news release. “Our hearts and prayers are with those families who have lost loved ones. We are grateful for the many people who are ministering to these families and others during this difficult time.”
Samoa’s measles outbreak has killed at least 60 people and infected nearly 3,900 others, The New York Times reported.
Help to make the season bright
Lights, cameras, Christmas.
Yes, ’tis the season for hundreds of thousands of colorful LED bulbs to brighten the night at Temple Square in downtown Salt Lake City.
Besides the panorama of lights, the holiday offerings include concerts, movies (such as the church’s new video “The Christ Child”) and a life-size Nativity display with narration by a familiar voice: that of church President Russell M. Nelson.
This week’s podcast: A year of change
This has been a remarkable year of change in the church.
It started way back on Jan. 2, with the introduction of retooled temple ceremonies, and continued throughout 2019.
The about-face on the LGBTQ policy, a widened stance on civil weddings, weekly calls home by missionaries, female witnesses at baptisms and temple sealings, a new program for children and youths — and that’s just the beginning.
Blogger Jenny Dye, co-host of “The Mormon News Report Podcast,” has been tracking and commenting on the developments. She joins this week’s show to talk about the deluge of adjustments, announcements, rescissions, reforms and reversals.

Remember refugees
The governing First Presidency again urged Latter-day Saints to open their hearts, hamlets and homelands to the world’s refugees.
Members are “deeply committed to living the two great commandments to love God and love our neighbor. We feel tremendous joy in helping all of God’s children, no matter where they may live in this world,” the leaders wrote in a news release. “ ... We encourage church members and friends to respond appropriately and legally, to help create welcoming communities by volunteering their time, talents and friendship to individuals and families who are integrating into our societies.”
In an October General Conference sermon, church President Russell M. Nelson noted the refugee crisis gripping the globe as more than 70 million migrants flee “civil strife, the ravages of nature or religious persecution.”
Temple updates
• The church broke ground Saturday on what will be Mexico’s 14th Latter-day Saint temple. Church President Russell M. Nelson announced the Puebla Temple in October 2018.
• For the 5 million or so people who visit Temple Square in downtown Salt Lake City every year, that experience is about to change.
When the Salt Lake Temple closes at month’s end to undergo a four-year renovation, the neighboring Tabernacle and Assembly Hall will stay open, but the Conference Center, across the street, will become the main venue for the Temple Square “guest experience,” Tanner Kay, manager for guest services, said at a Wednesday news conference.
Visitors will be able to see the progress of the temple makeover, which includes a seismic upgrade, from the center’s balcony and roof.
When the temple reopens in 2024, members will find spruced-up murals in the ordinance rooms. Live endowment sessions will continue, but screens will be added so the filmed version can be shown to those who speak a language besides English.
Quote of the week
“For all the things I find challenging about being part of this community — the heterosexism, the cultural imperialism, the gender discrimination and ossified leadership structure — there are so many others that feed my soul. What more can I say than this: If all I can accomplish by raising my children in this church is to teach them that we are all children of God, working and serving and loving together, saint and sinner, black and white, female and male, queer and straight, then I may have done what matters most.”

Texto completo: Una aerolínea con sede en Oklahoma que realiza vuelos chárter es la única dispuesta a deportar a inmigrantes considerados por la Oficina de Control de Inmigración y Aduanas ( ICE ) como “ de alto riesgo “.
Y lo hace cobrando precios exorbitantes.
Se trata de Omni Air International , la cual tiene contrato con el Departamento de Defensa de los Estados Unidos para el traslado de soldados y con el Departamento de Seguridad Nacional (DHS) para concretar deportaciones que ICE califica como “ misiones especiales de alto riesgo ”.
Un documento sobre el presupuesto de ICE obtenido por el sitio de noticias Quartz revela que se ha tenido que pagar prácticamente lo que la empresa pide por sus servicios aéreos, ya que es la única dispuesta a realizar esos vuelos especiales.
Un agente de viajes habría advertido a ICE que muchos operadores aéreos no quieren participar en el proceso de deportación ante una posible reacción negativa del público y el impacto en los medios de comunicación.
“Como resultado, nuestro grupo de selección de operadores se ha reducido a uno solo, Omni”, indica el documento de ICE.
El pasado 18 de noviembre ICE pagó $33,500 dólares por hora para trasladar a 166 inmigrantes que fueron deportados de Arizona a Bangladesh, India y Vietnam. Lo que cobró Omni es el doble del precio en el mercado, reconocen las autoridades.
Los inmigrantes detenidos que puedan ser perjudiciales durante un vuelo o que físicamente se rehúsen a ser deportados, serán enviados a su país en un vuelo chárter especial de alto riesgo, establece la unidad de Operaciones Aéreas de ICE .
Omni Air International es la encargada de esos vuelos especiales y también de los casos de deportación de alto perfil , como quienes son considerados una amenaza a la seguridad nacional, violadores de derechos humanos y detenidos con órdenes de arresto en el extranjero o que son buscados en su país de origen.
Esa misma aerolínea tiene operaciones comerciales en los aeropuertos de Las Vegas, Dallas, Seattle, Hawaii y Baltimore.
Otras compañías aéreas que han colaborado en la deportación de inmigrantes, en vuelos que no son de alto riesgo, son Xtra Airways , con sede en Florida y que ha realizado traslados a México y Centroamérica, al igual que Swift Air , que de acuerdo con el New York Times esta empresa estaría recibiendo $15 millones de dólares al año por el contrato que tiene con ICE.
En declaraciones públicas, algunas aerolíneas como American , Frontier y United han dejado en claro su rechazo a participar en la política de deportación del presidente Donald Trump .

Texto completo: Anne Hathaway didn't have to dig deep for her latest role in "Dark Waters." In Todd Haynes' whistleblower drama, the Oscar winner plays the real-life Sarah Bilott, whose husband, lawyer Rob Bilott (Mark Ruffalo), helped expose decades of environmental contamination by chemical company DuPont. "It's heartbreaking and infuriating on a human level," Hathaway says. "There wasn't really any acting required, in terms of playing someone who was learning of (corruption) and was equal parts aghast and terrified and angry and emotional."
Based on a 2016 New York Times Magazine article by Nathaniel Rich, "Dark Waters" begins with Rob taking on a new client: a West Virginia farmer (Bill Camp) who believes his cows' mysterious deaths are caused by a toxic runoff from a DuPont landfill, which contaminated a creek on his land. Rob's work leads to a study that finds 70,000 people were drinking tainted water with traces of PFOA, a toxic chemical used in the production of Teflon products such as non-stick pans until 2013. DuPont was allegedly aware for years that PFOA exposure is linked to illnesses such as kidney cancer and thyroid disease, and the company was forced to pay out $671 million in personal injury lawsuits in 2017.
The story hit close to home for Hathaway, 37, already a mom to son Jonathan, 3, with husband Adam Shulman, and now "a thousand months pregnant" with a second child, she says good-naturedly by phone. After reading the script, "I opened the drawer where I keep my pans and pots, and there was a non-stick pan," Hathaway says. "And despite reading an article when I was pregnant with my first child that said 'don't use non-stick,' there was one that had somehow slipped through the cracks and I'd been feeding my family with it for years. "I try not to blame myself too hard in those circumstances, because I believe that we as human beings and as Americans should never be put in that position where we're just trying to do our best, and we're inadvertently poisoning ourselves and the people we love."
Hathaway has always had an activist spirit, which is part of the reason why Haynes thought of her to play Sarah. "Anne has this incredible vitality and intelligence and compassion, and you see that in her work," says the director, best known for the Oscar-nominated "Carol" and "Far from Heaven." "Sarah is an essential part of the story of Rob and how he was able to do what he did, but also how hard it is on a domestic relationship when somebody takes on the system."
A vocal member of the Time's Up movement against sexual harassment and workplace discrimination, Hathaway credits her activism to her parents, who instilled the importance of equality and inclusivity from an early age. "I was born in the early '80s, and there were still things I was told I couldn't do because I was a girl," she says. "I was really lucky I was raised in a household where that sentence was never uttered. It seems strange to me that anybody would try to put me in a box based on the way I was born, when it's so much easier to just accept other people for how they are. So I guess that was my first awareness that the world wasn't a fair place for everyone."
Anne Hathaway, who is expecting her second child, has a new movie out.

Trump has alerted world to China threat

Texto completo: William Safire once recalled talking in the early 1990s with his old boss President Richard Nixon about events two decades earlier. They were talking China.
"Before Nixon died, I asked him - on the record - if perhaps we had gone a bit overboard on selling the American public on the political benefits of increased trade," wrote the New York Times columnist, who died in 2009. "That old realist, who had played the China card to exploit the split in the Communist world, replied with some sadness that he was not as hopeful as he had once been: 'We may have created a Frankenstein.' "
What Nixon and every president since - save President Donald Trump - has done, or at least acquiesced in doing, is the catapulting of the People's Republic of China to peer superpower status with the United States. Even as we watch, President Xi Jinping is playing "the Russia card" against America, in the reverse image of the events of 50 years ago. This week, Russia flipped the switch on the new "Power of Siberia" gas pipeline from the Far East of Vladimir Putin's country to the heart of Xi's.
Despite its extensive oil reserves, Russia may not just be "Saudi Arabia with trees," as some have called it, given the old Soviet Union's nuclear capabilities being modernized by Putin. But Russia's ailing demographics limit it to second-tier superpower status, akin to that of the other members of the nuclear club not named the United States or China.
What Trump has done, in his nearly three years in office, is fundamentally redefine the U.S.-China relationship by emphasizing what my radio colleague Dennis Prager first gave voice to as a general rule for competing interests: "Clarity before agreement."
Trump has clarified a great deal about China and its ambitions. The 45th president has also clarified - especially for Big Tech but also for all providers of goods and services to China, including the NBA - that there are deep differences between the value sets held in Beijing and those in Washington, differences that need to be recognized and understood.
Recent weeks have brought new and intense scrutiny to Xi's mandates regarding the China's Uighur minority. For months, the world has watched the perilous push by Hong Kong protesters for the preservation of the "one country, two systems" guarantees given them (and the world) by Xi's predecessors. And the West generally, and Americans specifically, are at long last fully awake to the reality that China's Communist Party has not joined any "end of history" long march toward freedom that inevitably results in an appreciation of liberty and natural law.
What Trump - with the assistance of popular and crucial books such as Henry Kissinger's "On China," Graham Allison's "Destined for War" and Michael Pillsbury's "The Hundred-Year Marathon" - has made clear is that the competition with China, though not a Cold War 2.0, is very much an all-out battle for leadership. Its fronts encompass every field of technology, weaponry, Information Age data and artificial intelligence, and cultural and international norms.
This is as significant a breakthrough as Nixon's in 1972, though of a completely different order. In 1972, the world welcomed China back into the community of nations, though not perhaps with the appropriate amount of recognition of the vast dislocations wreaked upon it by the Western powers and Japan for more than a century before then. Now, with China no longer "rising" but risen, a new era is in front of us, one that Trump has ushered in with typical Trumpian bluster and bluntness but with great effectiveness.
Given China's ambitions and its array of tactics in the service of Xi's grand strategic vision of it as the dominant country on the planet, Trump has done even his fiercest critics a great service: He is obliging them to consider China, in every aspect of life, on every stage, in every conversation. It is now incumbent on the men and women who would replace Trump at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. to declare their own China policies, and to do so in great detail.
The Democrats have avoided talking about China much, possibly because they don't want to upset their Silicon Valley funders, who would prefer that China remain just another market - albeit a very large one - instead of a strategic competitor not just with America but with the very idea of ordered liberty. Democrats also hate to acknowledge the good things Trump has done, including this infusion of long-needed clarity about Beijing.
It may not be Frankenstein's monster, but China is a wholly new force on the planet, though one wrapped in an ancient culture and history. Democrats who would be president need to demonstrate that they have a plan, for Xi most certainly does.

Power struggle fuels 'Virtue and Vengeance'

Texto completo: "Children of Virtue and Vengeance" (Henry Holt and Co., 416 pp., ***1/2) is the highly anticipated sequel to "Children of Blood and Bone," the first book of Tomi Adeyemi's West African-inspired fantasy trilogy, Legacy of Or sha. Famously, "Children of Blood and Bone" netted the now-26-year-old Adeyemi a seven-figure advance, one of the biggest in the history of young adult fiction. Quickly after that, Fox 2000 picked up the film rights. As of now, "Children of Blood and Bone" has been on The New York Times best-seller list for more than 34 weeks, and has spent 20 weeks on the USA TODAY Best-Selling Books list.
The dynamics of power, corruption and identity are further explored in "Virtue and Vengeance." Where "Blood and Bone" explores how persecuted minorities find ways to retain their culture, "Virtue and Vengeance" places that minority on an equal playing field with their oppressors overnight. The characters are forced to rethink what they know about their culture and exactly who gets to own it.
The first book follows Z lie, her brother Tzain and runaway princess Amari in a quest to return magic to the land of Or sha, where the maji people who formerly had powers are being ruthlessly persecuted by the monarchy. The monarchy chases the trio as well as Amari's brother, Prince Inan, who also discovers he has powers and a special bound to Z lie. Unlike Z lie, Inan sees his magic as curse rather than a blessing, especially under the rule of his father, who sees the maji only as "maggots."
At the end of "Blood and Bone," Zeilie, Tzain and Amari return magic to the lands of Or sha, and the once-powerless majis now have the magic they had lost, and with it a desire to reclaim their culture that had nearly been wiped out.
Yet, the majis are not the only ones who wake up with powers. The ruling class also discover they have new powers and even more reason to wipe out the majis for good. And that includes the genocidal queen of Or sha, Nehanda, who now takes her husband's place on the throne after he is killed by his daughter Amari at the end of "Blood and Bone."
Peace has never been more fragile. The book grapples with the idea of compromise when unspeakable violence has been committed against a group of people who are now returning such violence with a vengeance. The central conflict of the story is the war between the monarchy and the newly empowered maji, but the discord starts in the intimate bonds among the main characters, with characters' actions rippling out from the personal to acts of war.
Adeyemi expands on the strengths of the first book and raises the stakes in both friendships and in war, challenging the loyalties that were strongly cemented in "Blood and Bone." (though some relationships, especially the romances, feel underdeveloped and rushed). "Virtue and Vengeance" also introduces characters and revives old ones, revealing more difficult questions about redemption, power and reparations. Adeyemi does not pull any punches relating the horrors of genocide and war, yet her books still maintain a spirit of fantasy and adventure without her message losing its impact.
It builds to an ending that leaves the reader with a feeling that can only be described as dread. The dread is not a negative point, but adds scope to the series and more complexity to the theme of identity. Adeyemi writes a mean cliffhanger and successfully upends expectations.
The last chapter will undoubtedly leave fans shaking with questions until the final installment of the trilogy is published.

How Big Tech Is Swarming Capitol Hill

Texto completo: Big Tech's presence in the capital is unmistakable, and its interests intersect with more and more issues, says David McCabe, a tech policy reporter.
How do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? David McCabe, who covers tech policy in Washington, discussed the tech he's using.
What tech is most important for doing your job?
One element of covering policy is understanding what forces are pushing certain ideas forward in Washington. I often turn to government and private disclosure databases to help answer that question.
There's a lot of information a few clicks away: Congress maintains databases of whom companies are paying to lobby on their behalf. The Justice Department tracks which operatives are registered to work for foreign firms. The service Guidestar collects the forms that influential nonprofits file with the I.R.S. describing their finances, and many prominent foundations list their grants online.
These records don't tell the full story, but they can be a source of valuable context when you're chasing a tip or trying to understand the landscape around a new issue.
I try to speak with sources where they are most comfortable. That can be on the phone, by text or encrypted message, or in person. Twitter's and LinkedIn's direct message features can be great ways to reach out to people.
For on-the-record interviews, I've recently started using the automated transcription app Otter at the recommendation of other reporters. If I'm doing an interview by phone, I use an Olympus earpiece that plugs into my recorder to capture the conversation.
How is Silicon Valley having an impact on Washington?
Washington has become intertwined with the Valley in lots of different ways.
Every major tech company has ramped up its presence here. Small armies of lobbyists work Capitol Hill and a vast swath of the administration to fight attempts to regulate the industry or to shape the rules when they become inevitable.
The revolving door between tech and Washington may have lost some of its luster -- a job at Google or Facebook isn't as shiny as it used to be -- but it is still functioning just fine. For example, Google just hired the chief of staff to Senator Rob Portman, a Republican from Ohio, to lead its Washington office.
How do Washington folks use tech differently, compared with other parts of the country?
My unscientific conclusion is that the Washington metro area has the highest per-capita concentration of Twitter users whose profile photo is a shot of them appearing on cable news. Some of those people are my friends, and I would like to take this opportunity to urge them to reconsider.
How has the tech fluency among lawmakers changed, or not, over time?
Many lawmakers have become more fluent in tech -- or at least more conversant -- since the infamous Mark Zuckerberg hearings in 2018. There's an understanding that before they became giants, Capitol Hill didn't pay enough attention to the platforms that now account for a large share of the economy. In both the House and the Senate, lawmakers are often asking sharper questions than they used to and doing a better job of diving into the specifics.
There's a related issue: For years, "tech policy" largely meant communications policy. It was about regulating the infrastructure that allows us to share information with one another. That has much wider implications than it used to.
If you oversee banking, you have to grok Facebook's attempt to build a cryptocurrency. Google's use of patient records is a health policy question as much as it's a tech policy one. I'm interested in how lawmakers and their staff members adapt to this moment, when major tech companies are trying to play in more and more parts of modern life even as they face scrutiny for the business models that made them successful.
And what is the tech industry like in Washington?
All eyes are on Amazon and, more specifically, on its second headquarters in Northern Virginia. Its arrival has prompted a lot of questions about whether it will trigger even more gentrification in an already gentrifying city.
Amazon has been aggressive in building relationships with local educational institutions. In October, its chief executive, Jeff Bezos, visited a class at Dunbar High School in Washington, and the company is counting on local universities to help build the work force for its new offices.
The efforts have been met with resistance that is emblematic of the wider reckoning tech faces around its impact on society. Jay Carney, the former White House press secretary who leads Amazon's policy apparatus, visited Trinity Washington University this fall. While he was there, an undocumented student raised concerns about Amazon's work with United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and he was met by anti-Amazon activists outside during his visit.
Outside of work, what tech are you personally obsessed with?
I'm a heavy Spotify user and find that music streaming has broadened my musical horizons. I listen to more artists than I did before and pay more attention to new releases.
I am also one of those people who fell hard for AirPods. They look silly, but they work very well. Contrary to my expectations, I haven't lost one of the earbuds yet. That said: Buying the new, pricey AirPods Pro seems like tempting the earbud-losing fates. I'm staying away and saving my money.
Frankly, I spend more of my personal time trying to disconnect. I delete Twitter from my phone on vacation and on weekends when I'm being especially disciplined. I have been far less successful in cutting down on my Instagram use, but hope springs eternal.

Texto completo: Live up to our values In a whirlwind news week involving blockbuster impeachment hearings and a Democratic debate, The New York Times’ publication of the Community Party of China’s (CPC) internal documents was left by the wayside. Party documents regarding China’s brutal government-sponsored crackdown of ethnic minorities in China’s interior Xinjian region are shocking. Austin Ramzy and Chris Buckley detail the plight of college students returning home to find their families have vanished and veiled threats from party officials to keep their mouths shut. Other reports out of Xinjiang have highlighted worrisome facts, including over a million Uighurs in concentration camps, organ harvesting, forced quartering of communists in Uighur homes and massive surveillance.
As Americans, we understand that the role of the United States as a global leader requires us to lead by example on all issues, especially those of human rights, diplomacy and international engagement. As history has shown, when the United States leads, the world follows. As history has also unfortunately shown, when we step back, when America stands silent as atrocities are committed, the world also remains silent. We saw this in Rwanda, we saw this in Darfur and unfortunately, we are seeing this again in China and Burma. As people of conscience, we cannot allow this to happen.
Recently, the Senate passed the Uighur Human Rights Policy Act of 2019 in a bipartisan manner, and both Senators Durbin and Duckworth voted for the bill. I thank the senators for their votes, and I ask members of Illinois’ congressional delegation to encourage Speaker Pelosi to bring the bill to the House floor.
Standing up for what’s right is our responsibility as a people of conscience. Let’s live up to our values.

Texto completo: U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris dropped out of the Democratic presidential race on Tuesday, ending a campaign that started with promise but failed to gain traction in Iowa.
"As the campaign has gone on, it's become harder and harder to raise the money we need to compete," she said in a video posted on her Twitter account. "In good faith, I cannot tell you, my supporters and volunteers, that I have a path forward if I don't believe I do."
Her decision to drop out comes about 10 weeks after Harris launched an "all in on Iowa" strategy at the end of September, saying she wanted a top-three finish in the first-in-the-nation caucuses. She increased the number of paid staffers here from 65 to 131.
She visited the state almost every week for the past two months, with 38 public events in Iowa from late September through Sunday, according to the Des Moines Register's Candidate Tracker. Since October 2018, she held 87 campaign event in the state.
"Iowa has a long tradition and history of expecting the candidates spend time here and that folks get to know you," she said in Waterloo on Sept. 20. "I'm prepared to make that investment. I honor and respect the process, and that is what the process requires."
In addition to marque events like the Polk County Democrats' Steak Fry and the Liberty and Justice Dinner, Harris crisscrossed the state for house parties and speaking pavilions. Her family spent Thanksgiving in the Waterbury neighborhood during her most recent six-day swing through Des Moines.
Yet, her Iowa poll figures dropped. In late September, a Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom Iowa Poll found she ranked fifth in the state, with 6% of likely Democratic caucusgoers selecting her as their top candidate.
By mid-November, only 3% of respondents said Harris was their first choice. That placed her in a tie for sixth with outsider candidates like Andrew Yang, Tom Steyer and Tulsi Gabbard.
Harris' team also struggled to raise funds. Campaign Manager Juan Rodriguez announced at the end of October that headquarters staff would take pay cuts. They also laid off the campaign's New Hampshire organizers.
In a memo, Rodriguez said the team would deploy many "field staff from New Hampshire, Nevada, and California" into Iowa. But unlike at the end of September, Harris' campaign did not provide an exact figure of how many staffers they brought here.
After Harris announced she was dropping out on Tuesday, a campaign aide told the Register that she will return to the early states to thank employees.
Harris, who was elected to the Senate in 2016, first announced her bid on ABC's "Good Morning America" on Jan. 21.
State Rep. Ross Wilburn, D-Ames, who endorsed Harris at the end of September, said minority campaign workers for other candidates called and texted him Tuesday.
"It's important for diverse voices to be represented," he said. "... Whether you're a person of color in a city or in a community that's rural, it impacts the process of decision-making. But also, it's important who is at the table and in the room. It helps make communities feel represented."
Wilburn said Harris was an intent listener during their other meetings. He most recently met with her on Saturday in West Des Moines, when Harris held a meeting with African American leaders. The day before, the New York Times wrote a critical article about her campaign, blaming her poor performance in part on tension between Rodriguez and Harris' sister and campaign chair, Maya Harris.
Wilburn declined to discuss what the group talked about Saturday, but he said, "she was as determined as ever."
Dianne Baker Hoye, who hosted a house party for Harris on Saturday, said she did not see any indication that the campaign would end. Baker Hoye, who housed a campaign staffer, backed Harris because of her background as a prosecutor, believing she could sting President Donald Trump in presidential debates next fall.
A volunteer for Martin O'Malley's 2016 presidential bid, Baker Hoye said Harris' field staff in Iowa was as organized and dedicated as any team she had seen. After the standing-room only event at her house, a staffer told Baker Hoye they received 95 commit to caucus cards. She believed momentum was building for a comeback.
"She had people," Baker Hoye said. "I don't know what was behind her decision."
"In good faith, I cannot tell you, my supporters and volunteers, that I have a path forward if I don't believe I do." said Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Ca., in a video Tuesday announcing her withdrawal from the Democratic presidential race.

Jamelle Bouie: Democrats are crazy to leave any worker behind

Texto completo: Organized labor is the lifeblood of liberal politics in the United States. Unions backed Franklin D. Roosevelt’s New Deal reforms, gave critical support to the fight for the Great Society and powered Democratic political victories throughout the 20th century. Even now, the Democratic Party is generally strongest in states where organized labor has the most influence.
Despite this clear, partisan incentive for pro-union policies, too many elected Democrats have failed to make labor enough of a priority. This was true under Jimmy Carter, when union membership began its precipitous decline, as well as under Bill Clinton and Barack Obama. Other levels of government led by Democrats have also drifted away from unions.
Under pressure from moderate Democrats in key swing districts, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi wants to bring the White House-negotiated United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement to the floor before the end of the year. Moderate Democrats believe they can more easily win reelection with a bipartisan accomplishment under their belts. But passing it would hand President Donald Trump a key political victory in the midst of impeachment proceedings, potentially undermining the entire Democratic ticket in 2020.
There’s also the labor question itself. Trump has sold the USMCA as a worker-friendly revision to the North American Free Trade Agreement. But union leaders and their Democratic allies say it needs stronger enforcement for labor rights and environmental protection. Rushing it now may undermine both. It’s also not clear that this would actually help moderate Democrats. Passing a bill only validates Trump’s oft-made claim that he’s an expert deal-maker, and as the presidential election nears, bolstering the president means you’re boosting his party.
Pelosi’s focus on trade comes at the expense of the Protecting the Right to Organize Act, a broad package of pro-labor reforms introduced by Rep. Bobby Scott of Virginia and co-sponsored by 215 members, which Pelosi has put on the back burner. The PRO ACT would eliminate right-to-work laws, impose new penalties on employers who retaliate against union drives and prevent employers from delaying negotiations on collective bargaining contracts. The bill has already passed out of the House Committee on Education and Labor, and while it won’t become law under Trump, it’s still important — it shows the party’s commitment to the future of organized labor.
Pelosi’s narrow focus on the survival of moderate Democrats is understandable. Her majority rests on those moderates, who have followed her on impeachment despite real risks to their political standing. But the opportunity cost of that focus may be a chance to improve the vital relationship between labor and the Democratic Party.
Pelosi’s actions under a divided government are more defensible than those of Ralph Northam, the governor of Virginia, soon operating for the first time under unified Democratic control. With a liberal majority in the General Assembly, Northam intends to sign new legislation on gun control, voting rights and Confederate monuments (allowing localities to remove them without state authorization). He’ll push bipartisan redistricting and fully implement the Affordable Care Act, with a state-based health insurance marketplace. He even wants to explore ways to expand access to preschool education. But on labor, Northam prefers the status quo. Last week, he told a group of lawmakers and business leaders that he could not “foresee Virginia taking actions” that would include “repeal of the right-to-work law.”
“Right to work” is a bit of misnomer. Under “closed shop” rules, new employees at unionized workplaces must join the union or at least pay dues. The reasoning is straightforward. Under federal labor law, nonunion workers are covered by the union contract. But negotiations aren’t cheap — they take time and money. If everyone benefits, then everyone must contribute. “Right-to-work” laws essentially outlaw closed shops. Nonunion workers can claim union benefits without paying union dues or joining up, undermining the union in the process. It shouldn’t come as a surprise that “right-to-work” laws are associated with low wages and lower rates of unionization. Virginia, incidentally, was named this summer as the worst state in the country to work.
A 2018 National Bureau of Economic Research study of the political effects of “right-to-work” laws found that they reduced Democratic vote share in presidential, congressional and state legislative elections, reduced Democratic turnout, dampened labor contributions to Democratic candidates, reduced the number of working-class candidates and moved state policy in a conservative direction. Repealing “right to work” wouldn’t just be good for the state’s workers — including the black Virginians who propelled Northam to the governor’s mansion and saved him in the midst of a “blackface” scandal — it would strengthen the state Democratic Party and move policymaking to the left. It’s in Northam’s interest as the leading Democrat in Virginia to want to end right to work and open a path for union growth in the state. And yet, as a moderate, business-friendly Democrat, he won’t take the plunge.
Pelosi and Northam represent larger trends in Democratic politics: a long-term departure from labor that reflects on itself to undermine both. As unions get weaker, Democrats grow distant from organized labor. They are less likely to act on its behalf, which only makes the erosion worse.
Democratic inaction sits in stark contrast to the Republican Party’s ruthless assault on labor. Since 2010, five more states have passed “right-to-work” laws. In one of them, Michigan, public-sector union membership declined by 34,000. In another, Wisconsin, overall union membership is down 133,000 since the beginning of the decade. Both declines contributed to Republican victories in these states, including the 2016 presidential race. As Tracie Sharp, president of the conservative State Policy Network, told The Wall Street Journal in 2016, “When you chip away at one of the power sources that also does a lot of get-out-the-vote, I think that helps — for sure.”
Republicans and other conservatives know who their enemies are — they know that organized labor is a key obstacle to dismantling the social safety net. The question is whether Democrats understand that their fortunes are also bound up in the fate of workers.

Pitts: Barriers zigzag across America like a scar

Texto completo: Unsurprisingly, the one Donald Trump is trying to build on the southern border - the one he swore Mexico would pay for - has proven, like most things he touches, an embarrassing failure. First came news last month that smugglers have been able to cut through the barrier with a simple reciprocating saw, available at Home Depot for prices starting at less than $100. Then, TBS' "Full Frontal with Samantha Bee" aired a segment demonstrating that the wall, which Trump has said "can't be climbed," can actually be climbed in as little as 15 seconds and by climbers as young as eight.
Maybe Mexico should demand a refund.
In the meantime, and with much less fanfare, construction continues on a wall of much further-reaching consequences. You see, while the wall on the border is supposed to repel immigrants and smugglers, this one repels something many of us find even more threatening: contradictory opinions. Consider three recent news stories:
* In Washington, the White House announces it will cancel government subscriptions to the Washington Post and New York Times. The administration calls it a cost-saving measure, but the truth is obvious. Trump famously hates both newspapers.
* In Citrus County, Florida, county commissioners reject the local library's request for a digital subscription to the Times. Says commissioner Scott Carnahan, "Fake news, OK, I agree with President Trump. I don't want the New York Times in this county."
* In Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, the library reports that an unknown patron has been hiding books critical of Trump and conservatism, deliberately mis-shelving them in other sections of the library. As that person explained in a note, "I am going to continue hiding these books in the most obscure places I can find to keep this propaganda out of the hands of young minds."
The sheer snowflakery of all this cannot, of course, be overstated. And yes, it reeks of anti-intellectualism, that proud, bullyboy ignorance that has too often fed books - and bodies - into bonfires.
But this also speaks to barriers of intellectual - and emotional - separation that now zigzag across America like a scar, splitting towns, colleges, churches, workplaces, friendships and families. Nor is the barrier only being built from one side. As liberal college students demand "safe spaces" and "trigger warnings" so they won't have to confront contradiction of their beliefs, it becomes painfully clear this wall is a bipartisan project. And that should concern us all.
This is no argument for false equivalence, nor even for civility. But it is an argument for intellectual freedom - for honoring people's sacred right to speak and to hear.
The genius of America has always been that it believed in the marketplace of ideas, believed we should have access to the broadest possible range, and that if we did, we would, more often than not, choose the good over the bad, the right over the wrong, the intelligent over the stupid.
Yes, that trust has been sorely tested lately, but is the answer to abandon it completely? To do so would be to abandon everything that makes this country worth the trouble. To do so would be craven and un-American. As in commissioners of a podunk Florida county defending its citizens from the New York Times.
One doesn't know whether to laugh or cry. That wall Trump is trying to build against immigrants will go down as an expensive boondoggle. But you know what will cost us more in the long run?
Any wall we build against ourselves.

Memos Shed Light on Activities of Campaign and Trump Aides

Texto completo: Documents released by the Justice Department in response to a lawsuit by the news media include summaries of interviews with Michael Cohen, Hope Hicks and Rod Rosenstein.
WASHINGTON -- Michael Cohen, President Trump's former lawyer, told federal investigators that another lawyer representing Mr. Trump dismissed his warnings that a letter to Congress describing discussions between Russian officials and representatives of the Trump Organization about a proposed Trump Tower project in Moscow omitted key details, newly released memos show.
"Cohen said there were more communications with Russia and more communications with Trump than" what was documented in his letter, one memo said, noting that among them was a conversation he had had with a "woman from the Kremlin" whom he had told the president about.
The memo cites Mr. Cohen quoting the other lawyer, Jay Sekulow, saying the details did not need to be included in the letter to Congress because the Moscow project never moved forward.
Mr. Cohen's letter to Congress was sent in August 2017. Twelve months later, he pleaded guilty to a range of financial crimes and a campaign finance-related charge stemming from his payments to a pornographic film actress who had claimed to have had an affair with Mr. Trump.
In November 2018, Mr. Cohen made a surprise appearance in federal court to plead guilty to an additional charge of lying to Congress and revealed that Mr. Trump and his representatives were more involved in discussions over a potential real estate deal in Russia during the 2016 presidential campaign than had been previously known. He told prosecutors that he intentionally lied to protect Mr. Trump.
Mr. Cohen is currently serving a three-year prison sentence after pleading guilty to financial crimes as well as lying to Congress.
The conversations between Mr. Cohen and Mr. Sekulow about what to disclose about the project are laid out in memos written by investigators who interviewed Mr. Cohen as part of the examination by the special counsel Robert S. Mueller III, of a possible conspiracy between the Trump campaign in 2016 and Russian officials.
Mr. Cohen has claimed that Mr. Sekulow, who still represents Mr. Trump, told him to tell Congress that the discussions about the possible Trump Tower project, which Mr. Cohen had personally pushed for while he worked at the Trump Organization, had gone on for less time than they actually had.
Mr. Sekulow has denied that claim. Asked on Tuesday about the new batch of memos -- documents called "302s" summarizing interviews with witnesses -- he said the Trump team had declined to respond to Mr. Cohen's claims because his testimony was "not truthful."
The timing of the Trump Tower discussions was significant to investigators because the proposal represented a business interest that Mr. Trump would have had in Russia during the campaign.
Another matter detailed in the 302s -- the 2016 meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Kremlin-linked lawyer who had claimed to have dirt on Hillary Clinton -- was scrutinized closely by investigators as a possible instance of conspiracy between the campaign and Russia.
The memos were among nearly 300 pages of documents released by the Justice Department in response to being sued by BuzzFeed and CNN. They include summaries of interviews with Corey Lewandowski, Mr. Trump's former campaign manager, and Hope Hicks, the former White House communications director.
The interview summaries do not change the understanding of events that was documented in the report Mr. Mueller submitted to the Justice Department, and many of them are heavily redacted.
But they help paint a clearer picture of activities by the Trump campaign and by White House aides. And some describe a pattern of behavior by the president that is at the heart of the impeachment inquiry by House Democrats.
In one summary, Mr. Lewandowski described Mr. Trump directing him to deliver a statement to Jeff Sessions, then the attorney general, that he wanted Mr. Sessions to release in his own name.
Mr. Sessions had recused himself from matters related to the Russia investigation after it was reported that at his confirmation hearings, he had not revealed the extent of his own contacts related to Russia during the 2016 campaign. Mr. Mueller was appointed as a result.
The recusal infuriated Mr. Trump, and according to the summary of Mr. Lewandowksi's interview, he wanted Mr. Sessions to say that Mr. Trump "didn't do anything wrong" and that the existence of the special prosecutor was "unfair" to Mr. Sessions.
The statement was also supposed to say that Mr. Sessions would meet with Mr. Mueller and tell him how unfair the investigation was to the president. Mr. Trump, according to the interview summary, believed that issuing such a statement would get Mr. Sessions "back on track."
Mr. Lewandowski never delivered the message to Mr. Sessions, according to Mr. Mueller's report.
In other interviews with investigators, Ms. Hicks described in detail her discussions with the president about a meeting that his son Donald Trump Jr., in search of dirt to use against Mrs. Clinton in June 2016, agreed to hold with an associate who wanted to bring a Kremlin-connected lawyer to Trump Tower in New York.
Ms. Hicks recalled joining Mr. Trump and his daughter Ivanka and her husband, Jared Kushner, in the White House residence shortly after the meeting, when the Mueller inquiry was a few weeks old.
Mr. Kushner said they had discovered something that Mr. Trump should be aware of but was "not a big deal." He then told his father-in-law that he, Donald Trump Jr. and the former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, had attended the meeting at Trump Tower.
Mr. Kushner started to open a folder full of documents, Ms. Hicks recalled, but Mr. Trump "stopped him and said he did not want to know about it."
A week later, the group met again, this time to discuss emails related to the meeting that had been discovered between the younger Mr. Trump and others. Ms. Hicks proposed a "softball interview" to get ahead of the story.
Mr. Kushner again said it was "not a big deal, just a meeting about Russian adoption," according to the interview summaries.
Mr. Trump said that "they should not do anything, asked why so many people had the emails, and that they needed to let the lawyers deal with it," according to the summaries.
At another point, Ms. Hicks told interviewers that she knew the news coverage of the emails would be "really bad," and that her impression was that Mr. Trump did not believe that they would ever become public.
Other memos recount Ms. Hicks's recollection of working on a statement to provide to The New York Times when the newspaper learned of the meeting between the younger Mr. Trump and the lawyer, Natalia V. Veselnitskaya, who had links to the Kremlin. She presented the statement to the president as they were traveling on Air Force One, but he told her it contained too much information, according to the interview summary.
The statement that was eventually released by Donald Trump Jr., the parameters of which were dictated by his father, said the meeting had been "primarily" about Russian adoptions -- a reference to an anticorruption measure passed in the United States in 2012 that banned adoptions from Russia -- and did not mention the promise of information about Mrs. Clinton.
Another set of summaries describe how Rod J. Rosenstein, the former deputy attorney general who wrote a memo that became the justification for firing the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey in 2017, was conflicted about what he had done.
The day before Mr. Comey was fired, Mr. Rosenstein was called to the White House to meet with the president and others and told to write a memo summarizing his concerns about Mr. Comey.
"I knew when I left Director Comey would be fired," Mr. Rosenstein is quoted as saying. After it happened the next day, Mr. Rosenstein said he felt "angry, ashamed, horrified and embarrassed."
Recounting his feelings for Mr. Comey, Mr. Rosenstein then "paused a moment, appearing to have been overcome by emotion, but quickly recovered and apologized," investigators wrote.

Texto completo: A reader cites examples of animal cruelty by humans, some of which will not be banned by a bill that just passed Congress.
To the Editor:
Thank you for publishing Margaret Renkl's heartbreaking piece "How Not to Kill An Animal" (Op-Ed, Nov. 19). It details some of the horrific, and unnecessary, suffering people impose on wildlife, such as leg-hold traps.
You also covered President Trump's signing of the Preventing Animal Cruelty and Torture Act, which was passed unanimously by Congress ("President Signs Bipartisan Animal Cruelty Bill Into Law," news article, Nov. 26). While it is a very positive step, it exempts the cruelty to wildlife described by Ms. Renkl as well as the torture of livestock endemic to factory farms. Since dogs in puppy mills are deemed livestock, they are exempted from the law as well.
Ironically, in the Nov. 26 Science Times, James Gorman writes not just about dogs' devotion to people, but also about their capacity for interspecies love of all kinds ("Yes, Your Dog Loves You. She Can't Help It."). How wonderful it would be if we humans had so much compassion for other species.

‘All Is Calm’: beautiful singing, strong emotion, and humanity

Texto completo: What surprised us most about Theater Latté Da’s “All Is Calm: The Christmas Truce of 1914” was its simplicity and spareness. The stage is almost bare except for gray-painted wood crates and platforms. There’s theatrical haze, and the occasional projection at the back. No bombs burst, no shots ring out. It’s entirely a cappella singing and speaking until the end, when a lone bugle sounds.
Yet for 65 minutes, “All Is Calm,” now at the Ritz Theater through Dec. 29, holds your whole attention. Last Friday’s sold-out house was still as stones. No coughing, no between-songs applause. It seemed the whole audience held its breath from the start, when the cast of 10 emerged singing from the darkness through the haze. On the way out, we heard one word over and over: “Incredible.”
In 32 songs and many spoken passages, “All Is Calm” tells a remarkable true story: of the call to enlist in a war everyone thought would be over by Christmas, young men who signed up and were sent to the Western front, life in the trenches, hardships endured, comrades killed. And an unprecedented impromptu Christmas Eve cease-fire between Allied and German forces that took place in No Man’s Land, where the men sang Christmas carols and shook hands and exchanged gifts and addresses before returning to battle.
The songs are traditional: “It’s a Long Way to Tipperary,” “God Save the King,” “O Tannenbaum/O Christmas Tree,” “Stille Nacht/Silent Night,” “The First Noel,” “Auld Lang Syne.” Some are war songs set to familiar tunes: “When This Bloody War Is Over,” sung to “What a Friend We Have in Jesus.” “Raining, Raining, Raining,” set to “Holy, Holy, Holy.” Songs are sung in English, French, Flemish and German.
The spoken words are taken from soldiers’ letters and journals, poems of the time, war documents and gravestones. Most often, a spoken passage ends with a soldier giving his name and affiliation: “Private Frank Sumpter, London Rifle Brigade.” “Hugo Klemm, 133rd Saxon infantry.” You wonder – did he survive? What about him? “Oh, my,” one sings. “I don’t want to die … I want to go home.”
The show was created by Peter Rothstein, Latté Da’s founding artistic director, over years of research. The exquisite musical and vocal arrangements are by Erick Lichte and Timothy C. Takach, both formerly of the men’s a cappella group Cantus, where Lichte was a founding member and artistic director. It had its world premiere in December 2007 at Westminster Presbyterian Church, from where it was broadcast nationally over MPR, then moved in 2008 to the Pantages and became an annual holiday tradition. Cantus performed in the production through 2014.
Directed by Rothstein, “All Is Calm” has toured the United States and been broadcast on five continents. Last year, it ran for a few nights at the Ritz before going to New York City for an off-Broadway production that won a New York Drama Desk Award. Next week, it will be filmed for national broadcast over PBS in 2020.
In the years “All Is Calm” played the Pantages, we never managed to catch it. We all get busy during the holidays. We make choices about how we’re going to spend our time and our entertainment dollars. Do we want a night out of pure enjoyment? Do we want to laugh and clap and feel light on our feet as we head out the door into the snow? Or do we want to be moved, to think and feel and reflect? Cantus must have asked themselves those questions in 2007, when this was their Christmas show.
For your holiday fare, we might suggest a Christmas blend. Something sweet and/or funny, and also something poignant and pointed. “All Is Calm” is a visceral experience. It aims straight for the heart, and its aim is true. It’s filled with beautiful singing, strong emotion, and humanity. We wished, and not for the first time (or the last), that Latté Da had left the theater lights low a bit longer, to give us a chance to collect ourselves. It’s a powerful production. We’re very glad we (finally!) saw it.
It’s interesting that two important works for theater about the Christmas Truce of 2014 were both born here in Minneapolis. The opera “Silent Night” was commissioned by Minnesota Opera as part of its New Works Initiative, premiered here in 2011, and went on to win the Pulitzer Prize for music in 2012. “Silent Night” has also been seen on PBS.
“All Is Calm” continues at the Ritz Theater through Dec. 29. FMI and tickets (start at $33).
The picks
Now at the Film Society’s St. Anthony Main Theatre: Pedro Almodóvar’s “Pain and Glory.” The legendary Spanish filmmaker, director and screenwriter (“Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown,” “Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!,” “All About My Mother,” “Talk to Her”) returns with a story about a filmmaker in his physical decline, no longer able to continue his life’s work. The cast includes Antonio Banderas, a veteran of several films with the director, and Almodóvar’s longtime muse, Penélope Cruz. The house where Banderas’ character lives is Almodóvar’s house in real life. FMI and tickets.
Tomorrow (Wednesday, Dec. 4) at the Minneapolis Central Library: Talk of the Stacks: Dan Buettner. The New York Times best-selling author of “The Blue Zones,” Minnesota’s Dan Buettner will release his latest, “The Blue Zones Kitchen: 100 Recipes to Live to 100,” today (Tuesday, Dec. 3). So this Talk of the Stacks event will be a perfect time to pick up a copy and have it signed. Doors at 6:15, program at 7. Seating is limited. Overflow space with live feed will be available.
Thursday and Friday at the Ordway Concert Hall: Schubert Club International Artist Series: Sheku Kanneh-Mason and Isata Kanneh-Mason . Cellist Sheku Kanneh-Mason won the 2016 BBC Young Musician Competition, a big deal in Britain but not well known here. Then he performed at the wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle and became a sensation. The Schubert Club’s Barry Kempton knew about the young phenom before the royal wedding and nabbed him for his 2019-20 International Artist Season. Sheku will be here with his sister, Isata, who recently released her debut album on Decca. Wild but true: All seven of the Kanneh-Mason siblings are musicians, playing violin, piano or cello. 7:30 p.m. Thursday, 10:30 a.m. Friday. FMI and tickets ($28-75).
Saturday at SooVAC: Opening reception for “Let There Be Spaces in Your Togetherness.” Continuing its 20th anniversary celebration, Mizna, the St. Paul-based Arab arts organization, has joined with SooVAC for a juried group show. Participating local and national artists are from the Southwest Asian and North African (SWANA) region or of SWANA descent. Following its stay at SooVAC, the exhibition will tour to St. Cloud State University and New York Mills Cultural Center. 6-9 pm. FMI. Free. Closes Jan. 9. Meanwhile, another Mizna-related exhibition, “History Is Not Here: Art and the Arab Imaginary” continues at the M through Jan. 5. FMI.
Holiday pick
If you want to hear Cantus sing “All Is Calm: The Christmas Truce of 1914,” the original cast recording is available. If you want to see them live, performing their own “Christmas With Cantus” show, you’ll have several chances to do that starting Thursday, Dec. 12. The acclaimed men’s a cappella vocal ensemble has expanded its holiday program to nine Greater Twin Cities venues, so whether you live in Minneapolis or St. Paul, Fridley or Apple Valley, Stillwater or Wayzata, you won’t have to go far to hear their signature mix of superb singing, joy, nostalgia and newness. This year’s program is all about storytelling. FMI and tickets (prices vary by venue).

Warren, Patrick looking to make moves in an unsettled Democratic field

Texto completo: Deval Patrick is arriving at the party just as the early guests are starting to leave, and Elizabeth Warren is frantically looking for her next move.
Barely two months before the New Hampshire primary, a presidential campaign that should be coming into focus looks as opaque as it has at any point, and two Massachusetts candidates are searching for the way forward.
After a summer in which Warren appeared to be the most dynamic Democratic candidate, the narrative of her campaign has shifted. Now she is the candidate who inspires worry among the party faithful as much as any other emotion, the policy nerd who may have ridden the wave of fresh ideas as far as it will carry her.
The turning point for her candidacy is easy to pinpoint: the day she decided to put a $20 trillion price tag on a Medicare-for-All proposal that voters have greeted with either indifference or outright fear. That was pretty much when her rise turned into a plateau. Now, Pete Buttigieg is surging in Iowa and New Hampshire, while Warren is holding steady but no longer growing.
Patrick, meanwhile, is bouncing among the early primary states of Iowa, New Hampshire, and South Carolina in a bid to generate some momentum for his late-starting campaign. Though what he really needs isn't “momentum" — it's millions of dollars in hard currency And he needs it soon, before he becomes another starry-eyed dreamer who couldn't get onto the debate stage where the real campaign is happening.
Warren had a striking moment a few days ago in Iowa, where she gave an emotional answer to a young woman who asked about the challenges she has faced. She spoke of the end of her first marriage, and how hard it was to break it to her mother that the union that was supposed to propel her to success, in her family's eyes, was coming to an end. Predictably, some people later wrote about how Warren had cried. But her campaign seemed to view it as touching, immediately promoting it on social media.
Part of the strategy of releasing so many detailed plans about what she would do as president was to pivot away from her biography — and the whole problematic issue of her Native American heritage and whether she used it to get ahead.
But you don't white-paper your way to the presidency. Voters want to know — or feel that they know — the person, too. Warren has already talked extensively about her family's hardscrabble days in Oklahoma. But in the weeks leading up to actual voting, I wouldn't be surprised to see more intimate glimpses of Warren's life, and less talk about tax rates. (Though I don't think we'll hear more about her years at Harvard, which she seems to have all but disowned in her bid to repackage herself as a daughter of the heartland.)
The question for Warren, maybe unanswerable for now, is whether there are enough hard-core progressive Democratic voters to propel her to the nomination. Her vulnerability is to the center, where Joe Biden and now Buttigieg are chasing voters who want a return to “normal" (whatever that is) but aren't sure they really want big, structural change.
Patrick's challenge is more daunting, but also simpler. He has to introduce himself to voters who know little about him, while also building enough of an organization to take flight in the early states. It's a lot to do at once, especially for a candidate who hasn't run in nearly a decade and has never been exceptional at raising money. Breaking out of the pack in this race has been hard for nearly everyone.
Just ask Kamala Harris, who may have had the best kickoff of anyone, but dropped out Tuesday.
Warren may yet regain her footing, while Patrick is searching for his. But in a race in which no one seems able to seize control, they're hardly alone in searching for the inside track.

Texto completo: Julian Castro bashed the coverage of Sen. Kamala Harris’s campaign in the wake of her decision to drop out of the presidential race.
Harris, 55, announced on Tuesday that she was pulling the plug on her campaign after failing to move to the top of the crowded Democratic primary. Following her announcement, Castro, 45, lamented the downfall of Harris’s campaign.
“She’s one of the most qualified people running and, throughout this campaign, she has run her campaign with class and with dignity,” Castro said.
Castro continued by claiming that Harris was treated unfairly by the media in the final weeks of her campaign. He referenced a report from Politico that claimed Harris’s campaign was in “meltdown” and included a comment from a staffer who said the campaign had “no discipline, no plan, no strategy.”
He also cited the New York Times and Washington Post, which also published reports about how Harris’s campaign “unraveled” because she didn’t know the type of candidate she wanted to be.
“I will say that the way that the media have treated Senator Harris in this campaign has been something else. In the last few days, to see articles out of Politico, the New York Times, Washington Post that have basically trashed her campaign, and focused on just one small part of it, and I think held her to a different standard, a double standard, has been grossly unfair and unfortunate,” Castro said.
He added, “I’m glad she’s going to keep fighting in the United States Senate, and I believe that she and I share a very common vision for the future of our country.”

Castro, who served as President Obama’s housing and urban development secretary, has struggled to break out in the campaign. He did not qualify for the November debate and has a long way to go to qualify for the December debates. His RealClearPolitics polling average shows his nationwide support at 1.4%.

Texto completo: What are the impeachment articles going to look like?
Beginning this week, the House Judiciary Committee takes the reins of the impeachment inquiry.
Now that fact-finding hearings by the House Intelligence Committee have ended, the Judiciary Committee will hold a hearing “to explore the framework put in place to respond to serious allegations of impeachable conduct like those against President Trump." Jerrold Nadler, the Judiciary chairman, said,
In a letter to President Trump last week, Nadler said, “We will also discuss whether your alleged actions warrant the House's exercising its authority to adopt articles of impeachment."
Such articles would be drafted by Nadler's committee and then voted on by the full House.
Three contenders are emerging for impeachment articles against Trump, according to major media reports. Here is a quick overview:
Abuse of power One article could allege abuse of power, centering on allegations uncovered by the House Intelligence Committee that Trump used his office to pressure the president of Ukraine for his own political benefit, The Associated Press reported.
The article could be broken into categories like bribery or extortion. Democratic lawmakers have used those words at various times to describe Trump's actions
According to testimony and a rough transcript of a July phone call by Trump to the Ukrainian president, Trump wanted Ukraine to announce investigations that would harm his political rival, Democrat Joe Biden, and bolster a debunked theory that Ukraine meddled in the 2016 US presidential election. (The New York Times reports that not just one, but two articles may focus on the Ukraine scandal.)
Obstruction of Congress Another article could focus on Trump's efforts to stymie Congress's investigation, the Times and AP report. Top Trump administration officials have refused to testify and the administration has refused to produce documents in the impeachment inquiry.
House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff may have foreshadowed this article when he said during one of his panel's hearings that Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had made a “concerted and across-the-board effort to obstruct this investigation and this impeachment inquiry. And I will just say this, they do so at their own peril. I remind the president that Article 3 of the impeachment articles drafted aginst President Nixon was his refusal to obey the subpoenas of Congress."
Obstruction of justice A third possible article could focus on the findings of special counsel Robert Mueller on whether Trump obstructed justice during Mueller's expansive probe into whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russia, the news organizations reported.
Here's a refresher: After examining a number of incidents of possible obstruction of justice by Trump, Mueller said he could not exonerate Trump, though he could not charge him, either.
“If we had confidence after a thorough investigation of the facts that the President clearly did not commit obstruction of justice, we would so state. Based on the facts and the applicable legal standards, we are unable to reach that judgment," Mueller's report said.
Mueller, in a news conference on his last day as special counsel, noted that Justice Department policy barred him from charging a sitting president with a crime, but there was “a process other than the criminal justice system" offered by the Constitution — an apparent reference to the ability of Congress to impeach a president.
The furor over the Mueller report died down for a few months. But it may now get a second wind, thanks to the Ukraine scandal, which burst into the headlines in September and has rapidly gained momentum.

SLATED SENATE APPOINTEE FACES SCRUTINY OVER ABORTION: The likely appointment of Kelly Loeffler to fill Republican Johnny Isakson’s seat representing Georgia in the Senate is drawing opposition from anti-abortion advocates.
Gov. Brian Kemp, a Republican, intends to appoint Loeffler, chief executive of bitcoin trading platform Bakkt and co-owner of Atlanta’s WNBA franchise, to the slot this week, according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Conservatives have raised the alarm about Loeffler’s appointment because of the WNBA’s outspoken support for Planned Parenthood.
Screen Shot 2019-12-02 at 10.51.17 AM.png
The news also drew backlash from Susan B. Anthony’s List because Loeffler has served on the board of Grady Memorial Hospital, which SBA List claimed provides abortions, though a spokeswoman for Grady told the Washington Examiner that it has not provided elective abortions for more than a decade.
“I don’t know where that came from, but it totally is not true,” the spokeswoman said.
Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of SBA List, said that Loeffler’s affiliation to Grady should disqualify her from representing Georgia in the Senate, elaborating on Twitter that it was because Grady had links to Emory Medical School, which, according to its website, appears to offer training for students on providing abortions. The medical school did not get back to us to confirm in time for publication.
It’s unclear whether the opposition will derail the appointment. Kemp appeared to push back on the backlash in recent days, saying, “The idea that I would appoint someone to the U.S. Senate that is NOT pro-life, pro-2nd Amendment, pro-freedom, and 100% supportive of our President (and his plan to Keep America Great) is ridiculous.”
Further, Georgia has one of the most anti-abortion records in the U.S.: Kemp signed a six-week abortion ban into law this year, which was blocked by a federal judge.
But anti-abortion groups remained opposed. “This moment calls for a Senate candidate with outspoken public pro-life courage like that of the governor,” Dannenfelser said.
Tom McClusky, president of March for Life Action, agreed.
“It would be hugely disappointing if Governor Kemp appoints her to a critical seat in the U.S. Senate,” he said. “After the Senate gains made by conservative and pro-life candidates in the 2018 election, this would be a huge setback."
But at least one conservative defended Loeffler. Erick Erickson, editor of The Resurgent, said he was told by “multiple people” that Loeffler was a “devout, pro-life Catholic with a worldview that reflects that.”
If Loeffler is appointed, it will defy the will of President Trump and other Republicans. They want Kemp to nominate Rep. Doug Collins, a staunch conservative and defender of the president in the midst of impeachment. Conversely, Loeffler donated to Democrats several years ago.
Trump reportedly was not won over on Loeffler’s nomination when he met with her last week, AJC reported. GOP Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida blasted Kemp on Twitter, suggesting he should be primaried in 2022. “Let’s see if you can win one without Trump,” Gaetz wrote.
The battle could get even uglier: Some think Collins will run for the Senate seat in the 2020 special election if Kemp doesn’t tap him to the role. Loeffler may have an advantage, however, in bringing more female voters to the polls and by pouring her own fortune into the race.

FDA NOMINEE HEADED FOR LIKELY CONFIRMATION: The Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee has set up a Tuesday vote for Trump nominee Dr. Stephen Hahn, a Texas oncologist and healthcare executive, to be confirmed as commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration. After that, the vote will head before the full Senate.
During his confirmation hearing, Hahn sidestepped the question of whether he supported banning flavored e-cigarettes, saying that the decision would not be his because it was already under review by the White House. He did say, however, that he thought “aggressive action” would be needed to stop teen vaping.
TRUMP REAFFIRMS COMMITMENT TO ERADICATING AIDS: On World AIDS Day Sunday, Trump reaffirmed his plan to end the HIV epidemic within the next 10 years: “On World AIDS Day, The First Lady and I express our support for those living with HIV/AIDS and mourn the lives lost. We reaffirm our commitment to end the HIV/AIDS epidemic....in America, community by community where we will eradicate AIDS in 10 years, program already started. American leadership has proven that together we can save lives.”
The pilot program to distribute PrEP treatment set to begin Monday… maybe: The pilot program spearheaded by Health and Human Services to distribute two preventive therapies made by Gilead Sciences — Truvada and Descovy, both of which have list prices of thousands a month, is set to begin Monday, Bloomberg Law said, (HHS itself has only said it would begin Winter 2019). In May, Gilead donated enough Truvada to cover about 200,000 people at risk of contracting HIV for at least five years and possibly for six more after that, as part of the administration’s plan to combat AIDS.
WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION DIRECTOR CONDEMNS VIOLENT ATTACKS ON EBOLA FIGHTERS IN VISIT: The World Health Organization’s Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus called for better security measures to keep Ebola outbreak responders in the Democratic Republic of the Congo safe. On Nov. 27, armed attackers, possibly Congolese, attacked two camps where Ebola fighters were housed, one of nearly 400 attacks this year that have killed 11 people and injured 83. “Even though we shouldn't give up, your security must be ensured… There can be no more callous act than to target health professionals working to heal the sick and care for those in need,” Ghebreyesus said Sunday.
IN CASE YOU MISSED IT, ABORTION RATES KEEP FALLING: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported last week that abortion rates fell 2% in 2016 to 623,471, part of a declining trend in abortion rates. The data excludes some major players, though: California, Maryland, New Hampshire, and the District of Columbia. Still, the CDC’s data supports findings from the Guttmacher Institute, which collects more comprehensive data from the 808 known abortion providers in the U.S., concluding that abortion rates keep falling: In 2017, 862,320 abortions were performed, down 7% from 926,190 in 2014.
TEEN BIRTH RATES KEEP DROPPING, TOO: The CDC released a report last week showing a decline in the number of births among teens between the ages of 15-19 of 7% in 2018, to a record low of 179,871 babies born to teenagers. The report showed that the birth rate among teenagers declined in 38 states. The drop ranged from 19% in Montana to 4% in Indiana, Michigan, and Missouri. In the remaining 12 states and Washington, D.C., birth rates remained steady.

Texto completo: PAWTUCKET, R.I. — State and city officials on Monday announced a $400 million project that would put a 7,500-seat professional soccer stadium, an indoor sports center, and a 200-room hotel on three sites in downtown Pawtucket.
Governor Gina M. Raimondo and Mayor Donald R. Grebien joined Fortuitous Partners in announcing the Tidewater Landing project, calling it the largest economic development project in the Rhode Island city's history. Officials said the project would create 2,500 direct and indirect construction jobs, plus 1,200 direct jobs once completed.
“Here, we have an opportunity of a lifetime," Grebien said.
The announcement came exactly one week after the Pawtucket Red Sox announced that the Triple-A baseball team will be known as the WooSox when it moves to Worcester for the start of the 2021 season.
“The PawSox play a valuable role in this community. We have them in our fabric, so it's a loss," Grebien said. “But when you look at the substantial development — not comparing [United Soccer League] to baseball, but the development itself — absolutely, the city is in a much better position today."
State Secretary of Commerce Stefan Pryor said the project involves seven times more private investment than a failed proposal to keep the PawSox in Rhode Island.
“The proposed set of assets that will be produced — the physical developments, the mix of uses — are far superior to what the PawSox were proposing," Pryor said. “Beyond the boundaries of this development — the proposal on these three sites — we believe there will be a catalytic effect that far exceeds what the PawSox would have yielded."
The project will require $70 million to $90 million in public investment, mostly by the state. It relies on a newly approved tax-increment financing tool and federal Opportunity Zone tax incentives, which have stirred controversy on the national level. No public votes are anticipated, and no General Assembly approval is needed.
The Tidewater site, on the west bank of the Seekonk River and west of Interstate 95, would hold a stadium for a soccer team that would compete in the United Soccer League Championship — the second tier of US professional soccer. The “placeholder" name for the team is the Riptide. The team would begin playing in 2022.
About 200 people crowded into the Blackstone Valley Tourism Center for the Tidewater Landing announcement. Students from Tolman and Shea high schools raised their hands when Raimondo asked if anyone watched soccer.
Rhode Island is in the top 10 markets for televised soccer in the United States, and soccer viewership is on the rise, she said.
“Rhode island is the best market in the country without a professional soccer team," said Brett M. Johnson, founder and partner of Fortuitous Partners and cochair of the Phoenix Rising Football Club.
Pryor said Pawtucket is where the US Open Cup, the national championship in soccer, began more than a century ago. On Lonsdale Avenue, where there's now a Price Rite store, there was Coates Field.
The soccer tournament was held there in 1913, before thousands of spectators. Pryor read from an article in the Pawtucket Times: “Every vantage point was filled with humanity. Spectators thronged seven and eight deep."
Pryor added, “I think that's the kind of excitement we're creating again. Soccer is returning to its rightful home."
The Tidewater site, once home to a National Grid gas plant, also would include a riverside park, restaurants, and retail stores.
The Division Street site, on the east bank of the Seekonk River, would include food and beverage establishments, residences, a riverside park, and a pedestrian bridge.
Pryor said officials have been having “positive, constructive" conversations with the owners of the Apex site and hope they won't have to use eminent domain powers. “We would resort to eminent domain only as a last resort," he said.
Pryor said the state and city funds would be used to pay for infrastructure such as parking, the pedestrian bridge, and parks. He said Fortuitous Partners would finance the stadium privately.
The public funds would be derived through the tax-increment financing tool approved by the General Assembly in June. Tax revenue emanating from the new development would be used for the project, Pryor said.
Based on preliminary estimates over a 30-year financing period, the project is expected to pay for itself, Pryor said. He said tax revenue received by the state and city over those three decades could be double the public investment in the project.
The public investment of $70 million to $90 million would represent 20 percent of the project's cost, Pryor said. The state would provide $60 million to $80 million of that total.
In Washington, Democrats have questioned the Opportunity Zone program, which is meant to encourage investment in poor neighborhoods. The New York Times has reported that wealthy investors and developers, including some with ties to the Trump administration, are poised to profit from the program.
Grebien said that while there might be controversy about the program, it's helping Pawtucket.
“From the City of Pawtucket's perspective, without those types of opportunity zones and the [tax-increment financing] district legislation, we would be sitting here as we have for the last twentysomething years in Pawtucket without these types of developments," Grebien said.
Pryor said the Opportunity Zone program can be improved. But, he said, “Our mission is to utilize every tool available to us to advance the Rhode Island economy. In this particular case, we are able to bring substantial private investment to a city that deserves it — Pawtucket."
Grebien said no decision has been made about what to do with McCoy Stadium after the PawSox leave. He said the options include a Single-A baseball team, an independent league baseball team, or some municipal purpose.
Grebien said he called PawSox chairman Larry Lucchino and president Charles Steinberg to congratulate them on the WooSox announcment.
“I have had to digest that," Grebien said. “It's not where anybody wanted to be. But as we look at this, we wish them well, and we are going to move forward — in some ways, in a lot better ways."

Kyiv, Kiev and Ukraine - which to use and how to pronounce it WORD WATCH

Texto completo: Today, some random dispatches from the Word Front . . .
 Scratching Our Ucraniums - Recent testimony in the impeachment hearings has left many of us asking a big question. No, not the "quid pro quo" question, silly. We want to know how to pronounce "Ukraine."
Most witnesses, interrogators and media commentators have been placing the accent on the second syllable ("yoo-KRAIN"), but several have been stressing the first syllable ("YOO-krain"), and some have been switching between both versions. While most dictionaries list "yoo-KRAIN" as the only pronunciation, some also include "YOO-krain" as an alternative.
My advice about all things involving Ukraine? Stick to your story and stick to "yoo-KRAIN."
 Chicken "Keeve"? - Another question about Ukraine that surfaced during the hearings was how to spell and pronounce the name of its capital city. Why were some people saying "kee-YEV," while others were saying "KEEVE" (rhymes with "sleeve)?
Traditionally, English has used the Russian spelling and pronunciation: "Kiev" and "kee-YEV," respectively. But when Ukraine, once a republic of the Soviet Union, gained independence in 1991, English soon adopted the Ukrainian spelling "Kyiv," which derives from the name of Prince Kyi, who, according to legend, founded the city).
Meanwhile, many English speakers started trying to pronounce "Kyiv" as Ukrainians do - roughly, "keeYOOv. Good luck with that! The closest approximation they've been able to come up with is "KEEVE." (I always say "kee-YEV" because I'm too afraid to try pronouncing "kehYOOv." Call me "Chicken Kiev.")
 Frank Lloyd Wrong - Have you noticed that no one ever speaks of a "structure" or "design" anymore? Now it's all about "architecture."
Last May, for instance, Matthew Goodman of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said that Japan and the U.S. had differences over the "architecture of the agreement" being negotiated between them. And in October, NASA Administrator Jim Birdenstine referred to working with other nations to design the "architecture" of a plan to return to the moon. I can't help envisioning a lunar Epcot, with pavilions nestled in craters.
What's next? You guessed it, "architect" as a verb. The venerable New York Times took the plunge on its website last summer, telling its subscribers, "A lot has changed in the years since we first launched the paywall, especially with how we architect our applications."
All the news that's fit to blueprint?

Texto completo: In 2008, writer and activist Rebecca Solnit published her essay "Men Explain Things to Me." Based on an anecdote of an encounter with a man so intellectually oblivious that he doesn't realize he's referencing Ms. Solnit's own book to impress her, it formed the thematic backbone of her 2014 essay collection of the same name.
It also inspired the term "mansplaining" - a term The New York Times defined as "a man compelled to explain or give an opinion about everything - especially to a woman" when it proclaimed mansplain one of its "Words of the Year" in 2010. Although the author has distanced herself from that term, the viral nature of that initial essay has both informed and influenced contemporary feminism.
Her newest book, "Whose Story Is This?," is a sort of spiritual successor to "Men Explain Things to Me." While men generally still dominate the stories we hear in the media (leading to the silencing of the stories of women and people of color), the surge of women's voices heard via the #MeToo and #TimesUp movements has inspired Ms. Solnit to examine why, at this moment in history, victims of sexual harassment or assault are finally being believed.
A thought-provoking and accessible exploration of the roles social and cultural narratives play in our thinking about gender, race, history and more, the 20 essays in "Whose Story Is This?" collectively make the case that #MeToo and other current forms of social activism are not isolated incidents, but rather the result of slowly shifting ideas of what is, and isn't, acceptable behavior, and the increasing willingness to give voice to those who were previously voiceless.
"It's easy now to assume that one's perspectives on race, gender, orientation and the rest are signs of inherent virtue," Ms. Solnit writes in the opening essay. She goes on to point out that increasingly progressive attitudes are the result of decades of activism by innumerable individuals; attitudes that were once acceptable grow less attractive as more voices speak up against them. Once-dominant narratives - that rape or sexual assault only happens to women who aren't "careful," that allowing same-sex marriage would destroy the idea of a nuclear family, that hard work is all anyone needs to be successful - have increasingly come under fire as the internet and media give exposure to dissenting voices and enable social activism.
Yet, as Ms. Solnit points out, just because some dominant narratives are losing their credibility doesn't mean they've disappeared completely, and just because dissenting stories are given serious consideration today doesn't mean they'll still be given serious consideration tomorrow.
Indeed, the onslaught of harmful narratives Ms. Solnit identifies can certainly feel overwhelming; from the prioritization of the comfort of alleged sexual abusers over justice for their victims to the demonization of ambitious women whose behaviors would be congratulated if they were men, one can feel as if the work to be done is so vast and complicated that it may not even be possible to change those narratives.
The author counteracts that pessimism by reminding readers that the big societal changes we've seen in the past decade have been the result of years and years of smaller moments that changed the way we look at the world. Anita Hill's testimony regarding the sexual harassment she allegedly experienced at the hands of Justice Clarence Thomas at his confirmation hearing in 1991 didn't stop him from joining the Supreme Court; it did, however, make those watching at home aware of the concept of sexual harassment and what it looks like, which then increased the number of employees willing to speak out about their own experiences with harassment, which led to workplaces explicitly forbidding that behavior.
In fact, it is this gradual social change that Ms. Solnit seeks to encourage, and it gives "Whose Story Is This?" a sense of unabashed optimism. "We need hope and purpose and membership in a community beyond the nuclear family," she reminds us in the essay "A Hero Is a Disaster." She continues: "This connection is both personally fulfilling and is also how we get stuff done that needs to be done."
Writing with hope and purpose herself, Ms. Solnit reminds us that even when activism fails to achieve its immediate goal, it succeeds in giving inspiration to other people who want to change the world. In a social climate where anger and isolationism take precedent, it's an incredibly necessary reminder that ultimately the story of the United States is the story of every single person in it.

Texto completo: A co-chief film critic of The New York Times debates himself on the subject.
Our co-chief film critic is of two minds on the subject, and is not shy about speaking both of them.
A.O. Scott, Professional Couch Potato Recently, Martin Scorsese made some waves on the internet when he said, more than once, that Marvel movies were "not cinema." Those anchors of the Disney entertainment empire are widely seen in theaters around the world, fulfilling at least one basic criterion of what "cinema" might be. Scorsese's latest film, "The Irishman," which for my money is about as good as cinema gets, is playing in theaters for just three weeks before taking up permanent residence on the Netflix streaming platform.
It will join Alfonso Cuarón's "Roma," a multiple Oscar winner earlier this year, and Noah Baumbach's "Marriage Story," as well as "Atlantics," by the French-Senegalese director Mati Diop, an award-winner at the notoriously Netflix-hostile Cannes Film Festival in May. That's a small sample, limited to just one streaming company. There's a lot of cinema out there -- maybe more than ever before -- even if most viewers will have to stay home to experience it.
A.O. Scott, Professional Cinephile Which is no small matter, and nothing new. People have been watching movies at home since the early days of television. I doubt anyone is enough of a purist to refuse to watch them that way, but you don't have to be a film snob to prefer the big screen, the dark room full of strangers, the community and communion of what is now half-dismissively called "theatrical." The pictures look better that way.
A.O. Scott, Couch Potato Sometimes. But you might have to endure under-illuminated projection, muddy sound and the threat of bedbugs. Not to mention the distraction of texting, talking, screaming babies, loud popcorn-chompers or -- in the new, reserved-seating, cine-gastro-plexes -- the aroma of someone else's fish tacos. A decent flat screen can deliver a perfectly adequate, even superior, aesthetic experience -- one you can control.
A.O. Scott, Cinephile So you have to provide your own distractions. You can pause the picture, check your email, wander into the kitchen for a snack, fast-forward through the slow parts, switch over to the news. You're free to desecrate a work of art on your own terms, in the privacy of your own home.
A.O. Scott, Couch Potato But at least you have access to those works. You can feast on masterpieces of world cinema with your Criterion Channel subscription, on blockbusters and family movies with Disney Plus. Your television will be a universal cinematheque, a big-box video store with no late fees.
A.O. Scott, Cinephile Only subscription fees, which can add up in a hurry if you want that -- highly theoretical -- full menu of cinematic delicacies. The subscription model undermines that fantasy of universality. Imagine a video store that allowed you to rent only Warner Brothers movies. Imagine having to enroll in a corporate loyalty program, pledging allegiance to Disney or Sony or Netflix, and being forced to limit your choices accordingly.
The emerging streaming regime both restricts and expands access. Matt Zoller Seitz recently published a troubling article in Vulture about how Disney, newly in possession of the 20th Century Fox catalog, won't allow Fox titles to be screened in public. But why, as a simple economic matter, should companies in the streaming business undercut the value of their assets by letting nonsubscribers see them?
If that practice became the norm, if Netflix, Amazon and the studio-owned streamers kept their movies locked up on their platforms, what would happen to college film societies, museum film departments and repertory houses? This may seem like a minor issue, but revivals and retrospectives are part of how tastes are formed and history is made and revised.
A.O. Scott, Couch Potato On the other hand, what prevents devoted cinephiles from programming their own retrospectives?
A.O. Scott, Cinephile What encourages them? Streaming is built on the power of the algorithm, which inhibits risk and serendipity and creates an illusion of ease and comprehensiveness.
A.O. Scott, Couch Potato Why call it an illusion? It's surely the case that more movies are now available to more people in more places than before, at any time of day or night. You don't need to live near a campus or a museum or even an art house. You can queue up the complete works of your favorite auteur at six in the morning if you want to.
A.O. Scott, Cinephile Will you, though? Abundance can be its own kind of scarcity. Without a sense of occasion, without the idea that a given experience is special, even rare, all experiences become equivalent, and our attention follows the path of least resistance.
Going to the movies is a lark, and an adventure and a commitment. Watching television has historically been a more passive, less adventurous undertaking. It's about familiarity, comfort, the safety of your own couch or smartphone. Folding a sometimes difficult, often strange, occasionally sublime art form into that universe is a way of burying it.

Texto completo: LONDON — Police shot and killed a man wearing a fake bomb on London Bridge on Friday, after he fatally stabbed two people and wounded three others in what police called a terrorist incident, jolting Britain's capital two weeks before a general election and three days before world leaders were to gather here for a NATO summit.
The chaotic eruption of violence drew in several police officers and civilians, sent scores of panicked pedestrians fleeing from the bridge and nearby streets on both sides of the Thames, and evoked memories of an eerily similar terrorist attack on the same bridge in 2017 that killed eight people.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who halted his campaign to rush back to 10 Downing Street, declared that “this country will never be cowed or divided or intimidated by this sort of attack." He paid tribute to the bravery of the passersby who he said intervened to prevent further bloodshed.
Dramatic video posted on social media showed a crowd surrounding a man, whom they appeared to have tackled. As they wrestled with and held the man to the ground, at least three police officers responded with their guns drawn. One video depicted a man in a suit and overcoat holding a long knife that apparently had been taken from the attacker.
Police pulled the other people away from the man on the ground and then an officer appeared to fire at least one shot, hitting the man. The man died at the scene, police said.
Government officials said the man had previously been convicted of an Islamist terrorism-related offense, according to British media reports. He had been in prison and was released on condition that he wear an electronic tag, according to several reports. Police identified the suspect as Usman Khan, 28, and said that no other suspect was being sought.
“It has been declared a terrorist incident," said Neil Basu, assistant commissioner of the Metropolitan Police. “I must stress, however, that we retain an open mind as to any motive."
There were reports that the man was wearing an explosive device, Basu said, but police determined that it was “a hoax explosive device."
“What's remarkable about the images we've seen is the breathtaking heroism of members of the public who literally ran toward danger, not knowing what confronted them," said Mayor Sadiq Khan of London. It is not clear if the passersby who intervened saw the hoax explosive device and tackled him anyway.
On Friday evening, police reported that two people died after being stabbed and that three others remained injured.
A few hours after the London stabbing, an assailant stabbed three people Friday night in a busy shopping district in The Hague, and police were searching for the suspect, authorities said.
A Dutch police spokeswoman said it was too early to establish a motive for that attack.
The victims, all minors, were released from the hospital late Friday. It was unclear whether they might have been hurt when the crowds of holiday shoppers panicked.
The stabbing happened about 7:45 p.m., when a man attacked several people on the street. Investigators were “keeping every scenario open," police spokeswoman Marije Kuiper said.
The Netherlands was shocked by a similar stabbing in Amsterdam a year ago, when two Americans were wounded in a knife attack that prosecutors say had a "terrorist motive."
In London, meanwhile, the Metropolitan Police said that around 2 p.m., they responded to reports of a knife attack in Fishmongers' Hall, a grand Greek Revival building that sits just at the north end of London Bridge and is often used for events. On Friday, a criminal justice group whose members are former Cambridge University academics was meeting there.
A woman who said she was in the hall described an almost surreal scene, posting on Twitter that after the attack began, a man grabbed a 5-foot-long narwhal tusk from the wall and used it to confront the attacker.
Later, on the bridge, as the crowd was trying to subdue the assailant, bystanders captured images of a man standing with a long white pole, which the woman in the hall, Amy Coop, said was the narwhal tusk.
Videos posted on social media showed police vehicles blocking both sides of the roadway on London Bridge, one of the city's busiest arteries and a popular pedestrian crossing.
As police cordoned off the area, empty buses and abandoned vehicles remained parked on the bridge. In the nearby Borough Market, a food and drink space that is popular with tourists, visitors were told to shelter in place, before eventually being evacuated.
The incident bore a disquieting similarity to the 2017 attack on the bridge, in which a van careered onto the sidewalk, mowing down pedestrians, before three attackers leapt from the vehicle and struck people with knives. They killed eight people before being killed by police. Those men were also wearing fake suicide vests.
Earlier that year, a car plowed into pedestrians on nearby Westminster Bridge. Six people, including the attacker, were killed.
The 2017 London Bridge attack, which was carried out by three assailants inspired by the Islamic State group, came in the final weeks of Britain's last election, and it rapidly became a political issue. The Labour Party leader, Jeremy Corbyn, accused the prime minister at the time, Theresa May, of cutting the number of police officers in Britain.
The latest attack came only days before President Trump and other leaders are scheduled to visit the city for a NATO summit. On Tuesday, Queen Elizabeth II plans to hold a reception marking the alliance's 70th anniversary.
Those in the area around London Bridge described the panic in the moments after the attack.
Susan Vinn, 57, said that she had been outside her office shortly after 2 p.m., when she saw people running across the bridge and into her office lobby.
“It's horrible," she said of the attacks that have rattled London in recent years. “We know it's going to happen again, we just don't know when, so that keeps us worried for sure."

Weekly Trump Report Card: A Happy Thanksgiving for Trump

Texto completo: Our weekly White House report card finds President Trump in a good spot, thanks to his symbolic trip to serve Thanksgiving dinner to troops in Afghanistan, a strong stock market, signs of a final agreement on a North American trade pact, and consistent polling.
Democratic pollster John Zogby gave the president extra credit for traveling to see the troops in Afghanistan for the first time in grading the week with a C-.
Conservative analyst Jed Babbin added that he hopes the visit becomes a habit.
John Zogby
Grade C-
President Trump ended the week nicely by secretly flying to Afghanistan to visit and help serve dinner to the troops.
Tweet
He also took the opportunity to announce that his administration was talking peace with the Taliban. This comes as a growing number of military brass are expressing frustration and little confidence in Trump's national security and military policies.
At the same time, his polling numbers are down a little bit, and the House Judiciary Committee is preparing its case for impeachment. Black Friday sales were weak, and consumer confidence has taken a hit.
But I give him credit for the surprise trip and for the out-of-the-box announcement in Afghanistan.
Jed Babbin
Grade A
President Trump had a really good week in the polls, in Afghanistan and in signing a bill supporting pro-freedom demonstrators in Hong Kong.
It’s far too early to take any 2020 polls seriously, but this week’s New York Times poll made news because it shocked the Democrats. The poll found that many “Trumpocrats” — Rust Belt Democrats who supported Trump in 2016 and went back to voting Democratic in 2018 — are planning to vote for Trump again in 2020. That indicates both that the House impeachment proceedings, and the huge (dis)array of Democrat candidates, aren’t lighting fires under hitherto faithful supporters.
Tweet
Trump made his first trip to visit the troops in Afghanistan. The trip, designed so that he could help serve turkey to the troops on Thanksgiving, was long overdue. Trump had made a trip to visit troops in Iraq. The Afghanistan trip should become a habit for him.
Trump signed the “Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act,” signaling overdue support of the Hong Kong freedom demonstrators. Trump had hesitated over concerns that any signal from him supporting the demonstrators would negatively affect the ongoing trade negotiations with China. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has begun referring to Chinese President Xi Jinping as “Chinese leader Xi … ” in a minor but noticeable message that Trump doesn’t regard Xi as a legitimate leader.

Texto completo: This has been a golden age for brain research. We now have amazing brain scans that show which networks in the brain ramp up during different activities. But this emphasis on the brain has subtly fed the illusion that thinking happens only from the neck up. It’s fed the illusion that the advanced parts of our thinking are the “rational” parts up top that try to control the more “primitive” parts down below.
So it’s interesting how many scientists are now focusing on the thinking that happens not in your brain but in your gut. You have neurons spread through your innards, and there’s increasing attention on the vagus nerve, which emerges from the brain stem and wanders across the heart, lungs, kidney and gut.
The vagus nerve is one of the pathways through which the body and brain talk to each other in an unconscious conversation. Much of this conversation is about how we are relating to others. Human thinking is not primarily about individual calculation, but about social engagement and cooperation.
One of the leaders in this field is Stephen W. Porges of Indiana University. When you enter a new situation, Porges argues, your body reacts. Your heart rate may go up. Your blood pressure may change. Signals go up to the brain, which records the “autonomic state” you are in.
Maybe you walk into a social situation that feels welcoming. Green light. Your brain and body get prepared for a friendly conversation. But maybe the person in front of you feels threatening. Yellow light. You go into fight-or-flight mode. Your body instantly changes. Your ear, for example, adjusts to hear high and low frequencies — a scream or a growl — rather than midrange frequencies, human speech. Or maybe the threat feels like a matter of life and death. Red light. Your brain and body begin to shut down.
According to Porges’ “Polyvagal Theory,” the concept of safety is fundamental to our mental state. People who have experienced trauma have bodies that are highly reactive to perceived threat. They don’t like public places with loud noises. They live in fight-or-flight mode, stressed and anxious. Or, if they feel trapped and constrained, they go numb. Their voice and tone go flat. Physical reactions shape our way of seeing and being.
Lisa Feldman Barrett, of Northeastern University, also argues that a main purpose of the brain is to read the body, and to regulate what she calls the body budget. You may see a bully on the playground. Your brain then predicts your next action and speeds your heart rate and breathing to deal with it. You experience these changes as emotion — oh, this is fear or oh, this is anger — because your brain has created an emotion concept to make those physical changes meaningful.
“You might think that in everyday life, the things you see and hear influence what you feel, but it’s mostly the other way around: What you feel alters your sight and hearing,” Barrett writes in “How Emotions Are Made.”
When we’re really young we know few emotion concepts. Young children say, “Mommy, I hate you!” when they mean “I don’t like this” because they haven’t learned their culture’s concepts for hatred vs. badness. But as we get older we learn more emotional granularity. The emotionally wise person can create distinct experiences of disappointment, anger, spite, resentment, grouchiness and aggravation, whereas for a less emotionally wise person those are all synonyms for “I feel bad.”
A wise person may know the foreign words that express emotions we can’t name in English: tocka (Russian, roughly, for spiritual anguish) or litost (Czech, roughly, for misery combined with the hunger for revenge). People with high emotional granularity respond flexibly to life, have better mental health outcomes and drink less.
If bodily reactions can drive people apart, they can also heal. Martha G. Welch of Columbia University points to the importance of loving physical touch, especially in the first 1,000 minutes of life, to lay down markers of emotional stability.
Under the old brain-only paradigm, Welch argues, we told people to self-regulate their emotions through conscious self-talk. But real emotional help comes through co-regulation. When a mother and a child physically hold each other, their bodily autonomic states harmonize, connecting on a metabolic level. Together they move from separate distress to mutual calm.
Welch has created something called the Welch Emotional Connection Screen, which measures the emotional connection between mothers and preterm babies. By encouraging this kind of deep visceral connection through 18 months, her therapy can mitigate the effects of autism.
When you step back and see the brain and body thinking together, the old distinction between reason and emotion doesn’t seem to make sense. Your very perception of the world is shaped by the predictions your brain is making about your physical autonomic states.
You also see how important it is to teach emotional granularity, something our culture pays almost no attention to.
You also see that we’re not separate brains, coolly observing each other. We’re physical viscera, deeply interacting with each other. The important communication is happening at a much deeper level.

Study: MRIs Work To Detect Tumors In Women With Dense Tissue

Texto completo: Many women who have mammograms get normal results that come with a caveat: They are told they have dense breast tissue, which can make their scans harder to read and could leave cancer undetected.
Sometimes those patients are advised to follow up by getting ultrasounds or MRI scans, but for many, it is unclear what their next step should be.
Now, a new study provides strong evidence that supplemental MRIs are more effective in finding tumors in these women than mammograms alone.
The study, of more than 40,000 women with extremely dense breasts in the Netherlands, found that those who had mammograms followed by MRIs had more tumors detected than with mammography alone. The research also found that those who had MRIs were less likely to find a cancerous lump in between routine screenings; by the time tumors are big enough to be felt, they tend to be more advanced.
The study, the first large randomized controlled trial of supplemental MRIs in women with dense breasts, was published in the New England Journal of Medicine on Wednesday.
A common problem
Just under half of women over the age of 40 have dense breasts, which means their breasts have more connective and fibrous tissue than usual and relatively less fat. Women with dense breast tissue have a higher risk of developing breast cancer than women with more fatty breast tissue.
Dr. Wendie Berg, a professor of radiology at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine and chief scientific adviser for DenseBreast-info.org, said the study’s finding were “very important.”
“The standard practice of mammography alone is not adequate for women with extremely dense breasts,” Berg said, adding that her own cancer was detected early enough to require minimal treatment because her family history led her to seek an MRI.
“Women should be advocating for increased access to screening MRI,” she said.
But though the study results were significant, it is still unclear whether supplementing mammograms with MRIs ultimately reduces breast cancer deaths.
Matter of survival
“The ultimate test of the value of MRI screening” in these women will be “whether it improves survival - an answer that we will not have for a very long time,” cautioned Dr. Dan L. Longo, a deputy editor of the New England Journal and professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, in an editorial accompanying the study.
For all the promise, there is also a downside to using MRIs for breast cancer screening: They yield many false positive results that lead to unnecessary biopsies, and they can detect very early stage tumors that might never become life-threatening, said Carla van Gils, senior author of the study and a professor of clinical epidemiology at University Medical Center Utrecht.
Lifesaving tool
Nevertheless, van Gils said, the significant reduction in interval cancers - cancers that are diagnosed after a negative mammogram - suggests supplementary MRIs may be a lifesaving tool for women with dense breasts.
“It’s not the same as mortality, but it’s the first step. It’s a prerequisite,” she said, adding that the study is ongoing, and mathematical models will be run to make further predictions about mortality and overdiagnosis. “There are more questions that need to be answered.”
Only about 10% of women have extremely dense tissue like the women in the Dutch study. But having dense breast tissue generally makes it harder to see tumors on a mammogram because both the dense tissue and the tumors show up white on an X-ray. Fat, on the other hand, shows up black, so tumors are easily seen.
Many states now require that women having mammograms be informed that their breast tissue is dense when they get the results, and the Food and Drug Administration is developing similar guidelines. But there is little to no guidance on what women given the information should do about it. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists does not recommend routine use of additional tests after mammography in women who do not have symptoms or other risk factors, though many patients are referred for a supplemental scan.

Texto completo: In recent years there has been debate about when a decade begins and ends. We break it down for you.
Oh, to revel in New Year's Eve. Cheer with good friends! A glass of Champagne or two. And, this year, ringing in a new decade.
Oh, wait. Are we?
In recent years there has been debate about when a decade begins and ends. For some people, the next decade will begin on Jan. 1, 2020, and end on Dec. 31, 2029. For others, it won't start until Jan. 1, 2021, concluding on Dec. 31, 2030. To the average person -- well, many of us -- it can be very confusing. But what is correct? Should we celebrate the beginning of a new decade now or wait until next year, when it seems a little passé?
We decided to break it down for readers. We talked to an expert at the United States Naval Observatory, which runs the nation's master clock. We interviewed an editor at the Farmers' Almanac. We even talked to a curator of astrophysics.
There is one thing almost everyone agreed on. "Talking about it is a great way to get into a bar fight," said Geoff Chester, an astronomer and a public affairs officer at the observatory.
Why is this a controversy?
First, a little history. In 1999, people got into a spat over when the new millennium began. At the center of the dispute was the Naval Observatory, whose calculations of time influence government satellites, your iPhone and more. The agency's position was that the new millennium began on Jan. 1, 2001, Mr. Chester said. That's because the observatory uses a modification of the Julian date to measure time. The modified system is used by astronomers and geodesists, who study the size of the Earth. (The original Julian date begins Jan. 1, 4713 B.C.)
So that settled it, right?
Not so fast. In 525, a monk named Dionysius Exiguus wanted to pinpoint the date for Easter. So he devised a calendar system called anno Domini, which was based on when he believed Jesus was born. A.D., which is Latin for "the year of our Lord," is commonly used today. One glitch: Because it identified the date of Jesus' birth as Year 1, not Year 0, there is a time gap, Mr. Chester said. There is a lot of debate about this online, but timeanddate.com, which studies such things, has a good explanation.
Because of this, many people insisted the new millennium began on Jan. 1, 2000. It was widely debated and everyone had something to say. Mr. Chester, who was at the center of the kerfuffle back in 1999, sighed when asked to explain the different dates. "It's one of those things where numbers don't satisfy everybody," he said.
Did the debate make it easier to understand when a new decade begins?
Yes and no. Unlike the definition of daylight saving time, the definition of a decade is not governed by legal guidelines. But the debate got people talking. Mordecai-Mark Mac Low, a curator in the department of astrophysics at the American Museum of Natural History, said, "There are two different ways to designate decades."
First, there is the modified Julian date. But, he added, "people work with language more than numbers." The second way is to designate decades by popular convention and usage. An example? Most people would say the 1950s went from 1950 to 1959.
"People want simple answers," Dr. Mac Low said. "But the answer is not always simple."
Mr. Chester agreed. "There is no absolute," he said.
So what is the answer?
Using a modified Julian date, the 2020s will begin on Jan. 1, 2021, Dr. Mac Low said.
But that is out of sync with common usage. According to Emily Brewster, a senior editor at Merriam-Webster, a decade in popular culture is not defined by scientific convention. Because of this, the 2020s will begin on Jan. 1, 2020, and end on Dec. 31, 2029, Ms. Brewster said.
"It is interesting that there is this arbitrariness," she said. "It's unconventional, like language."
So I can still throw an end-of-the-decade party in December, right?
Most definitely. Indeed, people have already begun celebrating the end of the 2010s. "This could be a great controversy," said Peter Geiger, editor of the Farmers' Almanac. "Or maybe it's really just a great diversion."

Texto completo: Teddy Roosevelt banned a paper for alleging his kids tormented the fowl
Just before Thanksgiving in 1904, the Boston Herald served up some shocking news: Two of President Theodore Roosevelt's younger children had chased the presidential dinner turkey around the back lawn of the White House, pulling feathers from the frightened bird as Roosevelt looked on with great amusement.
But was this turkey of a story true? The controversy raged on until nearly Christmas. Over the years, the story has become the stuffing that Thanksgiving legends are made of.
The legend began when the Herald's White House reporter wrote that young Ethel and Quentin Roosevelt 'have a new plaything.' It was the 30-pound Rhode Island turkey delivered for the first family's Thanksgiving table. The big bird was kept in a cage, but the children 'wanted it loose and free.' When the gobbler was released, 'they chased the turkey all over the White House grounds, plucking it, yelling and laughing until the bird was well nigh exhausted. The President witnessed part of the proceedings and laughed.'
The next day, a Herald columnist named 'The Chatterer' opined: 'Apparently the Roosevelt children are chips off the old block and possess their full share of juvenile irresponsibleness. But why should they be allowed to torment and frighten an innocent turkey?'
Roosevelt didn't see the articles until the Wednesday after Thanksgiving. After returning from a trip to St. Louis, he found the clippings on his desk. He carried them into a Cabinet meeting, where he angrily declared the turkey story was a canard. Agriculture Secretary James 'Tama Jim' Wilson, who grew up on a farm, noted that it was impossible to pluck feathers from a running turkey. Roosevelt said it was even harder in this case because his Thanksgiving turkey was dead on arrival and dressed for the roasting pan. Roosevelt closed the meeting by declaring that he 'intended to stop newspaper stories of that kind.'
At 6 p.m., Roosevelt's secretary, William Loeb Jr., issued a typewritten statement that 'No such incident as that recited in the Herald has ever taken place since the president has been in the White House.'
A second, live turkey had been shipped in from Milwaukee, Loeb said, but it was never released from its cage before being freed at a bucolic barnyard in New York's Oyster Bay. The turkey story, Loeb said, 'marks the culmination of a long series of similar falsehoods, usually malicious and always deliberate, which have appeared in the news columns of the Boston Herald.' As a result, its reporter was barred from the White House, and all federal departments were ordered to stop providing news information to the Herald.
The Herald responded with what one newspaper called an apology that was 'a trifle sarcastic.' The Herald said: 'It is always with keen regret that the management of the Herald finds that it has been the means of circulating statements which have no foundation in truth.' The turkey story came from a supposedly reliable source, but 'candor compels us to say that it was not worth telegraphing.' The paper added that Roosevelt also has made statements in error.
Many newspapers sided with Roosevelt as an aggrieved father who was the victim of 'fowl' play. 'We are very much in sympathy with the indignant attitude of the president regarding the fake story,' the St. Paul Globe in Minnesota wrote. 'Mr. Roosevelt is distinctly a family man. It is an outrage that a public man should be pilloried through his children.'
The Buffalo Commercial commented, 'There is no excuse for printing and circulating reporters' rot of that sort because any intelligent person knows that the president is tender-hearted and detests cruelty to animals as he does cowardness.'
A columnist for the Charleston Post in South Carolina, writing with tongue in cheek, argued that the punishment of the Herald correspondent was 'way too mild. The Boston reporter should have been tried by court martial and condemned to be shot from the mouth of a cannon on the Washington Monument.'
Not all of the newspapers supported Roosevelt's actions. 'Nobody can blame the president for being irritated at the publication of such a story,' the New York Times editorialized. 'But the executive vengeance goes . . . entirely too far. This is all wrong, in addition to being perfectly un-American.'
The controversy escalated in early December when overzealous officials at the U.S. Weather Bureau in Boston refused to provide the Herald with government weather maps and forecasts for the Boston area. As one observer put it: 'Meanwhile the readers of the paper may find out when it is raining by looking out their windows.'
This time, even many Roosevelt supporters came down against the president. 'The denial by the United States weather bureau of the daily reports to the Boston Herald was an outrage on the people as well as on the public press,' said the New Orleans Times-Picayune.
'The Herald's offense was petty, the president should not permit himself to use a battleship to crush a codfish,' chided the Louisville Courier-Journal. The Newburyport Herald in Massachusetts scolded: 'The story was silly and the order of the President sillier.' Added one wag: 'This is very light punishment at the hands of the president. Just think, he might have shut the weather itself off.'
Roosevelt quickly rescinded the Weather Bureau ban, saying his order had been 'misconstrued.' But the government boycott of the Herald in Washington remained. The controversy continued to be front-page news well into December, overshadowing even a report that a two-headed baby had been born in Boston. And the comments about the anti-Herald orders grew more serious.
'If this principle is to be adopted and sustained, it will obviously be possible for the president of the United States to dictate to any newspaper' whom they shall employ 'in the work of gathering news concerning the government in Washington,' said the Manchester Union in New Hampshire. And 'that means censorship and nothing else.'
Finally, on the day after Christmas, the Chicago Tribune published this one-line news story: 'There were no White House turkey stories in the esteemed Boston Herald yesterday.'
The controversy disappeared from the news pages as apparently the White House quietly returned to normal press practices. Another Roosevelt 'big stick' policy had made its point. In the case of the fake turkey story, the policy might be called, 'Speak softly and carry a big drumstick.'

Mark Buffalo, Todd Haynes go deep in 'Dark Waters'
With "Dark Waters," Mark Ruffalo decided to make something more than an awards-season "issue" movie.
"It was a very straightforward whodunnit, whistleblower film," he said in a recent phone conversation with The Examiner, "but I was craving something more."
So the three-time Oscar nominee signed on as producer of the film, opening Friday, which is based on a 2016 New York Times Magazine article by Nathaniel Rich about Cincinnati lawyer Rob Bilott.
Ruffalo plays Bilott, who works for a firm that defends chemical companies, then changes allegiances after being approached by Wilbur Tennant (Bill Camp), a farmer who tells him something is killing his cattle.
Bilott decides to investigate, little knowing he's opening a can of worms that would result in years of legal wrangling.
It comes down to a dangerous, unregulated chemical used by the DuPont company known to cause cancer and other illnesses; the "forever chemical" can't be broken down by the human body, and, even worse, 99% of humans now have it in their systems.
Ruffalo hired director Todd Haynes, best known for colorful, dark soap operas "Far from Heaven" and "Carol," but also the maker of 1995's "Safe," one of the all-time great movies about sickness.
"The more I imagined the movie and what I wanted to see from it, I started drifting toward his films [about] these marginalized people living in these oppressive systems, an uneasy feeling lurking on the edges, and the madness of it." says Ruffalo, adding, "I wanted it to be as honest as possible because it's such an important story and these people's lives are so important to me."
A big challenge was Bilott's character. Far from a typical movie hero, he's modest, guarded and even dispassionate in his approach. Ruffalo, who spent a great deal of time with Bilott, found it difficult to get the lawyer to say much about himself.
"That's not typical to these kinds of characters in these kinds of movies, and it was a little scary at times to play it that way, but it works in a different way than if we had done it big," says Ruffalo, who consulted Bilott on how to approach a a deposition scene with a DuPont CEO.
Ruffalo says the attorney wasn't trying to shame the executive, but simply trying to get him to see the facts and perhaps do the right thing.
"Even after 20 years, and even after his career tanked and his health and his family suffered, [Bilott] never stopped believing in people's ability to do the right thing. He had every chance to step off, but he never gave up. I just found that to be so moving," says Ruffalo.
Ruffalo has nothing but praise for his costars, including scene-stealing Anne Hathaway, Tim Robbins, Bill Pullman, Victor Garber and Camp.
"The cast is amazing. It's a class A!," he laughs.
The cast also features Bucky Bailey, who was born with facial deformities after his mother, a DuPont employee, was exposed to the chemical. A photo of young Bailey is shown during the deposition scene; then Haynes shows the real, grown-up Bailey in another scene. It's a great moment, and a game-changer.
The scene was shot the last day of shooting. It was brutally cold, and everyone was exhausted, but when Bailey finished, the crew was sobbing.
"It was so beautiful," says Ruffalo. "We realized what this whole thing we were making really meant."

Texto completo: Rain, snow and winds across the United States are disrupting travel on one of the busiest days of the year and threatening to keep Thanksgiving Day parade balloons from flying.
Two large storms are causing widespread travel problems as close to 55 million people are expected to take to the roads and air, according to the AAA website. Areas around Denver, Colorado, received 8 to 12-inches of snow, causing treacherous road conditions, accidents, closures and the cancellation of almost 500 flights Wednesday.
In New York City, winds could reach 25 miles per hour (mph) on Thursday, threatening to ground the massive balloons traditional to the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade.


New York has regulations that have been in place since 1997 that will determine whether the balloons, which can be as high as 60 feet and are handled by ground crews holding ropes, will be allowed to fly. The rules ban flight in sustained winds of 23-mph, or with gusts of 34 mph, according to the New York Times.

‘The Daily Show’ host Trevor Noah will bring his Loud &amp; Clear Tour to Staples Center

Texto completo: Southern California has always had a special place in the heart of Trevor Noah. The 35-year-old South African writer, producer, comedian, political commentator, actor and current host of Comedy Central’s “The Daily Show,” first cut his teeth in some of the area’s smaller comedy clubs and theaters.
After starting out in 100 to 300-capacity rooms, Noah graduated to 1,000 to 3,000-capacity theaters and eventually worked his way up to selling out the 8,000-capacity Pacific Amphitheatre in Costa Mesa in 2018. His latest stand-up outing, dubbed The Loud & Clear Tour, is now playing out in arenas across the country and Noah will return to Southern California to headline Staples Center in Downtown Los Angeles Friday, Dec. 6.
“I’ve been lucky that California has been one of the places where I’ve had a lot of support from the days of having like a really tiny following,” Noah said during a recent interview as he was also in the midst of taping “The Daily Show” back in New York. “It has been a really wonderful, sort of gradual celebration that just keeps growing. That’s the only way I can look at this show (at Staples Center) because otherwise it becomes overwhelming and you start worrying too much about the size of the show as opposed to the quality of the show.”
Despite hosting a television show where the primary topic is to analyze and report on politics, Noah said that’s not what his comedy show is. He’s said in previous interviews that he doesn’t talk about those things, including the President of the United States, so specifically but speaks rather generally when it comes to getting political.
“The live comedy audience has always been more diverse and also more broad in their taste,” he said. “‘The Daily Show’ is obviously a show based around politics and news and not everybody wants to live in that world, which I completely understand. But when it comes to stand-up, I’ve been really lucky. I have Republicans come to my shows and they’ll say ‘Hey, I love your stand-up … I don’t like your political views, but I love coming to your stand-up shows.’ That’s fine with me. I don’t think we have to agree with each other on everything, but I like that we can still all laugh together as people. I’ve always enjoyed that people of all ages, all religions, ethnicities and politics affiliations come to the shows. I want you to have fun whether you come with your mom and dad, boyfriend or girlfriend, your siblings, your friends … I just want you to have a good time. It’s not a show designed for one specific person, it’s designed for everybody.”
Doing the stand-up tour gives Noah a break from the 24/7 news cycle and all the commotion and breaking news that comes with ongoing impeachment hearings and the ramping up of yet another election year.
“It is a nice break and I think people should take that break in life, too,” he said. “People always ask me, ‘How do you cope with Trump all the time?’ It’s not healthy and I only deal with it during the day while making a show that’s 30 minutes long. If you engage in politics for 30 minutes a day, that’s more than enough to get all of the information you need since most of it is repetitive anyway. You don’t have to live in it and I try not to. I understand how important it is to our world and I give it the attention it deserves, but I also make sure to go live my life as a human being, too.”
On top of working on his stand-up material, Noah said he also listens to a lot of music. Nothing specific at the moment, but he said he’s a sucker for a good playlist on Spotify or Tidal. He picked up and is currently reading the new Prince biography, “The Beautiful Ones,” which was released in late October. He also said that if he had to choose between either being on “The Masked Singer” or “Dancing With the Stars,” he’d pick “The Masked Singer.”
“Because I’d be covered the entire time and my embarrassment is limited to when I have to take my mask off,” he said with a laugh. “I don’t think people would know it was me based on how badly or how well I could sing, which is nice.”
Noah has already accomplished a lot in his lifetime. He’s obviously got a successful stand-up career and daily TV show, but his book “Born a Crime: Stories from a South African Childhood,” became a New York Times Bestseller and his “Son of Patricia” special and album is nominated in the best comedy category at the 62nd Annual Grammy Awards, which will be held Jan. 26 at Staples Center.
“I live a very strange life in that I’ve never been too worried about the distant future,” Noah said. “I just try to focus on what I’m doing now and try to do it to the best of my ability and I found that serves me well. Right now, all I’m focused on is the Loud & Clear Tour and ‘The Daily Show,’ just making sure I put together a great show on TV every night and making sure that the stand-up is a world-class comedy experience. Once that’s all done, I’ll focus on the next thing. The last thing I want to do is start focusing too far into the future and tripping on the thing that’s right in front of me.”

Bruce Ohr faces criticism in Russia investigation review

Texto completo: The Justice Department watchdog is expected to criticize DOJ official Bruce Ohr for meeting with Trump dossier author Christopher Steele after the FBI cut the former MI6 agent off as a source.
The FBI severed ties with Steele in the fall of 2016 because of improper leaks to the media, but Ohr acted as an unofficial conduit between Steele and the bureau during the Trump-Russia investigation up until at least November 2017.
A draft of Inspector General Michael Horowitz's forthcoming report shows Horowitz will condemn Ohr for not informing his superiors of his interactions with Steele, according to the New York Times.
Ohr was the fourth-ranking official at the DOJ until he was demoted after it came to light that he met with Steele and Glenn Simpson, the co-founder of the opposition research firm Fusion GPS, which commissioned Steele's work. Ohr’s wife Nellie Ohr also worked for Fusion GPS in 2016.
Documents show he was removed from his position as associate deputy attorney general in December 2017. In January 2018, he lost his position as director of the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force and shifted to counselor for international affairs in the Criminal Division.
Ohr testified last year to a joint task force of the House Judiciary and Oversight committees looking into alleged bias by the FBI and the DOJ about how he unilaterally decided not to inform his direct superior, Sally Yates, of the unofficial back channel.
[RELATED: DOJ watchdog expected to criticize FBI for excluding 'game changer' material from FISA application]
According to a transcript released in March, Ohr said it was a "regular practice" for him to make direct contact with the FBI with information about organized crime over the years and, while he wasn't serving as an investigator or prosecutor for an FBI case, he felt that providing the bureau "source lead information" from Steele was "overall part of my job." While the GOP investigators hounded Bruce Ohr for not notifying Yates, the Democratic side drove home the point that Ohr didn't violate any DOJ policy.
Steele's research, which contained unverified allegations about President Trump's ties to Russia, was used by the FBI to obtain warrants to wiretap former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page.
Republicans have alleged the FBI and the Justice Department misled the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court about the dossier's Democratic benefactors, Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign and the Democratic National Committee, and that Steele's anti-Trump bias was left out of the FISA applications. Democrats argue the Justice Department and the FBI met the rigor, transparency, and evidentiary basis for probable cause.

Horowitz recently wrapped up a year-and-a-half investigation examining the DOJ's and the FBI's compliance with legal requirements and policies in applications filed to the FISA Court during the Trump-Russia investigation.
According to leaks about the draft report, Horowitz is expected to condemn the FBI for failing to inform the judges on the FISA Court of potential problems with the dossier. The inspector general is also said to have found no evidence of political bias by top officials tainting the Russia investigation. His investigators did find that an FBI lawyer, identified as Kevin Clinesmith, allegedly altered a document related to the surveillance of Page but determined Clinesmith's actions did not taint the overall validity of a renewal application.
His final report is slated to be released on Dec. 9, and two days later Horowitz is scheduled to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee about his investigation.

Texto completo: The Associated Press
SUNRISE, Fla. - President Donald Trump on Tuesday night slammed the news media while telling a Florida audience that the impeachment inquiry has gone quite well for him over the past two weeks.
Trump was holding a re-election rally in Sunrise, before spending Thanksgiving at his nearby resort.
He was talking about the hearings held by the House Intelligence panel, which has been looking at whether Trump leveraged his office for personal political gain.
Trump told the crowd, "We won these last two weeks so solidly." But he said anyone who read The New York Times or The Washington Post "would have no idea we won."
He added that the inquiry will help Republicans in 2020.
"I think it's going to just walk us right through that election," the president said.
Trump also assuring the Florida crowd that he's not going to change the name of Thanksgiving.
Trump said that "some people want to change the name Thanksgiving, they don't want to use the term Thanksgiving."
He also said that's true of Christmas, but "now everybody is using Christmas again."
Trump said people have different ideas about what to call the holiday. But he knows those attending the rally love the name Thanksgiving. "And we're not changing it," he said.

Texto completo: As the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade nears, Thursday's forecast still leaves the decision on flying the balloons up in the air.
Parade officials will be closely monitoring the wind speeds on Thursday morning and said they will ultimately make the decision on whether the balloons will be part of the festive procession right before the parade begins.
Leading up to the 9 a. m. EST start time of the parade, winds will be nearing 21 mph with gusts approaching 39 mph, according to the National Weather Service. Under New York City regulations, winds over 23 mph and gusts over 34 mph call for the balloons to be grounded. The regulations were passed after a windy Thanksgiving in 1997 when a "Cat in the Hat" balloon knocked down a lighting pole, injuring four people.
"On Parade morning, Macy’s works closely with the NYPD, who, based on the current weather data and the official regulations, determine if the balloons will fly and at what heights," Macy's Spokesman Orlando Veras said in the statement. "Each is designed to fly at different heights and angles based on their shape and scale and the exact wind conditions along the route. "
The only previous time the balloons were grounded was in 1971, according to The New York Times.
Earlier this month, the balloons in question were tested at Metlife Stadium in East Rutherford to ensure that they are able to fly safely.

Texto completo: Despite losing to the Seattle Seahawks on Sunday to remain a game behind the Dallas Cowboys in the NFC East, the Philadelphia Eagles (5-6) retained control of their playoff fate when the Cowboys (6-5) were beaten four hours later by the New England Patriots.
Though they keep falling further behind in the race for one of the NFC's two wild-card spots, the Eagles will win the division if they win out to finish 10-6. The Cowboys also can finish as high as 10-6 (if the Eagles beat them in next month's rematch) but would lose out on the title because of the league's third division tiebreaker: record against common opponents.
The New York Times' weekly probability chart has dropped the Eagles chances of making the playoffs from 39% to 33%.
A wild-card berth is just about out of reach. Besides the Cowboys, six NFC teams have better records than the Eagles: San Francisco (10-1), Seattle (9-2), New Orleans (9-2), Green Bay (8-3), Minnesota (8-3) and the Los Angeles Rams (6-5). Of those teams, the Eagles have beaten Green Bay but lost to Seattle and Minnesota.
The Eagles hope to get injured wide receivers Alshon Jeffery (ankle) and Nelson Agholor (knee), running back Jordan Howard (stinger) and right tackle Lane Johnson (concussion) back.
All were sidelined for the Patriots game, and right guard Brandon Brooks joined them soon after it began because of an anxiety condition that flared up and made him physically ill. Brooks said Tuesday that he doesn't expect to miss any more time.
The Eagles have made the playoffs in each of the previous two seasons.

Texto completo: You might have already seen Andrew Scrivani's photographs in The New York Times Food section or in any number of magazines. And you've probably stopped to look closely, because even though they seem relatively unadorned, they're bathed in beautiful light, sometimes in a dark, moody photo and other times in a bright white one. And like all good photographers, he uses light to tell a story.
Scrivani's new “That Photo Makes Me Hungry: Photographing Food for Fun & Profit" (The Countryman Press, $24.95) is for every blogger who wants to get better, every baker who wonders why the photo doesn't look as good as the confection, every amateur longing to improve, and many professionals who know cameras and lighting but not food.
This photographer likes something happening in his pictures, like a ripe center of cheese oozing out or chopsticks picking up noodles. A photo of a T-bone steak shows the very rare beef cut off the bone, the edge of the knife that cut it, and the bone bare of meat. Red juices have spilled onto the cutting board and it looks like it's really delicious. “When people tell me that my pictures make them hungry," he writes, “I feel like I did my job."
In a series of six photos showing a stack of brownies, Scrivani does an exercise in which one photo has a silver reflector but no white card to bounce some light on the dark squares, then another has silver and white, another silver and black, and so on. It's the sort of thing amateur photographers do all the time and it's gratifying to see that we're not crazy.
He's also got food styling tips (“When you have to choose between delicious and delicious-looking, you must default to the latter"); a peek into his own studio (“I have a few hundred different table surfaces"); and advice for making a living from your photos (“Never, ever give it away").
Scrivani is a huge talent in the field and he's very generous with sensible advice on all aspects of his trade. The book will either make you want to go out and photograph everything you possibly can, or get under the covers because you can't ever be this good. Hopefully the former.

Texto completo: Readers criticize President Trump's failing policy.
To the Editor:
Re "Mr. Trump's Lose-Lose Proposition in Korea" (editorial, Nov. 22):
The failure of the most recent round of talks between the United States and South Korea on how to equitably share the costs of American troops on the peninsula is dangerous to the future of this crucial alliance, which has kept the peace in Northeast Asia for more than six decades. The alliance has also underpinned South Korea's prosperity and fostered trade and investment relations increasingly beneficial to America.
South Korea is not a free rider. It bolstered military expenditures 7 percent in 2018, reaching $ 43.1 billion, or 2.6 percent of gross domestic product, a level greater than any other major American ally. And South Korea receives zero foreign military aid from American taxpayers while 80 percent of its arms purchases are of American weapons.
The United States' request that South Korea shoulder more of its defense burden is reasonable. But the ask should be fair and transparent.
South Korean public opinion remains broadly optimistic about our two countries' relations, and Congress staunchly supports the alliance. Its value cannot be reduced to a nearsighted balance-sheet calculation by either side.
Thomas Byrne
New York
The writer is president of the Korea Society. To the Editor:
President Trump's failing Korea policy could be saved with some of Dwight D. Eisenhower's ideas.
Ike's open skies plan -- joint aerial inspection missions -- would benefit North and South Korea. These flights over each other's territory would improve transparency and cooperation between the two rivals. This is based on the Open Skies Treaty, which Mr. Trump is wrongly trying to eliminate.
Another Eisenhower idea, ending nuclear weapons testing, would also help ease tensions on the Korean Peninsula. The Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, which bans all nuclear test explosions, should be ratified by the United States along with North Korea and China.
These two arms control steps would be powerful symbols of peace and improve cooperation among rival countries. We need steppingstones toward a disarmament agreement.

Texto completo: Readers discuss the former mayor's candidacy, Barack Obama's advice and Joe Biden's slumping poll numbers.
To the Editor:
Re "In Muted Campaign Kickoff, Bloomberg Shows How Money Talks" (news article, Nov. 26):
A message to Tom Steyer and Michael Bloomberg: Instead of pursuing your personal quest to be president, why don't you do something truly useful and indeed heroic? Commit the time and money you would have spent on the campaign instead working to oust Donald Trump from the White House and secure a Senate majority for Democrats.
Work together, form an organization and use your combined wealth to save our democracy.

To the Editor:
Re "Bloomberg Hits Democratic Presidential Race Running to the Center" (news article, Nov. 25):
I believe that Michael Bloomberg may appeal to potential crossover Republicans. As a lifelong Republican I find that our current president represents very few of my long-held beliefs. There are many Republicans around the country with the same view. Whether it is immigration, climate change or income inequality, we want solutions that are fair and humane. The current president will not provide this.
On the Democratic side, plans presented by Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders are much too far to the left for voters like me to support. Mr. Bloomberg, a former Republican, will hopefully present a middle ground that both Republicans and Democrats can support.

To the Editor:
Re "Obama Urges Democrats to Place More of a Focus on Defeating Trump" (news article, Nov. 22):
When Democrats try to look less "left" by choosing a centrist candidate, they are making the mistake they always make -- playing it "safe" in their view. "Safe" will not win this election. To win they will need lots of people to go door to door, to show enthusiastic support of the Democrats, to get others out to vote.
There are the usual Dems who will vote for Joe Biden, but the only candidates running who can increase the turnout of everyone else are Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, regardless of their health plans.

To the Editor:
Re "Biden Is Lagging in Iowa, and for Some Supporters, the Thrill Is Gone" (news article, Nov. 25):
Of course Joe Biden is slipping in the polls -- thanks to the smear campaign against him and his son by President Trump's lackeys, liars and crooks.
And support for the impeachment of Mr. Trump remains flat in the polls, despite the overwhelming facts and evidence against him -- thanks to the Trump-Republican-Fox Noise propaganda machine.
The battle for truth and democracy is far from over. America has what some have termed "truth decay." We need a good dentist in the White House.

Hassan, Shaheen may be in VP mix

Texto completo: It's been more than 140 years since a politician from New Hampshire served as the nation's vice president.

If the political stars align just right, it's possible that dry spell will be over.
At a campaign event in Iowa, former Vice President Joe Biden was asked about a potential running mate if he wins the Democratic nomination.
He suggested four people without naming names and two of them are from the Granite State.
“I could start naming people but the press will think that's who I picked,” Biden said, according to a report in the Des Moines Register.
Biden's vice presidential list included “the former assistant attorney general who got fired,” referring to Sally Yates; “the woman who should have been the governor of Georgia,” referring to Stacey Abrams; and “the two senators from the state of New Hampshire,” referring to U.S. Sens. Jeanne Shaheen and Maggie Hassan, according to the Register.
If Biden, in fact, becomes the Democratic nominee and holds true to his all-female list, the eventual vice president would become the third woman from the two major political parties to vie to be vice president. The other two women were Sarah Palin – John McCain's running mate in 2008; and Geraldine Ferraro – the running mate of Michael Dukakis in 1984.
Yates served as deputy attorney general during the final two years of the Obama administration and became acting attorney general once Donald Trump was inaugurated. She was fired by Trump after she said the Justice Department would not enforce an immigration ban from seven predominately Muslim nations.
Abrams served in the Georgia House of Representatives from 2007 to 2017 and unsuccessfully ran for governor in 2018. She narrowly lost the election and never conceded because of alleged voter suppression. She told the New York Times she would be open to accepting a vice-presidential nod.
Shaheen is New Hampshire's senior senator and is currently seeking a third term in the 2020 election. Before going to Washington, she served three terms as governor from 1997 to 2003.
Hassan was a two-term governor of the Granite State from 2013 to 2017 and beat Kelly Ayotte to gain her Senate seat in 2016.
“Senator Hassan is flattered to be mentioned, but believes that the biggest impact that she can make for the people of New Hampshire is serving as a U.S. Senator,” her spokeswoman Laura Epstein said Monday.
The only vice president from New Hampshire was Henry Wilson, who served from 1873–75 under President Ulysses S. Grant. Wilson was a senator from Massachusetts but was born in Farmington, New Hampshire. Wilson served nearly 20 years after Franklin Pierce's single term as U.S. president.
In Iowa, Biden went on to say the most important thing a presidential candidate can do is to pick a running mate who is capable and shares common political ground, according to the Register.
The staff for Shaheen declined to comment.
Such a move would open new possibilities for Ayotte, a  former New Hampshire Attorney General who has moved back into the private sector. Ayotte remains at the center of speculation that she will run for the Senate at some point.

Texto completo: The Supreme Court refused on Monday to shield two conservative writers from being sued for defamation by a climate change expert whom they accused of having "molested and tortured data in the service of politicized science."
Over a dissent by Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr., the high court cleared the way for Penn State professor Michael Mann to sue the National Review and the conservative Competitive Enterprise Institute for having compared him to former Penn State football coach Jerry Sandusky, who was imprisoned for sexual abuse. Both had been investigated by the university.
In his 2012 article, columnist Mark Steyn said that in Mann's case, as with Sandusky and football legend Joe Paterno, who was also involved in the sex-abuse scandal, Penn State "declined to find one of its star names guilty of any wrongdoing." His comment repeated the words of an online columnist at the Competitive Enterprise Institute who first made the comparison between Mann and Sandusky.

The case involves a hotly disputed question that has split lower courts: When can statements of opinion form the basis of a libel suit? Ordinarily, the high court has ruled, a person can't be sued for expressing an opinion. But when a statement mixes opinion with a claim about facts -- in this case, the claim that Mann had misused data -- courts have struggled to decide whether lawsuits are valid.
Lawyers for the institute and the National Review, a conservative publication founded in 1955 by the late William F. Buckley, urged the court to block the suit on 1st Amendment grounds. They argued that freedom of speech and the press requires shielding people who comment on matters of great public controversy, such as climate change.
Standing aside in this case, they said, "would be to insert courts and juries into every hot-button political and scientific dispute."
But lawyers for Mann argued the disputed comments crossed the line from protected opinion to a defamatory accusation that Mann engaged in "data manipulation" and "scientific misconduct."
An appeals court for the District of Columbia had refused to block the suit.
The high court's action clears the way for the suits to go to trial. The justices, however, could still intervene later to review the verdict.
In the past, President Trump, among others, has called for making it easier to sue the press for libel. Justice Clarence Thomas has also suggested the court should reconsider the landmark 1964 decision in New York Times vs. Sullivan, which shields the press from being sued by public officials except when their reports reflect a "reckless disregard for the truth."
Thomas did not register a dissent Monday in the cases of National Review vs. Mann or CEI vs. Mann.
Alito, however, said the court should have heard the cases.
They "present questions that go to the very heart of the constitutional guarantee of freedom of speech and freedom of the press: the protection afforded to journalists and others who use harsh language in criticizing opposing advocacy on one of the most important public issues of the day," he wrote.
"Climate change has staked a place at the very center of his nation's public discourse," he added. "The core purpose of the constitutional protection of freedom of expression is to ensure that that all opinions on such issues have a chance to be heard and considered."

Texto completo: Sarah Huckabee Sanders teased that she may run for governor of Arkansas, saying she believes she was "called" to run for office.
"There are two types of people who run for office," Sanders said on Sunday, according to the New York Times. "People that are called and people that just want to be a senator or governor. I feel like I’ve been called."
The next governor's race in Arkansas is not until 2022, and Republican Asa Hutchinson currently holds the position. Sanders, 37, has been rumored to be planning a run since leaving the White House and after President Trump urged her to consider it.
The former White House press secretary said, "If I do [run], it will because I feel called to do it and because I feel I can offer something to the state, and I can do something to help move the state further ahead and grow it in a positive way, and I fit what the state needs at that time."
If she runs, Sanders would be looking to fill the position her father, Mike Huckabee, held for more than a decade, from 1996 to 2007. She left the White House in June to spend more time with her family after serving in the Trump administration for about two years.
Photo Caption:FILE - In this Friday, Sept. 6, 2019, file photo, Fox News contributor Sarah Sanders makes her first appearance on the "Fox & Friends" television program in New York. Former White House press secretary Sanders is laying the groundwork for a possible run for governor of Arkansas in 2022.

Texto completo: Less than six months after leaving the White House, former press secretary Sarah Sanders is planning her next move — and that move might just be a political run in her home state of Arkansas.

“There are two types of people who run for office,” Sanders told the New York Times. “People that are called and people that just want to be a senator or governor. I feel like I’ve been called.”
If she does run for office, it will likely be as a gubernatorial candidate in 2022. President Trump has been encouraging Sanders to launch her bid for the past few months, and given her family’s history in the state, Sanders would likely be an easy shoo-in.
The Beltway's many political pundits would like to think otherwise, pointing to her contentious tenure at the White House.TweetTweetTweetIt is true that Sanders often dodged questions and repeated blatant falsehoods to shield the White House from criticism. (Jay Carney, one of President Barack Obama’s press secretaries, had a similar habit). But none of this will matter in Arkansas, where most people view Sanders as political royalty and trust her more than any member of the mainstream media.

“The main thing I like about her is her honesty,” Carla Shelton, an Arkansas resident and small-business owner, told the Times. “She got a bad rap because people are offended that she does tell the truth. I’m 100% behind her.”

Shelton likely represents a large share of Arkansas voters, many of whom would be happy to see a Trump-endorsed candidate return to the governor’s mansion. Sanders knows this, and it’s why she continues to insist during her Fox News appearances that she’s carrying a message from “real America” — the America that doesn’t care what blue check marks on Twitter think; the America that values loyalty more than honesty, perhaps to a fault.
The media’s pundits think they can back Sanders into a corner by relitigating her time in the White House, but it’s nothing more than noise bouncing around the Beltway's echo chamber. Arkansas voters will support and defend their own, and Sanders is certainly that.

Maureen Dowd: Trump pursues his own great white whale

Texto completo: Washington — President Donald Trump is a rodomont. Not to mention a grobian. And, of course, a Sinon suffering from proditomania.
With Trump firmly lodged in our heads, it is understandable if we have all become a little conspiracy-minded.
Case in point: A few weeks ago, someone signed me up for A.Word.A.Day email from Wordsmith.org. Soon I began to detect a pattern.
Friday’s word was vulgarian, following close after bare-knuckle. Others included rodomont (a vain boaster), grobian (a buffoonish person) and Sinon (one who misleads and betrays). Also chirocracy (a government that rules with a heavy hand) and froward (difficult to deal with or contrary).
Sound like anyone you know?
Since this is a town of fevered conspiracists now, theories abound about why the president went to Walter Reed military hospital last Saturday. But nobody here buys that it was a spontaneous desire to do Phase 1 of a physical.
As Trump himself said Friday about it, “A lot of things are a matter with me.” But we do know the name of one severe malady the president has: proditomania. A.Word.A.Day defined it as the feeling or belief that everyone is out to get you.
Trump believes that paranoia can be useful. He sees the world as vicious and life as a battle for survival.
As we draw closer to Trump getting a lump of coal in his Christmas stocking, with Nancy Pelosi implacably heading toward a holiday impeachment, his proditomania is revving up.
Even Steve Doocy looked a little bemused during Trump’s shambolic 54-minute call into “Fox & Friends” Friday.
No matter how many experts — including the gloriously bracing Fiona Hill — explain that it is Russia that interfered with our elections and that Russia has been scheming to deflect blame to Ukraine, Trump keeps rambling about that Democratic National Committee server.
“The FBI went in, and they told them, ‘Get out of here; we’re not giving it to you,’” he said on Fox. “They gave the server to CrowdStrike, or whatever it is called, which is a company owned by a very wealthy Ukrainian. I still want to see that server.”
Trying to justify why he had ousted and smeared the ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch, he claimed that she was “an Obama person” who had refused to hang his picture in the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv. (A lawyer for Yovanovitch said the portrait had been hung immediately.)
“This was not an angel, this woman, OK?” Trump sneered, adding that when he complained that the dignified and well-respected former ambassador was being treated too gently, he was told: “Well, sir, she’s a woman. We have to be nice.”
It was peak Trump pique.
After climbing up in politics by putting down Barack Obama as an illegitimate president, Trump is so terrified of being seen as an illegitimate president that he acts out in ways that cause more people to see him as an illegitimate president.
His presidency began with him obsessing on his inauguration crowd size and carrying around his 2016 electoral map.
He can’t get past it and it’s intensifying, playing out on the world stage, with national security implications. It’s debilitating to his presidency, and the rest of us are hostages to his insecurities.
As Hill succinctly noted about the inability in the Trump era to separate fictional narratives from objective realities: “Our nation is being torn apart. Truth is questioned.”
Vladimir Putin hit the jackpot with Trump. He makes a perfect sucker for the former KGB spy.
“Thank God nobody is accusing us anymore of interfering in the U.S. elections,” Putin gloated Wednesday at an economic forum in Moscow. “Now they’re accusing Ukraine.”
The president seems like even more of a crackpot, given The New York Times story Friday revealing that, even as Republican lawmakers vociferously defended the president, they received a briefing “that Russia had engaged in a yearslong campaign to essentially frame Ukraine as responsible for Moscow’s own hacking of the 2016 election.”
Julian Barnes and Matthew Rosenberg reported that the Kremlin succeeded in spreading discord among its adversaries and sluicing false claims about Ukrainian meddling into Republican talking points. A lot of Republicans have dirtied themselves defending Trump, and their party will not easily recover from perverting its values.
Trump is blustering about impeachment and wanting a Senate trial and calling Pelosi — who has his presidency in a vise grip — “totally incompetent” and “crazy as a bedbug.”
But those who know him believe that he’s genuinely unnerved and even hurt at the prospect of impeachment.
One of his tweets Thursday as he headed toward being the third president to be impeached seemed to reflect a rare hint of vulnerability. “I never in my wildest dreams thought my name would in any way be associated with the ugly word, Impeachment!” he wrote.
It recalls a prescient moment from September when the president’s former homeland security adviser, Thomas Bossert, appeared on ABC’s “This Week” and warned that Trump had to let go of his conspiracy theory linking CrowdStrike, Ukraine and the DNC server.
“If he continues to focus on that white whale,” Bossert said, “it’s going to bring him down.”
But, like Ahab, Trump can’t ever let go. He’s hellbent on harpooning himself, chasing that which will sink him.
Seppuku. My word of the day.

Texto completo: NEW YORK - From the mountains of shoes that were worn by Jews when they were packed into railroad freight cars bound for Auschwitz, the Museum of Jewish Heritage: A Living Memorial to the Holocaust displays one: a woman’s red dress pump with a three-inch heel. It prompts viewers to wonder: Where did she think she was going?
Perhaps she did not have time to think when she was swept into the vortex of one of Europe’s innumerable roundups. She was destined for the unimaginable, where she probably vanished quickly: 900,000 of the 1.3 million people sent there were murdered shortly after their arrival.
The New York Times of January 28, 1945, reported on its front page the Red Army’s arrival the day before at Auschwitz, which the story described, in its 16th paragraph, as a place where more than a million “persons” were murdered. Persons. Of them, 1 million were Jews.
A yellowed Times edition from that date is displayed today in the museum, which is located on Manhattan’s southern tip, near the spot where, in 1654, 23 Jews who had come from Spain and Portugal, via Brazil, became the first Jews in what was then New Amsterdam. The museum’s six-sided Core building evokes the six-pointed star of David, and the 6 million Jews killed in the Holocaust, which is the subject of a shattering exhibit, “Auschwitz. Not long ago. Not far away.” The eloquence of the artifacts, which were first seen when the exhibit opened in Madrid and will be seen elsewhere in North America, is welcome testimony, in an age obsessed with new media, to the power of an old medium: the museum.
The exhibit includes Reinhard Heydrich’s gift for Hermann Goering on his 47th birthday. Before Heydrich was assassinated by Czech partisans in 1942, he was the “architect of the Final Solution.” His gift was a piece of parchment: the original 1551 proclamation, signed by the Holy Roman Emperor Ferdinand I, requiring Jews to attach to their garments a yellow circle. The seeds of the Holocaust germinated for centuries in Europe’s social soil. They did not, however, have to come to their cataclysmic fruition.
Other artifacts include Heinrich Himmler’s handwriting in his annotated first edition of “Mein Kampf.” And a photo of Anne Frank’s parents’ wedding. And a child’s shoe with a sock carefully tucked into it, waiting for the child to put it back on after the “shower” to which he had been directed, from which he did not return.
Did you know that eight of the 15 participants in the Jan. 20, 1942, Wannsee Conference, which finalized plans for the industrialization of murder, had doctoral degrees? Education is not necessarily an inoculation against evil. Only two participants were older than 50: Genocide was a project for up-and-comers, idealists who acquired the ideals from socialization under totalitarianism.
The exhibit includes grainy film of a passing freight train shedding notes the way a tree shed leaves in autumn, notes tossed from between the freight cars’ slats by the human cargo who were desperate to scatter random traces of themselves before the final darkness. One was tossed from a train leaving Holland by 17-year-old Hertha Aussen: “Most likely this will be the last card you will receive from me.” Three days later she was murdered on arrival at Auschwitz.
What also died at Auschwitz is - was - what is known as the Whig theory of history, which holds, or held, that there is an inevitable unfolding of history in the direction of expanding liberty under law. Just as the Holocaust was not inevitable, neither is the triumph of enlightenment: History is not a ratchet that clicks only one way. In several parts of the world, including on the dark and bloody ground of central Europe, there are forms of political regression. These are marked by a recrudescence of the blood-and-soil tribalism of degenerate nationalism, accompanied by thinly veiled, or not at all veiled, anti-Semitism.
Visitors entering “Auschwitz. Not long ago. Not far away” walk past these words of Primo Levi, an Auschwitz survivor: “It happened, therefore it can happen again.” Today in China’s far west, concentration camps hold more than a million people who Beijing says show “symptoms” of being “infected” with the “virus” of “unhealthy thoughts.” Similar medical terminology presented the Holocaust as social hygiene.
Polls indicate that a majority of millennials do not know what Auschwitz was. The future might teach them by analogies.

Texto completo: Former White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders disputed the portrayal of President Donald Trump by the anonymous purported Trump official in the book "A Warning," calling the person a "total coward" and saying it doesn't sound like "somebody who spent real time with the president. "
The book describes Trump as volatile and unfocused, but Sanders said, "you can't spend that kind of time with him and have that takeaway. "
Sanders made the comments Sunday during an appearance on the Fox News program "The Next Revolution With Steve Hilton. " She described the president as someone who is decisive and can quickly sort through large amounts of data. And she said the widely reported idea that the president needs his briefings to be simplified is "absurd. "

The rest of us want to take a break, we wanna sleep, the president works the entire time. "
During her White House tenure, Sanders was vilified by critics who accused her of obfuscation and outright lying as Trump's spokeswoman.
In an interview with The New York Times published Sunday, Sanders said of all the criticism leveled at her, the accusation of dishonesty bothered her most.
"I was attacked for everything, not just my performance," she told the Times. "I was called a fat soccer mom, my kids were threatened, my life was threatened. "
"I don’t like being called a liar," she added. "The other stuff bothered me far less. "
As Sanders considers reentering politics, this time as a potential candidate for governor in her home state of Arkansas, she can expect the charge of mendacity to follow her. Among the many instances where her detractors accused her of dishonesty, the most glaring was outlined in the report from former special counsel Robert Mueller, which said she inaccurately claimed there were "countless members of the FBI" who told her they had lost confidence in former Director James Comey.
Sanders was unable to back up that claim when interviewed by Mueller's team and told them it had been a "slip of the tongue. "
If her Times interview is any indication, Sanders is serious about a potential run to succeed Gov. Asa Hutchinson, whose term is up in 2023.
"There are two types of people who run for office," she said. "People that are called and people that just want to be a senator or governor. I feel like I’ve been called. "

Texto completo: The first "Frozen" made $ 67.4 million during its opening weekend in 2013. The sequel made over 75 percent more than that.
"Frozen 2" was a bit of a gamble: Rarely do musical sequels succeed, and this movie was being released a whopping six years after the original.
"Frozen 2" was a surefire success: The original grossed over $ 1 billion worldwide, and this follow-up has been aggressively marketed by a studio that dominates the industry.
However it was framed, Disney's "Frozen 2" proved its strength at the box office this weekend, opening to an estimated $ 127 million in domestic ticket sales. That is over 75 percent more than the original "Frozen" made during its first weekend in 2013 ( $ 67.4 million, not adjusting for inflation), which had the advantage of being a Thanksgiving holiday weekend. "Frozen 2" brought in an additional $ 223.2 million overseas this weekend, according to the studio.
"This is a sensational opening," David A. Gross, a movie consultant, wrote in a report this weekend. "Audiences have shown wariness of sequels, including animation," Gross added, referencing "Secret Life of Pets 2" and "The Angry Birds Movie 2," both of which opened this year to weaker sales than their predecessors. Disney's own "Maleficent: Mistress of Evil," released last month, about a half decade after the original, also failed to match its forerunner. Not so with "Frozen 2."
The original "Frozen" introduced audiences to the royal sisters Elsa (voiced by Idina Menzel) and Anna (Kristen Bell), distinctive supporting characters like the bubbly snowman Olaf (Josh Gad) and the movie's megahit song, "Let it Go." (All of its songs were written by the married duo Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez.) "Frozen," directed by Jennifer Lee and Chris Buck, drew praise for its focus on female self-reliance over romance, and won Oscars for best animated feature and best original song.
"Frozen 2" brings back Elsa, Anna and the rest of the ensemble. And again it is directed by Lee and Buck with songs by Anderson-Lopez and Lopez. It tells a story that centers on an adventure into an enchanted forest.
The new movie received a generally favorable reception from critics, if a less enthusiastic one than the original's: "Frozen 2" currently holds a 75 percent fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes, while the original stands at 90 percent. In her review for The New York Times, Manohla Dargis called "Frozen 2" a "diverting, prettily animated musical."

"Frozen 2" was by far the main event at theaters this weekend (it made more than double the amount brought in by the rest of the top ten movies combined), but a pair of other brand-new releases were also in the top five.
Sony Pictures opened "A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood," a drama in which Tom Hanks plays Fred Rogers, to a respectable $ 13.5 million in ticket sales. And STX Films's action movie "21 Bridges" opened to a solid $ 9.3 million in sales. That movie stars Chadwick Boseman as a Manhattan detective on a manhunt.
Those two movies landed in third and fourth place; neither could outpace 20th Century Fox's racing drama "Ford v Ferrari," which had a strong opening last weekend and brought in an additional $ 16 million this weekend according to Comscore, which compiles box office data. "Midway," a World War II action movie distributed by Lionsgate, rounded out the top five with $ 4.7 million in domestic sales.

Texto completo: My Mom died Tuesday. As much as I admire her 92 years of life, I remember as a kid thinking life had cheated her at times.
Lois Evaughn Schembs was born on a farm outside of Remington, Indiana, on Jan. 28, 1927, to farmer Jesse Schembs and his wife, Floretta Casey. Mom never said they were poor, but she did tell stories of running to the outhouse in the middle of winter nights and being happy to find a Sears catalog instead of just corn cobs. She’d heat an iron in the fire and use it to warm her bed sheets, but she’d still wake up some mornings to find the water frozen in her glass next to the bed.
She was so smart as a child, she skipped second grade. Then she got scarlet fever and missed so much school, she had to repeat third grade. Good in math and English, she was salutatorian of her Class of 1945 at Remington High School, where she also played the drums.
Of course, old classmates of hers just called her "the prettiest girl in school." They say she should have been queen of the Fountain Park Chautauqua in Remington, but the judges declared it a tie and Mom lost the coin flip.
Second in her class. Second to the queen. And second-class citizen when it came to education, I thought. College was never an option for her, so she took a job in bookkeeping with Sherman White and Co., a buyer of farm goods in Goodland. That’s where she met my dad, Willy Constable, on the day he came home from World War II and stopped by in uniform to see his sister, who introduced him to my mom. He was more than 10 years older, and Mom remembers being mortified when he wore his fedora on their first date to the movie theater, as if he were an old man.
Dad proposed on their third date. Three years later, Mom accepted. But first, she and her younger sister, Dorothy, crossed the Atlantic Ocean in the steerage compartment of a steamship for a grand adventure in Ireland. That took courage. Mom came home and married my dad on March 13, 1950, on what happened to be the first day in weeks that it was too wet for farmers to work. The last-second nuptials meant Willy’s father, Bert, skipped the wedding to attend his previously scheduled town board meeting. A rainy spring extended my parent’s honeymoon.
Mom gave birth to daughters Sally and Nancy, and then me and my brother, Bill. Mom insisted that all of us kids learn to play piano and sing alongside Dad and her in the choir at the Goodland Presbyterian Church. My sisters played organ and piano for church and countless weddings. My brother became a gifted musician and keyboard player who charmed crowds with his music. As the only person in my family who never got paid to perform music, I might be the only kid in history whose mother asked him to stop taking piano lessons. We both thought that was a good idea.
Mom and Dad were key members of the South Newton High School Production Company and got all of us kids interested in theater. They took us to Christmas concerts at Purdue University. But they also had good seats for Boilermaker football games, where we’d wrap our feet in plastic bread wrappers to keep warm and Mom would open her stash of homemade chocolate-chip goodies only when our team needed her "third-down cookies." Her only attempt at athletics was standing on her head on her birthdays.
Mom quizzed us on current events and political news at supper and set up an Electoral College voting system for family decisions, with everybody getting votes depending on age. A parental bloc defeated any move by the minority children, but any split opened the door for new alliances. Mom filled our home with books, music, humor and love.
An avid reader, political junkie and crossword wiz, she used to quote from New York Times stories and talk about writing her own book. "I’d call it ‘Hamburger and Sex,’" she said. "Because I know hamburger, and I need sex to make it sell."
In addition to cooking our meals and running the household, Mom was the driving force in getting all four kids to go to college. But she didn’t just inspire her own kids. She had an uncanny ability to draw people to her and consider her their second mom. People confided in her about sexual issues, drugs, abuse, alcoholism and dreams.
She lived on a farm in a conservative, heavily Republican, all-white community, but became a go-to person for anyone from outside those boundaries. She and Dad visited Jimmy Carter’s church in Plains, Georgia. Mom and her friend Ruthann were once in a photo on the front of The Indianapolis Star talking with Jesse Jackson after they made the trip to hear the civil rights leader speak. Mom donated to Barack Obama, slapped an Obama bumper sticker on her car in 2008, and probably deserves credit for making Indiana a blue state that year. No one so much as teased her.
Once we kids were out of her hair, she focused more on herself. She and her friends had frequent Lunch Bunch outings. In her 70s, she took art classes and became an accomplished watercolor artist, winning a couple of ribbons and landing one piece in a juried art show. She got back to her drums, too, playing snare drum in the Newton Jasper Community Band from her early 70s through her late 80s.
Lovely and elegant are words often used in descriptions of her. Always polite, Mom never swore or spoke badly about anyone. She never let us kids say the S-word, whether that meant "stupid" or "shut up."
She cared for the old ladies in the church. She cared for her parents. She cared for my dad before he died in 2003. She cared for my brother before he died in 2010. She cared for others her whole life. My thoughts about what she could have been if she had been given the chance vanished. Life didn’t cheat her of opportunities. It let her forge her own. She had grace, smarts, love and a wonderful life. And we were lucky to be part of it.

Texto completo: In the New York Times bestseller, "The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind," William Kamkwamba tells how, at age 14, starving and impoverished like the rest of his famine-ravaged nation of Malawi, Africa, he went to the library and found instructions on how to build a windmill.
Pegged as "crazy" by the villagers and his family, Kamkwamba nonetheless plunged ahead, using salvaged metal parts, wood scraps and a used bicycle frame to build a windmill that ultimately did pump water and generate electricity, rescuing himself and his family from extinction. In the process, he became an international hero and an acclaimed author.
"I want (the kids) to know how not to give up," said Kamkwamba, now 32 and a Dartmouth University graduate, at a visit Thursday to Kent Middle School in Kentfield. The school's entire student body had read his book, seen a Netflix film about his life and some students had even tried to make their own windmills.
"Also, don't be afraid of failing," Kamkwamba said. "What makes a difference is what you do after you fail."
Now married to a fellow Dartmouth student, living in North Carolina and working with a global
nonprofit Moving Windmills Project to support rural economic development in Malawi, Kamkwamba on Thursday spoke to three student assemblies for more than three hours.
"How did you feel when you first found out how to Google words and how a computer works?" asked Bobby Martinez, a sixth-grader.
"I said, Where was this Google all the time when I was building my windmill?'" Kamkwamba quipped. "There are so many designs for the windmill on the internet."
Kent Middle School principal Grant Althouse said Kamkwamba's story holds several key lessons about "seizing opportunities and overcoming challenges and adversity."
"There's also a message about cultural competence, and the challenges that other cultures in other parts of the world experience, and just really understanding and having a sense of empathy for the challenges here versus the challenges there," he said.
"And then, the universal language of mathematics and science," Althouse added. "He was able to discover some universal truths about science and apply them in a way that would advance his life in Malawi."
Kentfield School District Board of Trustees President Heather McPhail Sridharan said the book has galvanized many kids and adults in the greater school family.
"This is a culmination of a school-wide read," she said. "Everyone from our (transitional kindergarten), 4- and 5-year-olds, all the way up to eighth-graders, have all read his book. So this is a big moment for our whole school community."
Kent Middle School librarian Rebecca Jelen said she began planning the school-wide read in March, but wasn't able to get approval from publisher Harper Collins for Kamkwamba's visit until August. She was then able to work out a bulk book purchase with longtime Marin retailer Book Passage for 250 copies or about half of the district's student population with parents purchasing the rest. The elementary school students read a picture-book version of "The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind," Jelen said.
"For a middle school, the book covers a lot of content," Jelen added. "There are connections to a lot of topics science, climate change, geography and math even beyond language arts. "
The book, co-authored by Bryan Mealer, was named "Best Book of the Year" by Publisher's Weekly. In addition to being the star character in the Netflix film, Kamkwamba has been invited to speak at TED talks a speakers series focused on technology, entertainment and design on two occasions.
To thank him for appearing on Thursday, Kent Middle School gave Kamkwamba a warm wool sweater as a gift. That was a nod to Kamkwamba's tale of how he came to the U.S. for the first time wearing only a T-shirt with a long-sleeve-shirt over it the "cold" weather dress in Africa. He soon experienced what real cold weather was, he said with a laugh.
"I told them back in Malawi, if you go inside a freezer, that's what it's like," he told the students.
Science teacher Ron Pembleton said the windmill-building day was a good preparation for Kamkwamba's visit.
Max Yoakum, a seventh grader, was one of a team of four students who won first prize for the building the best windmill in the intra-school contest. The team used a kit for the basic parts, but did the design and the windmill flaps themselves.
"It was very fun," Yoakum said. "It was fun to get to design and assemble it yourself."
Reading Kamkwamba's book was "really inspirational" because he was "very motivated to make the windmill, and he was very motivated to help people," seventh-grader Leina Khan said.
"He didn't give up."

POINT PARK CANCELS FALL MUSICAL STUDENTS CONCERNED WITH ITS RACIST CONTENT

Texto completo: Student concerns over racist content in Point Park University's fall show have led to the cancellation of "Adding Machine: A Musical."
On Thursday, Steven Breese, artistic director of the university's Pittsburgh Playhouse and dean of the Conservatory of Performing Arts, convened a town hall in the Playhouse's Highmark Theater, where "Adding Machine" was to have opened Dec. 5. More than 200 students, faculty and staff aired concerns for nearly three hours.
"While it might be unusual and maybe even unprecedented, given the circumstances and the dialogue we had, it was absolutely the right thing to do," Mr. Breese said.
The provocative, expressionist musical was chosen for the current season by Mr. Breese's predecessor of 18 years, Ron Allan-Lindblom. Mr. Breese took the job in July.
Based on the 1923 play by Elmer Rice, "Adding Machine" debuted in 2008 to a rave New York Times review, which called it an "impossibly bleak, improbably brilliant little musical."
The show's protagonist is a racist who commits murder after being replaced by technology. In one particularly harrowing scene, as described in an essay by Chicago actor Bear Bellinger, "Inhabitants hurl epithets around the stage in a stylized musical sequence that is an apparent send-up of American White nationalism in an age of discrimination. But, when you add minority bodies to that mix, the message becomes muddled."
Mr. Breese was familiar with the play but not the musical when he arrived at Point Park. He understood the intent is to show "how easily discrimination and hatred become woven in the fabric of society."
Jordyn Hronec, covering the Thursday gathering as editor-elect of the Point Park Globe, quoted student actors who felt their concerns about the show's racist content were not being addressed. She wrote that the director of the COPA production, Tlaloc Rivas, who attended the meeting, had previously "described what he referred to as an "Action Plan for Traumatic Content' - something that students at the meeting claimed had not been effective enough."
Students did not hold back at the meeting. "It was not clear enough that the show was 'mocking' the characters expressing racist sentiments. Students were also concerned about the lack of trigger warnings given to students during the audition process, as well as on marketing materials," Ms. Hronec reported.
"I think there is difficult language in the show that is the trigger for emotional responses," Mr. Breese said Friday. "But also, and importantly, the play does hold a mirror up to society, and it's an ugly reflection. But there is this hate speech that we are supposed to react strongly to, yet there isn't a sense of getting their punishment or comeuppance for it. That's intentional in the playwright's mind but not easy for everyone to reconcile."
American musicals have dealt with racism, often by exposing it with disturbing images and language. "Show Boat," which debuted in 1927, includes a light-skinned black woman passing as white, who is discovered and ostracized. The song "Ol' Man River" from it was introduced with the N-word included - a lyric that has been modified through time, including by its original singer, Paul Robeson.
There have long been arguments for and against showing theatrical works in their original forms, as reflected by the times in which they were created and those in which we live today. "Thoroughly Modern Millie" is one example of a show that was rewritten to erase the racist stereotypes that featured white actors playing Asian characters.
In 2015, Clarion University canceled its production of "Jesus in India" after playwright Lloyd Suh voiced concerns over white actors being cast in roles written for actors of South Asian descent.
Canceling a university show, with actors already cast and rehearsal well underway, is not an easy decision, but "it was the right one," Mr. Breese said. The conservatory dean added that accommodations would be made for seniors or for any student who had worked on this production as a requirement.
Holding town hall meetings is something Mr. Breese has done in previous university positions and intends to do twice a semester. In this particular case, he praised the students' courage and passion in speaking up.
"It was an opportunity to have this dialogue and for students to express what was on their minds," he said. "Clearly when we got into the room, and there were 200 people, it indicated there was more conversation than any of us recognized. From that perspective, I'm delighted we did this."
Upcoming productions for the 2019-20 conservatory season are "The Wolves," a play about a girls soccer team that was a finalist for the 2017 Pulitzer Prize for drama; the Tony-winning musical "Parade," a historical account of the lynching of a wrongly accused Jewish man in the South, directed by Tony- and Emmy-winning director Rob Ashford, a Point Park alum; and the world premiere of the new rock musical "Pump Up the Volume."

Texto completo: It’s officially the holiday shopping season. But be wary. Your Grinch neighbor, the IRS, is sitting high on the mountain, waiting to pounce. When money or items of value change hands, the IRS often wants a share, and believe it or not, it includes gift-giving.
The basic rules
A recipient of a gift does not pay income taxes on the gift. But the donor may pay gift or estate taxes. These taxes work together but are two different taxes, separate and apart from income taxes. A gift tax applies to gifts made during your lifetime, paid by the donor and not the recipient.
Estate tax applies to transfers at your death, paid by the decedent’s estate, not the recipient. There is one tax exemption for both these taxes. Currently, the exemption is $11.4 million, so you can give that amount away during your life or at your death, or some combination thereof, without gift or estate taxes.
Additionally, anyone can give another person a gift of up to $15,000 a year. That means spouses can together gift $30,000 per year. After that, the gift is subject to gift tax and you’ll need to use part of your exemption.
How it works
If you gift, for example, $25,000 to your adult child, $10,000 is a potentially taxable gift. You would need to file a gift tax return and claim a portion of your lifetime exemption, leaving you with $11,390,000 still to gift during your lifetime or at your death without taxes. An amount beyond that is taxed at 40%, and you or your estate pays that tax, not the recipient.
You may think that with an exemption that high you have nothing to worry about. — gift away! (Please add me to your list.) But beware that the exemption amount is scheduled to drop to about $5.4 million after 2025. Expect to see a lot of serious gifting by the wealthy in 2025 to use up the larger exemption that will disappear the following year.
What could go wrong?
There can be a lot of reasons to gift during your lifetime: your kid needs the money, you need to drop an asset from your estate, you’re downsizing and would like to see your child and grandchildren live in the family home. But beware that besides the potential for a gift tax, there’s an income tax issue, too.
Unlike property inherited due to death, gifted property keeps the same tax basis the donor had. Say you have stock you paid $25,000 for that is now worth $50,000. If the stock is given to your heirs, it would have an income tax basis of $50,000. If they sold the stock, they’d have no taxable gain. If you instead gift that stock during your lifetime, the recipient gets your same tax basis of $25,000. If they sell the stock, they will have a taxable gain of $25,000. This may work fine if the recipient is in a low tax bracket or is a tax-free charity. Just do the analysis with your advisors before making a gift of an appreciated asset. Timing is everything.
Other Gift Tax Exemptions
There are other gifts that can be made without incurring gift tax. Gifts to pay for someone else’s medical expenses or tuition, gifts to a spouse and gifts to charity do not incur gift tax no matter the amount and are not subject to the annual $15,000 limit. But again, be cautious. The Grinch is rubbing his green paws together.
A gift of tuition for all levels of education is not subject to gift tax, but the exemption, known as the Gift Tax Exclusion for Tuition, only applies if you make the payment directly to the institution and not the student and keep documentation. The exemption does not include gifts for housing, books, supplies, or meals. The gift may also affect the student’s eligibility for financial aid.
Payment of medical expenses is excluded from gift tax only if the bill is incurred for “the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease” and is not covered by insurance.
Gifts between spouses are not subject to tax. But a gift from a spouse becomes the separate property of the recipient. You would not get half of it back if you divorce. (This is a Grinch of a different color, but relevant here.) Additional rules apply if your spouse is not a U.S. citizen.
Charitable gifts aren’t subject to gift tax, and you can get an income tax deduction if you itemize. But your deduction for charitable gifts is limited to 60% of your adjusted gross income, 30% in some cases.
Conclusion
Gifting to your loved ones or charity is, of course, a wonderful thing. My gift to you is simply to remind you that sometimes gifts need to be carefully planned out with professional advisors so it makes it to the Whos in your Whoville without the Grinch grabbing a chunk. The IRS is a mean one.

Texto completo: NEW YORK — Nobel laureate Toni Morrison, a colossal figure in American literature, received a final goodbye from friends and followers Thursday at a celebration of her life at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in Manhattan.
Morrison died Aug. 5 at 88.
Morrison's works, often described as incomparable and revolutionary, communicated the pain and prejudice of the black experience, especially that of black women, to millions of readers around the world.
Nine celebrities and literary masters spoke at the memorial, among them Oprah Winfrey, Pulitzer Prize-winning author David Remnick, and author and journalist Ta-Nehisi Coates.
"The first time I came face to face with Toni Morrison was in Maya Angelou's backyard, for a gathering of some of the most illustrious black people you've ever heard of," Winfrey told a crowd of more than 600, remembering a celebration after Morrison won the Nobel Prize. "My head and my heart were swirling."
Winfrey has chosen more books by Morrison than by any other author for her book club, she said. But Winfrey worried, at first, that Morrison's work was too demanding.
But Morrison gave Winfrey the confidence to choose those books: "'She said, 'That, my dear, is reading,'" Winfrey said.
"There was no distance between Toni Morrison and her words. She believed it was a writer's job to rip the veil off," said Winfrey, who drew the most applause of the evening. "Her words don't permit the reader to down them quickly and forget them.
"They will not be ignored," she continued. "They can gut you, turn you upside down, make you think you don't get it. You experience ... a kind of emancipation, a liberation, an ascension to another level of understanding."
When the crowd surpassed the cathedral's seating capacity, people clustered by entrances, craning their necks to catch a glimpse of the literary luminaries who spoke. Attendees snapped selfies and photos of the cathedral interior. The guest speakers, led by priests, arrived to rich organ music.
"Great novelists illuminate worlds we dimly know," said Remnick, the editor of The New Yorker magazine. "Great novels either open a door or they turn on the lights. Toni Morrison did it all. She opened the door and she turned on the lights."
Morrison often began her writing early in the morning but jotted down ideas throughout the day on a yellow notepad she kept close, said Angela Davis, an author, activist and academic who called Morrison her "big sister."
But although Morrison focused constantly on her work, she was always present for her two sons and her friends, Davis added.
"She demonstrated a way of being in the world that allowed her to simultaneously inhabit multiple dimensions," Davis said. "She was never only partially paying attention. She was always 100% engaged."
For author and professor Jesmyn Ward, the first woman to win two National Book Awards for fiction, Morrison's unflinching telling of the black experience was a sort of North Star.
"We wandering children heard Toni Morrison's voice, and she saved us," Ward said. "Something in that absolute narrative presence in her sure voice communicated this: you are worthy to be seen, you are worthy to be heard. Even in your quietest moments, you are worthy of witness."
Poet Kevin Young, who directs the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, said Morrison challenged him as he strove to find his own voice as an author. Once, when he was in college, Morrison visited his school to read from her masterwork, "Beloved."
"My friends and I literally sat at her feet," Young said. "Of course, now and always, we all sit at her feet.
"She freed something in me," he added.
Morrison served many roles to the people around her, among them mentor, teacher, editor and mother, said American-Haitian novelist Edwidge Danticat. One of the more important ones, though, was friend, she said.
"You were the literary giant that was Toni Morrison, but to myself you were also Chloe Wofford," Danticat said, calling Morrison by the author's given name. "You allowed me to see both. You gave us both lullabies and battle cries. You urged us to be dangerously free."
Toni Morrison was born Chloe Ardelia Wofford on Feb. 18, 1931, in Lorain, Ohio, the second of four children, the daughter of a ship welder and a homemaker, the granddaughter of sharecroppers.
Though Lorain was an integrated town, it wasn't immune from racism. When Morrison was a toddler, her parents fell behind on their $4 monthly rent, so their landlord set fire to their house — while they were in it. Morrison doesn't remember the fire, she told the Washington Post in 1993, but her father refused to be intimidated, and she later passed that lesson to the characters she created.
"She refused to allow racism to overcome her," Remnick said at the memorial. "She shaped how we thought, how we felt, what we read, what we teach, how we see each other and how we see this troubled country."
Life lessons, family stories and books were influences that shaped her into a visionary author whose gripping chronicles of the black experience inspired generations and rocketed her to critical achievement.
Morrison earned a bachelor's degree in 1953 from Howard University, a historically black university in Washington, D.C.— and became known as Toni because "the people in Washington" couldn't pronounce her real name, she told NPR in 2015.
Morrison completed her master's degree at Cornell University in 1955 and married Harold Morrison in 1958. They had two children, Ford and Slade, and divorced in 1964. She began teaching first at Texas Southern University, and then at Howard, beginning an academic career that would last five decades.
In 1967, she became the first black female fiction editor at Random House, where she published works by Muhammad Ali, Angela Davis, Gayl Jones, Chinua Achebe and Wole Soyinka. It was her second publishing job; the first was as a textbook editor in Syracuse, New York — a way to support the two children she was raising alone.
"She respected protest but she did not march. She edited," said Remnick at the service. "That was, for a time, her political work."
Her 1970 debut novel, "The Bluest Eye," tells the story of a black adolescent who lives in a violent household — and wishes for blue eyes. It's set in Morrison's hometown, post-Great Depression, and has consistently landed on the American Library Association's list of challenged books for the "controversial issues" it addresses.
"She does it with a prose so precise, so faithful to speech and so charged with pain and wonder that the novel becomes poetry," John Leonard wrote in a November 1970 New York Times review.
"I have said 'poetry,'" Leonard added. "But 'The Bluest Eye' is also history, sociology, folklore, nightmare and music."
Morrison's writing became pioneering and prolific, earning her widespread critical acclaim. "Song of Solomon," her third novel, won a National Book Critics Circle Award for Fiction. She won the 1988 Pulitzer Prize in fiction for her best-known work, "Beloved," published in 1987.
"Beloved" is the first in an African American history trilogy that includes "Jazz," which takes place in 1920s Harlem, and "Paradise," an Oprah's Book Club selection. The novel, which tells the story of an African American who escapes slavery, spent more than six months on the New York Times bestseller list in hardcover alone. Winfrey starred in the 1998 film adaption of the novel.
Morrison wrote 11 novels. Her other works include "Sula," "Tar Baby," "Love," "A Mercy," "Home," and "God Help the Child."
"When I began, there was just one thing that I wanted to write about, which was the true devastation of racism in the most vulnerable, the most helpless unit in the society — a black female and a child," she told the New York Times magazine in 1994. "I wanted to write about what it was like to be the subject of racism. It had a specificity that was damaging."
Morrison in 1993 became the first African-American woman to win the Nobel Prize in Literature.
The prize, she later said, was unexpected.
"I felt a lot of 'we' excitement," Morrison told the New York Times Magazine in 1994. "I represented a whole world of women who either were silenced or who had never received the imprimatur of the established literary world."
Morrison joined Princeton University in 1989 as a humanities professor, retiring with emeritus status in 2006.
Though her career took her across the country and around the world, Morrison spent decades in Rockland County, where she lived when she died.
Morrison long called Grand View-on-Hudson home, even after her house there burned on Christmas Day 1993. Around 120 firefighters from two departments responded to the fire, the Associated Press reported, which gutted the four-story house but spared her manuscripts. Her son, Slade, who was alone in the house when the fire started, escaped unhurt. The house was rebuilt.
"People used to say, 'How come you do so many things?'" Morrison told Publishers Weekly in 1987. "It never appeared to me that I was doing very much of anything; really everything I did was always about one thing, which is books. I was either editing them or writing them or reading them or teaching them, so it was very coherent."
Former President Barack Obama awarded Morrison the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2012.
"Toni Morrison was a national treasure, as good a storyteller, as captivating, in person as she was on the page," Obama tweeted after her death. "Her writing was a beautiful, meaningful challenge to our conscience and our moral imagination. What a gift to breathe the same air as her, if only for a while."
Morrison's final book, "The Source of Self-Regard: Selected Essays, Speeches and Meditations," was published in February 2019.

The real bombshell? How to properly pronounce Kyiv

Texto completo: As the first public impeachment hearings transfixed the country last week with revelations on a recalled ambassador and quid pro quos, America's collective mind was blown by another bombshell.
"Wait so Kiev is pronounced KEEVE (rhymes with Steve)?!?," star political forecaster Nate Silver wondered as many others online marveled that they had been pronouncing the Ukrainian capital wrong their whole lives. I made a 30-second video explaining the lesson in post-Soviet politics: Kiev is a transliteration from Russian, Kyiv is the preferred Ukrainian transliteration, and after simplifying Ukrainian's guttural vowels for American speakers, the proper pronunciation is "Keeve." It's now my most popular tweet ever; apparently, this is the content Impeachment Twitter craves.
Beneath this quirky language lesson, however, lies a battle over the pages of history that Ukrainians in the era after their Maidan revolution - which began six years ago Thursday - have been struggling to rewrite.
Throughout its existence, the Ukrainian nation had been dominated by nearby powers, including Russia, Poland and Austria-Hungary. Before 1991, when Ukraine gained independence from the Soviet Union, it had never existed as an independent state. The lens through which the modern world saw Ukraine was undeniably Russian. The language of higher education, of government and of privilege was Russian.
Ukrainian speakers were often ridiculed as provincial, or even politically, professionally and criminally chastised for their use of their native language. Taras Shevchenko, an artist, poet and Ukrainian national hero whose statue stands near Dupont Circle in Washington and in hundreds of locations across Ukraine, was exiled and sentenced to compulsory military service for promoting Ukrainian independence and writing poetry in Ukrainian, which the authorities referred to as "little Russian."
Since 2014, when Russia illegally annexed Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula and fomented a war in the country's eastern Donbas region, authorities in Kyiv have made a concerted effort at re-Ukrainianization, even down to the name of the capital city itself. It is not just a difference of transliteration but one of history, Ukrainians argue. The legendary founder of Kyiv, from whom the city gets its name is Prince Kyi, not Prince Kie.
The name also has political implications. The Ukrainian Ministry of Foreign Affairs launched the #KyivNotKiev campaign last year to gain recognition for the Ukrainian spelling of the country's cities. "Under the Russian empire and later the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR)," the ministry wrote , "Russification was actively used as a tool to extinguish each constituent country's national identity, culture and language. In light of Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine, including its illegal occupation of Crimea, we are once again experiencing Russification as a tactic that attempts to destabilize and delegitimize our country."
Kyiv has gone to great lengths to protect its information space, undertaking domestic measures that have been criticized as antidemocratic, including blocking Russian social media platforms and establishing quotas for the usage of Ukrainian in print and on the radio and television.
Ukrainians aren't exaggerating when they describe Russian language as a cudgel of Kremlin influence. Putin has claimed that his aggressive foreign policy in places such as the Baltic states, Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine has been in defense of Russian speakers and their rights. The Russian government funds a Russian cultural and language organization, called "Russki Mir" or "Russian World," which acts as an arm of Russian influence and soft power around the world. Russian-language media outlets posing as local media have peddled disinformation and targeted Russian-speaking populations across the former communist space.
Despite this background, embassies, media outlets and airports worldwide have been slow to correct their style guides and flight monitors; the capital's official transliteration has been Kyiv since 1995, but mentions of "Kiev" are still common. The very fact that so many Americans were puzzled by the official pronunciation of Kyiv shows how effective the Kremlin has been in promoting its worldview.
Though Ukrainians may not expect Americans to master the guttural first syllable, they are rightfully offended when they see a spelling of their capital that has been defunct for nearly 25 years bandied about in print and on the international stage. And as inaccuracies abound, their country is once again thrust into the limelight, perceived as a football, or worse - a casualty in a battle between great powers. But Ukrainians have agency. The least we can do is refer to their capital by its official name.
Since the quid pro quo drama began, at least, both The Washington Post and the New York Times finally announced they would use the Ukrainian spelling. For Kyiv, perhaps there is a silver lining, however thin, in the impeachment cloud.

Texto completo: President Trump should be considered one of America’s “greatest presidents” for his achievements so far despite the impeachment drive that in the end, will be viewed as a partisan attack similar to the Russia collusion charge, according to a New York Times best-selling historian and presidential adviser.
“Donald Trump should easily be ranked as one of America’s great presidents,” writes Doug Wead in his upcoming book, Inside Trump's White House: The Real Story Of His Presidency, a copy of which was shared with Secrets today.
In listing Trump’s efforts on the economy, in foreign policy, and presidential communications, Wead argued that the president’s legacy won't be destroyed by impeachment because it showed that he was under Democratic attack from the start yet still accomplished his agenda.

“It is very possible that the preposterous Russian collusion story has successfully inoculated Donald Trump from any new scandals that the impeachment process can uncover. While Russian collusion was meant to be a knockout blow, it may, in the end, be his key to political survival,” wrote Wead, an adviser to both Bush presidencies and Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul.
In a note, he also told Secrets, “I am not saying that he won't be impeached. Rather I am saying that impeachment will not be the scar on his legacy as it otherwise would be if it weren't for the failed attempt to tar him with Russian collusion.”
Wead, the author of several historical books, was granted exclusive access to the White House as Trump’s official biographer. Inside, he witnessed the workings of the Oval Office and key aides, including Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump.
He has been the target of several pre-publication death threats that he said the FBI believes are from anti-Trump activists.
The book, published by Center Street and due for a Tuesday release, dismissed several false claims made about the Trump inner circle and highlighted the wins that much of the media has shoved aside in the coverage of Russian collusion, the Mueller report, and impeachment.

Wead told Secrets, “based on the remarkable economy alone, Trump has been an outstanding president. Almost everything that social engineers and liberal politicians have wanted has come true for the poorest of the poor in our country and to every previous disenfranchised group of people. One must ask how he was able to see what every great economists in the world had missed? Was it luck? Was getting elected luck? Was creating jobs luck? Was he lucky in bringing back hostages that other presidents had left languishing in foreign prisons? Was defeating ISIS so easily, just luck?”
While it appears clear that House Democrats are pushing ahead with impeachment despite several polls showing less support for it, Wead took a longer view in arguing that Trump’s historical legacy will be good.
Citing the president’s economic record, Wead wrote, “Future historians who wipe away the dust of collective bias will see those numbers etched in stone and will be able to judge without contemporary emotion. If presidents are partly ranked as strong or weak based on their personal intelligence, then surely Donald Trump’s ability to see what the greatest economists in the world could not see is an example of remarkable insight.”
He even suggested that after Trump leaves office, Americans will one day wish he could return, as they have for other once scorned presidents, including George W. Bush. He suggested that one day cars will be adorned with bumper stickers that read, “Give us back our Trump.”
Wead quoted Kushner on that point. He wrote:
“Jared Kushner talked about that on that cold January night in 2019, when my wife and I visited him and Ivanka in their Georgetown home. The fireplace was ablaze, and Jared and Ivanka were on the couch opposite us. ‘There will come a day,’ Jared mused, ‘when people will miss him greatly. He goes for the big thing, and he gets it done. Nobody can keep up with the spirit in which he leads.”

Texto completo: Washington • In recent days, lawmakers were told that when President Donald Trump ramped up his campaign to pressure Ukraine into helping him against his domestic political rivals, he directed advisers to his personal lawyer. “Talk with Rudy,” he instructed. But one thing lawmakers will not do is talk with Rudy.
Rudy Giuliani was hardly the only offstage character during two weeks of impeachment hearings that ended Thursday. Lawmakers also heard that Mike Pence and Mike Pompeo were in the loop, that Mick Mulvaney organized the political equivalent of a “drug deal” and that John Bolton was adamantly against it.
But among those missing from the House Intelligence Committee’s witness list, besides Giuliani, were Pence, Pompeo, Mulvaney and Bolton. Not that the panel’s Democratic majority was necessarily uninterested in talking with the vice president, secretary of state, acting White House chief of staff or former national security adviser. Democratic leaders have decided not to wage a drawn-out fight to force them to testify over White House objections.
Instead, as the committee wrapped up its public hearings Thursday, House Democrats have opted for expeditious over comprehensive, electing to complete their investigation even without filling in major gaps in the story. It is a calculated gamble that they have enough evidence to impeach Trump on a party-line vote in the House and would risk losing momentum if they took the time to wage a court fight to compel reluctant witnesses to come forward.
But it leaves major questions unresolved. Was Pence told about a suspected link between security aid and investigations of Trump’s political opponents, as one witness testified? Did Pompeo sign off on it? Did Mulvaney facilitate the scheme? Did Bolton ever bring his objections directly to the president? Several current and former officials rushed out statements through aides or lawyers taking issue with testimony about them, but none of them volunteered to offer their own versions of the truth under oath.
Democrats have concluded that in the face of White House refusal to cooperate, it is better to press ahead and simply address the refusal of witnesses like Mulvaney to testify as a plank in a possible article of impeachment alleging obstruction of Congress.
“They should be coming before us,” Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Thursday. “They keep taking it to court, and no, we’re not going to wait until the courts decide. That might be information that’s available to the Senate, in terms of how far we go and when we go. But we can’t wait for that because, again, it’s a technique. It’s obstruction of justice, obstruction of Congress.”
Even some Republican strategists said she had a point. “As a political matter, the longer this goes, it is a real opportunity for Republicans to paint Democrats as unconcerned about the issues voters care more about, and I think Nancy Pelosi is well aware of that,” said Brendan Buck, who was counselor to former Speaker Paul Ryan.
But it leaves some frustrated about the missing pieces. “An impeachable offense should be compelling, overwhelmingly clear and unambiguous,” said Rep. Will Hurd of Texas, one of the few Republicans willing to criticize the president and at one point seen as theoretically open to the possibility of impeachment. “And it’s not something to be rushed or taken lightly. I have not heard evidence proving the president committed bribery or extortion.”
With the White House defying the House, Mulvaney has refused to comply with a subpoena for his testimony while Pence and Pompeo have defied subpoenas for documents but not been asked for testimony. Bolton has declined an invitation to testify and has not been subpoenaed but is awaiting the result of a lawsuit filed by his former deputy, Charles M. Kupperman, asking a judge to decide whether he should listen to the House or the White House.
That case is due for oral arguments in a U.S. District Court in Washington on Dec. 10, but even if the judge rules quickly it could be appealed all the way to the Supreme Court, which would take time.
Another lawsuit seeking to force Donald F. McGahn II, the former White House counsel, to testify in response to an earlier House subpoena in a previous matter may be decided by a judge Monday. But it too could be appealed, and Bolton’s lawyer has suggested that it might not apply to his client since there are separate national security concerns at stake.
None of which would suit the fast-track timetable envisioned by House Democrats. Although more witnesses could still be called, the Intelligence Committee concluded its scheduled public hearings after 12 witnesses and will now focus on drafting a report on the matter. It could also use the coming days to renew its press for the administration to turn over long-sought documents that have become more significant in light of the testimony.
From there, the committee’s report will go to the House Judiciary Committee, which traditionally handles impeachment and will then hold hearings of its own, but generally on constitutional and legal issues rather than fact-finding of its own. After it drafts articles of impeachment, the committee would vote on them and send them to the House floor, where Democrats anticipate a vote by Christmas.
In theory, if witnesses like Bolton do agree to testify or are compelled by a court, they could still be called before the Judiciary Committee. And for that matter, if the House does impeach Trump and sends the case to the Senate for a trial that would open sometime after the new year, additional witnesses could still be called then, too.
But the two weeks of public hearings showed how much remains fluid. Gordon D. Sondland, the ambassador to the European Union and a key figure in the pressure campaign, amended his original closed-door testimony after other witnesses contradicted him. Others like William B. Taylor Jr., the acting ambassador to Ukraine; Kurt D. Volker, the special envoy for Ukraine; and Laura K. Cooper, a Defense Department official, offered new information after their original interviews when reminded by their staff or other witnesses.
Some of those who have not testified are aggrieved at their portrayals over the last two weeks. Mulvaney protested testimony Thursday by Fiona Hill, a former Bolton deputy, that put him at the center of the pressure campaign.
“Fiona Hill’s testimony is riddled with speculation and guesses about any role that Mr. Mulvaney played with anything related to Ukraine,” his lawyer, Robert N. Driscoll, said in a statement. But the statement did not explain what role he did play, leaving the committee to guess.
In Mulvaney’s case, he has made statements that Democrats, at least, will consider evidence even if it was not under oath. During a briefing for reporters last month, Mulvaney admitted that Trump suspended $391 million in U.S. security aid to Ukraine in part to force Ukraine to investigate a debunked conspiracy theory involving Democrats during the 2016 presidential campaign. Mulvaney later tried to take it back.
Those comments as well as statements by the offices of officials like Pence and Energy Secretary Rick Perry raise the question of whether they have effectively waived any claim of immunity from testifying because they have publicly addressed the matter, according to lawyers. But Democrats may not take the time to litigate the question.
Rep. Tom Malinowski, D-N.J., who serves on the Foreign Affairs Committee that was involved in the Ukraine investigation at an earlier stage, pointed to Mulvaney’s public acknowledgment about the link between aid and an investigation as well as other testimony about figures like Bolton and Pompeo.
“I very much want to hear from them,” he said. “But if they lack the courage of their colleagues to testify under oath, we can assume that what we’ve learned about their views and actions is true.”
An impeachment proceeding is not the same as a criminal court process, of course, and the standard of evidence is not the same. The House can move forward with whatever evidence a majority considers sufficient. And to the extent that the processes can be compared, an impeachment would be the political equivalent of an indictment, signaling that there is enough evidence to merit a trial in the Senate, though not necessarily enough to convict.
Still, even in the relatively quick investigation conducted in the two months since Pelosi formally opened the impeachment inquiry, the basic facts of what happened have been established and to a greater or lesser degree verified by different witnesses.
“The reality is there’s not much ambiguity about what took place here,” Buck said. “We know what happened, and now members and voters have to decide whether it rises to the level of removing him.”

Paul Krugman: Donald Trump and the Corrupt Old Party

Texto completo: Formally, the House of Representatives is holding an inquiry into the question of whether Donald Trump should be impeached. In reality, we’ve known the answer to that question for a long time. In a different era, when both parties believed in the Constitution, Trump’s abuse of his position for personal gain would have led to his removal from office long ago.
No, what we’re actually witnessing is a test of the depths to which the Republican Party will sink. How much corruption, how much collusion with foreign powers and betrayal of the national interest will that party’s elected representatives stand for?
And the result of that test seems increasingly clear: There is no bottom. The inquiry hasn’t found a smoking gun; it has found what amounts to a smoking battery of artillery. Yet almost no partisan Republicans have turned on Trump and his high-crimes-and-misdemeanors collaborators. Why not?
The answer gets to the heart of what’s wrong with modern American politics: The GOP is now a thoroughly corrupt party. Trump is a symptom, not the disease, and our democracy will remain under dire threat even if and when he’s gone.
The usual explanation you hear for GOP acquiescence in Trumpian malfeasance is that elected Republicans fear being defeated in a primary if they show any hint of wavering. And that’s certainly an important part of the story.
Republicans haven’t forgotten what happened in 2014, when David Brat, a Tea Party insurgent, ousted Eric Cantor, at the time the House majority leader. Cantor was a hard-line conservative, but mild-mannered in affect, and perceived as soft on immigration. The lesson was that the GOP base demands red meat, and these days that means supporting Trump no matter what.
But electoral fears aren’t the only thing keeping Republicans in line.
On one side, I don’t think most observers realize, even now, the extent to which many Republicans view their domestic opponents not as fellow citizens but as enemies with no legitimate right to govern.
Attorney General William Barr says that progressives are “militant secularists” out to “destroy the traditional moral order.” If that’s how you see the world, you’ll support anything — up to and including soliciting and/or extorting intervention by foreign powers in U.S. elections — that helps defeat those progressives.
On the other side, it’s notable that with few exceptions even Republicans who are leaving or have left office still refuse to criticize Trump. There has been a wave of Republicans announcing retirements from the House, and there’s little question that some of these politicians are leaving because they’re disgusted with serving this administration. Yet almost none have said so explicitly, even though they won’t be facing any more primaries. What keeps them in line?
The answer is, follow the money.
What, after all, do retired officials do for a living? Many become lobbyists, and in an era of extreme polarization that means lobbying their own party. Being honest about why you quit would be bad for future business.
Beyond that, the modern U.S. right contains many institutions — Fox News and other media, right-wing think tanks, and others — that offer sinecures to former officials. However, this “wing-nut welfare” — which has no counterpart on the left — is available only to those who continue to toe the line.
Earlier I mentioned David Brat, who ousted Eric Cantor. As it happens, Brat himself was defeated in last year’s Democratic landslide. So what’s he doing now? He’s dean of the business school at Jerry Falwell Jr.’s Liberty University.
So financial incentives keep even retiring Republicans in line. And the exceptions prove the rule.
As far as I can tell, Gordon Sondland, who is ambassador to the European Union — but surely not for long — was the first political appointee, as opposed to professional civil servant, to attest to the Trump administration’s abuse of power in Ukraine. A key point about Sondland, however, is that he’s a rich man who doesn’t need wing-nut welfare.
He’ll live comfortably in retirement as long as he doesn’t go to jail. So his incentives were very different from those facing most GOP figures.
So are all Republicans corruptly subservient to Trump? No, there are some honorable Never Trumpers, including many of the foreign-policy neocons like William Kristol. Some of us will never forgive this group for misleading us into war, but it turns out that they really do have principles and deserve recognition for their current political courage.
But the modern GOP as a whole is overwhelmingly fanatical, corrupt or both. Anyone imagining that the mountainous evidence of Trump’s malfeasance will lead to a moral awakening, or that Republicans will return to democratic political norms once Trump is gone, is living in a fantasy world. Even catastrophic electoral defeat next year probably wouldn’t do much to change Republican behavior.
The big question is whether America as we know it can long endure when one of its two major parties has effectively rejected the principles on which our nation was built.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – Un exfuncionario de la Agencia Central de Inteligencia (CIA) que pudo haber devastado la recopilación de inteligencia de Estados Unidos en China al entregar a su red de informantes a Pekín fue sentenciado el viernes a 19 años de prisión.
Jerry Chun Shing Lee, un ciudadano estadounidense naturalizado que trabajó para la de 1994 a 2007, fue arrestado en enero de 2018 por poseer ilegalmente información clasificada de defensa estadounidense, que según los fiscales, entregó a los agentes de inteligencia chinos.
“Lee traicionó a su propio país por codicia y puso en riesgo a sus antiguos colegas”, dijo Timothy Slater, subdirector de la oficina de campo del FBI en Washington. “La seriedad de su traición y crimen se demuestra con la sentencia de hoy”, indicó.
La acusación asegura que Lee se mudó a Hong Kong en 2010 y comenzó a aceptar pagos de agentes chinos que le pidieron información confidencial sobre la CIA.
Pero en mayo pasado, Lee, de 55 años, se declaró culpable de un cargo de conspiración por entregar información de defensa nacional para ayudar a un gobierno extranjero, al tiempo que insistió en que el gobierno nunca probó que dio información a los chinos ni que haya aceptado $840,000 dólares de Pekín, como se alega.
El caso ha generado mucha especulación sobre lo que realmente hay debajo, porque le tomó al gobierno seis años desde la primera investigación de Lee hasta su arresto.
Informes de medios de prensa lo vincularon con la destrucción catastrófica de la red de informantes de la CIA en China entre 2010 y 2012.
El New York Times informó en 2017 que los chinos mataron a “al menos una docena” de fuentes que la CIA tenía dentro de China y encarcelaron al menos a otras seis.

The real bombshell? Learning to say 'Kyiv'

Texto completo: Other Voices
As the first public impeachment hearings transfixed the country last week with revelations on a recalled ambassador and quid pro quos, America's collective mind was blown by another bombshell.
"Wait, so Kiev is pronounced KEEVE (rhymes with Steve)?!?," star political forecaster Nate Silver wondered as many others online marveled that they had been pronouncing the Ukrainian capital wrong their whole lives. I made a 30-second video explaining the lesson in post-Soviet politics: Kiev is a transliteration from Russian, Kyiv is the preferred Ukrainian transliteration, and after simplifying Ukrainian's guttural vowels for American speakers, the proper pronunciation is "Keeve." It's now my most popular tweet ever; apparently, this is the content Impeachment Twitter craves.
Beneath this quirky language lesson, however, lies a battle over the pages of history that Ukrainians in the era after their Maidan revolution - which began six years ago Thursday - have been struggling to rewrite.
Throughout its existence, the Ukrainian nation had been dominated by nearby powers, including Russia, Poland and Austria-Hungary. Before 1991, when Ukraine gained independence from the Soviet Union, it had never existed as an independent state. The lens through which the modern world saw Ukraine was undeniably Russian. The language of higher education, of government and of privilege was Russian.
Ukrainian speakers were often ridiculed as provincial, or even politically, professionally and criminally chastised for their use of their native language. Taras Shevchenko, an artist, poet and Ukrainian national hero whose statue stands near Dupont Circle in Washington and in hundreds of locations across Ukraine, was exiled and sentenced to compulsory military service for promoting Ukrainian independence and writing poetry in Ukrainian, which the authorities referred to as "little Russian."
Since 2014, when Russia illegally annexed Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula and fomented a war in the country's eastern Donbas region, authorities in Kyiv have made a concerted effort at re-Ukrainianization, even down to the name of the capital city itself. It is not just a difference of transliteration but one of history, Ukrainians argue. The legendary founder of Kyiv, from whom the city gets its name is Prince Kyi, not Prince Kie.
The name also has political implications. The Ukrainian Ministry of Foreign Affairs launched the #KyivNotKiev campaign last year to gain recognition for the Ukrainian spelling of the country's cities. "Under the Russian empire and later the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR)," the ministry wrote, "Russification was actively used as a tool to extinguish each constituent country's national identity, culture and language. In light of Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine, including its illegal occupation of Crimea, we are once again experiencing Russification as a tactic that attempts to destabilize and delegitimize our country."
Kyiv has gone to great lengths to protect its information space, undertaking domestic measures that have been criticized as anti-democratic, including blocking Russian social media platforms and establishing quotas for the usage of Ukrainian in print and on the radio and television.
Ukrainians aren't exaggerating when they describe Russian language as a cudgel of Kremlin influence. Putin has claimed that his aggressive foreign policy in places such as the Baltic states, Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine has been in defense of Russian speakers and their rights. The Russian government funds a Russian cultural and language organization, called "Russki Mir" or "Russian World," which acts as an arm of Russian influence and soft power around the world. Russian-language media outlets posing as local media have peddled disinformation and targeted Russian-speaking populations across the former communist space.
Despite this background, embassies, media outlets and airports worldwide have been slow to correct their style guides and flight monitors; the capital's official transliteration has been Kyiv since 1995, but mentions of "Kiev" are still common. The very fact that so many Americans were puzzled by the official pronunciation of Kyiv shows how effective the Kremlin has been in promoting its worldview.
Though Ukrainians may not expect Americans to master the guttural first syllable, they are rightfully offended when they see a spelling of their capital that has been defunct for nearly 25 years bandied about in print and on the international stage. And as inaccuracies abound, their country is once again thrust into the limelight, perceived as a football, or worse - a casualty in a battle between great powers. But Ukrainians have agency. The least we can do is refer to their capital by its official name.
Since the quid pro quo drama began, at least, both the Washington Post and the New York Times finally announced they would use the Ukrainian spelling. For Kyiv, perhaps there is a silver lining, however thin, in the impeachment cloud.

Texto completo: It was interesting to me that the article at the top of the Post-Gazette's front page on Nov. 14 was about the death penalty phase of an ongoing criminal trial in Westmoreland County for Rahmael Holt.
The jury reportedly took only an hour to convict this man on all counts in the murder of Officer Brian Shaw in New Kensington. It took only two hours to sentence the 31-year old man to death. It is ironic to me that a society so outraged by murder would be in such a hurry to rush to judgment to murder someone else.
The same day, a letter from Cyril Wecht, M.D., addressed the Texas execution for Rodney Reed, and the prominent forensic pathologists who disagree on the evidence that convicted him of killing a Caucasian woman, 19-year-old Stacey Stites, 20 years ago "Nov. 14 letter, "Battle for Justice"). Protests against the upcoming execution are widespread and public. Oprah Winfrey, Kim Kardashian, et al. won the fight for a stay of sentence. The Innocence Project has so many of these cases. Bryan Stevenson's "Just Mercy," a New York Times bestseller is full of examples of his appeals on capital cases.
Dr. Wecht addresses the deep prejudice that exists in the criminal justice system, particularly in cases of black or Hispanic defendants and Caucasian victims.
The issue in both cases is not whether the victims were great human beings, as was Officer Shaw, but whether Rahmael Holt killed Officer Shaw and whether there is sufficient evidence presented for a conviction. It is suspect to me that the trial is so quick and the call for Holt's death so loud. This seems to have been the case when Reed was on trial.
Like Dr. Wecht, I worry that conviction and punishment are too fast when it comes to the taking of a man's life by execution. Public opinion of the case is not an aggravating factor in deciding capital cases. Public opinion is not evidence; it is politics. By now, we should all know that.

Texto completo: In a palpably tense exchange at an event in South Carolina, Joseph R. Biden Jr. sparred with an organizer protesting Obama-era deportation policies.
GREENWOOD, S.C. -- Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and an immigrants' rights activist on Thursday engaged in an unusually extended clash over Obama-era deportation policies.
For more than six minutes in a palpably tense gym here during a town hall-style event at Lander University, Mr. Biden sparred with the activist, Carlos Rojas, an organizer with the immigrants' rights group Movimiento Cosecha. The organization is urging presidential candidates to back a moratorium on deportations on their first day in office and has protested Mr. Biden before.
"You should vote for Trump," Mr. Biden admonished Mr. Rojas during one of the most heated moments, after Mr. Rojas rattled off deportation figures under the Obama administration amid scattered cries of "give him the mic!"
"You should vote for Trump," Mr. Biden repeated.
"No, no," Mr. Rojas said. "I'm not going to do that."
Mr. Biden was not the only presidential candidate to face protesters Thursday evening. In Atlanta, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts was interrupted during a speech at Clark Atlanta University by a group of charter school activists.
In South Carolina, Mr. Rojas began the exchange by translating for an immigrant named Silvia who raised concerns about the deportation numbers under former President Barack Obama.
"If you were to be president, will you stop deportations on Day 1 through executive action?" Mr. Rojas asked.
"No," Mr. Biden responded. "I will not stop all deportations. I will prioritize deportations only of people who have committed a felony or a serious crime, number one."
He walked over to stand near Mr. Rojas and Silvia.
"Number two," he continued, "to compare President Obama to this guy is outrageous."
The room applauded.
Mr. Biden went on to defend the Obama administration's record on immigration, and said he would not discuss any areas of internal disagreement with Mr. Obama. And he repeatedly said he would not back a total moratorium on deportations, even as his remarks were punctuated several times by protesters who shouted, "Not one more deportation." After Mr. Biden promised that there would not be family separations under his administration, someone shouted, "That's a lie!"
"No matter what happens, someone commits murder, they shouldn't be deported," Mr. Biden said, characterizing the protesters' position with an edge in his voice. By then, Mr. Rojas had left his seat and was standing next to Mr. Biden in the center of the room. "No, I'm asking you a question," Mr. Biden added.
The exchange finally ended as the protesters left the room and the rest of the audience applauded Mr. Biden.
In several Democratic debates this year, Mr. Biden has faced criticism from his rivals over the Obama administration's deportation practices when Mr. Biden was serving as vice president. Mr. Biden, meanwhile, is a fierce critic of the hard-line immigration policies of the Trump administration, especially of family separation.
Minutes after the immigrants' rights protesters left, he faced another interruption.
"I do not take money from corporations!" Mr. Biden said. "You listen to Bernie too much."
The clashes upended what had been an otherwise friendly town hall -- but some voters afterward commended Mr. Biden's stewardship of the incident.
Dan Healy, 70, said that he liked that Mr. Biden "said he wouldn't stop deportations for criminals."
"Yeah, he didn't back down," Mr. Healy's wife, Lora Healy, 72, said.
Ms. Warren was in the opening minutes of her speech, a major address on racial inequities, when she was disrupted. In an interview, an organizer of the protest, Dianechia Fields, 40, who is from Memphis, criticized Ms. Warren for pledging to cut funding for charter schools. Ms. Warren's education plan calls for ending federal funding for opening new charter schools and banning for-profit charters.
Ms. Warren eventually received some assistance from Representative Ayanna S. Pressley of Massachusetts, who had introduced her at the event. Ms. Pressley came back onstage and urged the protesters to let Ms. Warren proceed with her speech, which highlighted the story of black washerwomen who went on strike in Atlanta in 1881.
"We are grateful for your activism and your voice and you are welcome here, and we would love to convene after this about the issue that you are here to stoke our consciousness about," Ms. Pressley said. "But when these women have been ignored this long, this is their moment, and we are going to hear the story."
Thomas Kaplan contributed reporting from Atlanta.

Barriers zigzag across America like a scar

Texto completo: A few words about walls.
Unsurprisingly, the one Donald Trump is trying to build on the southern border – the one he swore Mexico would pay for – has proven, like most things he touches, an embarrassing failure.
First came news early this month that smugglers have been able to cut through the barrier with a simple reciprocating saw, available at The Home Depot for prices starting at less than $100. Then, TBS’ “Full Frontal with Samantha Bee” aired a segment demonstrating that the wall, which Trump has said “can’t be climbed,” can actually be climbed in as little as 15 seconds and by climbers as young as 8.
Maybe Mexico should demand a refund.
In the meantime, and with much less fanfare, construction continues on a wall of much further-reaching consequences. You see, while the wall on the border is supposed to repel immigrants and smugglers, this one repels something many of us find even more threatening: contradictory opinions.
Consider three recent news stories:
In Washington, the White House announces it will cancel government subscriptions to The Washington Post and New York Times. The administration calls it a cost-saving measure, but the truth is obvious. Trump famously hates both newspapers.
In Citrus County, Florida, county commissioners reject the local library’s request for a digital subscription to The Times. Says Commissioner Scott Carnahan, “Fake news, OK, I agree with President Trump. I don’t want the New York Times in this county.”
In Coeur d’Alene, Idaho, the library reports that an unknown patron has been hiding books critical of Trump and conservatism, deliberately mis-shelving them in other sections of the library. As that person explained in a note, “I am going to continue hiding these books in the most obscure places I can find to keep this propaganda out of the hands of young minds.”
The sheer snowflakery of all this cannot, of course, be overstated. And yes, it reeks of anti-intellectualism, that proud, bullyboy ignorance that has too often fed books – and bodies – into bonfires.
But this also speaks to barriers of intellectual – and emotional – separation that now zigzag across America like a scar, splitting towns, colleges, churches, workplaces, friendships and families. Nor is the barrier only being built from one side. As liberal college students demand “safe spaces” and “trigger warnings” so they won’t have to confront contradiction of their beliefs, it becomes painfully clear this wall is a bipartisan project. And that should concern us all.
This is no argument for false equivalence, nor even for civility. But it is an argument for intellectual freedom – for honoring people’s sacred right to speak and to hear.
The genius of America has always been that it believed in the marketplace of ideas, believed we should have access to the broadest possible range, and that if we did, we would, more often than not, choose the good over the bad, the right over the wrong, the intelligent over the stupid.
Yes, that trust has been sorely tested lately, but is the answer to abandon it completely? To do so would be to abandon everything that makes this country worth the trouble. To do so would be craven and un-American. As in commissioners of a podunk Florida county defending its citizens from The New York Times.
One doesn’t know whether to laugh or cry. That wall Trump is trying to build against immigrants will go down as an expensive boondoggle. But you know what will cost us more in the long run?
Any wall we build against ourselves.

Witness's Oft-Blunt Testimony Aligns With His Uncompromising Lawyer

Texto completo: The lawyer, Robert Luskin, also represented the Republican strategist Karl Rove and likely spared him a perjury charge.
WASHINGTON -- The Republican strategist Karl Rove told a federal grand jury conducting a high-profile investigation in 2004 that he had never talked to a journalist who disclosed the identity of an undercover C.I.A. officer. Eight months later, he advised that he had refreshed his recollection: Actually, he had talked to the journalist.
Mr. Rove's lawyer, Robert D. Luskin, was credited with unearthing email evidence that prodded his client to amend his testimony -- and possibly spared him an indictment for perjury.
On Wednesday, Gordon D. Sondland returned to the House impeachment inquiry, his memory significantly refreshed, and effectively rewrote his own testimony last month about President Trump's efforts to pressure Ukraine for potential political gain. Mr. Luskin, his lawyer, sat beside him as he demonstrated his improved recall.
At 69, Mr. Luskin, a cancer survivor, has cultivated a reputation for independence, hard work, a lack of gamesmanship and a series of tests for prospective clients. In an interview last month, he said he would not represent jerks, using a more profane term. He will not serve as a public attack dog. And he will not defend those who lack a healthy respect for and fear of legal proceedings.
"I'm too old to take a coach seat on a kamikaze flight," he said.
Mr. Sondland, the ambassador to the European Union and a major figure in the Ukraine saga, apparently fit Mr. Luskin's bill. So far, he is the only witness who dealt repeatedly and directly with Mr. Trump and who is cooperating with the House inquiry into whether the president abused his power in pressing Ukraine's president to announce investigations that could benefit Mr. Trump personally.
Even with Mr. Luskin by his side, the ambassador fared poorly with House investigators when he first testified behind closed doors on Oct. 17. Testimony by subsequent witnesses exposed holes in Mr. Sondland's account of his role in the Ukraine affair. He was forced to amend it in writing.
Andrew Weissmann, a former prosecutor on the special counsel's team that investigated Russian interference in the 2016 election, said he could imagine the advice that Mr. Luskin gave Mr. Sondland before he returned to the witness table.
"There is no doubt in my mind that he had a tough-love conversation with him that said, 'You are coming clean now, or else, a) I'm not representing you or, b) all bets are off,"' Mr. Weissmann said on MSNBC. "Basically you already had one bite at the apple and you saw what happened. There are documents out there. There are credible witnesses out there. You better tell the truth."
Mr. Sondland remained fuzzy about many details of the Ukraine saga on Wednesday, the result, he said, of the administration's refusal to release records to him. But he was adamant about two crucial points: that he acted at the president's express direction, and that he kept top officials, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Vice President Mike Pence, "in the loop."
Mr. Sondland refused to go along when members of Congress tried to reword his testimony to support their views. "I am not going away in circles with you," he told Representative Sean Patrick Maloney, Democrat of New York, at one point. "Be clear what you're asking me."
Mr. Sondland's blunt performance aligned with the independent streak that Mr. Luskin has displayed over his career. A life-size wooden hand, middle finger raised, sits atop his office coffee table. He was reportedly the first male lawyer to wear an earring while arguing a case before the Supreme Court. He rides a Ducati Monster motorcycle and owns a small plane that he pilots himself.
In a 2005 interview, he said there was always a moment in Washington scandals when bullies took over, be they pundits or journalists or lawmakers. "I have this incredibly strong urge to kind of step in front of my client and say, 'Don't you dare do that stuff to him,"' he said.
That urge apparently persists. As he arrived at the Capitol for Mr. Sondland's initial closed-door testimony last month, a journalist approached with a question. In a moment captured on camera, Mr. Luskin, himself a former reporter, pushed him aside without breaking his stride.
"Bob Luskin is not airbrushed," said Jamie Gorelick, a lawyer with the law firm of WilmerHale and the deputy attorney general during the Clinton administration. "He is wickedly smart, very sophisticated and very much his own man."
A Harvard Law School graduate and liberal Democrat, Mr. Luskin is now a partner at the law firm Paul Hastings. His most satisfying case in his long career, he said on Wednesday, was his decade-plus of work overhauling the Laborers' International Union of North America as part of a settlement of a civil racketeering case.
He cut a deal with the Justice Department that allowed the 800,000-member union to create its own internal system to ferret out corruption rather than be ruled by a court-appointed monitor.
Justice Department officials were initially highly skeptical about whether the arrangement would work, said Frank Marine, the prosecutor on the case. "This was the first time we had done this," he said.
The prosecutors demanded the right to pull out of the deal at the end of every 90 days. But they never had to use it.
"In the first 90 days, he achieved quite a bit. Then he kept going and kept going," Mr. Marine, who is now retired, said of Mr. Luskin. "He did just about everything he said he would do."
"If I was ever in trouble," Mr. Marine said, "he would be the person I would hire."

Texto completo: Over the weekend, Bravo hosted its first conference, bringing together "Bravolebrities" and the people who really, really love them.
First, I needed coffee. After I found a seat in the packed ballroom before the first panel on the first day of the first BravoCon this past Friday, I headed to the concession stand in search of caffeine. It was a little before 10 a.m.
"Sorry, we aren't open yet," the woman behind the counter said. I stood there for a moment, absorbing the bad news, when another woman walked up and asked: "When will you have alcohol?"
There would be plenty of options soon. You could visit the "Southern Charm" bar or the Mazel bars, pick up a can of Loverboy (a sparkling hard tea from members of the "Summer House" cast) or learn to make cocktails with Tom Sandoval and Tom Schwartz of "Vanderpump Rules." (The coffee soon came, too.)
For now, we both slunk back to our seats empty-handed. But we wouldn't be sitting for long. There would be a lot of standing at BravoCon, a three-day conference for superfans of the cable network, because these people were, well, pumped.
As soon as Andy Cohen, an executive producer of the "Real Housewives" franchise and the host and executive producer of "Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen," hit the stage at the Manhattan Center in New York City, the crowd was on their feet, screaming and cheering. We stood again as each panelist, all former "Housewives," came out. (The panel was called Bravo All-Stars: OG Housewives Edition.)
Later in the evening, at a taping of "Watch What Happens Live," we rose again and again with religious fervor as more than 75 "Bravolebrities" (what the network calls its shows' stars) were paraded out over the course of two hours.
There would be lots of standing throughout the day -- in line to take photos with the likes of Tinsley Mortimer of "The Real Housewives of New York City" and Jeana Keough, formerly of "The Real Housewives of Orange County"; at the back of a room for a panel called Empire State of Wives because all the seats were taken; while walking from site to site for panels, brunches, shopping and dinners.
Everyone seemed happy to do it, and just really (really) happy to be there. When three-day passes for BravoCon went on sale in August, they were gone in less than a minute. A weekend of live events in New York City and the chance to get up close to the faces normally seen only on TV and on social media? Sold -- for $ 299.50 to $ 1,499.50 to attend all three days, depending on how much access you wanted.
The Bravo stars seemed pretty happy to be there, too. They mingled and took selfies with fans as they sold their wares (books, clothes, wine) at the Bravo Bazaar. Backstage before "Watch What Happens Live," they mingled with each other and posed for more selfies with cast members from other shows.
"Whenever something's the first, you're like, 'Oh, is this going to be like Fyre Fest?' You never know," Mr. Sandoval said backstage. "But it's already been a huge success."
Mr. Cohen said that the idea for a conference had been floated around Bravo for years. "It's obvious the time has more than come," he said. "I can't think of another network that has this much brand loyalty, and that means so much to people."
Some of the fans in attendance wore D.I.Y. T-shirts with quotes from the shows. LED signs on the walls with phases like "whoop it up" and "turtle time" needed no explanation. (But just in case you do: Both are rallying cries to party coined by Housewives.)
"What's cool is everyone here speaks the same language and they're fluent," Mr. Cohen said.
Inside the Real Housewives Museum were artifacts that would make sense only to the faithful: breast implants that once belonged to Tamra Judge (Orange County, 2007 to present); jelly beans, referring to Kelly Bensimon (New York, 2009 to 2015) and the e-cigarette that Allison DuBois (Beverly Hills, 2010) puffed on during the epic "Dinner Party From Hell" episode.
Many fans traveled from out of state and abroad, bringing to life their group chats, Instagram fan accounts and dedicated Facebook groups. A whole cottage industry has sprung up around the network's shows: Bravo-adjacent podcasts, products and personal appearances. (The New York Times has an employee-created Slack channel dedicated to Bravo news and analysis.)
Brandon Graeter, 36, who hosts a Real Housewives party every other month with the Moxy Hotels, said the Housewives have affected how we communicate online.
"Shows like 'Atlanta' completely changed the landscape for GIFs culture and making meme-able moments out of sound bites," Mr. Graeter said. "I see a lot of people using Housewives GIFs now and memes that don't even watch the Housewives, but they're so familiar now with these people."
Micara Ludens, 32, and two friends flew from Chicago to attend the conference. She has watched the network for years and has multiple group chats with friends from college and former co-workers who have "bonded over the chaos, the mess and the love that is Bravo," she said.
"I equate this to how groups of guys talk about sports and fantasy football," Ms. Ludens said. "So in the same way that people will compete about sports teams, you have your Packers versus Bears fans, I'm Team Bethenny and everyone else is Team Ramona."
Mr. Schwartz, of "Vanderpump Rules," said over a shot of tequila and a beer: "People roast us and they make fun of us, but I think on some level they appreciate how much we give ourselves over to the show. It's almost cultish with Bravo fans. They're very passionate."
Bravo has worked hard to build that cult, partly by seeming to laugh with the audience.
"We've had a thing with editing that we've called the 'Bravo wink,' where sometimes we're winking at the audience," Mr. Cohen said. "Because someone is saying one thing and they're doing a completely opposite thing. Are people in on the joke that are on the channel? There is no joke, that is their lives. And they're very proudly living them."
On "Watch What Happens Live," questions from callers are peppered alongside Mr. Cohen's, and live polls let viewers weigh in on the discussion.
"The content really is mainly driven by what we think the fans want and what the fans tell us they want," Mr. Cohen said.
That passion was palpable at the "Watch What Happens Live" taping at Hammerstein Ballroom on Friday night in front of nearly 2,000 attendees. Grown women and men rushed the stage during commercial breaks for the chance to take a selfie or touch the hands of the stars. They danced as Kim Zolciak and Mr. Cohen performed "Tardy for the Party."
And they caught Ms. Judge at the end of the night when she stage dived into their arms.

Texto completo: The authorities decided to turn the house in Braunau into a law enforcement hub to deter neo-Nazi pilgrims.
BERLIN -- After years of wrangling over the future of the butter-yellow house in Austria where Hitler was born, the authorities have decided to turn the building into a police station, in a bid make it less of a magnet for neo-Nazis.
With the move, announced by the interior minister on Tuesday, the Austrian authorities hope to send a clear message to supporters of far-right extremism that the three-story building in downtown Braunau am Inn, near Austria's border with Germany, will not be a shrine to Hitler.
"The future use of the house by the police should send an unmistakable signal that the role of this building as a memorial to the Nazis been permanently revoked," Wolfgang Peschorn, the interior minister of Austria, said in a statement.
The building has posed a problem for the authorities for the past seven decades. The building's owner had refused for years to renovate it, making tenants hard to find. Admirers of Hitler, born there in 1889, kept returning.
The Interior Ministry took over the main lease from the family that owned the building in 1972 to ensure it had the final say on the use of the building. In 1984, the government sought to acquire the building outright from Gerlinde Pommer, a descendant of the original owners, who by that time had sole possession of the property, but she refused to sell.
At the same time, she also refused to invest in the building, making it difficult for the government to find a tenant who met the requirement to use it only for administrative, educational or social services purposes. In 2017, the government seized the building from Ms. Pommer, bringing an end to the dispute.
A redesign competition for the building's new purpose will begin this month, with work on the building to start next year, Mr. Peschorn said.
The competition will be open to architects from across the European Union in hopes of finding a concept that will ensure the "innovative use and function of the space." The winner will be announced in 2020, the Interior Ministry said.
Over the years, the house has served as a makeshift museum, a school and a library. For more than three decades an organization offering support and integration assistance for disabled people ran a workshop in the building, but the group moved out in 2011 because the owner refused to bring the building up to code.
After World War II, veterans from Austria and neighboring Germany flocked to the house, especially on Hitler's birthday. Although the neo-Nazi supporters had dwindled recently, the house remained under constant surveillance for potential problems.
Fascination with Hitler continues unabated more 70 years since the end of World War II. Sales of his paintings and memorabilia continue to draw crowds and criticism. On Wednesday, the Hermann Historica auction house in Munich is putting up for sale a top hat worn by Hitler and a cocktail dress that belonged to Eva Braun, his longtime companion.
Rabbi Menachem Margolin, chairman of the European Jewish Association, wrote to the owner of the auction house asking him to withdraw the sale, citing the rise of anti-Semitism across Europe and the "many millions of lives lost as a result of National Socialism," including the six million Jews killed in the Holocaust.
"We believe the sale of such memorabilia has little intrinsic historical value, but instead will be bought by those who glorify and seek to justify the actions of the greatest evil to affect Europe," he said. "The trade, therefore, in such items should simply not take place."

Arab Thinkers Call to Engage With Israel and Abandon Boycotts

Texto completo: Boycotting Israel is a failure, and has only helped that country while damaging Arab nations that have long shunned the Jewish state, according to a small new group of liberal-minded Arab thinkers from across the Middle East who are pushing to engage with Israel on the theory that it would aid their societies and further the Palestinian cause.
The group has brought together Arab journalists, artists, politicians, diplomats, Quranic scholars and others who share a view that isolating and demonizing Israel has cost Arab nations billions in trade. They say it has also undercut Palestinian efforts to build institutions for a future state, and torn at the Arab social fabric, as rival ethnic, religious and national leaders increasingly apply tactics that were first tested against Israel.
"Arabs are the boycott's first -- and only -- victims," Eglal Gheita, an Egyptian-British lawyer, declared at an inaugural gathering this week in London.
Calling itself the Arab Council for Regional Integration, the group does not purport to be broadly representative of Arab public opinion. Its members espouse a viewpoint that is, to put it mildly, politically incorrect in their home countries: Some have already been ostracized for advocating engagement with Israel and others said they feared retribution when they return.
Still, the few dozen members include more than a few well-known figures in places as far-ranging as Morocco, Libya, Sudan, Egypt, Lebanon, Iraq and the Persian Gulf, many of whom have begun to speak out, to varying degrees, in favor of engagement with Israel. The most recognizable name -- to Western eyes, at least -- may be that of Anwar Sadat, nephew and namesake of the Egyptian president who struck the first Arab peace treaty with Israel. He is also a critic of President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi who was expelled from Egypt's Parliament in 2017.
One of the council's main organizers, Mustafa el-Dessouki, the Egyptian managing editor of an influential Saudi-funded newsmagazine, Majalla, said that as he has wandered the region in recent years he has met many like-minded Arabs "who had kind of been waiting for somebody like me to come along."
Arab news media and entertainment have long been "programming people toward this hostility" toward Israel and Jews, he said, while political leaders were "intimidating and scaring people into manifesting it." But many Arabs -- even, to his surprise, in Lebanon, a bitter Israeli enemy -- "actually want to connect with Israelis," he added.
To a degree, the group also reflects the geopolitical alignment now linking the Persian Gulf nations and other predominantly Sunni Muslim countries with Israel, against Iran and its Shiite proxies in the region, said Mr. el-Dessouki's co-organizer, Joseph Braude, an American author and Middle East analyst of Iraqi-Jewish descent.
"The sense of Israel being somehow a greater friend or lesser enemy than Iran is a factor here," he said. But it is also one that will not last forever, he said, creating an urgency to build ties "based on common humanity, not some fleeting shared-security concern."
For the Palestinians, the council's arguments fly in the face of decades of efforts to isolate Israel in the hope that this would force it to make concessions at the negotiating table.
Even Palestinian leaders who do not support the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement oppose fully normalizing Arab relations with Israel, arguing that Israel's diplomatic gains from the Oslo peace process had only encouraged Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to expand settlements on the West Bank.
Husam Zomlot, who leads the Palestinian mission to the United Kingdom and did the same in Washington until the Trump administration closed that office, belittled the new council's members as an "extreme fringe of isolated individuals." From Tunisia, whose new president has called it treasonous to engage with Israel, he said, to Lebanon, where protesters are waving the Palestinian flag alongside their own, "the sentiment of the vast majority of the Arab world is going in the other direction."
"They are playing into the hands of Netanyahu," Mr. Zomlot said, because Mr. Netanyahu wants to "convince the Israeli electorate that he can have the cake and eat it too: keep the occupation and still normalize relations with the Arab world."
Mr. Netanyahu, indeed, has long posited that Arab nations are so eager to engage with Israel, culturally and commercially, that they will come around to normalizing ties even in the absence of a Palestinian state.
The Arab Council's members, however, explicitly reject the view that it is possible for Arab countries to reach formal diplomatic relations with Israel without resolution of the Palestinian conflict. And they argue that polls show that when Israelis are offered the enticement of acceptance by Arab nations, they become more willing to compromise, even by giving up land.
Mr. Sadat, for one, heaped enormous criticism upon Israel over its treatment of the Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza and of its own Arab citizens, as well as for "supporting the current autocratic regime in Egypt." All those things, he said, were adding to what he called the "Egyptian guilt quotient" over having made peace with Israel in the first place.
Some participants urged measures like establishing a teachers college and research institute with campuses in Casablanca, Amman, Haifa and Manama. And an Iraqi counterterrorism expert living in Germany, Jassim Mohammad, urged Arab security services to stop the spread of "radicalism and hate" in the media, schools and mosques and to spread "corrective content about Israel and Jews" instead.
He called this a "matter of Arab national security."
"The tools of scapegoating and blame deflection that initially targeted Jews and Israel have long since found new, local targets," Mr. Mohammad wrote, like ruling elites or rival ethnicities and sects.
The attendees received piped-in encouragement from Tony Blair, the former British prime minister, who commended them for speaking out and said that nurturing stronger Arab-Israeli ties was vital to "any realistic possibility of an enduring peace" and a two-state solution.
Mr. el-Dessouki said some members were attending at considerable risk. Egyptian citizens, including Mr. Sadat, were warned not to attend by security officials, he said.
Members praised a Lebanese cleric from Tripoli, Saleh Hamed, who attended in spite of the possibility of reprisal upon his return. "We do not deny the rights of the Jews to have a country," Sheikh Hamed said, citing the Prophet Muhammad's kindness toward Jews. But he was careful to add that the Palestinians "should have their lands according to the 1967 borders."
Sukayna Mushaykhis, a Saudi news anchor in Dubai, recalled seeing Lebanese officials abruptly exit a meeting in San Francisco when they learned that their hosts were Jews. "And yet today," she said, "I hear a man of faith coming from a state that is governed by Hezbollah, and he talks with so much bravery and courage."
The group met privately, citing security concerns, but allowed The New York Times to monitor the proceedings, which were held in Arabic, by live stream on the condition that it not report on them until the conference had concluded. The conference was funded strictly by American donors, but organizers said they planned to raise money in the region as a going concern.
They stressed that they received no aid from any government and that no Israelis were involved in any way.
In a founding document, the members urged their adversaries to debate them constructively "rather than resort to old methods of silencing critics and demonizing reformers."
Only one Palestinian was in attendance: Mohammed S. Dajani Daoudi, an academic who said he lost his post at Al Quds University in East Jerusalem after his bridge-building efforts with Israelis led him to take a group of Palestinian students to Auschwitz to learn about the Holocaust.
Mr. Dajani called for educating a new generation of peacemakers, lamenting that the Oslo process had failed to achieve peace in part because the "peace discussed between diplomats and generals was never fully matched by preparations for a wave of peace between peoples, allowing spoilers on both sides to win the day."
Asked why the only Palestinian participating was already something of an outcast, Mr. Braude said that younger Palestinians were interested, but that there were none well-established enough in their careers yet to withstand the blowback.

Use of facial recognition software on driver license photos? Utah lawmakers don’t like it.

Texto completo: A proposal to clearly authorize but regulate the use of facial recognition software on Utah’s driver license database fell flat at the Legislature on Wednesday, with the bill facing a bipartisan chorus of concerns related to privacy and warrantless searches.
But the bill’s sponsor, West Valley Republican Sen. Dan Thatcher, warned that inaction would mean the practice continues without legal guardrails as the state’s Department of Public Safety works to block bad actors from obtaining fraudulent identification.
“If we are going to issue a government ID,” Thatcher said, “then the onus is on us to ensure that we are not issuing an ID that can be used for identity theft or voter fraud or any of the other bad things you can do.”
Thatcher said that prior to the department’s adoption of facial recognition technology roughly 10 years ago, people were able to apply for and obtain a valid, government-issued identification card under a false name or birth date. That meant minors being able to engage in age-restricted activities, he said, and individuals applying for lines of credit with someone else’s information.
“They weren’t even fake IDs, they were real IDs issued by the state of Utah,” Thatcher said. “The way we found to stop that from happening was with the use of facial recognition software.”
When lawmakers first discussed the issue in September, there seemed to be some support for banning use of the technology on driver licenses. Several members expressed outrage at the revelation, first reported by the Washington Post and New York Times, that Utah was among a handful of states allowing the FBI and Immigration and Customs Enforcement mined data in millions of driver licenses.
Department of Public Safety officials said while such searches were conducted looking for identified suspects in criminal cases, the reports were overblown and denied there were wholesale fishing expeditions taking place.
Under Thatcher’s proposal, Utah driver license applications would include a disclaimer that a person’s image may be used to conduct facial comparisons “in relation to a criminal investigation or a fraudulent or inaccurate application, to mitigate a life-threatening emergency, or to identify an at-risk or deceased person.”
The bill would establish the Department of Public Safety as the only government entity authorized to use facial recognition software, and Thatcher said he intended to add an amendment that would require a warrant for “ongoing” investigations, but not for routine image comparisons.
Members of the Government Operations Interim Committee raised several objections, including that the bill would not allow Utahns to opt out of having their images used, that it would include comparisons to minors in the driver license database, and that it could run afoul of constitutional restrictions on warrantless searches and seizures.
And Rep. Karen Kwan, D-Murray, said that previous committee discussion on the topic had led her to expect a bill that would halt the use of facial recognition software — rather than authorizing it in state law — until those and other questions could be resolved.
“I still have my initial concerns about the use of the software,” she said.
The bill was also opposed by representatives of the Utah Eagle Forum and the ACLU of Utah, who urged committee members to continue working toward consensus legislation.
“We can do better,” said ACLU attorney Marina Lowe. “We can come up with a set of rules that I think we can all live by.”
Maryann Christensen, the Eagle Forum’s executive director, said it "makes no sense” to simply write a law adopting current Department of Public Safety practices just to have a law in place.
“I would vote against this bill,” she said, “I hope you’ll do that and that you will look to the future.”
Thatcher repeatedly attempted to compare the facial recognition process to a person being pulled over on suspicion of drunken driving. Drivers can refuse to consent to a blood draw — or decline to submit their images to the driver license database — but the likely result would be the loss of their driver licenses.
“Driving a motor vehicle is a privilege,” he said. “And not a right.”
Committee members, and particularly Blanding Republican Rep. Phil Lyman, took issue with that analogy. And Thatcher, the committee co-chairman, ultimately moved to adjourn the committee before a vote could be held on his bill, effectively ending consideration of his proposal for the time being.

Texto completo: The three-day, family-friendly, annual Bluffton Book Festival is back for another year Thursday through Saturday.
The festival, whose mission is to raise literacy levels in the state and Beaufort County, benefits the Literacy Center of Beaufort County as well as the national Book Industry Charitable Foundation.
A highlight event will be held from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. Saturday on Calhoun Street when New York Times bestselling children's author and illustrator James Dean will hold a speaking event for 100 ticketed guests.
Dean will discuss his acclaimed "Pete the Cat" series and introduce his latest installment, "Pete the Cat and the Perfect Pizza Party."
The speaking event will be part of the larger street festival planned for Saturday, also from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m., along Calhoun Street between Lawton and Green streets.
The free event will feature author readings and signings, performances, crafts, games, giveaways, food and music.
The festival kicks off with four scheduled workshops between Thursday and Friday at the Lowcountry Presbyterian Church fellowship hall. The workshop schedule is:
* 9-10 a.m. Thursday: Self-editing for publication with award-winning author and editor Susan Diamond Riley.
* 10-11 a.m. Thursday: Navigating pathways to
publication with Pat Conroy Literary Center executive director Jonathan Haupt.
* 2-3 p.m. Friday: Writing believable crime fiction with award-winning author and former FBI agent Dana Ridenour.
* 3-4 p.m. Friday : Ghostwriting 101 with celebrity ghostwriter Vickie MacIntyre.
The Taste of Gullah event scheduled for Thursday evening was canceled, according to the festival's website, which states that those who registered will be refunded.
​There will be a pair of Pat Conroy-inspired lectures at the Bluffton Library from 2-4:30 p.m. Thursday.
The first will be led by Nancy Thode, whose lecture will be about her mother Ann Head. The festival website describes Head as "Beaufort's forgotten novelist and Pat Conroy's creative writing mentor."
In part two, author Bernie Schein will share stories from his newly released memoir, "Pat Conroy: Our Lifelong Friendship."
At 11:30 a.m. Friday at the Arts Center of Coastal Carolina, Tina Lifford, star of Oprah Winfrey's and Ava DuVernay's critically acclaimed OWN Network show "Queen Sugar," will speak about her time on the show and introduce her soon-to-be-released book "The Little Book of Big Lies."
"Also learn about the area of Louisiana (much like Mitchelville on Hilton Head Island in that it was left to ancestors of slaves), which is the inspiration for the book and television show Queen Sugar," the festival website states.
From 6-9 p.m. Friday, the festival's featured authors will wine and dine with guests at the Masquerade & Mystery Under the Moonlight dinner at Oak Terrace at Rose Hill.
The dinner will feature a three-course meal, a question-and-answer session with authors, and a book-signing period. The event calls for "southern charm attire" or to come dressed as a favorite book character. There will be prizes for the best book character costumes.

Texto completo: The 14th season of "It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia" wraps up on FXX. And a live-action "Lady and the Tramp" is on Disney Plus.
What's on TV
IT'S ALWAYS SUNNY IN PHILADELPHIA 10 p.m. on FXX. The Gang closes out Season 14 with two back-to-back episodes, making "It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia" one of the longest-running live-action comedy series to date. The season, which began with attempts by Mac (Rob McElhenney) and Dennis (Glenn Howerton) to attract women by listing Dennis's bedroom on Airbnb, is expected to maintain its proudly unrefined comedy in its finale. In Episode 9 -- Part 1 of the finale -- Dennis and Frank (Danny DeVito) protest the trendy haircuts women are getting at a new salon next door, and in Episode 10 -- which was inspired by Samuel Beckett's "Waiting for Godot" -- Dennis and Charlie (Charlie Day) reflect upon their love for laser tag.
What's Streaming
LADY AND THE TRAMP (2019) Stream on Disney Plus. This remake, a live-action rendition of the 1955 classic, made its debut on Disney's new streaming platform and follows the plot of its predecessor: A cocker spaniel named Lady -- voiced by Tessa Thompson -- meets a street mutt known as Tramp, voiced by Justin Theroux. Lady, who has been feeling neglected since her humans had a baby, joins Tramp on his collarless adventures, which include slurping spaghetti and meatballs and avoiding a persistent dogcatcher. The live-action adaptation appears to support a diverse cast and refrains from repeating the stereotypically Asian Siamese cat number from the original. However, "the new film is not as faithful to the animals' point of view as the original is," Elisabeth Vincentelli wrote in her review for The New York Times, "and the supporting furry characters are egregiously shortchanged."
THE FANATIC (2019) Stream on Amazon; Rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. John Travolta stars in this new thriller about a movie fan turned terrorizing stalker. Directed by Fred Durst, the movie follows Moose (Travolta), a mega-fan of an action-movie actor, Hunter Dunbar (Devon Sawa), who desperately wants an autograph. When Moose misses his opportunity to meet Dunbar, he begins his deep descent from an obsessive childlike man into a menacing presence, inching toward destroying Dunbar's life. Moose appears to be on the autism spectrum, Glenn Kenny noted in his review for The Times, and few other characters seem to recognize his condition. "For as much resentment as these celebrities may want to vent about their pushier fans," Kenny wrote, "there's still no excuse for the hatefulness of 'The Fanatic."'
BIKRAM: YOGI, GURU, PREDATOR (2019) Stream on Netflix. "Bikram: Yogi, Guru, Predator" chronicles the arc of Bikram Choudhury, the Indian-born hot yoga founder who built a global franchise in the 1970s. In this new Netflix documentary, the director Eva Orner explores Choudhury's ascent to fame and his power as a yogi amid recent accusations of sexual assault.

Texto completo: Readers discuss why many Americans are not paying attention and praise the testimony of three officials last week. Also: America in Afghanistan.
To the Editor:
Re "House Hearings Roll On, but Many Tune Out" (front page, Nov. 18):
Thank you for reporting on how so many Americans did not bother to listen to the impeachment proceedings last week. It helps to answer a question that was nagging at me all weekend: How on earth could anyone listen to the words of George Kent, William Taylor and Marie Yovanovitch and still not question the ethics and morality of our current president?
Cathy Bernard
New York
To the Editor:
Impeachment has invaded every cell in my body. Physically it has caused rashes and fatigue. Mentally it has left me saddened and anxious, dizzy at times, and desperate for relief. Even Valium could not overcome impeachment's toxicity. Even when conversations never touch impeachment, it remains the elephant in the room.
So the monster has triumphed. Au revoir to cable news. Sayonara to talk radio. Farewell to the written media. Hello to ESPN, western movies, "Say Yes to the Dress." You are my haven now. For the sake of all Americans, censure the guy and move on.
Howard Quinn
Bronx
To the Editor:
We Americans had the opportunity last week to hear from three stellar Foreign Service professionals. Their love for this country is unquestionable, and the dignity with which they serve us is admirable.
Anyone who has become dispirited by the stark, in-your-face corruption and degradation visited upon us by President Trump and his stable of sycophants would do themselves some good to find and watch videos of the testimony of Marie Yovanovitch, my hero, as well as George Kent and Bill Taylor. They remind me that droves of people of good character and integrity still exist within the realms of government. They give me hope.
Any American who is turning his or her attention elsewhere is missing an opportunity to see our democracy in action. May it prevail.

To the Editor:
Re "Honesty Is the Best Foreign Policy," by Elizabeth Drew (Sunday Review, Nov. 17):
During Watergate, as now, a select group of people stood up for what they saw as right. However, let us also remember that Watergate was largely ignored by the public until the investigation really heated up. When there was actual testimony that the president had, indeed, conspired to cover up wrongdoing in his own administration, people woke up.
Right now, the sad fact is that much of the general public doesn't care. Either they have other issues that are important for them, they don't read much and are ignorant of the issues involved, or they are with President Trump through thick and thin. Whatever the reason, let us hope that they wake up. I do believe that our democracy will survive because of honest people like those Ms. Drew describes.

A Marine's Plea: Don't Abandon the Afghans
To the Editor:
Re "'Democracy Doesn't Come in a Box"' (Video Op-Ed, nytimes.com, Nov. 11):
It's true that democracy does not come in a box, but it also does not happen overnight.
There is no doubt that the United States and coalition military and civilian efforts in Afghanistan have been difficult and at times ineffective or even counterproductive. But it is equally true that over the duration of the war these efforts have also produced positive results and led to significant improvements in the Afghan people's quality of life.
A hasty and poorly planned exit from Afghanistan will have negative effects on both the United States' national security and the Afghan people's welfare. It would be very unfortunate if this administration repeated the mistakes of the last administration when it hastily left Iraq.
There is no need to abandon those Afghans who have courageously fought alongside us and to give ISIS the gift of a new safe haven.
The United States must maintain an adequate level of support to Afghanistan and not throw away the gains and sacrifices of the last 18 years.

WeWork, with new owner, may cut thousands of jobs

Texto completo: Firm tries to recover after ill-fated IPO effort
WeWork could lay off thousands of employees as the company tries to recover from a disastrous attempt to go public.
About 4,000 employees could leave WeWork through a combination of layoffs, divestitures of the company's ancillary businesses or through transfers to a contractor, according to a person familiar with the matter. That means WeWork could lose about a third of the 12,500-person head count it had in June, according to a company filing.
WeWork Executive Chairman Marcelo Claure told employees that layoffs would begin this week, according to an email obtained by The Washington Post. Claure said the layoffs would be 'difficult' but necessary to create a 'more efficient, more focused and even more customer-centric organization.'
In a year of disappointing tech IPOs, WeWork stood out for its meteoric rise and fall before the company ever went public. WeWork was valued at $47 billion in January, according to Pitchbook. Last month, SoftBank announced a $9.5 billion deal to take control of WeWork .
WeWork's spectacular combustion has become a cautionary tale in a summer of underwhelming IPOs, particularly when it comes to job creation and employee wealth. Uber, whose stock price has fallen by about 36-percent since it went public in May, has laid off about a thousand employees in recent months.
Tech firms have long been criticized for generating a smaller number of jobs than traditional corporate giants as firms automate more tasks and create technology to replace people, despite their huge streams of revenue.
Still, some have been critical of WeWork's marketing of itself as a tech start-up at all, instead saying it's closer to a real estate company " and should have been valued that way.
The company's core business is converting leased buildings into co-working spaces that offer perks such as yoga classes and kombucha taps. Earlier this year, it created a parent company called We Co. and expanded into apartment rentals, data analytics and education. It filed publicly for an IPO in August.
The plans to go public disintegrated after investors questioned the company's valuation as well as the leadership of then-chief executive Adam Neumann. Neumann stepped down as CEO in September and was replaced by two co-CEOs: Artie Minson, formerly the company's co-president and chief financial officer; and Sebastian Gunningham, who was vice chairman.
Without the infusion of Softbank cash last month, WeWork would have run out of money this month. Neumann became a board observer and was given an exit package worth as much as $1.2 billion. The company's board obtained control of his voting shares.
WeWork was 'probably hiring a little ahead of itself,' said D.A. Davidson analyst Barry Oxford. Layoffs frequently follow when a company attempts to slow its growth rate and demonstrate profitability, something he said WeWork is probably trying to do.
The news of the job cuts was reported earlier by the New York Times, which said WeWork's plan involved laying off 2,000 to 2,500 people from the company's core real estate business. An additional 1,000 employees would leave as the company sells or closes its other businesses, including a private school, and 1,000 building maintenance workers would be transferred to a contractor, the Times reported.
WeWork declined to comment on the number of layoffs.
WeWork, like other 'unicorn' start-ups such as Uber, Lyft and Slack, was one of the many companies that investors and employees hoped would generate wealth on the public markets this year. The debuts were especially crucial for tech workers, for whom stock is typically a major component of total compensation, and who have fewer opportunities to sell their shares.

Texto completo: Jeffrey Epstein was arrested this summer after allegedly sexually abusing and exploiting minor girls for years in his homes across the country. Recently, a commentary by Nicholas Kristof of The New York Times, published in The Salt Lake Tribune, cited Epstein’s crimes as “just the tip of a very large iceberg,” referring to “a much larger narrative out there about girls, often girls of color, who are commercially sexually exploited, often with impunity.”
Last year, Utah saw an 123% increase in reported human trafficking cases within the state. These child trafficking crimes are symptomatic of a larger issue that our state and our country must face: the criminalization of youth of color.
The school-to-prison pipeline refers to the ways that targeted disciplinary practices and the processes of suspension and expulsion push students out of school and into the criminal justice system. The school-to-prison pipeline disproportionately affects youth of color. Nationally, black students are three times more likely to be suspended than their white peers and Latinx students are 1.5 times more likely than white students to be suspended. In Utah, black girls make up 0.6% of the female student population, but represent 7.1% of those expelled from school.
Not only are students of color suspended and expelled more frequently than their white peers, they are often disciplined more harshly within schools. Black high school girls in Utah are three times more likely both to be physically restrained as well as to be referred to law enforcement for in-school infractions than white students.
With the increased presence of school resource officers (SROs), punitive discipline can quickly turn students into criminals. Take, for example, six-year-old Kaia Rolle in Florida, who was having a temper tantrum in school when her teacher called the SRO. The officer used zip-ties to restrain her, put her in his police car, and prepared to press criminal charges, complete with fingerprinting and a mug shot.
It is in this context that girls of color are often pushed out of schools and pulled into the streets through child sex trafficking. Black girls make up about 20% of those trafficked in the United States. Children under 18 cannot consent to sex work, as recognized by a recent change to Utah’s HB 20. However, society seems more comfortable seeing youth of color as criminals than as victims, leaving them largely excluded from discussions of sex trafficking in the United States. Black and Latinx victims of child trafficking are often more likely to be disciplined for a dress code violation in school, or even arrested for child prostitution than they are to receive counseling and support.
Recently, a St. George police lieutenant and LDS bishop accepted a plea deal in a human trafficking case. For sexual battery and exploitation of a prostitute, he will pay $86.00 and spend 90 days in jail. In contrast, Cyntoia Brown, who was a 16-year-old victim of child sex trafficking spent 15 years in prison for the murder of her john.
If we are appalled at Epstein’s case, we must be equally invested in safety and justice for our youth of color. Combat their criminalization by inquiring about your local schools’ disciplinary practices and their effects and through organizations like Black Lives Matter Utah.
If you or someone you know is being trafficked, call the national hotline at 1 (888) 373-7888. And continue to push for criminal justice reform including the elimination of arrests of children for “prostitution” here in Utah. Youth of color are children, equally deserving of our love, respect, and concern. It’s about time we showed it.

Texto completo: Organizing expert Marie Kondo is hoping to spark joy among consumers with a newly launched online shop.
The tidying maven opened the shop on her website, KonMari. com, to sell books, decor and other items aimed at helping buyers stay organized.
"The goal of tidying is to make room for meaningful objects, people and experiences," reads a message from Kondo on the shop's website. "I can think of no greater happiness in life than being surrounded only by the things I love. "
Among the items you can purchase: storage containers starting at $35, a linen kimono robe for $115, and a large serving bowl for $220.
Details of the shop's launch were first reported by The Wall Street Journal.
Kondo rose to fame through her New York Times bestseller "The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up," which later led to a Netflix series, "Tidying Up With Marie Kondo. "
"Trust in your own sense of what sparks joy for you," Kondo said during an interview with USA TODAY published in August.

THE WHITE NATIONALIST IN THE WHITE HOUSE

Texto completo: White House senior adviser Stephen Miller has a white nationalism problem. Nine hundred recently uncovered emails he wrote to Breitbart.com in 2015 and 2016 reveal him to be a white nationalist sympathizer and a promoter of racist anti-immigration ideas.
At the time Mr. Miller wrote the emails, he was an adviser to then-Sen. Jefferson Beauregard Sessions III, an extremist who could do little harm to America outside the confines of Alabama.
A weird and solitary figure even by the standards of the then evolving alt-right, Mr. Miller took it upon himself to educate the folks at Breitbart about the nuances of bigotry that they simply weren't astute enough to pick up on their own.
He sent emails to favored reporters at the site he believed would push his "tips" into the mainstream. Among his favorite ideas was the "white genocide" conspiracy theory that animated the Tree of Life shooter in Pittsburgh in 2018.
Of course, we wouldn't know about his intellectual freelancing if it weren't for the investigative work of the Southern Poverty Law Center. The SPLC acquired the 900 emails from disgruntled and fired Breitbart editors eager to show the extent of Mr. Miller's dalliance with white nationalist racism and ideas.
Mr. Miller wrote the emails before he became the architect of President Donald Trump's brutal anti-immigration policies. The politics of separating families at the border and the scheme to cut nonwhite European immigration to a trickle codifies into law the rhetoric of what were once alt-right fever dreams mere months before he joined the White House.
In any other administration, the existence of 900 emails exposing a senior aide's secret life as a cheerleader for white nationalism would've resulted in a full-throated rebuke, a swift firing and a televised escort from the White House grounds by the blackest Secret Service agents on staff.
Instead, an anonymous White House official told The Daily Beast that "Stephen is not going anywhere" and that "the president has his back." White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham used a variation of the "consider the source" argument by calling the SPLC "an utterly-discredited, long-debunked far-left smear organization" that was "beneath public discussion."
What Ms. Grisham and the White House didn't do was attempt to refute the 900 emails. All of this lends credence to the theory that Mr. Miller's white nationalist ideology, far from being a disqualification for a job in the White House, is what contributed to his getting hired in the first place.
Why would Mr. Trump fire one of his closest aides for attempting to halt the so-called "browning of America" that will result in a majority-minority country by the early 2040s?
Having an unadulterated bigot helping to craft immigration policy at the highest levels is the point of Mr. Miller's presence in the Trump White House. Far from being embarrassed by Mr. Miller's proximity to the president, the administration will use him as a human dog whistle to attract voters on the racist right.
What we know of Mr. Miller's emails so far reveal him to be a white grievance merchant who had an endless supply of story suggestions for a website on the prowl for affronts to white dignity.
One of his bright ideas was to sic a Breitbart reporter on Amazon.com after the online marketplace decided to stop selling Confederate battle flags after a young white supremacist, enamored of the Lost Cause and its symbols, slaughtered nine congregants of a black church in Charleston, S.C., in 2015.
Mr. Miller also pushed to make sure that a racist French novel called "The Camp of the Saints" got as much exposure in Breitbart as it was getting on unaffiliated white nationalist websites.
The SPLC released the first in what it says will be a series of reports exposing Mr. Miller's ties to the website, so even more examples and outrages are on the way.
No one expects Mr. Trump to suddenly be appalled by a fellow dabbler in the politics of racial intolerance. Given the moral relativism of a president who can see "very fine people" on both sides of the Charlottesville, Va., clash that resulted in a peaceful protester being murdered by a neo-Nazi, it would be asking too much for him to summon the empathy required to understand why embracing racism is bad for America.
The fact that Mr. Miller has absolutely no fear of losing his White House gig despite the existence of hundreds of emails that reveal his antipathy for the rights of racial and religious minorities in this country and the ideals of universal equality is astonishing.
Mr. Miller, who is part Jewish, insists that lumping him in with the bigots of the alt-right because of his ideological track record and work on behalf of the Trump administration, is a form of anti-Semitism in itself. Embracing victimhood is yet another example of the kind of Jedi mind trick Mr. Miller regularly engages in to win arguments. It won't work. Everyone knows a scoundrel when they see one.
We've reached a point in our politics when someone with ideas as odious as Stephen Miller's need only to hunker down if getting sacked means it would result in a partisan victory for the other side. Being a white nationalist no longer means ever having to say you're sorry. The revelations about Mr. Miller that would've been shocking in any other era, have already receded into the dustbin of last week's news cycle.
Stephen Miller may be a white nationalist, but that's not a big deal in Donald Trump's White House, where bigotry is just another lifestyle choice. What matters to Mr. Trump is loyalty to his cult of personality above all things, including white supremacy. As long as Mr. Miller can keep his hood on straight and remember who's calling the shots in the whitest White House in American history, everything should be all right.

Texto completo: After her husband's death in a plane crash in 1972, she carried on his humanitarian and philanthropic legacy.
On New Year's Eve 1972, an old cargo plane was taking off from Puerto Rico with relief supplies for earthquake victims in Nicaragua. On board were five people, including Roberto Clemente, the Pittsburgh Pirates' charismatic star outfielder.
His wife, Vera Clemente, went to see him off. She didn't like the look of the plane and thought it was overloaded. In addition, the pilot was late, which annoyed her. She thought her husband should wait until the next day.
But Clemente insisted on flying that night. He was worried that relief supplies were falling into the hands of profiteers.
Shortly after takeoff, the plane plunged into the ocean, killing everyone on board. The sudden death of the 38-year-old Clemente, who was not just one of Major League Baseball's best players but also its most famous humanitarian, shocked the world. His native Puerto Rico declared three days of mourning.
For the rest of her life, Ms. Clemente, who was 30 at the time, dedicated herself to keeping her husband's memory alive and carrying on his humanitarian legacy.
She died on Saturday at 78 after being hospitalized in San Juan. The Pirates announced on Nov. 1 that she was in delicate health and had been hospitalized. The Pirates and Major League Baseball, for which she was a good-will ambassador, announced her death.
"Vera epitomized grace, dignity and strength in the wake of heartbreaking tragedy and loss," Bob Nutting, the Pirates' chairman, said in a statement.
On her own, Ms. Clemente raised their three sons, Roberto Jr., Luis and Enrique, who were 2, 5 and 6 at the time. (They survive her, as do several grandchildren.)
When he died, Roberto Clemente had been planning to create a sports center for children in Puerto Rico, and Ms. Clemente had planned to teach there.
In short order, she established the Ciudad Deportiva Roberto Clemente (Roberto Clemente Sports City), which he had envisioned as a place where young people could play sports, but where they could also learn other skills, like reading, and attend programs, like drug and alcohol rehabilitation clinics. Since then, hundreds of thousands of youths have taken part in its activities.
"When he died, I felt the responsibility to at least make a reality of a sports city, to give children the opportunity not just to become stars but good citizens," Ms. Clemente told The New York Times in 1994. "My main purpose was to do what he was planning to do."
She said she was compelled to carry out her husband's wishes not only because of the way he died but also because of the way he had lived.
"If he had died in a common way, people would still remember him," she said. "But Dec. 31, it was a special day, and his was a special mission. I admire him for that, as a person, as a human being. So his image I keep alive. I feel happy doing what I am doing."
Vera Zabala was born in Puerto Rico on March 7, 1941. She graduated from the University of Puerto Rico with a degree in business administration and worked as a teller at the government bank in Carolina, just outside San Juan.
One day in 1964 she left the bank to go to the drugstore across the street when Clemente, who was driving by, spotted her, according to David Maraniss's biography "Clemente: The Passion and Grace of Baseball's Last Hero" (2006).
He introduced himself to her inside the drugstore, but Ms. Zabala didn't give him the time of day. Besides, her father was strict and kept her on a short leash.
Clemente, who was several years into his Hall of Fame career, pursued her by calling her friends and neighbors. She kept turning him down but eventually relented.
He told her that he was in a hurry to have a family because he was going to die young but that God had a plan for him, according to Duane Rieder, founder and executive director of the Clemente Museum in Pittsburgh. Mr. Rieder quoted her as saying, "I felt God's plan for me was to assist Roberto."
They were married on Nov. 14, 1964, in Carolina, where Roberto Clemente was born, just east of San Juan, with hundreds of people in attendance, including the governor and several of Clemente's fellow ballplayers.
Clemente was killed just eight years later, and his widow stepped into the role of humanitarian.
Every year, she took an active part in choosing the winner of the Roberto Clemente Award, an honor given since 1973 to the player who "best represents the game of baseball through extraordinary character, community involvement, philanthropy and positive contributions, both on and off the field."
After Hurricane Harvey, she flew to Houston during the 2017 World Series to present the award to Anthony Rizzo, the Chicago Cubs' first baseman, who was a cancer survivor and who had established a foundation to help children with the disease.
While in Houston, she took time out to volunteer at a food bank to help families recovering from the hurricane.

Texto completo: The writers' conference is changing its aid offerings after attendees raised concerns ranging from sexual harassment to racism to the work cutting into the seminars they came for in the first place.
Every summer in Vermont, emerging and established writers gather for lectures, readings, workshops and the occasional barn dance at Bread Loaf, one of the oldest and most prestigious writers' conferences in the United States.
To offset the fees, which this year are set at $ 3,631, the conference has for decades admitted about 20 "wait scholars" a year, who receive free tuition in exchange for waiting tables and doing other kitchen and dining-hall tasks. At least three of 2019's National Book Award finalists worked as waiters at Bread Loaf, and dozens of other authors have taken up the job over the years. (I attended this year, though not as a wait scholar.)
But the conference's new director, Jennifer Grotz, said this month that she was ending the wait-scholar program and that the conference would instead direct the program's funds to scholarships with no work requirements. In an interview, Grotz, a former Bread Loaf waiter herself, cited concerns raised by waiters in 2016 ranging from sexual harassment to racism to the work cutting into the seminars they came for in the first place. She also noticed that waiters were often young writers of color, serving fellow writers who were mostly older and white.
"The optics in the dining hall were troubling, and very different from what the conference goals were," she said.
Members of the class of 2016 said their concerns were captured in a stinging essay by Jean Ho, who worked as a waiter that year. "Women waiters commiserated in the kitchen about certain male conference attendees whose stares lingered too long on our bodies, who put their hands on us to get our attention, called us 'Baby' or 'Sweetheart,"' Ho wrote. "The worst stories I heard from the black writers: a white faculty member curiously touching a black student's braids; a waiter who was asked by a white dining room guest to bring her a cup of coffee 'hot and black like you."'
Ho declined to comment, but another person who attended that year and worked as a waiter, Benjamin Aleshire, corroborated what she wrote. "It was very apparent to me that the whole Bread Loaf waiter system was this outdated, classist dinosaur in need of a meteor," he said.
During the 2016 conference, Grotz, then the assistant director, and the conference's director at the time, the poet Michael Collier, met with the waiters. "All of us wept as we told stories of our working-class backgrounds and stories of racism and sexism and how this experience brought up those issues," Aleshire said.
Bread Loaf, which Middlebury College operates, began in 1926. The editor John Farrar started it with the encouragement of Robert Frost as a way for writers to meet and learn from one another. The conference typically breaks even, Grotz said, though that could change with the elimination of the waiter program.
"I'm going to have to pay dining services for the work the waiters did," she said. "We're going to be losing money this year, but I feel like it's a triumph."
Though 2016 marked a turning point, the attendees that year weren't the first to express frustrations about how they were treated.
The poet Major Jackson was a waiter in 1996 and is grateful that he was able to attend Bread Loaf. He said he could not have afforded the tuition without the scholarship, which led him to an M.F.A. program and a career as a poet and a teacher. But the experience was a complex one.
Toward the end of the conference that year, he kicked over a tea station in the dining hall and stormed out -- a story that has become Bread Loaf lore, though Jackson no longer remembers what prompted it. "Now, we have a language to talk about microaggressions, but they were there all along, no doubt," he said.
This year, two novelists who had previously attended as waiters, Ingrid Rojas Contreras and R.O. Kwon, returned to Bread Loaf. It brought back some uncomfortable memories.
Rojas Contreras recalled having to perform a song and dance for the other attendees one evening. "At one time it would have been more like a gentle hazing, when the conference was made up mostly of men, mostly of people of means, mostly white," she said. "When the population changes, when women are waiters, people of color are waiters, queer people are waiters, then it is no longer a light hazing."
She and Kwon told Grotz and the other conference organizers that they wanted writing institutions like Bread Loaf to be more supportive of people from marginalized identities.
"I knew in my heart exactly what to do," Grotz said. "Once I wrapped my head around that, I tried to make it happen."

Texto completo: Whoopi Goldberg likes to fly solo.
On Monday, "The View" co-host revealed on the "Tamron Hall Show" that she has made a conscious decision to live alone with her 20-year-old cat, Oliver.
"When you make a commitment to live with someone else, it’s a commitment to ask their opinion and listen and work it out with them. I don’t want to do that," Goldberg, 64, said. "I don’t want to share money. I know it’s terrible, but I don’t want to. "
Goldberg is just the latest celebrity to share her preference of living alone.
Earlier this month, "Big Bang Theory" actress Kaley Cuoco opened up about living separately from her husband Karl Cook after more than a year of marriage.
We are 'so happy': Kaley Cuoco on living separately from husband Karl Cook
"The older I get, I know now what works for me," Cuoco said on the "Brad Behavior" podcast last week. "We've been together for almost four years. We've not lived together. We are building our house, as you know. We will be under the same roof, eventually, but this has worked for us. "
Similarly, Gwyneth Paltrow revealed in June to London's The Sunday Times that she only lives part-time with TV producer husband Brad Falchuk.
Although Paltrow's unconventional living situation caught flak from "The View" co-host Meghan McCain, Goldberg defended her: "I love it. I’ve done it. I don’t want anybody in my house. "
Goldberg continued: "You can come and cook, you can come and hang out, you can sleep (over) and then you gotta go home. I don’t want your drawers on the bathroom floor!"
In 2016, Goldberg told the New York Times that she's "not that interested" in love or getting married again because she thoroughly enjoys her own space. (Goldberg has been married three times. )
"I’m much happier on my own," she told the outlet. "I can spend as much time with somebody as I want to spend, but I’m not looking to be with somebody forever or live with someone. I don’t want somebody in my house. "
Paltrow, however, said this summer that she and Falchuk were moving in together.

The 50 Greatest Dodgers of the 2010s: #43, Andrew Toles

Texto completo: Editor’s note: This is the Nov. 15, 2019 edition of the Inside the Dodgers newsletter. To receive the newsletter in your inbox, sign up here.
I broke the story of Andrew Toles’ promotion to the big leagues in the summer of 2016. One thing I didn’t include in any of my reporting at the time was this text message from a Dodgers staffer: “that could end poorly.”
The story of Toles’ career with the Dodgers hasn’t technically ended. He’s still under contract to the team, but he spent all of 2019 on the restricted list and did not play. The reason for his absence was never revealed; we only knew that Toles had the support of the organization while he was away. For a player who joined the team in a cloud of mystery, it was an appropriate fadeout to the decade.
The Dodgers were well aware of his question marks when they signed Toles as a minor league free agent. They knew Toles had been disciplined by two different college programs — kicked off the University of Tennessee baseball team in 2011 and suspended by Chipola College in 2012. They knew the Tampa Bay Rays expelled Toles from his Single-A team following a blow-up with his manager in May 2014. They knew all this because the GM who drafted and developed Toles with the Rays was none other than the Dodgers’ Andrew Friedman.
Toles’ second chance in professional baseball went much better than his first. Fast-tracked from Single-A to the majors in 2016, Toles slashed .314/.365/.505 in 48 regular season games. By October, he had ramrodded his way into the starting outfield. Toles started four of six NLCS games against the Cubs that year, going 6 for 13 (.462) with a pair of doubles. At 24 years old, Toles had made the leap from prospect, to failed prospect, to starting outfielder on a playoff team. The transformation landed him in the pages of the New York Times.
The following winter, the Dodgers jettisoned their de facto left fielder, Howie Kendrick, paving the way for Toles to seize regular playing time in 2017. However, a knee injury in May promptly ended his season. His absence on the field would have been more conspicuous without the emergence of Chris Taylor. Still, by 2018, Toles was healthy and competing for a job in spring training. There was a pathway for him to regain his standing on the depth chart.
By the final week of camp, Toles and Joc Pederson were in the running for the final outfield job. Pederson went 8 for 54 during the Cactus League season. Toles went 15 for 53. Pederson won the job anyway, and Toles began the season in Triple-A. There, a hamstring injury cost him two months. He batted .306 at Oklahoma City but never cracked a Dodger outfield rotation that now featured a rejuvenated Pederson and Matt Kemp, in addition to Chris Taylor, Kiké Hernandez and Yasiel Puig. On Sept. 29 in San Francisco, Toles singled and stole second base against the Giants. He hasn’t batted in a major league game since.
Judging only what he did on the field, Toles deserves some extolling. His postseason at-bats, limited though they were, look impressive in the context of the decade. His .792 regular-season OPS compares surprisingly well with the Dodgers’ other outfielders of the last 10 years. His effort in the outfield and on the bases was at least as impressive as hit bat. Ironically, Toles’ hard-nosed efforts landed him in the operating room and derailed his early promise perhaps as much as anything. Toles is still only 27 years old. But without knowing the substance of his off-the-field issue(s), it’s hard to say anything definitive about his future in baseball.
All we have for now are memories of one of the game’s best personalities, a talented athlete who offered tantalizing glimpses on the field. Who else points at a mean-mugging Chase Utley and says, unironically, “I wake up in the morning and I’m like, ‘how can I be like Chase Utley today?’ ” Who else admits he checked FanGraphs to see when he’d get called up from Triple-A? Who else, while being unable to walk, says (also unironically), “I’m pretty much healthy right now … besides my knee”? No one, that’s who. You can tell the story off the 2010s Dodger teams without Andrew Toles, but it wouldn’t be nearly as fun.

Local Elections May Shade 2020 Presidential Race

Texto completo: Elections always have consequences, as President Barack Obama once said, but not always the ones people expect.
For now, statewide trends seem to favor the still-unknown Democratic presidential nominee beating Republican President Donald Trump in Pennsylvania next year and reversing his shocking Keystone State win three years ago.
But G. Terry Madonna, the longtime Franklin & Marshall College political analyst and pollster, doesn’t see the trends as surefire forecasts.
“Midterms are not predictive of general elections that follow,” he said. “Ask Barack Obama.”
Republicans, aided by the tea party movement, won control of the U.S. House in 2010, only two years after Obama’s election, but Obama won re-election in 2012 anyway.
Trump’s win here hinged heavily on an almost 20-percentage-point win in Luzerne County and cutting Obama’s 27-point 2012 win in Lackawanna County to less than 4 points for Democrat Hillary Clinton in 2016. Clinton still won Lackawanna, but county Republican Chairman Lance Stange Jr. thinks the county is within Trump’s reach next year.
Nonetheless, Democrats have plenty of reasons for optimism.
For starters, Trump’s polling numbers in Pennsylvania remain mixed at best. A recent Franklin & Marshall poll showed more than half of voters with a strongly unfavorable view of him and believing he’s doing a poor job.
Voting trends seem to reflect that.
Last year, Democrats picked up 11 seats in the state House, netted five seats in the Senate and added three U.S. House members.
Two weeks ago, Democrats shockingly won control of governments in the important four counties outside Philadelphia. A third of the state’s voters live in Philadelphia and Bucks, Chester, Delaware and Montgomery counties, which represent only five of the state’s 67 counties.
“The Republicans do have to be concerned about what’s going on in the Philly suburbs,” Madonna said. “What went on in 2018 and again in 2019 in the municipal and county elections was a stunning victory by the Democrats.”
Democrats swept Republicans off the Delaware County Council and gained control of county government for the first time since at least the Civil War, The Philadelphia Inquirer reported. They won a majority in the Chester commissioners office for the first time and control of the Bucks commissioners office. That means Democratic control of Philadelphia and all four Philadelphia suburban counties. Democrats flipped Montgomery years ago.
Almost two-thirds of southeastern voters support the impeachment inquiry into the president, according to the Franklin & Marshall poll.
“It bodes well for Democrats,” Democratic strategist Mike Mikus said.
As concerned as they are, Republicans downplay the Democrats’ southeastern Pennsylvania gains. They point out Trump lost the southeast in 2016 and still won the state by 44,000 votes.
“The Republican Party has been bleeding votes in the southeast for many years,” Republican strategist Vince Galko said. “I think the national atmosphere expedited it this time around.”
Republicans point to gains of their own in Pittsburgh’s suburban counties. They flipped control of commissioners offices in Washington, Greene and Westmoreland counties, three row offices in Cambria County and two row offices in Beaver County. They also kept control of commissioners offices in Beaver, Lawrence and Fayette counties.
“However, it’s going to come down more to who’s the president running against, what is the atmosphere at that time?” Galko said. “Is it Joe Biden or Elizabeth Warren or someone else? Certainly, that’s going to be a larger factor than just the outcome in southeast PA in this past election.”
In 2016, Galko said, voters went for Trump “because they were just sick of the system, sick of the status quo.”
“They may have been unsure about President Trump, but they wanted somebody to go down to D.C. and knock some tables over. They gave him the benefit of the doubt,” he said. “Will he earn that this time around again? I’m not sure, but I do think the economy is really helping him with those voters. ... We are living through the greatest economy of our lifetime right now.”
Mikus said Republican gains in suburban Pittsburgh matter less.
The southeastern counties where Democrats gained ground have three times as many voters as the southwestern counties where Republicans did.
“The southwestern counties got redder, but they weren’t by big margins,” Mikus said. “They were fairly close races. ... I take heart with that. I don’t think Republicans have much room to grow.”
A Trump victory would give Republicans back-to back wins here for the first time since 1988 when Vice President George H.W. Bush followed up President Ronald Reagan’s 1984 victory. A recent New York Times/Siena University poll had Trump trailing Biden in Pennsylvania by only 3 points, tied with Warren, a U.S. senator from Massachusetts, and a point behind Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont.
“The real question is will the enthusiasm level of Trump’s core support, at least where you are (in Scranton/Wilkes-Barre) and out in the southwest be sufficient to get him over the finish line in 2020, and we just don’t know that yet,” Madonna said.
Too much remains unknown, he said.
“Remember, we don’t know what’s going to happen with the economy, whether it’s strong or what happens if we slide into a recession. We don’t know if there will be a foreign policy crisis of some kind. And thirdly, we have to see how all this impeachment plays out,” Madonna said. “I won’t rule out that Trump can carry our state again. I won’t rule it out.”

Texto completo: With all due credit to Bing Crosby, busy sidewalks dressed in holiday style are the calling card of the Central West End, one of the most walkable, festive neighborhoods in St. Louis. Higher-end stores are interspersed with quirky shops and plenty of places to grab a sip or a snack.
WHILE YOU'RE THERE
Take a Window Walk: Neighborhood shops are festooned with their cheeriest decorations -- including a king-size Santa outside the World Chess Hall of Fame -- for the month of December. On Saturdays, the streets will be filled with the sounds and smells of the season, as carols are played and chestnuts are roasted. Photos with St. Nick, children's activities and carriage rides are also on the schedule. 1 to 5 p.m. Dec. 7, 14 and 21.
Fuel up: When you're halfway through your list and your energy starts to flag, there's no better remedy than caffeine. Unless it's sugar. The Central West End serves up both. Visit Kaldi's Coffee, Northwest Coffee Roasting Co. or Mary Ann's Tea Room for a coffee or tea fix. Then swing by Jeni's Splendid Ice Cream, Insomnia Cookies or the Cup for your favorite sweet treat.
Make a day of it: Take a break from spending money and pop into one of the neighborhood's many art galleries. Catch a film at Chase Park Plaza or stroll through the World Chess Hall of Fame. Create your own candle at the Candle Fusion Studio or curl up with a book at the Schlafly branch library.

Texto completo: Amy Jarrard of Minneapolis:
1 Preservation Hall Jazz Band, the Fitzgerald. Always a joyful, danceable show and even being seated at the Fitz couldn't prevent that. Their latest "A Tuba to Cuba" album paired perfectly with New Orleans classics and some incredible solos by ridiculously talented musicians.
2 "The Apollo," HBO. This documentary surveys the 85-year history of the world-famous theater with incredible footage and interviews over the years, including plenty about Amateur Night. The film is mind-blowing in its thorough look at the performers who've played at the Apollo, but also really hits on the importance of the theater to Harlem and African-American arts and culture.
3 The Waterboys, the Varsity. Mike Scott and the boys still have it. Great mix of the new album and all their Muscle Shoals love with the old classics. Hard to beat an enduring, brilliant lyricist and a fiddle.
Jon Bream of the Star Tribune:
1 Prince's "The Beautiful Ones" lands at No. 1 on New York Times nonfiction bestseller list. Ahead of the ever-popular Elton John's chatty memoir "Me." Maybe less is more, especially when you were so mysterious anyway.
2 CMA Awards. While country radio plays too few women, this show stepped up with lots of female singers, past and present, as performers and presenters. Too few won awards but the performers ruled, especially Reba McEntire, Kelsea Ballerini, Maren Morris and Kacey Musgraves, who gave a succinct impassioned speech: "Female energy and spirit is needed right now." Amen.
3 Tyler Childers, First Avenue. Hampered by a thick Kentucky drawl but helped by a first-rate band, he wowed for two nights. He's the real deal in country music old-school style.

Starbucks shops goes BYON — Bring Your Own Newspaper

Texto completo: At Starbucks, it's now BYON — Bring Your Own Newspaper.
In September, the Seattle-based coffee giant stopped selling national and local print newspapers at its more than 8,600 company-operated U.S. locations, including in the Coachella Valley.
That means if you want to pick up a paper copy of the Sunday New York Times, L.A. Times or, yes, The Desert Sun with your venti pumpkin spice latte, you're out of luck.
Asked why it was making the move, Starbucks gave one of those corporate-speak non-answers so typical these days: "We are always looking at what we offer our customers in our stores and making adjustments to our portfolio based on changing customer behavior," Sanja Gould, a company spokeswoman, said in a statement.
Starbucks likes to talk — make that brag — about its positive social impact. On its company website it says, "we are committed to offering Starbucks as a place for public conversation and elevating civic engagement through service." How the corporate suits at Starbucks square that with kicking newspapers to the curb, I don't know.
No doubt about it, Starbucks was a key sales outlet for print newspapers big and small. According to a story in the Seattle Times about the move, distribution via Starbucks was so valuable, the Wall Street Journal, New York Times and USA TODAY were "willing to compensate Starbucks financially, in some cases in the form of free advertising, to have their papers distributed at Starbucks."
This month, Starbucks rolled out a program to give free access to the digital versions of some newspapers to customers who connect to its in-store Wi-Fi networks (and give the company their email addresses). Among the titles touted in its email announcement of the move were The Wall Street Journal, the Los Angeles Times, Barron's, and the Chicago Tribune. Starbucks also is offering several publications owned by Gannett Co., The Desert Sun's parent company. Among those are USA TODAY, the Arizona Republic and the Des Moines Register.
Don't have a phone, or don't want to spend yet more time staring at your phone? Too bad.
Apparently, if you're a community newspaper outside of a major metro area, like The Desert Sun, you're too small potatoes to be bothered with.
Think it doesn't make a difference? It does. These days, every sale counts.
Just ask Penny Abernathy, of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill School of Media and Journalism, who keeps close tabs on the number of newspapers in the United States. By her reckoning, the U.S. has lost 2,100 newspapers since 2004. That's left nearly half of the counties in the U.S. with only one newspaper — usually a weekly. And more than 170 counties have no newspaper at all.
About 37,900 people worked as reporters, editors, photographers, or film and video editors in the newspaper industry nationwide in 2018, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics' Occupational Employment Statistics. That is down 47% from 2004.
Fortunately, there are many local businesses where you can buy a cup of joe and The Desert Sun, and we appreciate their continued partnership. Among them: The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf, Sherman's Deli & Bakery, Koffi, Ernest Coffee, Swiss Donut, Townie Bagels, and numerous 7-Eleven and Circle K outlets. Supermarkets including Gelson's, Albertsons and Jensen's Foods also sell The Desert Sun.
Go online to https://bit.ly/2Qj9mbX to search a comprehensive list of outlets where you can buy a copy of The Desert Sun.
If you want to keep up your Starbucks routine and want to BYON, please consider a home delivery subscription. We currently have a very special offer for new subscribers and returning snowbirds: Start a prepaid two-month daily home delivery subscription, or a three-month weekend (Friday-Sunday) home delivery subscription, and you will receive a free membership in the Palm Springs Historical Society (a $50 value) and a free copy of the historical society's 2020 calendar.
To take advantage of this offer, please visit our lobby at 750 N. Gene Autry Trail from 9 a.m. to noon, Monday through Friday, or call 760-322-8889 during those hours. (Other subscription offers and rates can be found at desertsun.com/subscribe)
And if you're a shop owner who would like to carry The Desert Sun, please call our Distribution Director Rich Robb at 760-778-4678.
Thanks for starting your mornings with us.

How About a Room Upgrade, and a Cocktail?

Texto completo: When booking a high-end vacation, using a travel agency can mean scoring perks and benefits that would cost hundreds, at no cost to you.
After visiting the Grand Canyon with my 9-year-old daughter in August, I splurged on a two-night stay at the Enchantment Resort in Sedona, Ariz., to cap off our mother-daughter trip. Upon arrival, we were upgraded to a two-bedroom, two-bath suite with a kitchenette, a fireplace and dual balconies facing the breathtaking red rocks of Boynton Canyon -- a significant boost from the $ 299-a-night double queen room we had reserved. Our complimentary daily breakfast could be taken in the room or at the hotel restaurant, a hotel receptionist informed us. And moments after a bellhop whisked us to our spacious suite in a golf cart, a room service attendant arrived with a fruit and cheese platter and a personalized welcome note.
The V.I.P. treatment hadn't come at extra cost or because they thought we were someone special. (I don't disclose my New York Times affiliation). I had simply booked the hotel the old fashioned way -- through a travel agent.
The move may seem counterintuitive when you can book a vacation with a couple of taps on your phone. Not to mention that major resorts and hotel chains boast lowest rate guarantees as an incentive for booking directly through their websites. But for luxury travelers who are already planning to spend upward of $ 300-a-night on their vacation, a travel adviser (as agents preferred to be called these days) can be the way to go.
To save money and enhance the quality of your trip at no cost to you, look for an adviser from a large consortium like American Express, Signature Travel Network or Virtuoso. Because of longstanding partnerships with travel companies and the sheer volume of bookings these groups generate for hotel, airline and cruise partners, they are able to negotiate special rates and perks on behalf of their clients, from free cocktails and room upgrades upon arrival to spa treatments and late checkouts. Virtuoso alone estimates it has $ 26.4 billion a year in collective buying power.
Simply put: "We buy a considerable amount from the travel providers and are able to secure additional benefits for guests," said Phil Cappelli, the senior vice president of Preferred Partnerships for Signature Travel Network. Benefits can include complimentary breakfast, food and beverage credits, airport transfers, priority access to the top tour guides for cruise passengers and more.
All those extras come at no additional cost when using a travel adviser. In some cases, you don't even need to pick up the phone. Travelers can get the same benefits at more than 1,100 hotels simply by booking at Virtuoso.com. Because the transaction is handled by a Virtuoso adviser on the back end, the traveler still gets the perks. Likewise, American Express Platinum cardmembers who book through American Express Travel have access to similar benefits whether they talk to an agent, book online or through the mobile app. (Benefits vary by card level for bookings through American Express Travel.)
Keep in mind that the relationship between agents and hotels, cruise lines and other travel suppliers is a two-way street. In return for drumming up business, some advisers not only reap benefits for their customers, they often receive benefits themselves in the form of commissions. While a good travel adviser won't risk a client's experience over such incentives, it doesn't hurt to ask how your agent is being compensated.
I did my own research before I emailed my adviser, Beth Washington at McCabe World Travel, a Virtuoso member in McLean, Va. Scouring the internet for the best deals at luxury resorts in Sedona with a pool, nearby hikes and kid-friendly activities, I narrowed my choice down to the Enchantment. The cheapest option was a nonrefundable rate of $ 623.38 for two nights or $ 718.76 with flexible cancellation. The Virtuoso rate for the same room was the same as the flexible rate and included daily breakfast (a $ 30 credit per person, per day) and $ 100 credit toward spa or golf.
In other words, if my daughter and I both had breakfast each day, which we certainly planned to, the Virtuoso deal was better than if I booked through the hotel directly. Because my daughter was too young to go to the spa and neither of us play golf, my adviser offered to apply the credit to food and beverages instead. Sold.
I handled the airline reservations myself as they were simple enough -- we used miles to fly in coach from New York to Phoenix. McCabe World Travel charges $ 45 a ticket for airline reservations, which includes after hours emergency service if any changes or delays arise. But it doesn't hurt to ask your adviser about any deals they have with airline partners.
Platinum Card and Business Platinum Card members, for example, can get discounts on front-of-the-cabin seats for themselves and travel companions traveling internationally on more than 20 airlines when they book through the American Express Travel International Airline Program at amextravel.com or over the phone.
Aside from the deals, advisers can also ease the hassle of planning a vacation -- especially for complex trips. Cruise lines in particular rely heavily on agents to send bookings their way, partly because there are so many choices involved in buying a cruise, from multiple room categories to dozens of restaurants and hundreds of land excursions. In March, Carnival Cruise Lines started a "Why Use A Travel Advisor," campaign (called WUATA) to show agents their appreciation and convince first-time cruisers that it can pay to book through an agent. The campaign includes WUATA videos with client testimonials. One cruiser's quote: "People that don't use a travel agent are crazy."
Signature's advisers have access to special negotiated programs with 34 cruise lines, including a private car, driver and guide on shore excursions valued up to $ 500 per couple in addition to shipboard credits (up to $ 500) with most partners. Virtuoso offers complimentary benefits valued from $ 800 to several thousand dollars per couple on 700 departures. Perks ranging from a bottle of wine to a spa treatment are offered on another 4,500 sailings a year.
The Bottom line: If you want V.I.P. treatment on your next trip and savings to boot, and are planning to pay at least $ 300 a night for a hotel room anyway, it can make sense to talk to an agent. Below are three travel adviser consortiums and the perks that come with booking through one of their members.
American Express Platinum Card Members
Estimated savings: About $ 550 at 1,100 hotels around the world on a stay of two nights.
What you get: Early check-in and room upgrades when available, complimentary daily breakfast for up to two guests, a "unique amenity" valued at $ 100, guaranteed late checkout at 4 p.m. and five times the usual number of Amex points or the ability to use Pay with Points on prepaid stays at Fine Hotels & Resorts Properties on AmexTravel.com.
Virtuoso
Estimated savings: More than $ 500 per stay, available at 1,400 hotels in 100 countries.
What you get: Complimentary daily breakfast; room upgrade, either guaranteed at the time of booking or at check-in based on availability; early check-in, late checkout, availability permitting for most (sometimes guaranteed); and complimentary Wi-Fi. Additional perks may include: complimentary airport transfers, spa treatments and meals.
Signature Travel Network
Estimated savings: Up to $ 500 dollars on luxury hotels on a stay of two to five nights.
What you get: Varies by hotel, but can include complimentary full breakfast, food and beverage credits, spa treatments, airport transfers, room upgrades, early check in and late check out.

Women running for president: Usually unlikable?

Texto completo: Cue the misogyny. Again.
The latest example comes from a poll of registered voters in six states expected to play outsize roles in the 2020 presidential race. Nearly four in 10 (38%) of these potentially pivotal voters agreed with this overtly sexist statement: "Sometimes, it feels like most women who run for president just aren't that likable."
The very statement, posited in a recent New York Times-Siena College poll, is at once infuriating and comical, blatantly sexist and rather preposterous. This is, after all, the first time in U.S. history that one might reasonably ask any question involving most women. And while it is not the first time one might credibly ask whether the plethora of men who run for president are likable, the mere thought of that question is, well, not thought of.
Pollsters have long tried to assess whether voters felt comfortable with candidates. Gallup first asked whether each candidate was likable in 1976. Many polls have asked whom you'd prefer to grab a beer with. But those questions addressed each individual candidate (male and, when there was one, female) and didn't conjoin – much less ridicule – a minority of them.
This presidential election, which comes during the centennial of women's voting rights, has drawn a record number of women seeking a major-party nomination (now five, after Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York ended her campaign). Yet we have one question – framed in the negative – that lumps them all together.
As Debbie Walsh, director of the Center for American Women and Politics, told me, "This is the thing that plagues and haunts women: Are they likable enough?"
Why would more than 1,400 of the 3,766 registered voters in the poll bite on a question like this? Why would they agree, either strongly or somewhat, that most women presidential candidates are unlikable?
"I'm not sure if it's just these candidates, just these women, or a deep-seated resentment," said Meghann Crawford, a pollster for Siena College.
Let's contemplate that. How well, exactly, do the respondents know most of the women? What traits do they think Sens. Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris and Amy Klobuchar, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard and self-help guru Marianne Williamson share? What could possibly make most of them unlikable? What, really, do they have in common?
And what of the dozen men who are vying for the Democratic nomination? What about the four men competing for the GOP nomination, including Donald Trump? Are most of them unlikable? Are any of them? The poll didn't ask.
It has long been a given that women in politics and elsewhere (read: everywhere) are held to different standards than men, particularly when they seek or attain power. They not only have to be overqualified, they also have to be assertive (not aggressive), smart (not haughty) and serious (but not too much). They also should be nurturing (but not smothering), empathetic (but not tearful) and able to laugh (but not cackle) at themselves (and at the sexist jokes that undoubtedly will come their way). Oh, and they shouldn't be too ambitious (read: like the men who set the standards).
If they are too (fill in the blank), they definitely will be unlikable.
But to whom? Who are these judgmental folks? The group most likely to agree that most women presidential candidates are unlikable is Republicans, at 53%. Among Democrats, who nominated a woman once and have the chance to do so again, 26% said most women who run for president are unlikable.
The next largest group of women-dislikers is people with a high school education or less, at 47%, followed by white people who either didn't attend or didn't graduate from a four-year college, at 44%. By contrast, 28% of all college graduates and white college graduates agreed that most women presidential candidates are unlikable.
Notably, women are tougher on other women than men are: 43% of women – versus one-third of men – said most of the women who run for president are unlikable.
One woman, Elysha Savarese of Florida, told The Times that female presidential candidates are "super unlikable."Savarese said Warren, the top-polling woman, has body language that is "off-putting."
"She's very cold," said Savarese, 26. "She's basically a Hillary Clinton clone."
Which is fitting. Apparently, there is only one presidential candidate in all of American history to whom we can compare Warren. It is not other Massachusetts senators, like John or Teddy Kennedy, Calvin Coolidge or John Kerry. It is not another academic like Woodrow Wilson, or a law professor like William Howard Taft. It's not eggheads like Adlai Stevenson or Barack Obama. No, Warren either is or is not the new Clinton, the one woman a major party has nominated to the highest office in the land.
Let's be clear: When we compare Warren to Clinton, we're not comparing their policies, which are relatively dissimilar.
We're comparing their personas. Or, rather, stereotypes of women's personas. Are they shrill? Are they nasty? Do they grate on you? Do they remind you of your first wife or your mother-in-law (to mention other stereotypically unlikable women)?
Clinton was a lightning rod whom a lot of people liked to dislike. She won the most votes anyway.
Imagine, then, what other women might do.
If only most of them were likable.

Texto completo: On Election Day, Sen. Susan Collins addressed a gathering at the Capitol to plug a new bill that she claims will reduce the chronic shortages of hundreds of lifesaving drugs. Most are generic sterile injectables, including antibiotics, anesthetics, painkillers, epinephrine, chemotherapeutic agents and even saline solution. This crisis has forced importation of many of them, triggering shortages in other countries.
A better title for her Mitigating Emergency Drug Shortages (MEDS) Act, co-sponsored by Sen. Tina Smith, D-Minn., might be the "Let's Kick This Can Down the Road Again Act." It's another fake solution.
S.2723 purports to restore competition by requiring the Food and Drug Administration to prioritize applications from drugmakers to make scarce drugs, among other provisions. But the FDA is already doing that. It also ignores the fact that manufacturers have halted production because of razor-thin margins; they're not clamoring for permission to make them. A similar 2017 Collins bill died, deservedly, in committee.
For Mainers like Dawn DeBois of Bangor, who suffers from a rare condition requiring monthly infusions of immunoglobulin, the bill is a cruel hoax. Last summer, her treatments, and those of countless others, were abruptly canceled by shortages, causing a recurrence of crippling symptoms.
Sen. Collins is well aware of the real root cause of this unprecedented market failure but has declined to address it: the exhaustively documented anticompetitive contracting and pricing practices, self-dealing, conflicts of interest and legalized kickbacks of giant hospital group purchasing organizations, which control purchasing of an estimated $300 billion-plus annually in drugs, supplies and services for thousands of hospitals and other facilities. I know she knows because I briefed her after an April 2018 New York Times panel.
The first group purchasing organization was organized in 1910 as a cooperative to save hospitals money - their sole purpose - by purchasing goods in bulk. That worked fine until 1987, when lobbyists sold Congress on the fiction that hospitals could save more if vendors, rather than hospitals, paid expenses. The upshot was the catastrophic "safe harbor" statute, which exempted group purchasing organizations (and later, pharmacy benefit managers, which distribute prescription meds to consumers) from criminal prosecution for taking kickbacks from vendors. Congress handed them a "Get out of jail free" card.
That transformed these cartels into a lucrative "pay-to-play" scheme in which they sell sole-source contracts, on a drug-by-drug basis, to the highest bidders. That's reduced the number of suppliers for any given drug to one or two or none at all.
And since hospitals own group purchasing organizations, hospital executives often receive a portion of the kickbacks as "share backs" - effectively a partial refund of a deliberate overcharge. Higher prices therefore mean more money for insiders - and exorbitant charges for everyone else. Instead of saving money, group purchasing organizations and pharmacy benefit managers inflate annual health care costs by an estimated $230 billion or more.
These abuses have been exhaustively documented in numerous federal and state investigations; congressional hearings, including four held by the Senate Antitrust Subcommittee; antitrust lawsuits; media exposÃ©s, and independent research over 20 or more years. In 2005, then-Sens. Herb Kohl, D-Wis., and Mike DeWine, R-Ohio, of the antitrust panel drafted a bill that would have repealed the unsafe safe harbor. But it was torpedoed by the powerful group purchasing organization-hospital lobby.
More recently, on Oct. 29, the same day Collins introduced her bill, the FDA released a report that cited the role of group purchasing organization contracting practices in causing the shortages.
So it wasn't surprising that last week's meeting was sponsored by publicly held Premier Inc., the second largest group purchasing organization, long a poster child for these egregious practices.
At this love fest, Collins boasted that "more than 50 organizations" supported S.2723, while Premier gushed over her and her bill. Actually, these supporters are mostly group purchasing organization shareholder hospitals and others with a financial interest in preserving this perverse system. MaineHealth, which was represented by its pharmacy chief, is a member of Vizient, the largest group purchasing organization.
Sen. Collins: If you're serious about ending drug shortages, cancel the "Get out of jail free" card!

Save Earth’s little things and you save us all, including the Joshua tree

Texto completo: Just as, when feeling a great urge to see your taxes cut, you don’t turn to the president pro tempore of the California state Senate to get the job done tout de suite, you don’t look for help saving all creatures wise and wonderful, including ourselves, by asking a species denier for help.
You know who I mean when I say species denier. It’s the people who howl bloody human murder whenever environmentalists try to protect some little flora or fauna they have never heard of, or can’t eat.
The delta smelt is the great California example. Who gives a damn, goes the denier logic, about a little fish nobody in their right non-ichthyologic mind has ever heard of, and that even the enviros have a hard time finding one example of?
Yes, the delta smelt is very tiny. And it has held up much transfer of water from north to south in a vast state, as have other ecological considerations. I wouldn’t recognize one if it happened to swim by. But thank all that is good for the people who would, and who understand that by saving the little things, we save the rest of us well.
I was thinking of this plain fact recently when considering the possible loss of the Joshua trees in our desert because of climate change. Unlike the delta smelt, everyone loves a Joshua tree. We have a whole national park that celebrates them. So many of us, including the species deniers — the kind who claim they wouldn’t miss a smelt or two, or, on the flora side, some weed or another, I suppose — would miss them.
And yet, as our staff writer Matt Kristoffersen reported in August: “Because of climate change, however, roughly 80% of the habitat for the famous plants in Joshua Tree National Park might not survive past 2100 — and that’s being optimistic, UC Riverside scientists conclude in a new study. Researchers at UCR’s Center for Conservation Biology, among other institutes, published the study in June in the journal Ecosphere. It confirms what scientists said years ago in previous studies: the trees’ fate is in the hands of humans.”
They are beloved despite what a National Park Service guide given out at the park calls “their grotesque appearance.” Yucca brevifolia is a member of the agave family. As in tequila. It’s very hard to estimate their age: “They’re yucca plants, so they don’t grow with rings, like a tree, so you can’t count their age that way,” a former ranger told The New York Times. “All we can do is make estimates.”
They grow about half an inch inch to three inches annually, so tree people use a Joshua tree’s height to guess its age. The tallest ones in the park are about 40 feet. They may therefore be about 150 years old, though no one knows.
And if climate change continues at the accelerating rate that it is, the 160,000 acres across the park that have supported Joshua trees since before humans lived here could fall to just 37 acres by 2100. Because it’s getting hotter, and drier, and they won’t make it if we keep going as we are.
I grew up camping and climbing and staring at the Joshua trees there, as my parents did before me, as my daughter has done after. I want the great-grandkids to have the same chance.
Told of that news, Kathryn Phillips, the director of Sierra Club California — also a former reporter here — said: “When I hear stuff like that, it motivates me. I’m not the kind of person that wants to roll up into a fetal position and cry. I want to take action and fight back.”
If you are worried that perhaps you are not concerned enough about the big things, find some little plant or critter to worry about. Help protect it. Then we big things can ride on its coattails.

Texto completo: WARNING: Parts of this column may bear strong resemblance to my earlier columns when Michael Bloomberg toyed with running for president, because with Bloomberg, history has a way of repeating itself. Every four years, Michael Bloomberg hears something virtually no other American hears: a groundswell of support for a Michael Bloomberg presidential candidacy. Now, as the 2020 Democratic primaries rapidly approach, he’s hearing it again.
Bloomberg, a fairly successful mayor of New York and a fabulously successful businessman, has an estimated net worth of $52 billion. Without that fortune, nobody would be talking about a Bloomberg candidacy at this late date. But with his money, Bloomberg could self-finance a run from start to finish without ever having to ask a single donor for a penny. This time, Bloomberg, who in his political life has been a Democrat, a Republican, an independent and now a Democrat again, is setting a personal record by flirting twice in a single cycle. Last spring, there was a ripple of speculation about a 2020 Bloomberg candidacy. On March 5, Bloomberg put an end to it when he announced flatly, "I’m not running for president." Instead, he said, he would pour his energy and resources into a new climate change project called Beyond Carbon. Now, however, he has apparently moved beyond Beyond Carbon. Last week, The New York Times reported that Bloomberg is "actively preparing to enter the Democratic presidential primary."
Bloomberg is said to be concerned — and it is a legitimate concern — that the current Democratic field has moved too far left. But there is no indication that voters believe Bloomberg is the solution to the problem. This latest tease is too recent for any reliable polling — although one survey found Bloomberg with the highest negatives in the field — but in the past, he has never been a voter favorite outside the confines of New York City.
Bloomberg is being pressed into action by states with early primary filing deadlines. He has already placed his name on the ballot for the Alabama primary, and a short time later flew to Arkansas to file there. Alabama and Arkansas are fine, but what about Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina — the first states to cast votes and award delegates? Bloomberg has apparently decided to blow them off.
Candidates in the past have sometimes tried to skip an early primary or caucus, but skipping all four at the beginning is a sure way to lose.
Bloomberg’s move is a symptom of Democratic anxiety. We’ve seen it before, in both parties. At the beginning of a primary season, with a big field of candidates starting the race, the party faithful say, "Isn’t this great? We have so many good candidates — almost an embarrassment of riches!" Then, after several months of campaigning, they say, "Can’t somebody enter this race and save us?"
The answer is no. The Democratic field is what it is. One of the candidates in the race right now will win the nomination, go on to face President Donald Trump, and have a chance to become the next president. There’s no savior waiting to rescue Democrats — and that includes Michael Bloomberg.

Texto completo: Trump wants Supreme Court to block subpoena for his taxes
WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump is asking the Supreme Court to block a subpoena for his tax returns, in a test of the president's ability to defy investigations.
The filing Thursday sets the stage for a high court showdown over the tax returns Trump has refused to release, unlike every other modern president. The justices also could weigh in more broadly on Trump's claim that sitting presidents can't be prosecuted or investigated for crimes.
The subpoena from the Manhattan district attorney is seeking Trump's tax returns back to 2011 from his accounting firm as part of a criminal investigation. Trump's lawyers say a criminal probe of the president at the state or local level is unconstitutional and unprecedented in American history.
Lower courts have rejected Trump's claims of immunity.
The Supreme Court justices may not decide whether to hear the case for at least another month.
A second, similar case is headed to the court over a House committee subpoena demanding Trump's financial records from the same accounting firm. The president has lost both cases at each step of the judicial system so far. The Mazars USA firm has said it will comply with the subpoenas, if courts agree.
Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. is seeking the records in a broader probe that includes payments made to buy the silence of two women, adult film actress Stormy Daniels and model Karen McDougal, who claim they had affairs with Trump before the 2016 election. Trump has denied the claims.

Brexit Party fails to clinch voting pact with Conservatives
LONDON -- Britain's Brexit Party has failed to reach a tactical voting pact with the ruling Conservatives, saying Thursday that it will field 300 candidates in next month's election to force Prime Minister Boris Johnson to deliver on his promise of a clean break with the European Union.
Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage said the party had to contest the seats in Britain's Dec. 12 election to keep the pressure on Johnson, rebuffing Conservative arguments that doing so risks splitting the pro-Brexit vote and boosts parties that want to remain in the EU.
Britain is holding a national election on Dec. 12 because Johnson wants to secure a majority so he can take the U.K. out of the bloc.
Johnson reached a Brexit deal with the EU but has not persuaded enough British lawmakers to pass it.

Pastor: Jimmy Carter 'up and walking' post brain surgery
ATLANTA -- Former President Jimmy Carter was already "up and walking" just a day after undergoing surgery to relieve pressure on his brain from bleeding linked to recent falls, his pastor said.
The Rev. Tony Lowden visited Carter, 95, in an Atlanta hospital on Wednesday.
"His spirits are good and he is up and walking," Lowden told reporters.
Carter Center spokeswoman Deanna Congileo has said there were no complications during Carter's Tuesday surgery at Emory University Hospital for a subdural hematoma, blood trapped on the brain's surface.
The center said the bleeding was connected to Carter's recent falls. A Spring fall required Carter to get hip replacement surgery. He fell twice in October, hitting his head at least once.

Trump Jr.'s book is a No. 1 bestseller, but with an edge
NEW YORK -- Donald Trump Jr.'s "Triggered" is a No. 1 New York Times bestseller, although not without an edge.
"Triggered: How the Left Thrives on Hate and Wants to Silence Us" came out last week and tops the hardcover nonfiction list that will appear in the Times on Nov. 24.
A dagger symbol appears next to the listing, indicating that some of the sales were "bulk purchases," often meaning that the author or someone associated with the author bought a substantial number of copies. A spokesman for the Republican National Committee, Steve Guest, said the RNC has been offering "Triggered" as a fundraising incentive, a common practice for political books.
Guest said copies were bought "to keep up with demand," not in a "large bulk purchase."

North Korea: US offers to restart nuclear talks
SEOUL, South Korea -- North Korea on Thursday said the United States has proposed a resumption of stalled nuclear negotiations in December as they approach an end-of-year deadline set by North Korean leader Kim Jong Un for the Trump administration to offer an acceptable deal to salvage the talks.
In a statement released by state media, North Korean negotiator Kim Myong Gil didn't clearly say whether the North would accept the supposed U.S. offer.
He said North Korea has no interest in talks aimed at buying time without discussing solutions. He said the North isn't willing to make a deal over "matters of secondary importance," such as possible U.S. offers to formally declare an end to the 1950-53 Korean War, which was halted by a cease-fire, not a peace treaty, or establish a liaison office between the nations.

WASHINGTON -- European and other members of the international coalition fighting the Islamic State group must take back and prosecute their nationals detained in Iraq and Syria to help keep IS from regaining territory, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Thursday.
Pompeo told foreign ministers and senior officials from about 30 coalition members that it's imperative that they hold thousands of detained foreign fighters accountable for atrocities committed while IS held swathes of territory in the two countries.
Many of the detained foreign fighters are from Europe, but countries have been reluctant to take them back and officials acknowledged there are still differences of opinion among coalition partners about how best to deal with them.

In South Carolina: A school shooter who was 14 when he killed a first grader on a school playground in South Carolina after killing his father in their home was sentenced Thursday to life in prison without parole.
Jesse Osborne, now 17, crashed his father's pickup truck into the fence on Sept. 28, 2016 and fired on first graders at Townville Elementary School celebrating a classmate's birthday.
But Osborne's lawyers noted he never tried to get inside the school, even though police took 12 minutes to arrive.
Osborne, who was tried as an adult, had left a video chat open on his cellphone and witnesses said he was pacing outside, crying and saying he was sorry. Jacob Hill, 6, was killed.

Texto completo: Over the past seven years, it has been my humbling privilege to serve on the board of the Central Florida Commission on Homelessness, the last 15 months as the managing chair.
As my tenure comes to a close this month, and as the Commission moves in an exciting new direction, I am grateful for the enormous progress made, but we must acknowledge the persistent, ongoing challenges.
On the success side, our collaborative effort has resulted in housing more than 700 chronically homeless individuals, including more than 300 veterans. As we continue to see the horrible conditions which currently exist in West Coast cities that chose a different approach, this achievement cannot be underestimated. However, tent cities and tarps could still appear in Central Florida if we do not remain committed to our new system of care and its funding.
As a local faith leader grounded in the Christian tradition, the principle of the "tithe" has always been part of how I believe communities should function. In the Old Testament, a certain amount was set aside for the care of the less fortunate, the "widow, the orphan, and the stranger." (Deuteronomy 10:18) People were encouraged to work and earn, but there was always a bent toward a generous heart. It was not a focus on me, but we. It was community over self.
Sadly, with the rise of what David Brooks of The New York Times calls "hyper-individualism," we have lost that notion.
My prayer is that Central Florida could turn that tide and become a national model for community generosity. Don't get me wrong: we have wonderfully benevolent people and many generous organizations who sacrificially give to help others. Collectively, however, we could and must do better.
I was saddened to read in the Orlando Business Journal of a recent national Lending Tree study on charitable giving. It found that charitable giving on the whole was decreasing, in large part because of personal indebtedness. We owe so much we can no longer afford to give. Also, more dollars were given to animal causes than any other single need. I love my dog as much as the next person, but seriously? Animals, not humans?
As I have long said, the fact that nearly 100 homeless people die each year says more about who we are as a community than it does about those who died. I want to live in a community that values others over self, that minimizes greed in favor of achieving a higher common good. This is not a social issue; it is a moral one. What's more, we absolutely have the money. We're just not giving it.
We've enthusiastically granted money for projects that benefit us - athletic stadiums and performing arts centers, better roads and higher paying jobs. We love those things. I love those things. Such choices drive economic benefit. They make our community better, no doubt, but it smells rotten when those making money have little heart for generosity.
In a phone call with Rich Maladecki, CEO of the Central Florida Hotel & Lodging Association, I asked him why so little of our tourist tax money ($279 million this year) was spent on human need. He said it was simply not fair. No single industry should have to put the needs of the homeless on their back. I completely agree with that, but collectively, why could those needs not be put on all of our backs?
What if the lawyers association and the medical association and the tourism industry and the entertainment industry and the real estate industry all took a page from the church playbook and became radically generous? What if they gave away 10% of their profit? Our church does. Many churches do and far more.
I know. Eye roll. It'll never happen. Perhaps, but with good leadership comes vision and money always follows vision. I'd love to see the tourism industry say, "You know what? We get it. We're not taking the whole burden, but we're in for X." Then, lead. Lead. Challenge other industries to do the same, and before you know it, the problem is solved. We have the money. The community cost to keep our homeless housed is roughly $2 million per year. That number will grow as we house more each year, but that's absolute peanuts compared to what is being generated in Central Florida.
Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer said last year that "homelessness is, hands down, the hardest issue I have had to deal with as mayor." It is, but together, we can continue our progress. We can be a community known for innovative solutions as well as collaborative public/private/faith funding partnerships.
First Presbyterian Church of Orlando gives $200,000 a year to this cause. What can your industry do, not just on homelessness, but on any pressing human need? With the right leadership and generous hearts, we can and we will make a difference.
I hope you'll join me.
David Swanson is senior pastor at First Presbyterian Orlando.

Twins Meet Again at the Turn of a Century

Texto completo: Newly restored, Ildiko Enyedi's confident debut feature, "My 20th Century," is a sparkling Hungarian fable of theft, anarchy and electric light.
"My 20th Century" -- a first feature by Ildiko Enyedi, made in the waning days of Hungarian Communism -- looked back to the last fin-de-siècle even as it heralded a new beginning.
The movie, revived at the Museum of the Moving Image in a shimmering new digital restoration, was among the most acclaimed debuts of its day, winner of the Camera d'Or for best first film at the same 1989 Cannes Film Festival where another debut, Steven Soderbergh's "Sex, Lies, and Videotape," won the Palme d'Or.
Vincent Canby, who reviewed "My 20th Century" in The New York Times (and later named it as one of the 10 best movies of 1990), called it "wondrous" and "even more impressive when one realizes that it is the first feature by Miss Enyedi." It is even more impressive that Enyedi, who wrote as well as directed, uses the possessive "my" to spin a fable regarding the origins of modern times -- epitomized by the motion picture.
On the day in 1880 that Thomas Edison celebrates the invention of the electric light bulb, the stars in the heavens herald the birth of twin girls to an unmarried woman in Budapest. Soon orphaned, Lili and Dora (names suggestive of the Gish sisters) are reduced to selling matches in the snow. Like the little girl in the Hans Christian Andersen fairy tale, they drift off with visions of a happy ending. In their dreams, they are rescued by a donkey; in reality, each is snatched by a well-off, possibly villainous gentleman.
Next seen on Dec. 31, 1899, the sisters (both played by the Polish actress Dorotha Segda) are both, unknown to each other, aboard the Orient Express. Dora is a brash adventuress, vamping in the dining car; Lili is a timid anarchist, riding third class. Their separate fates take them around Central Europe. Dora orchestrates a daring jewel theft; Lili has difficulty lighting a bomb's fuse. They will not meet until they are led by a donkey into a hall of mirrors for the movie's final sequence.
Shot in sparkling black-and-white, its scenes punctuated by intertitles and iris shots, "My 20th Century" evokes early cinema, as well as snow globes and sugar frosting. It's a sophisticated confection that anticipates Wes Anderson's Middle European fantasy "The Grand Budapest Hotel." Still, this is also the world of Freud and Kafka. Lili attends a lecture by Otto Weininger, the author of "Sex and Character," and is treated to a grotesquely misogynous rant. Nor is Weininger the only problematic male. The sisters have separate encounters with the mysterious Z (the Soviet actor Oleg Yankovsky, Andrei Tarkovsky's alter ego in "Nostalghia"). Seduced and robbed by Dora, he all but rapes Lili, having confused the two.
While some critics have suggested that Dora embodies capitalism and Lili socialism, "My 20th Century" makes no reference to the upheaval in the Soviet bloc at the time. There is, however, a haunting digression, a dog who might be a subject in Pavlov's lab is encouraged by celestial beings to throw off its electrodes and find freedom by the sea. (Hungary, of course, is landlocked.)

Here to Help; One Thing You Can Do: Balance Your Energy Demand

Texto completo: Also this week, the carbon footprint of the very, very wealthy
Welcome to the Climate Fwd: newsletter. The New York Times climate team emails readers once a week with stories and insights about climate change. Sign up here to get it in your inbox. (And find the website version of this week's letter here .)
Want to encourage renewable energy? Timing is everything.
Renewables, by their nature, can be sporadic. The wind isn't always blowing when you need those turbines spinning. Water levels in hydroelectric dams rise and fall.
But energy demand isn't sporadic: It tends to run in a predictable curve that peaks during the daylight hours.
That means renewables, so far, can't always fulfill demand reliably at peak times. Sure, we've got solar power, but that, too, is subject to factors we can't control, like cloudy days. That's why on-demand energy sources like fossil fuels, which generate plenty of greenhouse gas emissions, are still very important in our energy mix.
Daire McCoy, a fellow at the London School of Economics' Grantham Research Institute, called it "a very dumb system."
What could make the system smarter? Lowering the peaks in demand by shifting some of our consumption to off-peak hours, typically early mornings and overnight. That could go a long way toward lowering our reliance on fossil fuels. And, depending on where you live and the incentives in place, it might also lower your monthly bill.
Rebalancing demand could be as simple as turning off your water heater for a few hours during the day, or using a timer to run your dishwasher and clothes dryer at night.
Another thing you can do is to avoid using your most energy-hungry appliances simultaneously. For example, don't run your clothes dryer, hair dryer, oven and air conditioner at the same time. That, in theory, has the potential to raise the daily demand peak.
If you're not sure which machines in your home use the most energy, this appliance energy calculator on the Department of Energy website can probably help.
Changing behavioral patterns, though, is hard. That's why governments and energy providers are turning to incentives and smart technology in an effort to balance demand and, ultimately, lower emissions of planet-warming carbon dioxide.
One of the main incentives is time-of-use pricing, a system that encourages consumers to shift demand by making energy less expensive during off-peak hours. It's already being used in California and Illinois. Internationally, it's in effect in France, Spain and Finland, among other countries.
On the technology side, smart meters can relay real-time information, like how much energy is used and when, so that households can adjust consumption and suppliers can further understand demand patterns. A report by the British government estimated that smart meters could save nearly 45 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent from 2013 to 2034.
"If we can make the system a lot more flexible," Mr. McCoy said, "it would allow integration of more renewables, and not having to build extra coal plants."
As Elizabeth Warren is galvanizing the Democratic primary with her promise to tax billionaires to fund health care, a growing body of research is also looking at the role of very wealthy people in climate change.
A typical two-person, very wealthy household -- one with more than $ 1 million in investments in addition to a home and personal property -- produces roughly 129 tons of planet-warming carbon dioxide per year, or about ten times the global average, according to a team led by Ilona M. Otto, a researcher at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany.
Of the 129 tons per year, about 10 come from driving, the team estimated, while powering homes generated close to 20 tons. But one habit accounted for more than half the emissions from very wealthy households: 67 tons of carbon dioxide came from frequent air travel.
Overall, emissions from the world's wealthiest 0.5 percent produced up to 3.9 billion tons of carbon dioxide a year, or almost 15 percent of the world's lifestyle-related carbon emissions, the researchers estimated. In comparison, the world's poorest 50 percent have been estimated to be responsible for only about 10 percent of lifestyle emissions.
Dr. Otto and her colleagues defined lifestyle-related emissions as anything related to personal consumption choices -- the heating and energy used at home, or in personal vehicles, or the emissions associated with flying, as well as the food and goods a household consumes -- but not emissions related to infrastructure or the use of public services. Their findings were presented in the journal Nature Climate Change this year.
The research had a tiny sample size. The team conducted "lifestyle consumption surveys" with three very wealthy people, one based in the United States and two in South Korea. The researchers also interviewed the pilot of a private jet hired by wealthy customers, mostly in Europe.
Still, the findings loosely track an earlier analysis, by the Paris-based economists Lucas Chancel and Thomas Piketty, based on national G.D.P. and emissions data for 1998-2013. They found that the world's top 10 percent of emitters contributed about 45 percent of global carbon dioxide emissions, while the bottom 50 percent contributed 13 percent. (They point out that the world's top 10 percent of emitters are not just in heavily industrialized countries; a third of them are from developing countries.)
All this, Dr. Otto and her colleagues said, means there is "a largely untapped potential to reduce carbon emissions by altering the way of life of the superrich."
They argued, though, that taxes alone would not affect consumption patterns -- the wealthy quite likely can afford to continue polluting. But more aggressive policies, like restricting household or individual emissions, or imposing renewable energy requirements, might do the job, they said.
Other authors have proposed an inheritance tax that could be funneled to climate action. In 2017 alone, 44 of the world's richest heirs inherited a total of $ 189 billion, according to a study by the consulting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers. That pool of money dwarfs the less than $ 3 billion in support for climate mitigation projects given out by the four largest global climate funds, including the United Nations Green Climate Fund.
Still, Dr. Otto sounded a warning. "Any form of policy targeted at the superrich is bound to meet with strong resistance," she said. "The rich are overrepresented in national governments and there are strong ties between the wealthy and the political elites."

Texto completo: Headnote LOCAL
MITCH ALBOM described it as the most personal thing he's ever written.
"Finding Chika: A Little Girl, an Earthquake, and the Making of a Family" tells the story of an orphaned Haitian girl who forever changed his life. Released on Nov. 5, the book was the focus of his presentation at Congregation Kesher Israel on Nov. 9.
The writer received national acclaim for his book "Tuesdays with Morrie," which spent four years on the New York Times bestseller list. The 1999 film version won four Emmy awards, including best TV film, director, actor and supporting actor. Albom's other books include "Have A Little Faith," "The Five People You Meet in Heaven" and "The Next Person You Meet in Heaven." He's also founded nine charities in Detroit, including a 24-hour medical clinic for homeless children.

Albom, 61, was born in New Jersey. He earned a bachelor's degree at Brandeis University in 1979 and a master's degree from Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism, followed by an MBA from Columbia Business School. He moved to Detroit in 1985 where he became a sports journalist at the Detroit Free Press. Today, he hosts a daily talk show on WJR radio.
Albom's family moved multiple times during his childhood and, at one point, resided in Philadelphia's Society Hill, where the adolescent Albom attended Akiba Hebrew Academy, now known as Jack M. Barrack Hebrew Academy. His parents became friends with Lewis Cohen, a Kesher Israel congregant.
This year marks the 125th anniversary of the Society Hill congregation's formation. For the occasion, Cohen reached out to Albom, asking him to speak at a fundraiser.
"I would do anything for him; he's a great guy," Albom said of Cohen. "But then when he told me about that particular synagogue and the history that it had, how far back it went and the struggles that it had along the way to stay relevant and thriving, I thought any way that I could help that I would be happy to do. That fact that it coincided with my book coming out was more coincidence than anything else."
Albom told the story of Chika, a presentation he's only given a few times before. A video monitor displayed photos and videos that drew both laughs and tears from the crowd.
Albom's talk began with the 2010 earthquake that hit the Caribbean island nation of Haiti, leaving 300,000 dead and 1.5 million displaced. A few days later, he was approached by a Detroit-area pastor who was concerned about an orphanage on the island. Unable to call, he had no idea if the children were dead or alive.
A few weeks later, Albom was able to arrange for a small plane to fly them to Port Au Prince. What he saw upon landing has stuck with him. He said people covered in white dust walked around like zombies, searching for water and begging for food. The smell of dead bodies filled the air. Miraculously, the orphanage survived but was in poor shape.
So Albom began work improving it.
Three days before the earthquake, a young girl named Chika Jeune was born. She spent her first three years living in poverty, then her mother died giving birth to her brother. Chika was then taken to the orphanage, which at that point been taken over by Albom and renamed the Have Faith Haiti Mission & Orphanage. Since the earthquake, the orphanage had grown and today houses more than 4C children.
Albom said Chika made an immediate impression upon her arrival, being what Albom described as both brave and self-assured. At 5, it was discovered that Chika had a brain tumor. Albom and his wife, Janine, brought Chika to Detroit seeking medical treatment. The doctors gave her four months to live, but the couple refused to accept that. Chika became a permanent part of their household during their search for a cure.
Never having had children of their own, Albom and his wife experienced parenthood for the first time. They cared for Chika, and even took her to Disneyland. At home, they played games like "Fluffy Cozy Bed Camp." The rules were simple. Chika was the boss, Albom's wife was the second boss and he was the third boss. Despite coming from different parts of the world, Chika and the couple became a family.
Sadly, after two years of experimental treatments, Chika died. She was 7, so in his talk to the congregation, Albom gave seven things he learned from his time with Chika. He wrote what he learned into the book; all profits from it will go toward the orphanage.
"Becoming parents in our late 50s to a little girl, a Haitian orphan who didn't look like us, didn't talk like us and didn't come from us, but we still couldn't have been any more of a family than if she looked just like us. There's all these different ways of becoming a family, but there's no wrong way," Albom said. "As long as you have love, you are a family and that was the biggest takeaway from the book." *

Texto completo: President Donald Trump has been good for America’s billionaires. He slashed corporate taxes, cut the top income tax rate and raised the total exemption for the estate tax, directly benefiting several hundred billionaires and their heirs. He’s placed wealthy supporters in key positions of government like the Commerce Department, rolled back Obama-era financial regulations and privileged the interests of favored industries — like resource extraction and fossil fuel production — above all else.
There are billionaires who oppose Trump, of course. But for the most part they aren’t class traitors. They still want the government to work in their favor. They still want to keep their taxes low, just without the dysfunction — and gratuitous cruelty — of the current administration. And they want Democrats to choose a conventional nominee: a moderate standard-bearer who doesn’t want to make fundamental changes to the economy, from greatly increased taxes to greater worker control.
Plenty of Democratic voters agree. But just as many have rallied behind candidates who want a more equal, more democratic economy. Two of the three leading candidates — Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren — want new taxes on the wealthiest Americans and their assets. Sanders has the steeper tax but Warren is not far behind former Vice President Joe Biden in national polling and leads the field in both Iowa and New Hampshire. With Biden struggling to break away from the pack, it looks like Warren actually could be the nominee, and anti-Trump billionaires are worried.
That’s why one of them, Mike Bloomberg, has floated a plan to run for the Democratic nomination. And why others have gone public with their attacks on Warren.
Mark Cuban, a billionaire investor, said Warren — whose wealth tax calls for a 2% tax on households with more than $50 million in assets and a 6% tax on households with assets of more than $1 billion — is “selling shiny objects to divert attention from reality.”
Another billionaire investor, Leon Cooperman, called Warren’s wealth tax a “bankrupt concept,” said it could “lead to inappropriate actions in the economy that are counterproductive” and warned that Warren is “taking the country down a very wrong path.”
“What she’s peddling is bull. Total, complete bull,” Cooperman said last week on CNBC, “That comes from someone who believes in a progressive income tax structure, who believes the rich should pay more.”
A few days later, Cooperman announced his support for Bloomberg’s potential candidacy.
Bill Gates also thinks Warren’s wealth tax goes too far: “I’ve paid over $10 billion in taxes. I’ve paid more than anyone in taxes. If I had to have paid $20 billion, it’s fine. But when you say I should pay $100 billion, then I’m starting to do a little math about what I have left over.” He claimed that he was “just kidding,” but when asked if he would support Warren over Trump, he demurred. Instead, he said, he’d cast a ballot for whichever candidate had the “more professional approach.”
If there’s a prominent billionaire who hasn’t taken a public stance on Warren, it’s Jeff Bezos, the chief executive of Amazon. But he did urge Bloomberg to run for president earlier this year, perhaps a sign that he, too, is worried about the outcome of the Democratic primary.
All of this is understandable. As my New York Times colleague Patty Cohen notes, if Warren’s wealth tax had been in effect since 1982, Gates would have had $13.9 billion in 2018 instead of $97 billion, Bezos would have $48.8 billion instead of $160 billion, and Bloomberg would have had $12.3 billion instead of $51.8 billion. They would still be billionaires, but Warren’s tax would have taken a significant chunk out of their assets. And even if the wealth tax never became law, a Warren administration would still take a hard line on financial regulation, consumer protection and tax enforcement, key areas of interest for the super rich. It’s impossible to imagine a Warren White House in which billionaires would have the same access and favored status that they do with Trump.
Warren’s wealthy critics are right to be nervous. And they have a right to speak out against her. But Bloomberg’s potential entry into the race — and Tom Steyer’s ongoing presence — shows that they’re not just giving an opinion. They want assurance that the Democratic nominee won’t be too disruptive. They want a restoration of the pre-Trump status quo, not a revolution. They want a veto of sorts, a formal way to say that Democrats can only go so far with their plans and policies.
The only response worth making to this idea is to laugh. Despite voter suppression, unlimited political spending and the president’s attempt to solicit foreign interference on his behalf, this is still a democracy. The final say still rests with voters, with ordinary Americans who retain the power to shape our government. And if those voters decide to nominate Warren or Sanders instead of a traditional moderate — and if either of those candidates beats Trump, as is very possible — then the billionaires will have to learn to live with the people’s will.

More Woes For WeWork: $1.25 Billion Quarter Loss

Texto completo: The co-working company's losses increased sharply as it expanded ahead of a failed initial public offering.
The rapid expansion of WeWork's office-space empire caused the company's losses to more than double in the third quarter, according to a company presentation.
WeWork lost $ 1.25 billion in the three months that ended in September, up from $ 497 million in the same period a year earlier, according to the document, obtained on Wednesday by The New York Times. Revenue increased about 94 percent, to $ 934 million.
The numbers show why WeWork's planned initial public offering flamed out so spectacularly. The company was forced to withdraw the offering at the end of September after investors grew nervous about the company's finances and its unusual corporate governance. Adam Neumann, its co-founder, stepped down as chief executive under pressure.
Vicki Bryan, chief executive of Bond Angle, a research firm, said WeWork should have told investors during the I.P.O. process that losses were escalating in the third quarter. "They knew the bulk of this and kept the public in the dark," she said.
WeWork leases office space, refurbishes it and then rents it out to its customers. In the belief that there is a growing appetite for such space, it has added hundreds of new locations around the world. But doing so has cost hundreds of millions of dollars.
At the end of September, WeWork's presentation said, the company had $ 2 billion in cash, a number that included $ 692 million of restricted cash. That sum compares with slightly over $ 3 billion in total cash at the end of June, implying the company used $ 1 billion of cash in three months. The document did not, however, provide a cash-flow statement that would show exactly how much cash the company spent in the quarter.
SoftBank, WeWork's largest outside shareholder, moved last month to rescue the company. It accelerated an equity investment and announced plans for WeWork to sell bonds to investors.
SoftBank's overhaul of WeWork involves getting out of noncore businesses and focusing on profitable markets. The company is also expected to lay off thousands of employees in the coming weeks.
WeWork disclosed its financial performance through the end of June in documents it filed for the I.P.O. Because it scrapped the offering and remains a private company, WeWork is not required to publicly release financial statements. The latest numbers come from a presentation of selected financial data that is provided to investors who own WeWork bonds.
Occupancy at WeWork's locations is declining, according to the presentation. In the third quarter, WeWork had enough members to fill the equivalent of 79 percent of available desks at the company's locations, down from 84 percent a year earlier. Such a dip might be expected because WeWork was opening locations at a fast clip. But occupancy dropped even at locations open more than two years, to 87 percent in the third quarter from 90 percent a year earlier.
Older locations are generally more profitable than new ones, in part because they have had time to fill up. The presentation reveals the eye-popping rate at which WeWork has been adding space. At the end of September, WeWork had 625 locations, an 87 percent increase from a year earlier. It is now in 127 cities, up from 83.
WeWork is not out of trouble until SoftBank's rescue plan is in place. As part of the bailout, SoftBank, led by the investor Masayoshi Son, made a $ 1.5 billion investment in WeWork equity last month. Under the plan, WeWork would also sell over $ 2 billion of bonds to raise new money, though it is not clear how much appetite exists for the company's debt. Its existing bonds have plunged in price.
SoftBank's plan also involves buying WeWork stock from existing shareholders, including Mr. Neumann. But while its purchases would give it nearly 80 percent of WeWork's stock, SoftBank would end up with just under half of WeWork's voting power. It is not clear how SoftBank intends to exert control without a majority of the votes.
A financial metric that the company likes to emphasize in its communications with investors also weakened in the third quarter. That metric, which the company calls its "location contribution margin" and does not include significant costs, fell to 9 percent in the quarter, down from 12 percent a year earlier.

Texto completo: A Dreamer and two other readers urge the court not to bring an end to the DACA program. Also: Working round the clock; the joy of doing chores.
To the Editor:
Re "Justices Appear Inclined to Let Trump End DACA" (front page, Nov. 13):
I'm one of those "700,000 young undocumented immigrants known as Dreamers." I grew up primarily in the United States, enabling me to follow my wildest dreams. As this country is all I've ever truly known, I can't imagine a future anywhere else.
Yet it is not up to me to decide where I'll live. For all that I've accomplished, adjusting my own legal status to remain here is still just an elusive fantasy.
I wait yet again for my future to be determined by another power. However, this is nothing new, given the uncertainties in my past seven years of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA. Except this time, the ball is in the highest court.

To the Editor:
The American dream is a shining beacon of hope around the world. This is precisely why it is imperative that citizens understand the importance of protecting the Dreamers and the entire DACA program. What message will it send to the world if we fail to protect about 700,000 people yearning for freedom, prosperity and independence?
We must incorporate DACA as a cornerstone to the larger effort of comprehensive immigration reform. We can't leave these fine people in the lurch. Mr. President, the American people implore you to see reason and put aside your preconceived notions and political bias. Yes, we must double down on security at the border and open up a national fight against gang violence in our major cities. However, we should not punish innocent people and mistake them for hardened criminals.
We should grant citizenship to these Dreamers, who serve our country in the military, pay payroll and sales taxes, and receive an education to advance their future and that of our broader American family. We demand a policy of common sense and humanity. America must preserve DACA and return to our founding principles.
Henry J.H. Wilson
Barrington, Ill.
To the Editor:
Conservative justices on the Supreme Court, taking the president's word, have apparently decided to let President Trump have his way and end DACA. Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh make clear that instead of practicing judicial independence and acting as a check on his power, they will defer to the president.
In the future, will they take the same approach, assuming the next president has made "a very considered decision," or will they question a president who doesn't share their political views? The founding fathers are rolling over in their graves at this latest violation of the norms we have fought for over nearly 250 years.

A Five-Hour Workday?
To the Editor:
Re "5-Hour Workdays? Yes, Please," by Cal Newport (Op-Ed, Nov. 7):
Sounds like a great idea! And if you have a fever of 104 degrees, have the chills and are having unending coughing spasms; and all your family members, who happen to have complicated medical histories, have the same; and you call your family doc and you get a message that says, "I work five hours a day, from 10 a.m. until 3 p.m., and don't bother me otherwise," what might you do?
As a physician, having taken calls at all hours of the day and night, I really wonder how jettisoning round-the-clock inbox checks might work. Sorry, unlike your personal physician, no urgent care center has you in mind, only profits. Be careful what you wish for!

Cleaning as an Art Form
To the Editor:
Re "The Pleasure of Household Chores," by Juan Vidal (Sunday Review, Nov. 3):
As a child, in exchange for a weekly allowance, I did mandatory household chores like dusting, vacuuming the stairs, scrubbing bathrooms, changing sheets and ironing my dad's boxers and handkerchiefs. My mother was an excellent and grateful supervisor because she hated housework.
Chores turned into a way to have fun and get attention. I found cleaning and organizing projects my mother would have never dreamed of.
As an adult who has worked mostly from home for the last two decades, I have struggled with the clean-before-work affliction. Cleaning and organizing grew into an art form, a creative endeavor.
Now, on the verge of retirement, with more time on my hands, I hate to admit that I love nothing more than spending the day cleaning and organizing my house, garage and garden.

Texto completo: Ever since my book, "The Life and Afterlife of Harry Houdini," came out, people have asked if I have tried any impossible escapes of my own. I'm going to try one here. I'm going to try and write about President Donald Trump without invoking politics. Wish me luck.
It is stunning how many people have read the book a story about the great escape artist and how he still impacts the world and immediately thought of Trump.
He is not referenced in the book. But he is there, because the similarities between Houdini and Trump are, pardon the word, inescapable.
Houdini was the greatest showman of his time or, perhaps, any time. He was a master at using the media to promote himself.
He was a prolific mythmaker or liar, if you prefer. Nothing about Houdini was as it seemed. He relished every challenge that came his way including allowing the punch to the stomach that led to his death.
He ruthlessly attacked his enemies and his perceived enemies. He would sometimes go to shows of his imitators while dressed as an old man. He would then take the stage, lock up the imposters in unbreakable handcuffs, tear off his costume and shout, "I am Houdini!"
Houdini once sued a German newspaper and police officer who charged him with perpetrating a fraud on German audiences. He won in court and told the story repeatedly for the rest of his life.
Does any of this sound familiar?
Understand, Houdini began as a struggling and conventional magician in 1898, he put up all of his secrets for sale when he made an astonishing discovery: People, everywhere, love the seemingly impossible escape.
And so he began escaping from handcuffs and chains and jails and straitjackets and milk cans and water torture cells and boxes and bags and anything else "Nothing on earth can hold Houdini a prisoner," he insisted. And in that time long before radio, much less Instagram, he went viral again and again.
And our fascination with escape goes on, it is timeless. This is why Houdini is constantly referenced today. Every time a quarterback escapes a sack, a dog escapes a yard, a friend escapes paying the bill or an inmate escapes a jail cell, they are the next Houdini.
Trump has been called Houdini many times in his life by his biggest fans and his fiercest critics. It's undeniable: He's the escape artist of our time.
He repeatedly escapes from situations that would have stopped even the savviest of politicians and business leaders. And he does it much in the same way that Houdini did: With audacity and shamelessness and limitless refusal to accept defeat and a supernatural belief in his own powers.
When Trump, as reports say, added a Sharpie mark to a weather map to prove that Alabama was indeed in the line of a hurricane, it was like Houdini had come back to life. That's exactly what he would have done.
One of my favorite stories in the book is about the time a man named William Hope Hodgson intended to defeat Houdini. He challenged Houdini to escape from his personal handcuffs and Hodgson proceeded to put multiple handcuffs and chains around Houdini until, as one reporter said, he looked like "a trussed turkey."
Houdini complained repeatedly that this wasn't a fair fight, that Hodgson had almost broken his arm, that he had lost all feeling in his limbs and asked to have the chains removed for a moment.
"This is a contest, not a love match," Hodgson shouted as the crowd booed.
Hodgson was sure he had Houdini beaten. There were no tricks left, no misdirections to pull, no secrets to hide. Houdini was entirely up and he couldn't get out and that was that.
Only Houdini got out. And then he stood before the audience, his arms were bloodied and his face was white from exhaustion, and in his own words, "I suffered the tortures of hell. I sweat blood!" But he escaped because he always escaped and that isn't just Houdini's story.

Texto completo: Despite Ellie Goulding's ultimatum to the Salvation Army, the Christian charity says she'll still perform at the halftime show at the Dallas Cowboys game this Thanksgiving.
The "Love Me Like You Do" songstress had threatened to drop out unless the charity made "a solid, committed pledge or donation to the LGBTQ community. "
The football game annually kicks off the Salvation Army's Red Kettle Campaign, which raises money to feed and shelter the homeless year-round. Salvation Army representative Kurt Watkins told USA TODAY the singer confirmed Wednesday she'll still perform.
USA TODAY has reached out to Goulding's reps for comment.
The fracas began with an Instagram post Goulding shared Tuesday showing the singer in a red apron volunteering with the charity.
"Ok so maybe hairnet not my strongest look but thank you @salvationarmyus for having us in New York," the U. K. native wrote, going on to share the virtues of the organization. "I sat and spoke to several people who had come in from the bitter cold for some food (they serve to over 150 per day here), warmth and perhaps a chat with one of the volunteers. "
Though many applauded Goulding for her act of service, others left comments criticizing the singer for associating with a religious organization that has been characterized by some as anti-LGBTQ.
"so sad to see Ellie supporting them," user @angelsporch wrote in a comment, captured by NBC 5 Wednesday. "they're extremely homo/transphobic, literally to the point of letting queer homeless ppl die. wish she had done some research beforehand or something. "
Goulding replied to the fan's criticism, saying that "upon researching this, I have reached out to The Salvation Army and said that I would have no choice but to pull out unless they very quickly make a solid, committed pledge or donation to the LGBTQ community. "
"I am a committed philanthropist as you probably know, and my heart has always been in helping the homeless, but supporting an anti-LGBTQ charity is clearly not something I would ever intentionally do," she continued. "Thank you for drawing my attention to this x"
The Salvation Army quickly moved to address Goulding's concerns, calling them "misconceptions. "
"We’d like to thank Ellie Goulding and her fans for shedding light on misconceptions and encouraging others to learn the truth about The Salvation Army’s mission to serve all, without discrimination," Salvation Army national commander David Hudson said in a statement to USA TODAY. "We applaud her for taking the time to learn about the services we provide to the LGBTQ community. "
Ellie Goulding is married! The singer wed her art dealer boyfriend in a lavish ceremony at York Minster
"Regardless of race, ethnicity, sexual orientation or gender identity, we’re committed to serving anyone in need," he continued. "Every day, we provide services such as shelter for the transgender community and resources for homeless youth – 40 percent of whom identify as gay or transgender. "
Hudson added that Goulding's performance "will kick off a season of giving that helps support these and many other programs and services throughout the country. "
According to a 2011 report from the New York Times, the Salvation Army's "position statement" on its website included language saying that "Scripture forbids sexual intimacy between members of the same sex. The Salvation Army believes, therefore, that Christians whose sexual orientation is primarily or exclusively same-sex are called upon to embrace celibacy as a way of life. ”
Hello, Dolly! Singer Ellie Goulding nailed her Dolly Parton Halloween costume
That language no longer appears on their website. Today, the Salvation Army has a page on its website highlighting its commitment to the LGBTQ community.
"We're motivated by the love of God to meet human needs in His name without discrimination," a current statement reads. "We embrace people regardless of race, gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation, or gender identity. "

Urine tests and antibiotics in the elderly

Texto completo: (TriceEdneyWire.com) - Regardless of how healthy you may be otherwise, the most common infection that affect seniors and the elderly are in the urinary tract.
This can range from urinary incontinence; bladder infection; to even increasing the risk of kidney problems.
Now, before you get carried away, please keep in mind that we are talking about issues associated with aging...in other words, it only happens if you live long enough. Sure, people can have urinary issues at any point in life, but, again, we're talking about aging and the elderly.
In fact, the urinary tract isn't the only thing that comes along with aging. As you grow older, you will have other changes, including: the bones, muscles, and joints; the male reproductive system; the female reproductive system; and in most of your . organs, tissues, and cells.
Specifically, I'd like to address new finding that look at the problem with urine tests that result in elderly patients being prescribed and antibiotic. It seems that we are now finding out, that in most cases, this is not only of little to no benefit, it can actually cause problems.
It's no secret that we have a serious problem with the over-prescribing of antibiotics in this country. In some situations, when a goes to the doctor, and before the test results are back, they are already prescribed and taking an antibiotic. The problem has gotten so out of hand that the Center for Disease Control (CDC) says that more than 70 percent of the bacteria responsible the 2 million infections you can get while in a US hospital are resistant to at least one commonly used antibiotic. It gets worse; 20 percent to 50 percent of antibiotics prescribed in hospitals are found (after the fact) to be unnecessary or inappropriate.
With the overuse or overprescribing of antibiotics, we can not only increase our resistance to antibiotics when you really need them, but can increase the severity of the condition you first complained about, how long you'll be sick, increasing your risk of complications, and most importantly, prevent a situation that may have resolved itself on its own without an antibiotic.
Which leads me to the original point of this column.
The latest research on the topic has found that seniors and the elderly are asked to provide and urine sample for are routinely prescribed an antibiotic. In the past, when a urine specimen tested positive - even when no symptoms of infection were present - doctors were taught that treatment with antibiotics was the right approach. We know now that is wrong.
As first reported in the New York Times, a task force concluded last month that for virtually everyone except pregnant women, screening for and treating asymptomatic bacteriuria provides no benefit and has potential harms.
What we are learning now is that many urine samples will reveal results showing the presence of bacteria, but this does not mean there is an infection. This practice happens all too often in the elderly, especially those in nursing homes.
It doesn't help when most of us, like most doctors, expect to use an antibiotic on the slightest hint that there could be an infection of any kind; whether it's a cold, sinus infection, rash, and yes, a urinary tract infection.
Urinary tract infections happen when germs get into the urethra and travel up into the bladder and kidneys. When you have a UTI, the lining of the bladder and urethra become red and irritated just as your throat does when you have a cold. The irritation can cause pain in your lower abdomen pelvic area and even lower back, and will usually make you feel like urinating more often. Burning or pain when urinating is the most common symptom. You may even feel a strong urge or need to urinate but only get a few drops. This is because the bladder is so irritated that it makes you feel like you have to urinate, even when you don't have much urine in your bladder. At times, you may lose control and leak urine. You may also find that your urine smells bad and is cloudy.
Further complicating things is the fact that somewhere between 40 percent-60 percent of all women will experience at least one urinary tract infection during their lifetime. Add to that, is the connection between urinary tract infections and dementia.
Often, a senior of elderly person may suddenly become confused, hallucinate, or have a drastic change in behavior. Mistakenly, this can be considered to be dementia or Alzheimer's, even though urinary tract infections can make dementia or Alzheimer's worse, it is not necessarily the case.
In a younger person, the urinary tract infection would likely reveal itself with painful symptoms. In older people, it shows up as confusion, agitation or withdrawal.
So, as you can see, there is a plethora of reasons why the medical profession, as well as patients and families can find themselves on an antibiotic to treat a "urinary tract infection".
The takeaway is to know that we have reached a point in routine healthcare where we have to ask questions; even when it comes to being asked by a doctor to "pee in a cup".
In addition, you want to make sure that the next antibiotic that you really need will work, and you work experience antibiotic resistance. Taking unnecessary antibiotics is a problem for many reasons. Not the least of them being that it could be harmful to your health.

'The Report' revisits all the president's torturers from the George W. Bush era

Texto completo: It's never a good sign when the most dramatic scene in a movie owes its power to C-SPAN footage. That's the case with “The Report." It's a based-on-fact story about the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence investigating the CIA's use of torture (excuse me, “enhanced interrogation techniques") during the George W. Bush administration. More specifically, it focuses on the all-consuming efforts of staffer Dan Jones (Adam Driver) to reveal both the illegality and ineffectiveness of the CIA program.
Part of the lack of drama is intentional. Much of “The Report" belongs to what one might call the DC-procedural tradition. The tone is consciously chilly, the acting underplayed. People sit in windowless or underlit rooms. They shuffle paper, write on white boards, click keyboards, stare at computer screens. Sometimes, as a change of pace, they debate policy or attend PowerPoint presentations. The menacingly blank facade of CIA headquarters at Langley, Va., is played for all its worth.
Stylistically, the founding film in this tradition is “All the President's Men" (1976). So it will come as no surprise — though perhaps as a disappointment — that, yes, “The Report" includes a semi-clandestine meeting in a parking garage. This one's between Jones and an unidentified New York Times national-security reporter (Matthew Rhys) who sure has a lot in common with James Risen (who's thanked in the closing credits).
A sizable chunk of “The Report" does not belong to this tradition. It goes to the other extreme: torture scenes in Afghanistan and other black-ops sites. The camerawork is handheld-jittery; and the tone intense and overheated, as it should be.
There are two problems here. Instead of complementing each other — each strain serving as moral, visual, and emotional counterpoint to the other — they're more like cognitive dissonance. That's not good. The other problem is worse. What both strands of “The Report" share is phoniness. Neither offers a sense of this-is-really-how-it-was persuasiveness.
This isn't necessarily a question of factuality (though it is odd that we're told that before being hired by the Senate committee, Jones worked for the CIA — whereas in real life it was the FBI). CIA director George Tenet (Dominic Fumusa) screwed up, big time, but was he really that sweaty and furtive in private? Yes, the enhanced-interrogation program was demonstrably a failure. But were the two psychologist contractors who designed it, James Mitchell (Douglas Hodge) and Bruce Jessen (T. Ryder Smith) such patently self-aggrandizing chuckleheads? They're presented as a very sinister version of Abbott and Costello.
This is Scott Z. Burns's debut as a feature director. He's primarily been a screenwriter, often for Steven Soderbergh: “Contagion" (2011), “Side Effects" (2013), earlier this fall “The Laundromat." That background may account for what's most impressive about “The Report." The movie is flashback-heavy, jumping around from 2001 to 2014, and plenty of points in between. It's also at times policy-wonk obscure, throwing out all sorts of names from deep inside old news stories (hello, Senators Saxby Chambliss and Mark Udall). But Burns's narrative remains consistently clear. That is no small achievement.
If Burns's screenwriting background may account for “The Report" moving along smoothly, it makes more puzzling how maladroit the dialogue is. That maladroitness has a lot to do with the lack of plausibility. “It throws the whole program under the goddam bus," one Bush aide grumbles to another. This is not how bureaucrats and policymakers talk. It is, though, how screenwriters think they talk. Nor is it likely that lawmakers and people who work for lawmakers would fail to know the difference between going to jail (which is bad) and going to prison (which is very, very bad). And surely Jones doesn't need to be told by his boss, “Senate staff don't have to run for reelection. She does."
The she in question is Dianne Feinstein. Annette Bening plays California's senior senator with a fine blend of acuity and steeliness. At first glance, you're tempted to think, “Hey, why is Annette Bening wearing that terrible wig?" Soon enough, you realize how persuasively she inhabits the role. As Obama White House chief of staff Denis McDonough, Jon Hamm does his suave, detached Jon Hamm thing. Tim Blake Nelson, as a CIA whistleblower, has just one scene — and electrifies it. He is the Jane Alexander equivalent here (to return to “All the President's Men"), and that is very high praise.
Adam Driver is staking a claim to 2019. He was very funny hunting zombies in “The Dead Don't Die." He's getting excellent reviews for “Marriage Story," which opens here Nov. 22. He returns next month as Kylo Ren — boo, hiss — in “Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker." Driver is a naturally recessive actor. That served him well last year, amid all the hugger-mugger of"BlacKkKlansman." Here the recessiveness means he blends in all too well with that Langley facade.
The C-SPAN footage mentioned above shows Senator John McCain's Dec. 9, 2014, speech on torture and the committee report. “This question isn't about our enemies," McCain says. "It's about us." In revisiting that question and putting it in human terms, “The Report" does a signal service. In muddling and reducing that question, it loses the signal for the noise.

Texto completo: Two patients in China were diagnosed with plague, the deadly and infectious disease tied to historic pandemics, local media reported.
The two people, from Inner Mongolia, were treated for pneumonic plague in Beijing's Chaoyang district, local health officials said Tuesday, according to Caixin and state-media Xinhua.
The news outlets reported the patients received "proper treatment," and disease control measures and prevention methods have been taken.
According to Caixin, the patients were treated at Chaoyang Hospital, which has since replaced all chairs in its emergency room.
The Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention said the patients were quickly isolated and health officials investigated everyone who could have been exposed to them, The New York Times reported. Chinese health officials also called the risk for further infections "extremely low. "
Pneumonic plague is one of three forms of the infectious disease and the only one that can be transmitted from person to person by inhaling infected droplets – for example, spread when someone breathes in cough droplets from an infected person.
The U. S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention calls pneumonic plague the "most serious form of the disease. " All three forms are caused by the Yersinia pestis bacterium.
Earlier this year, a Mongolian couple died from the bubonic plague after eating raw marmot meat. The case sparked a quarantine in the area for days, but no additional cases appeared to have been reported.
More on plague in Mongolia: After eating raw rodent’s kidney for 'good health,' couple die of bubonic plague, spark quarantine
The couple ate the rodent's raw meat and kidney, which people in the area believe is good for health, a World Health Organization official told the BBC at the time.
A person is infected with bubonic or septicemic plague usually via infected flea bite or handling infected meat. Either form of plague can develop into pneumonic plague if they go untreated and spread to the lungs, the CDC says.
Fever, headache, weakness and rapidly developing pneumonia are all symptoms of pneumonic plague, the CDC says.
Plague is treated with modern antibiotics, but throughout history, pandemics have caused widespread death around the globe, including the Black Death – the pandemic that swept across Europe in the mid-1300s and killed millions. Infections in humans do still occur in parts of the western United States, too, though modern cases are not usually fatal, the CDC says.

Texto completo: Authors will present books considered of Jewish interest during the 2019 Miami Book Fair taking place from Nov. 17-24 at Miami-Dade College's Wolfson Campus.
At 6 p.m. on Nov. 18, Bari Weiss - staff editor and writer for the New York Times - presents her book, "How to Fight Anti-Semitism," in which she delivers an urgent wake-up call to all Americans while exposing the alarming rise of anti-Semitism in this country. Weiss felt an urgency to write this book following the Oct. 27, 2018 shooting tragedy in which 11 peopled died and six others injured at the synagogue in which she became a bat mitzvah, Tree of Life - Or L'Simcha Congregation in Pittsburgh. In the book, she explains what people can do to defeat anti-Semitism. The book also addresses radical Islam's hostility towards Jews and its expression not only in countries like Iran but also in Europe.
"I want to give people a sense of the contemporary landscape of anti-Semitism, what it looks like from the far right, what it looks like from the far left and what it looks like coming out of the Muslim world," Weiss said, regarding what she hopes people can take away from her upcoming book presentation.
Weiss continued, "I feel it's clear that if you look at history, societies where anti-Semitism flourishes are societies that are dead or dying, and I wrote this book first and foremost as an American who cares so much about the future of this country."
"I hope people understand that with anti-Semitism, its proximate victims are obviously Jews, but the broader victim of anti-Semitism is the surrounding society where anti-Semitism flourishes. The main reason why I wrote this book is that I want this country to survive, thrive and live up to its ideals, which is why I feel it's very important for every American, not just Jews, to take up the fight against this virus."
At 4:30 p.m. on Nov. 24, Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative journalist and author Debbie Cenziper presents her book, "Citizen 865: The Hunt for Hitler's Hidden Soldiers in America," which tells the story of a team of Nazi hunters at the U.S. Department of Justice.
Cenziper explained her reasons for writing this book.
"This book explores a part of the history of the Holocaust that mainstream audiences were not familiar with, including myself. I think we know a lot about World War II and the Holocaust, but there was a lethal killing force in occupied Poland that I had never heard of before and that I don't think even Western investigators and scholars knew a lot about for a long time, so this book talks about a piece of the Holocaust that we never really knew much about."
Cenziper, continued, "I was also fascinated by the work of American Nazi hunters, specifically how they were able to live in these dark places year after year interviewing survivors, witnesses and killers, and then go on and have normal lives themselves."
Other books considered of Jewish interest that will be presented at the book fair include "Savage Feast" by Boris Frishman, "Return to the Reich: A Holocaust Refugee's Secret Mission to Defeat the Nazis" by Eric Lichtblau, "Wunderland" by Jennifer Cody Epstein, "The Plateau" by Maggie Paxson and "Family Papers: A Sephardic Journey Through the Twentieth Century" by Sarah Abrevaya Stein.

Risk, benefit of Bloomberg running Sun Sentinel Editorial

Texto completo: The Democrats have 17 candidates clamoring for their presidential nomination, offering a wide and impressive array of experience and ideas. What makes Michael Bloomberg believe they may need another?
For one thing, he's not the only person who thinks so.
A problem in having so many choices - too many, really - is that people are slow to settle on one. Meanwhile, Joe Biden, the one whom Donald Trump fears most, is struggling to raise money befitting a front-runner. He's also losing traction to Elizabeth Warren, whose advocacy of mandatory Medicare for All and a wealth tax worry some who might accept them, but for two more urgent priorities.
Those priorities are defeating Trump and electing a Congress not hostile to moderate and achievable reforms such as Medicare for those who want it - that is, the public option that should have been in the Affordable Care Act all along.
Bloomberg isn't the only Democrat who doubts that Warren or Bernie Sanders could accomplish all that.
This is a nation that welcomes progress, but prefers that it come in measured strides, rather than great leaps forward.
Should Biden falter in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina - the earliest of the caucus and primary states - Bloomberg's plan would be to make a late but bold grab for Super Tuesday March 3, with its huge haul of Texas, California and 12 other states and territories.
But a late-entry strategy has been tried and failed every time, notably by Rudy Giuliani. Bloomberg would be fairly accused of having skipped places he couldn't win.
November 2020 will be a close election, no matter what some polls show, because of the anti-democratic influence of the Electoral College. There will be no votes that the Democrats can afford to waste. The advantages of nominating a centrist would be significant.
Bloomberg is certainly a centrist. He has broad potential appeal to Democrats passionate about gun control and saving the climate, both of which he has supported with enthusiasm and money. His campaign contributions aided the success of Florida's Fair Districts voter initiatives in 2010, and just helped turn Virginia blue.
But Biden, too, is a centrist. So are Amy Klobuchar and some others.
It is Biden's candidacy that stands the most to lose from a Bloomberg campaign, which could hardly help the others. Bloomberg's primary campaign could have the paradoxical consequence of nominating Warren or Sanders and re-electing Trump. Before committing to the race, Bloomberg should think very seriously about that.
There's no doubt that Bloomberg despises Trump and what he has done to and with the presidency.
"I'm a New Yorker, and I know a con when I see one," the former mayor told the Democratic National Convention in 2016.
The contrasts between the two billionaires, assuming that Trump actually is one, couldn't be more pronounced. Bloomberg built a hugely successful business without help from a deep-pockets father. American courthouses aren't littered with litigation over a chronic refusal to pay tradespeople what they are owed. He has never resorted to bankruptcy. He is intelligent, educated and well-mannered. He was never fined for looting a charity. And he proved himself in office before seeking the highest office of all, serving three competent terms as the mayor of a city more populous than 38 states.
But to overcome the other accomplished Democratic candidates, there are several large issues he will have to manage.
* His wealth. Democrats don't mind nominating rich people for the presidency, people like Franklin D. Roosevelt, John F. Kennedy and John Kerry, for example But Bloomberg, whose fortune has been estimated at $52 billion, would be by far the wealthiest. Voters would and should demand that he release his income tax forms. As mayor, he insisted they would tell competitors too much about his private business.
He also would need to persuade voters that his opposition to Warren is more about electability than about his long-standing ambition to be president or about her proposed wealth tax, which he opposes. He's not the only person by any means who thinks it's unconstitutional, but that's an open question. What's not in question is that the top 1 percent is concentrating its wealth at a rate not seen since the Gilded Age. Bloomberg would need a persuasive answer for that.
* His campaign strategy. Clearly, he could afford to spend a billion dollars on Super Tuesday and not miss the money. But he shouldn't entirely self-finance his campaign. Democrats won't like that. He should appeal for small contributions, like Sanders did so successfully - not for needing the money, but for offering voters some ownership in his campaign. The risk is that it could embarrass him with a low yield. In that event, it would tell him something.
* His liabilities with blacks and Hispanics. They were the people most often stopped and frisked without cause in a police department practice he still defends. A federal judge called it "indirect racial profiling" and his successor revoked it. At its peak in 2011, nearly 700,000 people were searched. Only 10% were white, according to New York Times columnist Charles Blow, and nearly 90% were innocent.
"Bloomberg used the fear factor to keep white New Yorkers in line," Blow wrote in a fiery column Monday, denouncing what he called a "terror campaign against those young black and Hispanic men."
Bloomberg would likely retort that he was trying to prevent gun violence in minority communities, but it would be a hard sell. Crime has been declining in New York, as well as in most other places, without massive apprehensions of innocent civilians.
Bloomberg deserves credit for deciding early not to run as an independent, which he realized would likely result in splitting the anti-Trump vote and re-electing the president. Before committing to running as a Democrat, however, he should satisfy himself that his candidacy would not have the same tragic outcome.
Editorials are the opinion of the Sun Sentinel Editorial Board and written by one of its members or a designee. The Editorial Board consists of Editorial Page Editor Rosemary O'Hara, Sergio Bustos, Steve Bousquet and Editor-in-Chief Julie Anderson.

Texto completo: Three teachers were also injured in the attack, in which a man entered a kindergarten in Yunnan Province and sprayed a caustic chemical, the official state news agency said.
A man sprayed a corrosive chemical inside a kindergarten in southwest China, injuring 51 students and three teachers, according to the official state news agency.
The attack, which took place Monday afternoon in the Yunnan Province city of Kaiyuan, left two people with serious injuries that were not considered life-threatening, according to the Xinhua news service.
An hour after the attack, the police detained a 23-year-old man, whose surname they gave as Kong. The authorities said he sprayed the chemical, called caustic soda, "as a revenge on society," Xinhua reported.
Caustic soda, also known as sodium hydroxide, can be a colorless to white substance appearing as flakes, beads or a granular form, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The substance can cause irritation to the eyes, burns to the skin and a temporary loss of hair.
The episode is the latest instance of violence at Chinese schools this year. In September, a man attacked an elementary school in Hubei Province in central China on the first day of the semester, killing at least eight students and wounding two others, the police said.
In April, a man armed with a knife killed two students and injured two others at an elementary school in Hunan Province in central China.
And in January, 20 children were injured after a man with a hammer attacked an elementary school in the Chinese capital, leaving three students seriously injured, the authorities said at the time.

Texto completo: The Environmental Protection Agency is pushing forward with a policy that could limit the science the agency uses to underpin regulations, a change long sought by conservatives but derided by many scientists and public health experts as an effort to stifle reliance on research into the harmful effects of pollution on Americans.
The agency in recent days submitted an updated version of its Strengthening Transparency in Regulatory Science rule to officials at the Office of Management and Budget. If OMB approves, the next step would be to seek public comment, signaling that the EPA intends to finalize the controversial proposal in 2020.
The effort first gained traction when then-EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt pushed for the changes during a high-profile announcement in April 2018. He called it a move toward greater transparency that would increase Americans' trust and confidence in the research on which the EPA bases major decisions.
The new rule would allow the EPA to consider only studies where the underlying data is made available. Critics say that would restrict the use of research that includes sensitive personal data and hamstring the agency's ability to protect Americans from toxic chemicals, air pollution and other risks.
In the annals of science, there aren't many reports that had as much of an impact as Harvard's Six Cities Study of 1993. The administration's proposal, critics add, could prevent the use of such landmark research, which showed a stark association between long-term exposure to air pollution and higher risk of premature death. That work has influenced government pollution standards that research shows have saved thousands of lives.
On Wednesday, the House Science, Space and Technology Committee will hold a hearing on the subject titled 'Strengthening Transparency or Silencing Science'; one of the top EPA officials overseeing the plan will testify.
Momentum for the policy seemed to slow after that initial proposal. Pruitt left the EPA months later amid a flurry of ethics inquiries, and opponents of the proposal flooded the agency with comments and vows to fight the effort in court.
However, Pruitt's successor, Andrew Wheeler, has made clear that he intends to move forward with the effort, which has long been championed by conservatives such as former congressman Lamar Smith (R-Tex.), who for years sought unsuccessfully to establish a similar requirement legislatively.
'Good science is science that can be replicated and independently validated, science that holds up to scrutiny. That is why we're moving forward to ensure that the science supporting agency decisions is transparent and available for evaluation by the public and stakeholders,' Wheeler told a congressional committee in September. 'I fundamentally believe the more information we provide to the public, the better our regulations will be and the more they will trust our decisions.'
The New York Times first reported details of the updated proposal Monday, citing a draft it had obtained.
On Tuesday, the EPA took issue with parts of that report, saying in a news release that the Times had relied on a 'preliminary' draft, and not the 'final text' sent to OMB for review. In particular, the agency insisted that the proposal would not apply retroactively to existing regulations and that it would include measures to protect confidential personal information from public release.
The agency, however, declined to share a copy of the updated proposal or describe how it had changed until the interagency process is completed and a public comment period begins.
Still, the EPA's working to finalize the measure before the end of President Trump's first term, overriding the opposition from science and public health groups, brought another round of swift criticism.
'This proposal has nothing to do with science. They want politicians, not scientists, to evaluate the evidence of harm to the public,' Michael Halpern, deputy director for the Center for Science and Democracy at the Union of Concerned Scientists, wrote in an online posting. ' . . . This entire exercise is designed to exclude certain types of public health studies that demonstrate that pollution makes people sick.'
Hayden Hashimoto, a legal fellow at the Clean Air Task Force, an advocacy group that, along with others, has questioned whether the EPA has the legal authority to impose the new rule, said the EPA had not adequately identified a problem in need of solving.
'Vague appeals to transparency do not warrant the agency impairing its use of quality science,' he said in a statement. 'EPA already has peer review processes in place to evaluate influential scientific information that the agency relies on for its regulations.'
EPA officials said Tuesday that once the agency publishes its latest proposed revisions and additions, it will take public comments for 30 days on the changes. They said that when the agency finalizes the rule in 2020, it will take into account the more than 600,000 comments it has received since the agency first proposed the rule in 2018.

Texto completo: Police Chief Andrew Kudrick Jr.'s most recent annual salary was $187,792.
HOWELL – The township's police chief's pay scale is about 20 percent behind the highest-paid chiefs in the state — but that may be about to change.
The chief's top-end salary could be as high as $250,000 if the Township Council approves an ordinance change Tuesday. As of now, the highest salary a chief can make is $201,000. Police Chief Andrew Kudrick Jr.'s most recent annual salary was $187,792, according to state pension records.
The revisions to the salary ordinance and a new contract for Kudrick were introduced on the same evening on Oct. 22. Both the salary ordinance and the contract would take effect retroactive to Jan. 1, 2019, according to township records. The specifics of the contract were not immediately available. Neither the chief, Mayor Theresa Berger nor Brian Geoghegan, the township manager, have returned multiple messages requesting comment on the developments.
Only three police chiefs in New Jersey make more than $250,000, according to pension records, but several make more than $200,000.
A 25-year veteran of the force Kudrick became a full-time police officer in 1994, according to pension records. He has served as a patrol sergeant, community services lieutenant and training officer. He has also worked as a supervisor with the department's canine unit. He became chief in 2015.
Kudrick was already chief in October 2018 when, in a bizarre traffic incident that turned into a foot chase, he apprehended a knife-wielding motorist who police said menaced a family in another car and refused to stop for police.
The Howell Township Police Department generally, and Kudrick personally, have long enjoyed support among the community and the council. The department won top police department in Monmouth County in the 2019 Asbury Park Press Reader's Choice survey.
When in 2018 the Asbury Park Press published an investigative series that included a story on the death of a man in Howell police custody, the Township Council issued a resolution denouncing the Press' reporting and declaring support for Kudrick's department.
As of now a township chief can take home between $95,000 and $201,000 in base pay. Under the proposed new scale, a chief's new pay would start at $150,000 and top out at $250,000.
That top-end salary is higher than that of outgoing New York Police Department Commissioner James O'Neill, who took home $226,530 a year, according to the New York Times. O'Neill ran a department of approximately 36,000 sworn officers, compared with Kudrick's 87 subordinates, according to New York City data and New Jersey pension records.
But $250,000 would not be the highest salary a New Jersey chief has seen, even recently. In Carlstadt, former police Chief Thomas Nielsen's salary hit $261,650 before his retirement in June, according to state pension and borough council records. In Monroe in Middlesex County, former Chief Michael Lloyd made $250,462 before his retirement earlier this year. And on the Jersey Shore, chiefs in Toms River and across the causeway in Seaside Heights have salaries that topped the quarter-million mark.
More than 4 in 10 New Jersey police officers earn more than $100,000 a year before factoring in overtime pay. The median salary for a NJ police officer this year is $93,000 with a median of 13.6 years in the state's pension system. Of agencies in Monmouth County, Howell has the highest median salary for police officers, at about $140,000 with a median of 14.7 years in the pension system.
Monmouth County had a median police salary of about $109,000 with 14.9 years in the state police pension system.
Howell's potential new pay scale only covers base salary and not other "additional pay, compensation and benefits" that may be part of an employment contract, according to the ordinance.
Kudrick's new contract would take effect retroactively to Jan. 1 and expire July 1, 2024, according to the resolution announcing it.
The chief's salary is only slightly higher than that of other top supervisors. Captains John F. Storrow, Mark J. Pelicki and Thomas F. Rizzo's most recent base salaries were $184,692, $186,050 and $186,966 respectively, according to pension records.
The specifics of his new contract were not immediately available. The Asbury Park Press filed a records request for the contract Friday with the township clerk's office. State law allows seven business days for a public agency to respond to, deny or request a continuance on records requests.
Mayor Berger was absent for the vote to accept Kudrick's new contract. The other four members of the council — Deputy Mayor Evelyn O'Donnell, John Bonevich, Pamela Richmond and Thomas Russo — unanimously approved a resolution to accept the contract. The resolution passed on the council's "consent agenda," bundled together with several others for a single vote.

Texto completo: Gambia, on behalf of Rohingya Muslims, opens an international dispute with Myanmar in an effort to have the country's leadership tried for genocide.
PARIS -- An arsenal of international laws has failed to confront the impunity of Myanmar's government and security forces for their deadly purge of the country's Rohingya Muslim minority, forcing hundreds of thousands to flee a campaign of rape, arson and killing.
But on Monday, Gambia filed a lawsuit accusing Myanmar of genocide, summoning the case before the United Nations' highest court in an effort to open a legal path against the country's authorities.
In the suit, filed at the International Court of Justice in The Hague, Gambia requested that the court condemn Myanmar for violating the Genocide Convention with its campaign of ethnic cleansing.
Gambia, a small West African country with a largely Muslim population, was chosen to file the suit on behalf of the 57-nation Organization of Islamic Cooperation, which is also paying for the team of top international law experts handling the case.
The filing amounts to a last-ditch effort to impose an international ruling against Myanmar: Despite a wide outcry over cruelty to the Rohingya, no other court has jurisdiction to pursue a genocide case against the country.
Gambia also requested that the International Court of Justice issue an urgent temporary injunction ordering Myanmar to halt all actions that could aggravate or expand the existing situation. That could mean a demand to stop further extrajudicial killings, rape, hate speech, or leveling of the homes where Rohingya once lived in Rakhine State.
"It is clear that Myanmar has no intention of ending these genocidal acts and continues to pursue the destruction of the group within its territory," the lawsuit said, adding that the government "is deliberately destroying evidence of its wrongdoings to cover up the crimes."
The court's 15 judges rarely deal with genocide. Based in the stately Peace Palace in The Hague, the Court of Justice was set up by the United Nations to rule on disputes between nations. It acts more like a court of appeal, focusing on questions of international law, such as disputes over borders or disagreements over international conventions.
But that can also include disputes arising from the Convention for the Punishment and Prevention of Genocide, established in an earlier case when Bosnia sued Serbia for genocide. The convention covers "acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such."
In its suit, Gambia claims that applies to Myanmar. The novelty in this case, though, is that Gambia is not at war with Myanmar, as Bosnia and Serbia were. But the Genocide Convention treaty does establish a mandate for member nations to act against genocide, wherever they are.
Experts say that if the court accepts the case, whatever the outcome, it will draw renewed attention to the immense suffering of the Rohingya people, most of whom fled to Bangladesh and now live in refugee camps there.
It is not clear how Myanmar, which has always denied accusations of ethnic cleansing and genocide and argues that it was defending itself against an insurgency, will respond to the case.
"Myanmar will ignore this at its peril," said John Packer, a professor of law at the University of Ottawa who has long studied the Rohingya's plight. If the court hears the case, he said, "there will be a sort of public truth-finding exercise. Myanmar's simple denials will not stand up to scrutiny."
A different body, the International Criminal Court, was specifically created to prosecute genocide and other atrocities. But that court has no jurisdiction over cases in Myanmar because the country has not signed on to the court's treaty. (Neither have the United States, China, India, Israel and several other countries.)
But the I.C.C. did set itself up to at least partly take up the case against Myanmar last year, when it ruled that it could prosecute for "deportation" and associated crimes against Rohingya who fled to Bangladesh, which is a court member. But judges have not yet approved a criminal investigation by the court's prosecutor.
Gambia's lawsuit against Myanmar was born out of a series of meetings of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation at which the country's attorney general, Abubacarr M. Tambadou, assumed a position of leadership because of his special expertise. He had worked more than a decade as a lawyer at the United Nations tribunal dealing with the 1994 genocide in Rwanda.
In a telephone interview, Mr. Tambadou said he had been very moved by his visit to the Rohingya refugee camps in Bangladesh.
"The world failed Rwanda when the international community did not prevent the genocide while it was unfolding," he said. "The treatment of the Rohingya is illustrative of the international community's failure to prevent genocide in Myanmar. I thought this was not right. The world cannot stand by and do nothing."
The resulting lawsuit, seen by The New York Times, leans heavily on reports by United Nations fact-finding missions and what it calls other credible sources.
Multiple United Nations investigations have underscored what they called a genocidal intent behind the campaign against the Rohingya.
It says that all members of the Rohingya group in Myanmar are presently in grave danger of further genocidal acts because of Myanmar's deliberate and intentional efforts to destroy them as a group. It also stresses that the remaining Rohingya communities and individuals in Myanmar continue to face daily threats of death, torture, rape, starvation and other deliberate actions aimed at their collective destruction, in whole or in part.
The lawsuit notes that Rohingya Muslims have been subjected to persecution for decades in Myanmar, which denies that the Rohingya even exist as an established ethnic minority, despite hundreds of years of history in the country.
But pressure increased greatly in late 2016, according to the lawsuit. It cites examples of "attacks in which homes were set ablaze by security forces, in many cases with people trapped inside, and entire villages razed to the ground."
One investigator documented cases where parents saw their young children being thrown into fires. The suit cites incidents of Myanmar's "security forces calling families out of their homes, separating men and boys to be executed in front of their families or taken away." It cites testimony about women and girls being raped and then killed.
The suit says that so-called "clearance operations" were genocidal acts, "intended to destroy the Rohingya as a group, in whole or in part, by the use of mass murder, rape and other forms of sexual violence, as well as the systematic destruction by fire of their villages, often with inhabitants locked inside burning houses."
It said that from August 2017 onward, such "clearance operations" intensified.
Paul Reichler, the lead lawyer on the Gambia team, said he hoped that the court would issue an injunction against Myanmar as soon as possible.
"We are confident that genocide has been committed in this case, and we are very confident in the fairness of the court."

Texto completo: Another Democrat, Representative Ilhan Omar, had a different response to the news: "Good riddance."
Maybe he just should have called.
Senator Chuck Schumer of New York responded to the announcement on Monday that Representative Peter King, the Long Island Republican, was retiring by publishing a warm tribute to Mr. King on Twitter.
Such an across-the-aisle embrace has long been par for the course on occasions of retirement, death or other political farewells.
But in a hyperpartisan era in which ideology often trumps old-fashioned bonhomie, Mr. Schumer was rebuked by members of his own party for saying Mr. King "stood head & shoulders above everyone else" and "fiercely loved America, Long Island, and his Irish heritage and left a lasting mark on all 3."
"I will miss him in Congress & value his friendship," the senator concluded.
Many Twitter followers of Mr. Schumer, the highest-ranking Democrat in the Senate, did not agree with the sentiments.
"Good grief," read one of the more polite responses. "Have you lost your mind?"
Indeed, the tweet prompted more than 10,000 replies, mostly negative and some downright nasty. Videos of thumbs-downs, eye-rolling and heads shaking "no," flooded into Mr. Schumer's feed, as the word "resign" got tossed about.
Many of those outraged by Mr. Schumer's praise pointed out Mr. King's more controversial positions and statements, including when he said that there are "too many mosques" in America; that protesting N.F.L. players are similar to Nazis; and that Eric Garner's death was the result of his obesity and asthma, rather than the chokehold applied by a New York Police Department officer.
Add in Mr. King's frequent support for President Trump and his policies, and Mr. Schumer's comments seemed even more galling -- and divisive -- to some on the left.
Another of Mr. King's congressional colleagues, Representative Ilhan Omar of Minnesota -- a Muslim-American who herself has been the subject of Twitter fury -- had a blunter take on his retirement announcement, noting his inflammatory statements about Islam and Mr. Garner.
"Good riddance," she said.
Regardless of the criticism, Mr. Schumer did not delete the tweet despite some calls to do so.
"SERIOUSLY SCHUMER??," wrote Peter Daou, a former adviser to Hillary Clinton, about the tweet. He chastised Mr. Schumer for "fawning" over Mr. King and other Democratic leaders for "enabling" Republicans. "We need a new Democratic Party."
The reaction to Mr. Schumer's tweet was not completely unexpected, though some said it was overblown.
Brian Fallon, the executive director of the activist group Demand Justice and a former top aide to Mr. Schumer, noted that Mr. King had a deep local and middle-class appeal -- he will have served more than a quarter century when he retires -- and that the senator had become "fond of him."
"The two of them worked shoulder to shoulder in the years after 9/11 fighting to get Homeland Security funding for New York," Mr. Fallon said. "Pete King would criticize his own party when Bush's budgets would shortchange the grant amounts allotted for New York, and Schumer respected that about him."
Angelo Roefaro, a spokesman for Mr. Schumer, said the senator and the representative "had many disagreements on many issues, especially on immigration, his attitude toward Muslims, and women's rights," which manifested itself in efforts by the senator and other Democrats to defeat Mr. King last fall.
But, he added, "they've worked closely together on issues vital to New York, like delivering much-needed federal aid locally post 9/11, Superstorm Sandy and backing universal background checks legislation," for guns.

Texto completo: A little more than two weeks after Facebook announced a news initiative, the social network was on the defensive, responding to a published report that a website co-founded by the company's top news executive had displayed bias against Elizabeth Warren.
Popular Information, a liberal newsletter, reported on Monday that The 74, a nonprofit education policy website co-founded by Facebook's top news executive, Campbell Brown, had published several articles attacking Ms. Warren, a senator from Massachusetts and Democratic presidential candidate. One of them called Ms. Warren "the second coming of Karl Marx."
The newsletter entry was written by Judd Legum, a former editor of the defunct liberal website ThinkProgress and a onetime Democratic political operative. It argued that the articles critical of Ms. Warren that appeared on The 74 were relevant to Facebook's move into the news business, because Ms. Brown still sits on the site's board. Mr. Legum also reported that the family foundation of the education secretary, Betsy DeVos, was a donor to The 74.
Ms. Brown responded swiftly to the criticism on Monday, saying in a Twitter thread that her involvement with The 74 had no bearing on Facebook News and that the articles singled out by the newsletter were opinion essays, not news articles.
"The 74 is not part of Facebook News and the FB news team does not and has not supported The 74 in any way," Ms. Brown wrote on Twitter. "I still care deeply about the issues The 74 covers so I remain on the board of directors w/no editorial role and make personal donations (it's a nonprofit)."
Ms. Brown, a former anchor at NBC and CNN, also said that she had listed her relationship with The 74 in her Twitter biography. She added that her support for the charter-school movement -- a frequent topic in The 74 -- puts her in the company not only of Ms. DeVos, but of Cory Booker, a senator from New Jersey and a Democratic presidential candidate.
The flap is the latest sign that Facebook will be susceptible to charges of bias now that it has stepped more boldly into the role of media publisher.
The company drew the close attention of journalists, politicians and anyone else on the lookout for signs of partisanship when it announced Facebook News, a separate section on its mobile app featuring reporting from publications including BuzzFeed, The New York Times, The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal.
News organizations responded positively to the move, for the most part, because Facebook is able to deliver readers in huge numbers and had agreed to pay for some content. There was skepticism, too, some of it resulting from Facebook's decision to include Breitbart, a far-right news and commentary site, among the publications it had chosen to highlight. On Friday, Facebook News removed posts from Breitbart that claimed to identify the whistle-blower who set in motion an impeachment inquiry into President Trump.
Steve Snyder, the editor in chief of The 74, said in his own tweets Monday that the site had also published opinion pieces critical of Ms. DeVos and her policies, along with news articles dispassionately covering education. "Nothing is structured here to prioritize one viewpoint over another," Mr. Snyder said in an interview. He added: "Campbell plays no editorial role."
Mr. Legum defended his newsletter story in an interview. "She maintains a public association and is admittedly still involved in the website -- she sits on the board," he said, referring to Ms. Brown. "I don't think it's illegitimate to say we should be able to evaluate what's on there and that it reflects somewhat upon her approach."
A Facebook spokeswoman said in an emailed statement that The 74 was not among the sites whose articles will be featured in Facebook News's selection of top stories, adding that Ms. Brown had always been open about her relationship with the site. "Any suggestion otherwise is baseless," the spokeswoman said.
When the company announced its push into news last month, Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's chief executive, said he hoped the new tab's users would number in the "tens of millions" in the United States and "hundreds of millions" globally.

From One Mayor to Another, on His Presidential Chances: 'Not Even Close'

Texto completo: Mayor Bill de Blasio portrayed Michael Bloomberg as out of touch with Democratic values: "a billionaire who epitomizes the status quo."
Mayor Bill de Blasio, not far removed from his own failed presidential bid, said on Monday that there was "no way in the world" that his predecessor in City Hall, Michael R. Bloomberg, deserved the Democratic nomination for president.
"This is a Democratic Party today that's getting more progressive, that wants to address the concerns of working people, that does not accept the status quo," Mr. de Blasio said. "There's no way in the world we should nominate a billionaire who epitomizes the status quo."
Mr. de Blasio portrayed Mr. Bloomberg as being out of touch with current Democratic values, and suggested that Mr. Bloomberg's 12-year tenure as mayor of New York was a showcase for some of his worst instincts.
"I think when he was mayor he had no understanding of the inequality crisis," Mr. de Blasio said. "He was absolutely tone-deaf to what working people were going through in this city, and there were a number of other areas where he had a chance to do something and he just did not make it a priority."
Mr. Bloomberg filed paperwork last week to run in Alabama's Democratic primary contest. His advisers say he is likely to enter the race, and may employ the risky strategy of skipping the four early primary states to focus on big states that hold later primary elections.
"I can be objective about some of his strengths and weaknesses -- I can certainly prefer him over Donald Trump," Mr. de Blasio said on Monday, when asked about Mr. Bloomberg's nascent campaign. "But does he represent today's Democratic Party? Of course not. Not even close."
He added that his own mayoral victory in 2013 came in large measure because he ran as the anti-Bloomberg.
"Obviously, when I got elected," Mr. de Blasio said, "I think it was in large measure because people wanted a very, very different approach."
The mayor's comments, while consistent with remarks he made during the 2013 campaign, in which he blamed Mr. Bloomberg for turning New York into a "tale of two cities," are actually a departure from his more recent and more measured stance toward Mr. Bloomberg.
The mayor has offered occasional praise for Mr. Bloomberg's work on public health initiatives and efforts on gun control and immigration. And he has even given his predecessor credit for starting programs that the de Blasio administration has since expanded, such as selling air rights to fix the city's decrepit public housing.
Stu Loeser, a spokesman for Mr. Bloomberg, declined to comment about Mr. de Blasio's remarks on Monday.
But Chris Coffey, who worked as a senior official in all three of Mr. Bloomberg's administrations, was less reluctant to weigh in -- and took a potshot at Mr. de Blasio's penchant for showing up at City Hall well past 9 a.m.
When Mr. Bloomberg was running the city, "New Yorkers knew that the mayor was going to get up at 6:15 a.m. and work really hard for six or seven days a week," said Mr. Coffey, who leads the New York practice for Tusk Strategies, a political and strategic consulting firm. "We don't have that now."
Mr. de Blasio, he added, may owe some of his success to his predecessor, who "put money into rainy day funds and was a good steward of the budget."
Should Mr. Bloomberg be in need of advice on how to handle criticism of his stop-and-frisk policing policies as he takes steps toward entering the presidential race, he could ask Mr. de Blasio how he dealt with similar attacks.
Mr. de Blasio was protested twice on national television during his run for the 2020 Democratic nomination over his refusal to fire the police officer involved in the chokehold death of Eric Garner, a Staten Island man accused of selling loose cigarettes.
"Mayor de Blasio is right in the sense of what Mayor Bloomberg has done for low-income New Yorkers of color should disqualify him" from becoming president, said Alyssa Aguilera, co-executive director of Vocal-NY, a nonprofit that helps low-income people. "He exacerbated inequality and changed the DNA of the city."
"But at the same time," she continued, "Mayor de Blasio said a lot of the right things in the progressive space, but we didn't see him being bold and taking on the police union and developers. Neither of them should be president."

Judge dismisses Trump lawsuit against NY over tax returns

Texto completo: A federal judge on Monday dismissed President Trump's lawsuit against New York officials that was aimed at preventing the release of his tax returns.
Judge Carl Nichols handed down a 19-page ruling, finding the US District Court in Washington, D.C., does not have jurisdiction to hear the case.
Trump sued New York's attorney general, tax commissioner, and the House and Ways Means Committee in July, seeking an injunction to block the application of a New York state law known as the TRUST Act that could allow the Democratic-controlled House to obtain the tax returns.
The House committee and its chairman, Representative Richard Neal of Massachusetts, have not requested Trump's New York state tax returns. But the lawsuit was filed preemptively, citing concerns that the panel could use the TRUST Act to try to procure Trump's state returns.
Trump has refused to release his tax returns since he was a presidential candidate and is the only modern president who hasn't made that financial information public.
The TRUST Act, which was signed into law in July 2019, allows state officials to access the tax returns of certain government officials, including the president, if the tax returns are requested by a congressional tax committee and have been requested for a legitimate legislative purpose.
Trump's attorney, Jay Sekulow, said he was reviewing the ruling.
New York's attorney general, Letitia James, said in a statement that she was "pleased with the court's conclusion."
In a separate case, a federal appeals court ruled earlier this month that Trump's tax returns can be turned over to New York prosecutors by his personal accountant in response to a grand jury subpoena.

Trump's public appearances become a referendum
President Trump had just begun to speak on an outdoor stage here at Madison Square Park in front of a couple of hundred military veterans when the whistles and catcalls could be heard from beyond the security perimeter where crowds had gathered, along with a chant: "Lock him up!"
High above, in the windows of the tall buildings overlooking the park, a handful of makeshift signs were also visible: "IMPEACH" and "Dump Trump."
If Trump had hoped to kick off his hometown's annual Veterans Day parade with an apolitical tribute to the armed forces, he instead was treated to another reminder that virtually every one of his public appearances has turned into a referendum on his presidency amid the mounting impeachment inquiry by House Democrats.
From loud boos at Nationals Park in Washington, D.C., last month to a huge ovation at a college football game in Tuscaloosa, Ala., this past weekend, Trump has faced a real-time voice vote from the American electorate, with nearly a year to go before ballots are cast on Election Day.
"It's an indication of just how deeply polarizing President Trump is that he has to kind of carefully cherry-pick stadiums or universities or venues because chances are he's going to get booed, or the boos will be louder than the cheers," said Douglas Brinkley, a presidential historian at Rice University.
As the first sitting president to participate in the Veterans Day parade in New York, Trump mostly stayed away from politics during his remarks, though he highlighted the US Special Forces operation last month that ended in the death of Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, which has become part of his campaign stump speech.
After presiding over a wreath-laying and a moment of silence, Trump returned to his motorcade, which sped down the parade route along Fifth Avenue and pulled up to Trump Tower.
The president entered his private residence before the parade began.

Veteran N.Y. Republican in House says he will retire
Representative Peter T. King, the longest-serving Republican in New York's congressional delegation, said Monday that he would retire, joining a growing exodus of Republicans from Congress before the 2020 elections.
King, who is serving his 14th term in the House, said in a statement that his decision was primarily motivated by the desire to end the weekly commute to Washington after nearly three decades and have “more flexibility" to spend time with his children and grandchildren.
But in an interview, King conceded that the toxic political environment in Washington and the uncertainties of a coming impeachment proceeding against President Trump had underscored his sense that it was time to leave.
“Something was building for a while," King said. The difficulties of coordinating his Thanksgiving and Christmas travel plans with family amid the unknowns of the impeachment battle, he said, “somehow became like a metaphor" fueling his decision.
The exit of King, 75, comes as a growing number of Republicans have decided to retire rather than seek reelection as they eye the grim political realities for their party, including the prospect of sharing a ticket with an unpopular president. King is the 20th House Republican to depart Congress at the end of 2020 because of retirement or seeking another office.

McConnell: Bevin 'had a good four years,' but probably lost
Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, said Kentucky's governor, Matt Bevin, "had a good four years," but he says a review of Bevin's narrow reelection defeat is unlikely to change the outcome.
Bevin trailed Democrat Andy Beshear by about 5,000 votes in the Nov. 5 election. A recanvass of votes is scheduled Thursday.
McConnell said he's "sorry Matt came up short." He said that the recanvass is unlikely to change the election results, and that "barring some dramatic reversal on the recanvass, we'll have a different governor in three weeks."
Bevin has refused to concede and cited voting irregularities in the governor's race but has not provided evidence. Some Republican leaders have said Bevin should accept the results of the recanvass if Beshear's lead holds.
"My first election was almost the same number of votes that Beshear won by. We had a recanvass, added them up, it didn't change, and we all moved on," McConnell said.
McConnell was asked whether he was concerned about the results of the governor's race ahead of his own reelection effort next year. Republicans won all the down-ticket races in Kentucky, despite Bevin's apparent defeat.
"Well, we'll find out, because the 2020 election is underway already," McConnell said.

‘It Can’t Happen Here’: Sinclair Lewis’ message reverberates

Texto completo: The New York Times and much of the U.S. press had opposed his election, but their constant attacks had only served to enhance his electoral prospects. Now, during his second year in office, the president wanted “louder, more convincing Yeses from everybody around him,” according to the nationally known writer who chronicled his rise to power.
The description of an American president surrounded by “yes” men may have a contemporaneous ring, but these words were written more than 80 years ago by Minnesota native Sinclair Lewis about his fictional creation, a president with the unlikely name of Berzelius Windrip.
The ignominious Windrip appeared on the pages of Lewis’ 1935 novel just as Hitler and Mussolini were tightened their hold on their beleaguered nations. At home, two American demagogues, Louisiana’s Huey Long and Detroit-based Father Charles Coughlin, had gained a national following during the early years of the Great Depression.
In “It Can’t Happen Here” Lewis tells the story of Berzelius Windrip, known as Buzz, who is elected president in 1936 and transforms the United States into a totalitarian dictatorship. Loosely patterned after Huey Long, Windrip is serving in the U.S. Senate as a Democrat from an unidentified state when he bursts onto the national political scene.
“He was an actor of genius … with the power of bewitching large audiences,” Lewis writes. “There was no more overwhelming actor on the stage, in the motion pictures nor even on the pulpit. He would whirl arms, bang tables, and glare from mad eyes. … But below this surface stagecraft was his uncommon natural ability to be excited by and with his audience, and they by him.”
Attacks on the press, appeals to prejudice
Throughout his book. Lewis develops themes that continue to resonate in the world of 21st-century American politics. As the story unfolds, Windrip begins his rise to power, campaigning for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1936. Buzz augments his theatrical talents with attacks on the press and overt appeals to the racial and religious prejudices of his core supporters. The centerpiece of his 15-point program is a populist call for increased taxes on the rich and the redistribution of those tax dollars to ordinary Americans in the form a $5,000-a-year federal payment.
Buzz succeeds in wresting the Democratic nomination away from Franklin Roosevelt (who expected to face a real-life challenge from Huey Long in 1936. But Long’s life was cut short by an assassin’s bullet in September 1935, just as Lewis’ novel was being published).
Windrip goes on to defeat his Republican challenger, Walt Trowbridge, in the November 1936 general election. Trowbridge was defeated, Lewis explains, because he “represented integrity and reason in a year when the electorate hungered for frisky emotions, for the peppery sensations associated, usually not with monetary systems and taxation rates, but with baptism by immersion in the creek, young love under the elms, straight whiskey, angelic orchestras soaring down from the full moon.”
Windrip’s despotic takeover of the U.S. government is seen through the eyes of a small-town newspaper publisher named Doremus Jessup (known as Dormouse to his friends and family). As the novel opens, Jessup is living a bucolic life in the town of Fort Beulah, Vermont. Gradually, Jessup comes to recognize the threat that the newly elected president poses for the American democracy.
President declares martial law
The book’s tone shifts to dystopian when Windrip declares martial law after Congress refuses to pass his bills, giving him full control over legislation and stripping the Supreme Court of its ability to block his edicts. His private army, the Minute Men (M.M), begins rounding up opposition congressman. Those who resist are charged with “inciting to riot,” while those who supported Windrip are “safeguarded” by the M.M. to protect them from “irresponsible and seditious elements,” according to a White House spokesman.
When Jessup writes a scathing editorial criticizing the Windrip regime and its Corporate State (Corpo) he s beaten by M.M. thugs and forced to convert his newspaper, the Fort Beulah Daily Informer, to a mouthpiece for Windrip and Corpo. Then, when Jessup’s loyalty to Corpo is questioned by neighbors who now support the Windrip regime, he is imprisoned in a concentration camp set up outside of Fort Beulah. Eventually Jessup escapes and joins the resistance, the New Underground, led by an exiled Walt Trowbridge, who is living in Canada.
(In a nod to his native state, Lewis makes Minnesota the center of the resistance and sets one of the key battles between Corpo and the New Underground in the town of Osakis, located 15 miles from his home town of Sauk Center.)

Jessup blames himself and others like him

As fashioned by Lewis, Jessup may be a hero, but one with self-aware flaws. At one point, after he has been imprisoned by the M.M., he blames himself and others like him for the destruction of the American democracy. “The tyranny of this dictatorship isn’t primarily the fault of Big Business nor of the demagogues who do their dirty work,” he tells himself. “It’s the fault of Doremus Jessup! Of all the conscientious, respectable, lazy minded Doremus Jessups who have let the demagogues wriggle in, without fierce enough protest.”
Despite his archaic references and overly melodramatic plot, Lewis delivers a message that has disturbing implications for current state of American politics. “It Can’t Happen Here” serves as a cautionary tale for modern-day Doremus Jessups, who let “demagogues wriggle in without fierce enough protest.”

Texto completo: He represented New Jersey's Second District for 20 years, then was ambassador to Panama in a crucial period.
William J. Hughes, who served 20 years in Congress representing the Second District of New Jersey and then was United States ambassador to Panama during the years leading up to the transfer of control of the Panama Canal from the United States to Panama, died on Oct. 30 at his home in Ocean City, N.J. He was 87.
The Godfrey Funeral Homes posted his funeral notice.
In Congress, Mr. Hughes, a Democrat, was known for his work on issues related to senior citizens, the environment and gun control. For most of the 1980s, he was chairman of the House Subcommittee on Crime, a period that produced a ban on armor-piercing bullets and some attempts to limit assault weapons and tighten record-keeping on handguns, among other proposals.
Mr. Hughes said he was not anti-gun -- "I'm a hunter myself, and I own guns myself," he told The New York Times in 1992 -- but the National Rifle Association continually opposed his initiatives, and his political enemies zeroed in on the gun issue when he ran for re-election in 1992.
Anonymous fliers circulated that fall pictured a saluting Adolf Hitler above the words: "Everyone in favor of gun control raise your right hand. Dump Bill Hughes." (His election opponent, Frank LoBiondo, said he had no connection to the fliers and condemned them.)
Mr. Hughes won that election, which turned out to be his last. He declined to run again in 1994 (Mr. LoBiondo, a Republican, won the seat that year), and in 1995 President Bill Clinton named Mr. Hughes ambassador to Panama. He served in that post until October 1998. In 1999, completing a 20-year process set in motion by treaties signed during President Jimmy Carter's administration in the 1970s, control of the Panama Canal was formally transferred to Panama.
Among the honors Mr. Hughes received in his home state was the dedication, in 2008, of a research center at Stockton University in Galloway, N.J., in his honor. New Jersey's current governor, Phil Murphy, invoked it in a tribute posted on his official website.
"Congressman Hughes will continue to inspire future leaders through the work of the William J. Hughes Center for Public Policy at Stockton University," the governor said, "perhaps the most fitting tribute to his tremendous legacy."
William John Hughes was born on Oct. 17, 1932, in Salem, N.J., in the southwest part of the state, to William Wesley Hughes and Pauline Hughes Mehaffey. He grew up in nearby Penns Grove, graduating from Penns Grove Regional High School in 1950.
He graduated from Rutgers University in 1955 and earned a law degree at the Rutgers law school in Camden, N.J., in 1958.
Mr. Hughes joined the law firm of Loveland, Hughes and Garret in Ocean City.
"Much of my work was in the area of wills and trusts and estates," he told the States News Service in 1993, explaining how he had come to serve on the House Select Committee on Aging, "and I represented a lot of senior citizens who had no families."
He was first assistant prosecutor for Cape May County, N.J., from 1960 to 1970, accounting for another area of interest once he was elected to Congress, crime. He first ran for Congress in 1970, unsuccessfully challenging the Republican incumbent, Charles W. Sandman Jr.
Four years later, though, after Mr. Sandman had gained notoriety for his aggressive defense of President Richard M. Nixon as the House Judiciary Committee was considering articles of impeachment, Mr. Hughes used that against him.
"When Sandman spoke," he told The Times just before the election that November, "the nation either laughed or wept, and the people were disgusted with that they saw: a sneering, sarcastic, old-line politician who behaved like a carnival barker and one who couldn't possibly see right from wrong."
Mr. Hughes won handily, and challengers in his subsequent elections didn't come close to defeating him. In 1990, the Republicans didn't bother to field a candidate.
Mr. Hughes's subcommittee on crime produced legislation to fight drug trafficking, child pornography and other problems. Also during his congressional tenure, he championed a ban on coastal dumping -- his district included the southern part of the Jersey Shore -- and secured preservation of parts of the New Jersey Pine Barrens, the wild, heavily forested area in the southern part of the state.
Mr. Hughes married Nancy Gibson in 1956. She died last year. He is survived by a brother, Daniel; three daughters, Lynne Hughes, Barbara Hughes Sullivan and Tama Hughes; a son, William Jr.; 10 grandchildren; and four great-grandchildren.
Mr. Hughes's wife died after an eight-year battle with a progressive neurodegenerative disease, The Press of Atlantic City said in her obituary. He was her primary caregiver during that time.
"My mom lived longer because of my dad," Lynne Hughes told the newspaper.

Jazz critic Nate Chinen dives deep into our changing relationship with the genre

Texto completo: When jazz critic Nate Chinen talks about artists whose recent work excites him, he's quick to mention vocalist Cecile McLorin Salvant.
Hers is the first name encountered in Chinen's book "Playing Changes: Jazz for the New Century," which he will discuss at two Jazz St. Louis events this week, and its placement there is by design.
"In some ways, it's a book about our changing relationship to tradition," Chinen said by phone from his home in New York's Hudson Valley. "The way we talked about the jazz tradition at the end of the 20th century is different from the way we talk about it now."
Chinen sees McLorin Salvant as having solved one of the essential questions facing jazz artists today: how to absorb and acknowledge the genre's long and incredibly rich history without being trapped into merely emulating it.
"Cecile is so deeply in tune with jazz history and with cultural history," Chinen says. "She's not just retracing those steps; she's really interrogating it, she's turning it on its side, she's finding her own way to speak that language."
Of course, there's no one prescribed method of approaching jazz, and "Playing Changes" addresses some of the myriad ways that today's artists are expanding the genre and moving the music forward.
The book profiles a host of jazz innovators including pianists Vijay Iyer, Jason Moran, Brad Mehldau, Robert Glasper and "Late Show With Stephen Colbert" bandleader Jon Batiste; guitarist Mary Halvorson; saxophonists Kamasi Washington, Steve Coleman, John Zorn (who studied at Webster University) and Donny McCaslin, whose band accompanied David Bowie on his final album; and bassist Esperanza Spalding, who has used social media to lay bare her creative process.
"Playing Changes" is a deep dive into language of jazz and the mysteries of artistic creation, but it's intended for a general audience.
"I wrote the book certainly with the idea that a jazz initiate would appreciate it and get something out of it," Chinen says. "I didn't want it to be too inside-baseball."
Chinen is the editorial director of Newark, N.J., jazz radio station WBGO, a frequent contributor to NPR music coverage and also works closely with the multimedia program "Jazz Night in America," which last year produced a program featuring the Bad Plus playing live at the Ferring Jazz Bistro. Previously, he was a regular contributor to the New York Times and a longtime columnist for JazzTimes.
The book opens with a provocative chapter on Washington, whom some have crowned a new jazz savior -- the implication being, of course, that jazz needs saving.
"I really do feel like we weren't talking about jazz saviors prior to the period where jazz stopped being a popular music," Chinen says. Rock 'n' roll took hold commercially in the late 1950s, after which jazz became "something much more elevated -- more of a sophisticated niche taste."
Chinen charts that course by which jazz came to be called, in that famous -- and to some degree infamous -- phrase, "America's classical music." As jazz staked out its cultural significance, it emphasized preservation over innovation and sought institutional support and academic respectability.
In short, it went uptown.
Its power center is quite literally in uptown Manhattan: Jazz at Lincoln Center. Along with its managing and artistic director, Wynton Marsalis -- who in his earlier days was hailed as a jazz savior, too -- JALC became a symbol of the stultifying conservatism that eventually took hold of the music.
On the one hand, Chinen says, the success of Jazz at Lincoln Center "is self-evident, and I think it's a really positive thing. But there's a cost to that, in the sense that, if jazz is high culture, it's no longer in touch with the noise and chaos of the streets."
As for Marsalis, Chinen says he sought to present a nuanced portrait of him in the book. "I have enormous admiration for him, but I also harbor certain ambivalences about his philosophy. To me, he's definitely not a villain, but he's also not unequivocally a hero. It's complicated."
Still, with notable exceptions like New York's downtown scene, centered at the Knitting Factory, the latter decades of the 20th century were rife with the sense that jazz was walling itself off and constantly policing its borders.
"In the '90s, I was aware of a constant set of questions around defining the music," Chinen says. "What is jazz, and when you say that, what are you excluding? I feel like, with the rise of another generation of artists, those questions feel increasingly irrelevant and beside the point."
One of those artists is Glasper, who, around the turn of the century, was among a number of jazz musicians who began to collaborate with hip hop, R&B and soul artists, creating new hybrids as they went along.
For his part, Glasper doesn't seem to feel the need to be polite about it. His most recent release is a mixtape featuring guest artists ranging from Herbie Hancock and Bilal to Andra Day and Yassin Bey (formerly Mos Def). It's titled "F-- Yo Feelings."
"You know, Glasper likes to stir the pot," Chinen says with a laugh. "But really, I see him as really important in terms of changing the conversation around jazz's relationship to black music."
When Glasper arrived on the scene, he says, "it wasn't all that intuitive for pop or hip-hop or R&B artists to seek out jazz musicians to collaborate, and Glasper really made it a natural evolution."
The results, Chinen contends, "have implications that go far beyond whatever our genre silo may be when you consider that this conversation includes Kendrick Lamar, Brittany Howard, people like Flying Lotus, Anderson.Paak and Solange. There's a whole constellation of really interesting African American artists who are in dialogue with jazz, even if you wouldn't call what they're making jazz."

Texto completo: If you are looking for the perfect gift for your most stylish friend, several new books are bound to please. While the words "icon" or "legendary" get thrown around loosely, these books all feature true masters of style in different genres: men's and women's fashion, music and art.

One of the most innovative artists of the 20th century, David Bowie created work that crossed genres and shattered boundaries.

"Chanel: The Making
of a Collection"
By Laetitia Cénac, Illustrated by Jean-Philippe Delhome

This 240-page book contains hundreds of color illustrations by famed artist Jean-Philippe Delhomme detailing Karl Lagerfeld's Spring 2019 collection - Lagerfeld's last before his death.

Cénac weaves in the history of the iconic house with its contemporary collections. $35
"I've Seen the Future and I'm Not Going:
The Art Scene and Downtown New York
in the 1980s"
By Peter McGough
In his memoir, artist Peter McGough tells of that almost-mythical time in New York's pregentrified Lower East Side in the 1980s, when he fell into the East Village's art scene, getting to know artists like Andy Warhol, Keith Haring and Jean-Michel Basquiat, and frequenting mythic locations like Studio 54 and the Chelsea Hotel.
When McGough first moved to New York in 1980, he met and fell in love with another artist, David McDermott, and has collaborated with him ever since. McDermott and McGough became as well-known for their work in painting and photography as much as their lifestyle, which embraced a Victorian aesthetic in all they did, including wearing top hats and detachable collars and living in a converted townhouse lit only by candlelight.
Their paintings were backdated to various decades, depending on the subject, adding a highly conceptual element to the work, and their photography was produced in historical processes such as cyanotype, gum bichromate and salt prints, leading the duo to became hugely successful, and showing in three Whitney Biennials. Told with humor, McGough looks back at their professional and romantic partnership and struggles. $29.95
"Hunks & Heroes:
Jim Moore Four Decades of Fashion at GQ"
By Jim Moore

The book contains 250 of Moore's legendary fashion photographs that showcase in an eye-popping manner the magazine's most memorable covers, many in a double gatefold. It's not simply a look book of cool covers and celebrities but also includes Moore's commentary and shows the evolution of men's style through the decades. Classic covers include a 1980s "American Gigolo"-era Richard Gere and Kanye West, who does the forward for the 352-page book. $75
"Bill Cunningham: On the Street: Five Decades of Iconic Photography"
By The New York Times
From the 1970s until his death in 2016, New York Times photographer Bill Cunningham captured New York street style almost daily. A new book by the newspaper chronicles through his eyes not only how fashion changed over nearly 50 years, but also how people and culture changed. The book focuses heavily on style - it includes essays and contributions from Anna Wintour, Guy Trebay and others - but also on important moments, such as the 1980s New York transit strike, the rise of casual Fridays and President Barack Obama's inauguration. The 384-page book contains famous Cunningham photographs that ran in The New York Times and many never-seen-before images of how he captured life. $65

Texto completo: Visit Yarmouth a dozen, even two dozen times, and you're still unlikely to stumble upon The Garrison.
Down a lazily sloping side-street, on the banks of the Royal River, just past a one-way bridge crossing, you'll find chef Christian Hayes' restaurant inside the old Sparhawk Mill - where chuffing, hydro-powered wheels once spun miles of cord and braided twine for lobstering.
When I tried to describe The Garrison's location to a Yarmouth-based friend, even she couldn't quite place it. "Is it near the park off Main Street?" Sort of. "What about the waterfall?" Not really. "Well, thank god for GPS," she huffed in frustration, terminating our guessing game by pulling out her smartphone. "Oh wow," she said, looking up from her screen. "Yeah, it's in the middle of nothing."
Hayes wouldn't have it any other way.
"I'm inspired by restaurants like The Lost Kitchen, where the chefs are out in their own little world, doing their own thing," he said. "This is where we (Hayes and his wife, General Manager Christine Hayes) started Dandelion Catering, and we just love it here with water on both sides and a garden, so we rented another 2,000 square feet of space in the mill and moved the catering business to make room for The Garrison. But even for Yarmouth, we're a little bit off the beaten path."
The restaurant's semi-isolation translates into a sense of intimacy that the interior amplifies, but not through rough-hewn woods and Scandinavian hygge. Instead arriving guests are shunted, heels clacking, down a brick-and-concrete corridor: a design red herring that misleads you into thinking the dining room must be similarly impersonal.
Surprise. It's not. Leather bar stools, diffuse overhead light from wire-clad pendants that bulge geometrically from their centers and vivid abstract mixed-media canvases commissioned from local painter Jenny Prinn humanize and soften the space beautifully.
Look carefully and you'll spot another clever bit of coziness-building trickery - ceilings appear to be a few feet lower than they actually are, thanks to a dark gray paint job that extends a few feet down the walls.
Christian Hayes unveils a little legerdemain of his own with the menu. Dish names and descriptions are intentionally understated, promising little, then overdelivering when they appear at the table.
Take "Scallops" ($21), which turns out to be a large starter of three caramelized, chili-oil-slicked Harbor Fish Market scallops arranged around a tart, crunchy tarragon-apple relish like campers warming themselves at a crackling fire. But here, what appear to be licking flames are roughly torn slices of fire-curled Spanish Serrano ham.
Or the "Lamb" ($13), an appetizer special that looks as minimalistic on the plate as it sounds. But tasting exposes origami folds of scents and flavors: honey bubbled just to the point of scorching, then quelled with Cara Cara orange segments and apple cider vinegar; toasted salty pistachios blitzed into a ragged puree; runny yogurt jolted awake by preserved lemon and piney thyme leaves.
Ask him to describe his style of cooking, and Christian Hayes first dodges the question (charmingly). "I like leading with 'thoughtful food,' " he says with a laugh, before copping to an allegiance to a mostly Mediterranean style, but one that allows for occasional references to Asian dishes he prepared while building dim sum boards as part of the unusually eccentric menu at Natasha's in Portland.
With about a decade's worth of hindsight, those Asian-inspired nods to his culinary past have evolved into miniature experiments in technique and flavor. Crispy skin dumplings ($13) are a paleo diner's dream: chicken-skin-wrapped bundles of hoisin-dressed ground pork that are first poached, then deep-fried and dunked in a sticky soy-citrus glaze. The pork filling probably could do without the extra cooking step - it gets a little rubbery - but texture barely dims the appeal of this dish.
Better still is lobster (claws and tail) unzipped from its shell and marinated in a rough-pounded paste of lemongrass, ginger, cilantro and garlic, then eased into bubbling ghee ($35). As orders come in, chunks of the wildly aromatic meat are slipped onto a sweet potato hash ladled with coconut curry broth that erupts in flares of fish sauce and bruised makrut lime leaf. I haven't eaten a better lobster dish all year.
Elsewhere, The Garrison's menu leans into Mediterranean approaches, especially with its braised dishes (of which there are several).
For its pappardelle ($28), the kitchen breaks down and slow-braises North Star Sheep Farm rabbit in a Spanish style, using half sherry vinegar and half stock, then blunts the acidic bite of the liquid by cooking it down risotto-style with successive ladlefuls of stock. When added to thick ribbons of pasta alongside crisp cubes of pancetta, chopped olives, caraway-toasted breadcrumbs and Madeira wine, the rabbit and its juices create a terrifically appealing, sweet-savory sauce.
And as much as I adore the stock-braised pork shoulder with classic French pommes puree and a nostril-tickling, pink-peppercorn-strewn slaw of parsnip, apple and fennel ($26), I prefer The Garrison's wine-braised short rib sandwich ($16), a riff on a fast-food burger. Tender shreds of slow-cooked beef, iceberg lettuce, a gauzy slice of melting American cheese, and a burnished, house-made brioche bun dark enough to masquerade as a pretzel roll - what's not to love?
You might even think you've wandered into a child's birthday party if you start with the sandwich and finish with the "Chocolate" dessert ($12) - a warm, fudgy brownie plated with a weirdly disconnected (but nonetheless appetizing) scoop of ganache-like mousse.
Like many dishes on The Garrison's menu, including all of its desserts, the brownie is gluten-free. But according to Christian Hayes, that status is secondary to taste, just as it is with vegan dishes like harissa carrots plated like spokes around a nest of homemade hummus dribbling with tahini and pomegranate molasses ($12).
"A lot of dishes we do are gluten-free. And with the carrots, we wanted a nice vegan dish that somebody who isn't vegan would enjoy," he said. "So I did what I do when I have an idea; I'm very impulsive, so I have to get out a piece of paper and create a map to find my way through it."
Whether on a piece of paper or through GPS, you too will need a map to find your way to The Garrison. But once you've found it, you won't forget the way.

Texto completo: Some years back, I sat in the front row of a community event, waiting for a high-ranking police officer to address a room filled with immigrants from Central and South America.
I flipped open my notebook and uncapped my pen.
I was in reporter mode, ready to write down his remarks.
Then, to my surprise, he looked at me, leaned in close and quietly asked, 'It is more appropriate to say Hispanic or Latino?'
That memory boomeranged back at me the other day because of all the recent talk surrounding another word: Latinx. That whispered question, I realized, if asked today, might have to include a third choice: 'Is it more appropriate to say Hispanic, Latino or Latinx?'
The word Latinx is not new. Neither are the debates it inspires (sometimes within the same family). But in the past week and a half, divisive online discussions about the word have been fueled by two events.
On Nov. 1, a market-research firm published the results of a survey on Medium under the title, 'Progressive Latino pollster: 98% of Latinos do not identify with 'Latinx' label.'
And on Nov. 5, a New York Times opinion piece carried the headline, 'Liberalism's Latinx Problem: Why is Elizabeth Warren describing Latinos with a term that few would use themselves?'
Let's start with that survey. The firm that conducted it, ThinkNow, said it grew out of a curiosity 'about the appeal of 'Latinx' among the country's 52-million people of Latin American ancestry.'
The Medium piece explained that the firm polled 508 people, presenting them with the most common terms used to describe that population. They were then tasked with picking the one that best described them. Their options: Hispanic, Latino/Latina, American, my country of origin, my country of origin + American, Chicano/Chicana, Latinx, and if all those felt wrong, 'I don't like any of these names/labels.'
The results reflected what you might expect because of some terms' long-established places in our language wells. Most people chose 'Hispanic' and 'Latino/Latina.'
Few chose 'Latinx.'
'Despite its usage by academics and cultural influencers, 98% of Latinos prefer other terms to describe their ethnicity,' read the piece. 'Only 2% of our respondents said the label accurately describes them, making it the least popular ethnic label among Latinos.'
We could pause here and dissect the survey. We could try to pull it apart piece by piece.
We could also just give it what it's worth: a shrug.
It's not surprising that most people with Latin American roots don't reach for that identifier first. Most didn't grow up hearing it roll off the tongues of their abuelas. Some may have never heard it all. I know some of my Mexican American relatives haven't.
I also know that if I asked them to describe themselves, they would all reach for different words. One might say Hispanic. Another, Mexican. Another, Mexican American. And, because I have a BIG family, it's a safe bet there are a few Latinxs in there.
Sure, some Latinos despise that 'x' and have criticized it as crossing out their heritage. In an article by my colleague Rachel Hatzipanagos, a woman described it as 'Anglicizing the Spanish language.' In that same article, Ruby Corado, a transgender activist in the District, who had to fight to be recognized as a Latina, said, 'I come from the old school, so I actually like the term 'Latina.' But I embrace that term, [Latinx] as well.'
Picking a preferred identifier does not mean a person rejects all the other ones. I generally identify as 'Latina' because it feels the most right to me and my experiences, but I wouldn't snub my Chicana cousin or my Latinx nephew if they decide those are the labels that fit them best. I also understand why someone who graduated from my high school, which was majority Hispanic, might just call themselves 'American.'
But that complex picture is not the one you would have been left with if you clicked on different media sites after that Medium piece published. Several outlets placed the survey in a political context, connecting it to Sen. Elizabeth Warren's embrace of the word 'Latinx.'
'Sen. Elizabeth Warren, one of the front-runners in the 2020 Democratic primary, frequently uses the term on the campaign trial including on the Democratic debate stage,' read a piece published that same night by the Washington Examiner. 'In September, she celebrated 'Latinx Heritage Month,' which is usually recognized as National Hispanic Heritage Month, on Twitter.'
'Shocker! Latinos do not want progressives like Elizabeth Warren, Pete Buttigieg, and Beto O'Rourke messing with their language,' read a piece that ran the next day on the conservative site TheBlaze.
At the top of that piece was the headline: 'Poll: Genderless woke label 'Latinx' is not popular among Latinos.' At the bottom, the last line ended with a very unwoke, 'muy bueno.'
The New York Times column, written by Ross Douthat, noted the progressive nature of the word (which Merriam-Webster added to the dictionary in September 2018). The 'x' provides a gender-neutral, non-binary alternative to the feminine 'Latina' and masculine 'Latino,' which makes it popular among the LGBTQ community.
'When spoken, 'Latinx' sounds like neither normal English nor conversational Spanish, and it looks like what it is, a word designed for ideological purposes rather than for felicity in speech,' Douthat wrote. He went on to argue that Warren's 'adoption' of the word 'suggests that Warren is distinctively beholden to a hermetic academic-progressive world, to a point where she doesn't know how to talk to the less-ideological, less-woke, maybe-even-somewhat-conservative Hispanics whose votes her party needs.'
Warren may not win the Hispanic votes she needs. None of the Democratic candidates may. But let's be real " if that happens, it won't be because Latinos didn't like the word she used or what it suggested about her.
If that were true, then I wouldn't still have relatives and former classmates with Hispanic last names who ardently support President Trump. He has described Latino immigrants as 'rapists' and 'animals.' More concerning, he has suggested certain citizens are not American. He described an Indiana-born federal judge as unable to be impartial because he was 'Mexican.' And in September, he asked CNN contributor Steve Cortes, 'Who do you like more, the country or the Hispanics?' As if one isn't a part of the other.
In fairness, though, he did tweet about his love of Hispanics. Many people, I'm sure, haven't forgotten when he wrote, 'Happy #CincoDeMayo! The best taco bowls are made in Trump Tower Grill. I love Hispanics!'
I understand the urge to push back against political correctness and how 'Latinx' may seem like yet another way for a person to unintentionally offend someone. There is an easy way around that concern: You can ask people how they want to be identified.
When that police official asked me which word he should use, I knew he did so with the best of intentions.
I assured him either was fine.
I didn't have a poll to support that. I just knew that the Latinos/Hispanics/Latinxs gathered in that room " just like many of us now tuned in to the presidential election " had so many high-stakes concerns that it didn't matter what he called them.

Texto completo: This book is really two separate stories. One is about a tunnel, the other about a traitor; one embodies ingenuity, the other evil. But they intersect in Berlin during the depths of the Cold War, when the West was petrified that the Soviets would stage an unprovoked and undetected assault. Steve Vogel quotes CIA chief Allen Dulles warning President Dwight Eisenhower in 1953, 'The Russians could launch an atomic attack on the United States tomorrow.'
That fear of annihilation motivated the United States and Britain to dig a tunnel from the American sector of Berlin into the Soviet sector, where the allies could tap into key telephone lines that ran close to the border and overhear the plans of Russian military and intelligence officers. Richard Helms, later the CIA director, called it 'the most elaborate and costly secret operation ever undertaken within Soviet-occupied territory.' Costly and risky, but the stakes were enormous. As Vogel writes, 'The Berlin tunnel was born of . . . desperation.'

The Soviets were equally desperate. Their goal was to counteract Western power and pressure, and they had a secret weapon " not a missile but a man, a highly placed British intelligence officer named George Blake who had turned against his country years before and was assigned to take minutes at a top-secret meeting that outlined the tunnel project. He gave his Soviet handlers a copy of those minutes and a 'simple sketch' of the tunnel's route.
Here is the supreme irony at the core of this tale: The Russians heard about the tunnel before it began, yet did nothing to stop it. So few people were in the know that if Moscow tipped its hand, Blake would have immediately fallen under suspicion, and he was too valuable to risk exposure. 'In essence,' writes Vogel, 'the KGB foreign intelligence directorate was sacrificing Soviet military, political, and scientific secrets to protect its own secret " George Blake.'
The tunnel operated for 11 months before the Soviets decided that Blake was safe and they could score a propaganda victory by disclosing the excavation while their new leader, Nikita Khrushchev, was visiting London in April 1956. But in fact, as the Post editorialized, the Russians made a 'grievous mistake' by revealing the tunnel, which provided clear 'evidence that the tradition of Yankee resourcefulness and ingenuity is not a myth after all.' Moreover, the information gleaned from the wiretaps about Soviet strengths and strategy 'remained valuable for a decade and more,' noted Helms.
This is a fascinating, fast-paced narrative, and Vogel is particularly well-suited to write it. A former foreign correspondent for The Washington Post, he was born in Berlin in 1960, the son of a CIA agent, and 'the city always held a mystique for me,' he writes. For good reason. Cold War Berlin was a divided city symbolizing a divided country, a divided continent and really, a divided world. And the political and military rivals that faced off there didn't build bridges of understanding. They built a tunnel, and later a wall, which only aggravated their animosities instead of easing them.
If Berlin was a divided city, Blake was a divided personality, who spent his whole life seeking a clear identity and never quite finding it. His father, Albert Behar, was a Turkish Jew who earned British citizenship by fighting with the Brits in World War I. His mother was a Dutch Protestant, and he was raised a Christian in Rotterdam, but after his father's death, 13-year-old George was sent to live with rich relatives in Cairo. He returned to Holland at the outbreak of World War II, became a courier for the Dutch resistance, escaped through France and Spain to England where his mother had changed the family name to Blake, and enlisted in the British navy. His commander then 'took a fateful step' and recommended Blake to the Secret Intelligence Service, also known as MI6. In 1948 he was assigned to the Korean capital, Seoul, and on July 2, 1950, he was captured by North Korean soldiers and spent three years as a prisoner of war. While in captivity he embraced the communist cause and offered to spy for the Soviet Union.
Why? The man who had once considered the priesthood had lost his faith, 'so there was a vacuum in my mind,' he later said. That vacuum was not just religious but political and personal. Was he Behar or Blake? Jew or Christian? Dutch or British or Turkish? He was an officer in the 'hallowed SIS,' but 'he deeply resented the class consciousness and snobbery he encountered' in British society, especially from the family of a girlfriend who objected to their romance. For Blake, writes Vogel, 'declaring allegiance to communism was akin to a religious conversion.' A man without a country or a cause had found a creed that filled the hole in his soul. 'To betray, you first have to belong,' he once said. 'I never belonged.'
Blake was eventually arrested in 1961 and after a brief trial was sentenced to 42 years in prison, 'the longest sentence imposed in modern British history, going back 150 years.' But on Oct. 22, 1966, he managed to escape with the help of three confederates who tossed a rope ladder over the prison wall. He eventually made his way to Berlin and from there the KGB flew him to Moscow, where he lives today at age 96.
'George never has any regrets,' his cousin insisted, but this reader is not convinced. His wife and children left him, the Soviet Union collapsed, and the communist dream died. Berlin has been united for many years now, but Blake remains a man who never quite belonged anywhere and still doesn't.

Impeachment will play out on TV -- and Trump will win

Texto completo: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi insists the impeachment procedures adopted last week are "the fairest possible." Don't believe it.
In truth, a provision slyly added at the last minute is all but certain to deprive President Donald Trump of the ability to defend himself. Expect a one-sided propaganda circus with Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., acting as ringmaster.
Democrats are boasting about the "impeachment inquiry protections" offered to Trump, claiming they're the same as the rules devised for President Richard Nixon and President Bill Clinton. But that's a baldfaced lie. Section F, quietly devised by Judiciary Committee Chair Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., stipulates that unless the president surrenders executive privilege -- a power even the Supreme Court has ruled is vital to his office -- he and his lawyers will be denied any ability to call or question witnesses.
House Democrats are behaving like thugs, twisting arms to get what the Constitution does not entitle them to demand.
The Judiciary Committee's Section F was triggered recently, when four White House officials refused to show up for Schiff's grilling because Trump and the Justice Department instructed them to stay away. It is the president's right to do that to protect executive privilege. Schiff immediately called these four officials "first-hand witnesses to serious misconduct." That's typically Schiff -- rushing to judgment without hearing any evidence. Expect more of that when the hearings go public in mid-November.
Pelosi defended the House decision to drag out their investigation of the president with formal public hearings, saying "if we don't have a system of checks and balances, we might as well all just elect a president and go home." With all due respect, Madam Speaker, impeachment was never intended to be a part of the routine checks and balances between Congress and the executive. That's what the president's veto power and Congress' override are for. Impeachment was reserved for those rare moments when a president actually may have committed "high crimes and misdemeanors."
It's tragic to see Democrats turning impeachment into a tool to discredit a president merely because he belongs to a different party or they find him objectionable. Allow it to happen once and it could happen again and again, giving the party that controls the House the power to undo presidential elections routinely.
Most presidents facing reelection would be doomed by the rigged House spectacle about to begin. But Trump sees that he can overcome the impact of these televised hearings by going directly to the public himself. He said he's tempted to hold a "fireside chat" with the American people and read the transcript of his controversial July 25 phone call with the Ukrainian president.
Trump's medium is television, and no one is better. New York Times author James Poniewozik, who is no Trump fan, argues in a recent book that Trump doesn't just appear on television; he owes his rise to television.
Compared with Trump, Schiff and his star witnesses are not very telegenic. Typical are demoted Ukrainian Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch, acting Ukrainian Ambassador William Taylor and State Department careerist George Kent. These bureaucrats, reeking of self-importance, are convinced that they know more about foreign policy than the president. They're dripping with disdain for him and the people who elected him.
Meanwhile, Trump shows how to maximize television audiences. In a mere nine-minute Oval Office speech defending the needs for border security, he pulled in a whopping 43 million viewers, ratings that Trump-haters like sleazebag lawyer Michael Cohen and former FBI Director James Comey couldn't touch.
Will Trump win the ratings war against the House Democrats and their witnesses? With a Senate conviction and removal from office highly unlikely, because real evidence of wrongdoing is lacking, the only goal of House impeachment is to damage the president and make him unelectable in 2020. Democrats shouldn't count on that. They'll easily win a vote to impeach Trump, but they're likely to lose where it really counts: in the court of public opinion.

Texto completo: Un fiscal asistente del condado de Harris, Texas, fue despedido este viernes tras rechazar investigar un caso de intento de agresión sexual a un preso de una cárcel por considerar que la víctima era un inmigrante ilegal.
Kim Ogg, la fiscal de este condado, en el que se incluye Houston, anunció que tomó la decisión de cesar al funcionario después de que se llevara a cabo una investigación interna. “Preguntar a una víctima acerca de su estatus migratorio está mal, va en contra de nuestras políticas y no podemos tolerarlo”, afirmó en un comunicado.
Los hechos ocurrieron en la noche de Halloween, según The New York Times. Un preso de una cárcel de la metrópoli texana desnudó su miembro e intentó acercarse a otro detenido contra su voluntad, lo que hizo que la víctima gritara pidiendo ayuda.
Un policía intervino y separó a los dos hombres. Después, denunció lo acontecido a la oficina de la Fiscalía del condado de Harris. El agente creía que se abriría una investigación por intento de agresión sexual y que se aplicara ese cargo al presunto autor, un hombre arrestado por supuestamente conducir ebrio.
Pero las cosas no fueron así. El fiscal asistente John Denholm, quien recibió la denuncia del agente, le preguntó si la víctima era un inmigrante regular o no y si estaba dispuesto a testificar.
El policía le dijo que no le parecía una información relevante, pero alegó que el agredido parecía ser de México. Denholm entonces rechazó la denuncia al pensar que se tratara de un indocumentado.
El caso salió a la luz tras la denuncia de un sindicato y generó gran alboroto en Houston, una ciudad con fuerte presencia de hispanos y donde la policía considera una prioridad evitar cuestionar a víctimas y testigos sobre su condición migratoria. Como explica The Washington Post, un policía presentó la demanda ante otro fiscal. Denholm fue reasignado a otras tareas.
Pero dos sindicatos de funcionarios de aplicación de la ley, al menos un legislador estatal y la Liga de Ciudadanos Latinoamericanos Unidos, un grupo nacional de defensa de los latinos, pidieron el despido del fiscal al considerar insuficiente que se le reasignara o se determinara una sanción disciplinaria contra él. El viernes, la fiscal Ogg decidió escuchar estas criticas.
Denholm trabajaba en la oficina de la Fiscalía del condado de Harris desde enero de 2017. Anteriormente estuvo de teniente de la Oficina del Alguacil del mismo condado. El presidente de una organización de agentes locales indicó al Houston Cronicle que ya en otras ocasiones Denholm rechazó casos y tuvo encontronazos con funcionarios de aplicación de la ley.
En un email de este viernes, el ya ex fiscal asistente dijo al Post que sabía quién había formulado las acusaciones que llevaron a su despido y pareció dar a entender que la versión de la policía sobre este caso era incorrecta.

Texto completo: "Every generation blames the one before." - Mike + The Mechanics
So I guess "OK Boomer" is a thing now. And I gather I'm supposed to be offended by it. Certainly, some people seem to be.
The saying - a dismissive eye roll from Generation Z to their elders - is suddenly all the rage. It appears on hoodies, headlines, tweets and memes, this catch-all response to old folks' nonstop nagging and criticism. Some members of the Baby Boom generation are not amused.
Maureen Dowd of The New York Times sees it as "intergenerational war." Steve Cuozzo of The New York Post says the young ones "really, really hate us." Bob Lonsberry, a conservative radio host, declared "boomer" - no joke - "the n-word of ageism."
Granted, these are media types - not real people - so we should be careful about generalizing. I, for one, can't say I really feel "hate" from young folks. But to whatever degree I should be taking this seriously - "You darn kids, get off my internet!" - I find that I can't. I keep laughing instead.
It strikes me as funny that some in my generation, which defined itself by an insolent rejection of the old, are traumatized by a younger generation's insolent rejection of us. Am I the only one who remembers when the hippies warned, "Don't trust anyone over 30?" Does no one else recall when Pete Townshend sneered, "Hope I die before I get old"?
Then how dare any of us clutch our pearls over a little intergenerational sniping? Besides, it's not as if the kids don't have a point. Our record is certainly mixed.
I'd say our music was better than theirs, but they have better television - and more of it - than we could've dreamt. Boomers made great strides in civil rights for black people, women and the LGBTQ. But we dropped the ball on climate change, failed to address a rigged financial system. And we - the white cohort of us at least - bear blame for the catastrophe of Trump. We deserve both credit and castigation. Every generation does - even the "Greatest."
When I was a kid, I used to tease this old man in the neighborhood for being an old man in the neighborhood. "Keep a'livin'," he'd always retort. And I did. And here I am, just turned 62 and wondering how the heck that happened. The Gen Z kids will too soon enough wonder the same thing. The big wheel keeps on turning.
Usually that confers perspective and context, the soil from which wisdom grows. But you couldn't prove that by these overwrought responses to young people's taunts.
I'm remembering teenage battles with my mom as I write this. As it happens, I've got Nat King Cole playing in the background. He was mom's end-all and be-all. She didn't want to hear any noise from my room about P-Funk getting funked up, Papa being a rolling stone or midnight trains to Georgia. As far as she was concerned, music stopped when King Cole died. I got sick of hearing his name, scorned him on general principle.
But I remember one day mom deigned to listen to the Stylistics with me. Afterward, she sniffed that "Betcha By Golly Wow" was actually a pretty song to have such a silly title. It was a backhanded compliment, but I felt vindicated by it just the same. I doubt she needed my vindication - adults didn't need that from kids back then. Still, somewhere in the intervening decades, I decided Cole wasn't so bad either. I just had to learn how to hear him - and I did.
So the kids may "OK" this Boomer to their hearts' content. Because as they will eventually discover, that old man in my neighborhood was right.
Keep a'livin' indeed.

Opinion: Mary Cain's allegations against Nike, Oregon Project need to be independently investigated

Texto completo: Nike’s sports performance reputation is in shambles today, and rightly so.
Just six weeks after its top track coach was banned for four years for anti-doping violations, former teen running phenom Mary Cain came forward with the chilling accusation that she was “emotionally and physically abused” while training with Nike.
Once revered for its innovative and bold ways, Nike has become known for something else this autumn.
It has become the Russia of sports performance companies.
You can’t trust it. You have no idea what it’s doing behind closed doors. And it must be independently investigated.
Cain’s allegations, appearing in a video for The New York Times, are an American sports tragedy. Arriving in Eugene, Oregon, at the age of 17 in 2013 to train with Nike’s Oregon Project and legendary coach Alberto Salazar, Cain, now 23, said she was met with an all-male staff who told her that in order to better her performances, she needed to become “thinner and thinner and thinner. ”
As Salazar, the coach who has now been banned, and his staff pushed her, Cain said that she developed suicidal thoughts and started cutting herself.
She accused Salazar of shaming her in front of others on the team if she did not meet the weight he wanted for her: 114 pounds. She said he attempted to give her birth-control pills and diuretics to assist with weight loss, even though diuretics are not allowed in the sport.
What happened then was awful: Her lowered weight caused her menstrual cycle to stop for three years, leading to five broken bones. Incredibly, there was no certified nutritionist or sports psychologist on staff with whom she could consult.
In her video, Cain called out Nike directly, saying the company “is not acknowledging the fact that there is a systemic crisis in women’s sports and at Nike, in which young girls’ bodies are being ruined. … I got caught in a system designed by and for men, which destroys the bodies of young girls. ”
Nike responded, but in a most brazen way. Instead of saying right out of the box that it was launching an investigation, or apologizing, or showing any signs of humanity, the first sentences of its statement stunningly went after Cain.
“These are deeply troubling allegations which have not been raised by Mary or her parents before,” Nike said. “Mary was seeking to rejoin the Oregon Project and Alberto’s team as recently as April of this year and had not raised these concerns as part of that process. ”
Only then did Nike say it takes the allegations “extremely seriously,” adding it will launch an immediate investigation “to hear from former Oregon Project athletes,” finishing with the note that Cain’s allegations “are completely inconsistent with our values. ”
After what we’ve seen from the morally bankrupt Oregon Project, which is now defunct, it appears the allegations actually might be completely consistent with the way Nike has been operating its athlete training and performance business.
Cain left the Oregon Project in 2015 but did attempt to return this year, she said on Twitter Friday morning.
“I wanted closure, wanted an apology for never helping me when I was cutting, and in my own, sad, never-fully healed heart, wanted Alberto to take me back. I still loved him. Because when we let people emotionally break us, we crave more than anything their very approval.
“We quickly fell out of touch this summer, and that made the rose color glasses finally fall off. He didn’t care about me as a person; only as the product, the performer, the athlete. ”
As word got out about Cain’s video, the running world laudably rallied around her.
“I had no idea it was this bad,” tweeted 2017 New York City Marathon winner Shalane Flanagan. “I’m so sorry, @runmarycain that I never reached out to you when I saw you struggling. I made excuses to myself as to why I should mind my own business. We let you down. I will never turn my head again. ”
Amy Yoder Begley, a U. S. Olympian who said she was kicked out of the Oregon Project after finishing sixth in the 10,000 meters at the U. S. track and field championships, tweeted that she was told she was “too fat and ‘had the biggest butt on the starting line. ’”
Kara Goucher, another Olympian who also was with the Oregon Project, added her voice. “I have stories to match all of Mary’s claims and so much more. ”
This is a time of great upheaval in the U. S. Olympic community. Sexual abuse, as we know so well, is real. Mental, physical and emotional abuse appears to be real, too. Nike has many crucial questions to answer about how it treated Cain and other top women athletes.
It must face those questions head on in a thorough, independent investigation. There is no running away from this.

U.S., China agree on rolling back some tariffs

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - The United States and China have agreed that an initial trade deal between the two countries would roll back a portion of the tariffs placed on each others' products, a significant step toward defusing tensions between the world's two largest economies.
The so-called "phase one" agreement has not been finalized, and the exact terms are still under discussion. But the Trump administration has committed to rolling back tariffs if an agreement is reached, according to people familiar with the negotiations.
The move suggests the two sides are getting closer to a deal that would provide relief to businesses and consumers that have struggled with the additional costs of tariffs.
The development comes as President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, face increasing political and economic pressure to resolve their 19-month trade fight.
Investors have already begun anticipating some type of resolution. Stocks soared Thursday after the Chinese government said Beijing and the Trump administration had agreed to remove some tariffs as part of any deal reached between the two sides.
Gao Feng, a spokesman for China's Commerce Ministry, said at his weekly news conference in Beijing that China is insisting that any deal include tariff reductions and that the United States had agreed to remove tariffs as part of an agreement.
"In the past two weeks, the leaders of the two sides have conducted a serious and constructive discussion on properly addressing the concerns of both sides, and agreed to cancel the tariffs by stages in accordance with the development of the agreement," he said.
Gao did not specify what tariffs might be dropped, or when.
Last month, Trump announced that he would cancel a planned tariff increase in October as part of a first-phase trade deal, but made no mention of the tariffs he had already placed on more than $360 billion of Chinese products.
Since then, the United States has begun considering rolling back tariffs put in place Sept. 1 on more than $100 billion of Chinese food, clothing, lawn mowers and other products, according to people briefed on the discussions.
Markets, which Trump pays close attention to, are increasingly optimistic about the chances for a deal and have been rising steadily.
Trump took notice Thursday, saying in a tweet "Stock market up big today. A New Record. Enjoy!"
While markets are booming, farm and manufacturing states continue to struggle under the weight of Trump's trade war.
The fight has brought the economies of several farm belt states to a near standstill, Commerce Department data showed Thursday. From the middle of 2018 through the middle of this year, growth in Iowa, Kansas and Nebraska slowed to less than 1% for the year, well below the more rapid expansions they had enjoyed in the first half of 2018.
In the second quarter this year, gross domestic product rose by an annual rate of just 1.1% in Wisconsin, Michigan, Iowa, Illinois and Georgia. GDP grew by just 1% in Indiana and Kentucky.

Billionaires Keep Benefiting From a Tax Break to Help the Poor. Now, Congress Wants to Investigate.

Congress is calling for investigations of and changes to a Trump tax break aimed at helping poor areas of the country in response to reporting by ProPublica and The New York Times showing the program has been exploited by the wealthy and politically connected.
The opportunity zone program, which was part of the 2017 tax law overhaul, was supposed to drive investment toward specially designated low-income neighborhoods. But numerous reports have highlighted ways in which politically connected individuals have landed opportunity zone designations for areas in which they have a financial stake, sometimes at the expense of poorer areas.
ProPublica’s reporting uncovered instances in Baltimore and Detroit in which billionaires stand to benefit from the break in areas that shouldn’t have qualified for the program in the first place. The Times reported that Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin had intervened to get a tract added to the program that included land owned by a billionaire investor.
Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., introduced a bill this week that would significantly narrow the scope of the program. It would remove hundreds of areas that the original legislation allowed to benefit from the break even though they were not poor, including the two areas of Detroit and Baltimore that ProPublica identified. It would also vastly increase the reporting requirements for those taking advantage of the break and narrow the kinds of investments that would be eligible to receive it.
“The Opportunity Zone program has been troubled from the start,” Wyden said in a statement. “The Treasury Department has been steering potentially billions in tax breaks to Donald Trump’s friends, and there are no safeguards to ensure taxpayers are not simply subsidizing handouts for billionaires with no benefit to the low-income communities this program was supposed to help.”
In recent days, Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Cory Booker, a vocal backer of the program since its inception, and Reps. Emanuel Cleaver and Ron Kind also called on the Treasury’s inspector general to review the program, citing the ProPublica and New York Times stories. Their letter requests a review of all opportunity zones to ensure they comply with the eligibility requirements of the program.
Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., recently announced that, if elected president, he would seek to scrap the opportunity zone program altogether. “This is corruption and corporate greed, and it is unacceptable,” he said, citing ProPublica’s Detroit story and other reporting.
Other lawmakers, including House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal, requested the Government Accountability Office review the program and “identify any Opportunity Zones that do not meet the statutory criteria and explain how and why they were designated.”

Texto completo: MSNBC Morning Joe host Joe Scarborough dismissed the upcoming book that's scheduled to be released later this month that's being written by "a senior Trump administration official."
This author is the anonymous Trump official who published an opinion piece in the New York Times last year, claiming that there is a group of administration officials working against Trump's interest and agenda.
Scarborough appeared unimpressed with the book, titled A Warning, and the official who's writing it anonymously and addressed it on a brief tangent from a conversation about former Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions, who recently announced a run for Senate.
“Who cares what they say behind the scenes?” Scarborough said on Friday morning of Republican senators who have privately criticized the president. “Same with that anonymous book. Seriously? Who cares?!”
“We know that he’s been acting like a crazy man inside the White House,” Scarborough said. “Question is: When are you going to affix your name to those charges, and what are you going to do about it?”
In an excerpt that has already been released, the author alleges that Vice President Mike Pence was on board with a plan to remove the president from office via the 25th Amendment, a point that has since been refuted by his representative.
The author also compared the president to “a twelve-year-old in an air traffic control tower" who is "pushing the buttons of government indiscriminately, indifferent to the planes skidding across the runway and the flights frantically diverting away from the airport.”

Texto completo: President Trump encouraged former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg to enter the 2020 Democratic primary, predicting that he would hurt former Vice President Joe Biden’s White House bid.
“He’s not going to do well, but I think he’s going to hurt Biden actually," Trump told reporters Friday as he left the White House. “He doesn't have the magic to do well. Little Michael will fail. He'll spend a lot of money ... There's nobody I’d rather run against than little Michael.”
Bloomberg, 77, is preparing to enter the race, but the billionaire businessman has not yet made a final decision on whether to run, according to the New York Times.
He decided earlier this year to sit out of the race because he saw Biden as a strong candidate, but has been rethinking whether Biden can win the party’s nomination. Bloomberg also doubts the chances that either Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts or Bernie Sanders of Vermont, the leading liberals in the race, could beat Trump in the general election.
Bloomberg is expected to rely on his own wealth to fund his campaign if he decides to vie for the nomination.

Michelle Goldberg: The cure for worrying about Trump is to work against Trump

Texto completo: Last Saturday I was at a restaurant with my daughter when I ran into a friend of a friend. With little preamble she said, her voice choked with panic, “He’s going to win again.” She told me, I think half-facetiously, that she was finding it hard to socialize, because she could scarcely talk about anything but her horror of Donald Trump and her suppurating fear that he could be reelected.
Pundits sometimes address Democratic primary voters as if they were complacent about the chances of another Trump term and need a harsh dose of reality. The primary campaign, New York magazine’s Jonathan Chait wrote recently, “has proceeded in blissful unawareness of the extremely high chance that Trump will win again.” But if there are Democrats out there who think beating Trump is going to be easy, I’ve yet to meet them. I’m deeply scared, and so are most progressives I speak to.
According to the polls, we’re not alone; in one recent survey, 67% of Democrats said they feel anxious about the election. Reports from Iowa suggest that Democratic primary voters, desperate to find a silver bullet against Trump, are wracked with indecision.
“Nobody knows what to do,” one member of a county Democratic committee told The Associated Press. “They’re all afraid.”
Obviously, fear makes sense, given the stakes of this election. But too much of it can be demoralizing, even disabling.
“Democrats are particularly prone to toggling between overconfident jubilance and terrified paralysis,” said Ben Wikler, who was elected Wisconsin Democratic Party chair in June after years with the progressive organizing group MoveOn.
Part of the problem is that it’s not clear exactly what Democrats who abhor Trump should be doing right now. Immediately after the 2016 election, there was the Women’s March, then the airport protests, then the health care town halls. Democrats mobilized for a series of special elections and then for the 2018 midterms. That mobilization is still happening — it’s why Democrats just won big victories in Virginia and, it appears, Kentucky. But at the moment, a lot of Democratic political energy is being spent on the primary, an inevitably divisive process that leaves many people second-guessing themselves.
Those shaken by the possibility of a second Trump term, however, can take concrete steps to make that prospect less likely, even if they don’t live in swing states. Doing so isn’t only useful — it’s therapeutic.
“The best answer to despair is recognizing that you’re not helpless,” said Ezra Levin, co-founder of the progressive group Indivisible and co-author of the new book “We Are Indivisible: A Blueprint for Democracy After Trump.”
Where to start? Well, in Wisconsin, said Wikler, the general election is already underway. Just this past weekend, volunteers braved the snow to knock on 54,000 doors, looking to identify voters who might be sympathetic to Democrats but who aren’t on Democratic voter lists. Until recently, said Wikler, those lists didn’t include a single person in the town of Seymour, population 3,459. But canvassers there found enough people fired up about beating Trump to form their own local group.
At this point, Wisconsin Democrats don’t need outsiders to fly in and knock on doors. What they do need are virtual volunteers to call and text reminders to local canvassers. And, of course, they need money. Once I learned that individuals can donate $10,000 to each of the state Democratic parties, I wondered why I’m not being invited to fundraisers to rebuild the blue wall every weekend.
“As much as people are obsessing over the primary, the work of donating and volunteering and showing up and getting involved — especially in state parties in battleground states — is essential now ,” Wikler said. “People often make panic donations in the last couple of weeks of a campaign. Certainly those donations are welcome, but at the end of a campaign all you can do is buy some more ads. If you make the panic donation a year out, it means that state parties and outside groups can hire more field organizers to train more volunteers to be able to reach out to more neighbors who might never get onto the get-out-the-vote lists unless the conversation starts months and months in advance.”
There are also plenty of things that volunteers can do outside the Democratic Party structure. Andrew Gillum, who narrowly lost the Florida governor’s race last year, is leading a huge voter registration drive in that crucial state. Stacey Abrams, who narrowly lost the race for Georgia governor, has founded a group, Fair Fight 2020, to register and mobilize voters and tackle voter suppression.
Indivisible is working on driving more than 1 million calls to Republican senators who are up for reelection next year demanding a fair and open impeachment trial.
“The goal is not, if you’re in Brooklyn, call into Iowa, because Joni Ernst doesn’t care what you think,” said Levin, referring to Iowa’s junior senator.
Instead, Indivisible has created a tool that allows members to call progressives in states like Iowa, talk to them about impeachment, and then patch them through to their senators’ offices. In Oregon, he said, some people have been hosting calling parties.
Levin reminded me that in 2017, Democrats’ chances of winning the House seemed bleak, given the effect of gerrymandering.
“In early 2017 we got laughed at when we said we could take the House,” he said.
The blue wave of 2018 wasn’t preordained — people built it. They’re building another. The only cure for worrying about whether it will be big enough is to help.

Texto completo: Senior envoy in Syria highly critical of troop withdrawal
WASHINGTON - A senior American diplomat has written a highly critical assessment of the Trump administration's abrupt withdrawal of troops from northeast Syria last month, a decision that paved the way for an attack on U.S.-allied forces in the area, officials said Thursday.
In an internal memo, William Roebuck, the top American diplomat in northern Syria, takes the Trump administration to task for not doing more to prevent Turkey's invasion or protect the Kurds, who fought alongside U.S. forces in the battle against the Islamic State group, according to two U.S. officials familiar with the matter.
One of the officials described the memo, which was obtained and first revealed by The New York Times, as "lengthy and harsh." The officials spoke on condition of anonymity.
Roebuck's memo highlights how President Donald Trump's decision to withdraw the troops was deeply divisive, even within his own administration. The move was widely criticized by Democrats and Republicans as abandoning a key ally in the fight against the Islamic State.
Turkey invaded days after Trump ordered the U.S. special forces to leave.
In the memo quoted by the Times, Roebuck said there was no way to know if more pressure on Turkey's president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, would have stopped the operation.
"It's a tough call, and the answer is probably not. But we won't know because we didn't try," the Times quoted Roebuck as writing.
Trump's ordered withdrawal from the northeast has been somewhat tempered by the deployment of forces to protect oil fields in Kurdish-held areas.

GM selling shuttered factory in Ohio to electric truck maker
TOLEDO, Ohio - General Motors is selling a massive assembly plant it shut down earlier this year in Ohio, a closing that drew threats and scolding from President Donald Trump, to a newly formed company that said Thursday it intends to begin making electric trucks by late 2020.
The company called Lordstown Motors Corp. plans to hire 400 production workers at the outset, but said it still needs more investors before manufacturing can begin.
GM had employed 4,500 people at the factory near Youngstown just two years ago before it began cutting production and eventually in March ended more than 50 years of car manufacturing there, part of a major restructuring plan.
Terms of the sale and the investors who are behind the deal weren't disclosed by the privately held Lordstown Motors.

French leader laments NATO's 'brain death' due to US actions
BRUSSELS - French President Emmanuel Macron claimed that a lack of U.S. leadership is causing the "brain death" of the NATO military alliance, insisting in an interview published Thursday that the European Union must step up and start acting as a strategic world power.
Macron's public criticism of the state of the world's biggest military alliance was rejected by German Chancellor Angela Merkel and NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg, setting the scene for a possible showdown in London next month when NATO leaders meet.
"What we are currently experiencing is the brain death of NATO," Macron told The Economist magazine. He said the United States under President Donald Trump appears to be "turning its back on us."

North Carolina no longer an outlier on sex and consent
GREENSBORO, N.C. - North Carolina's governor has signed a sexual assault bill that says women can revoke consent during sex.
Gov. Roy Cooper said in a news release Thursday that he had signed the bill, which undoes a 1979 court decision that made North Carolina the only state where women can't revoke consent.
The law also undoes a court ruling from 2008 that said sexual assault laws don't apply to people who were incapacitated because of their own action as victims, such as by taking drugs or alcohol. It also increases penalties for child abusers.
The law goes into effect Dec. 1.
Both houses of the legislature approved the bill unanimously last week. Cooper says the bipartisan legislation "will help more people seek justice against abusers."

Okla. woman in failure-to-protect case to be freed
OKLAHOMA CITY - An Oklahoma woman who has served 15 years in prison for failing to report her boyfriend, who served just two years for abusing her children, is scheduled to be released from custody.
The Oklahoma Department of Corrections says Gov. Kevin Stitt has signed the commutation sentence of Tondalao Hall and she is to be released Friday.
Her release comes about after the state Pardon and Parole Board voted unanimously to recommend that Stitt commute her sentence to time served.
Hall's ex-boyfriend, Robert Braxton, pleaded guilty to abusing the children and was released on probation after two years in jail.
The disparity of the sentences outraged women's rights groups and brought further attention to Oklahoma's high rate of incarceration, particularly of women.

Governor of Texas to open homeless camp in Austin
AUSTIN, Texas - Texas' Republican governor said Thursday that he is creating a homeless campsite on 5 acres of state land of the outskirts of downtown in the capital of Austin, escalating a battle with the city's liberal leaders over people living on the streets.
Greg Abbott's announcement was met with a mix of muted welcoming and accusations of political posturing from Democrats who run the state capital around the Texas Governor's Mansion, where Abbott has spent months lashing out at the city's homelessness problem on Twitter.
Abbott spokesman John Wittman said the campsite will have portable restrooms and hand-washing stations. He said it will also provide access to homeless case workers and health care providers until permanent sheltering opens.

In China: A court sentenced nine fentanyl traffickers Thursday in a case that is the culmination of a rare collaboration between Chinese and U.S. law enforcement.
Liu Yong was sentenced to death with a two-year reprieve, while Jiang Juhua and Wang Fengxi were sentenced to life in prison. Six other members of the operation received lesser sentences, ranging from six months to 10 years. Death sentences are almost always commuted to life in prison after the reprieve.

Texto completo: With a year to go before the 2020 election, some national polls show Donald Trump facing daunting, double-digit deficits in his re-election bid.
But the polling in Wisconsin and other swing states paints a far more competitive picture.
Can both be right?
The gap between Trump's worst national polls and his best battleground polls is so big it simply doesn't add up.
But it also reflects something very real about the political landscape: that nationwide surveys don't always capture what's happening in the handful of states most likely to determine the Electoral College winner.
Wisconsin is a prime example. It is at the top of the list of pivotal battlegrounds in the eyes of most analysts, suggesting that public opinion here shouldn't deviate all that much from what it is nationally. Yet Trump has performed consistently better in Wisconsin than he has in nationwide polls.
The president is averaging in the low 40s in job approval in national surveys.
But in Wisconsin, he is at 46% approval in a Marquette Law School poll released two weeks ago, 47% in a New York Times/Siena poll released Monday, 44% in a Fox News poll released last month, and 42% in a poll just released by the Kaiser Family Foundation and Cook Political Report. Trump's average job approval in those four surveys is 45%, far from stellar but not crippling to his re-election prospects either.
"I think the battleground polls are more meaningful" than the national polls, said Diane Feldman, a longtime Democratic pollster who has conducted many surveys in Wisconsin.
The seeming disconnect between national surveys and battleground surveys was highlighted this week when the New York Times published polls showing Trump either tied, narrowly behind or narrowly ahead of his best-known Democratic rivals in the key states of Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Florida, Arizona and North Carolina.
Takeaway: In the states that matter most, the race is up for grabs.
A day later, a nationwide Washington Post-ABC News poll showed Trump trailing Joe Biden by 17 points, Elizabeth Warren by 15 and Bernie Sanders by 14.
Takeaway: Trump is in dire, dire straits.
"There is a profound disconnect between the state-level polling on the horse race and what we're seeing in the national polling. I don't know whether Joe Biden is up by 17 points nationally or if he's only up a couple of points in Wisconsin, but both can't be true," said political scientist Ken Goldstein, who conducts his own polls in Wisconsin and elsewhere.
Part of the explanation involves different pollsters using different methodologies and capturing different cross-sections of voters with different partisan leanings. Feldman said sometimes national polls oversample the populous coasts, which would skew a survey toward Democrats.
Part of the explanation involves the normal variations in polling that always produce occasional outliers.
But that still leaves the fact that, as the 2016 election showed, the Electoral College picture can deviate from the picture of the nation as a whole. Three years ago, Trump won the decisive battlegrounds of Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania by under 1 point while losing the national vote by 2 points.
If that pattern holds, Democrats might have to win the popular vote by 3 points or more in 2020 to carry the key state battlegrounds they need to win the Electoral College.
Polling since Trump took office reinforces that point.
"In Wisconsin, our (Trump) approval number has been consistently about 3 points higher than his national average," said Charles Franklin, who conducts the Marquette poll. Trump has averaged a little under 46% approval in Wisconsin over the past year in Marquette's polling.
As a result of this gap, anyone focused on the polling in battleground Wisconsin is probably going to get a more competitive picture of the electoral fight than he or she would get from national surveys, where Trump is typically getting approval ratings of 41% to 44% — or, in the case of the Washington-Post-ABC poll, 39%.
"The news this week was unequivocally bad for the White House if you were looking at national polls and unequivocally bad for the Democrats if you were looking at state polls," said Goldstein, a political science professor with the University of San Francisco and before that, the University of Wisconsin-Madison. (The White House also got bad news with the GOP's election setbacks Tuesday, losing legislative control in Virginia and a contest for governor in Kentucky).
"Battleground states are battlegrounds precisely because they're close. We should expect Wisconsin and probably Pennsylvania and North Carolina or Florida and Arizona to be pretty close states," Franklin said.
There have been variations in both the state and national polls. Nationally, an NBC/Wall Street Journal poll shows Trump trailing Biden by 9 points, while Trump's deficit in the Washington Post survey is almost twice as large.
In Wisconsin, a Fox News poll released in early October had Biden leading Trump in Wisconsin by 9 points. The recent Marquette poll had Biden leading by 6. The New York Times/Siena poll had Biden leading by 3.
While the New York Times poll puts Trump's approval here at 47% and Marquette puts it at 46%, the new Kaiser survey puts it at 42%. One thing that could explain these differences is that in the Marquette poll, the mix of Republican and Democratic voters was close to even; in the Kaiser survey, the sample was more Democratic-leaning in its makeup.
But in the case of the state's most frequent poll (by Marquette), Trump's ratings have been remarkably consistent. The president's approval ratings in the last six Marquette polls dating back to October 2018 are: 46, 47, 44, 46, 45 and 46%. Those numbers have deviated even less than you would expect simply from random statistical variation.
Franklin said his numbers are very consistent with the possibility that Trump's true level of approval among all registered voters in Wisconsin hasn't changed at all over the past year.
What do Trump's job ratings in Wisconsin suggest about his prospects of winning the state again?
If you believe that a president's approval rating is highly predictive of the incumbent's share of the vote, that would suggest Trump is at a significant disadvantage in this state right now.
"Every president running for reelection over the last 60 years has received on Election Day a percentage of the popular vote within a point of their job approval number," ABC news analyst Matthew Dowd, a strategist for President George W. Bush who now considers himself an independent, wrote this week.
But some experts believe Trump can and will "overperform" his approval rating, as he over-performed his popularity rating in 2016.
Why? Because so many of his own supporters have such mixed feelings about him personally that it holds down his overall approval rating among people who are happy with key aspects of his performance — such as the economy — and will end up voting for him anyway. Others who dislike Trump may end up disliking the Democratic nominee even more, which happened in 2016.
"He has a vote that goes beyond the voters that approve of him," Feldman said.
Trump's flat approval ratings make it incumbent upon him to drive up the "negatives" of the Democratic nominee, said Ed Goeas, a GOP pollster.
"It's going to be driven by how high the negatives of his opponent are," said Goeas, who doesn't think Trump's approval number is as good a guide to his re-election performance as it has been for past presidents.
"His approval overall is kind of a worst-case scenario for him," he said.
Franklin said the Wisconsin polling suggests "the president's job approval has been consistently net negative, but not enormously so. He has been behind Biden in the (last two Marquette polls) but quite competitive with the other Democrats."
The Marquette pollster said, "it would be wrong to see the state as anything other than close," with Trump still facing an "uphill" battle due to his negative ratings.
"Everyone's obsession with Wisconsin isn't just hype. It's truly competitive," Goldstein said. "Trump is very much in a gray area, where he would be in trouble if this were a pure referendum (on him) but has a chance because it's going to be a choice."
Feldman, the Democratic pollster, said "We are maybe looking at a situation that is more similar to 2016 than (Democrats) would like it to be," meaning a very narrowly decided contest.
If that is true, then after all this time, Wisconsin would be right back where it was in the last election — on a knife's edge.

Texto completo: Joe Biden said in a recent interview he agrees with Jim Mattis that the Obama administration's decision to withdraw troops from Iraq was a mistake, but that as vice president he tried to keep "a residual force" stationed there. This is revisionist nonsense. Just a few months ago, at the July Democratic presidential debate, Biden boasted that "one of the proudest moments of my life was to stand there in Al-Faw Palace and tell everyone that ... all our combat troops are coming home." In September, he declared, "We were right to get the combat troops out." But now he agrees it was a mistake?
The fact is, at the time Biden expressed zero regrets about the complete U.S. withdrawal, which he was in charge of executing. The New York Times reports that in December 2011 Biden was "ebullient" as he presided over the departure ceremony for the last American forces, calling President Barack Obama from Baghdad to tell him "All I've said about this job, I take it back. Thank you for giving me the chance to end this goddamn war."
Of course, he did not actually do that. He unleashed a humanitarian and national security catastrophe. Biden's withdrawal created a vacuum that allowed the Islamic State - which had been reduced to just 700 fighters - to regroup, reconstitute itself and build a murderous caliphate the size of Great Britain. The terrorists enslaved and raped thousands of Yazidi girls and carried out gruesome executions across Iraq and Syria. And they spread their murderous tentacles across the globe, carrying out 143 attacks in 29 countries that killed over 2,000 people and injured many thousands more.
Biden has criticized President Trump for withdrawing from Syria against the advice of our military commanders. Yet Biden did not listen to our military commanders when it came to the Iraq withdrawal. The Times reports that Gen. Lloyd Austin, the U.S. commander in Iraq, proposed keeping as many as 24,000 troops in Iraq. According to Biden national security adviser Colin Kahl, Austin was told by the White House "you've got to be kidding." So Austin presented Obama and Biden with options for 19,000, 16,000 and 10,000 troops - and told them the lowest number was "unwise." But Biden "aggressively pushed for a smaller force," and Obama agreed. Then, during negotiations with the Iraqis, the administration cut the offer in half to just 5,000 - an offer the Iraqis rejected.
In his interview with The Wall Street Journal, Biden blamed George W. Bush for the U.S. withdrawal, noting that he had negotiated a status of forces agreement that required an end to the U.S. military presence by 2011. Please. Does anyone really believe that if Bush were still in office in 2011, he would have pulled out all U.S. forces? Of course not.
The reason Obama and Biden were unable to get an agreement to extend the U.S. troop presence is that they made it crystal clear to the Iraqis that America was headed for the exits. Iraqis watched as Obama and Biden rejected numbers well above 10,000, only grudgingly agreed to even that number and then cut that to 5,000. If you were an Iraqi, would this have given you confidence in America's long-term commitment?
Iran and its political allies inside Iraq were pressing for a U.S. withdrawal, and threatening politicians who supported extending the American military presence. For Iraqi leaders, 24,000 American troops might have been worth the political risk, and maybe even 10,000 would have been worth it. But an offer of just 5,000 troops from an administration that was determined to go to zero as quickly as possible was not. If America was leaving, and Iran was staying, why risk siding with the Americans?
In 2013, as the Islamic State was gaining steam, Biden said that he and Obama felt "happy and ... fulfilled" with the decision to withdraw from Iraq. A year later, they would be forced to send U.S. forces back to Iraq to deal with the debacle they had unleashed.
Biden supported the Iraq invasion but then opposed the Bush surge, which crushed the Islamic State and won the war. Then he supported a premature withdrawal that allowed the terrorists to regroup and was celebrating that decision as recently as four months ago -- but now says he regrets it. That's quite a record for a man running on his record of experience and judgment.

Our View: Consolidating elections worked as intended

Texto completo: A 17 percent voter turnout for an election might seem like little to brag about -- but, as always, context is essential when evaluating the results of Santa Fe's first consolidated municipal election this week.
That 17 percent is a vast improvement in voter participation for school board and community college board races, and it's slightly above turnout in non-mayoral municipal elections. While 38 percent of registered voters took part in the 2018 municipal elections, when the job of mayor was on the ballot along with council seats, only about 15 percent of voters showed up in 2016 for council races and a municipal judge contest. Similarly, 10 percent of school board voters participated in 2017, and just 5.2 percent in 2015.
That's why we are calling the move to consolidate local elections -- everything from city races to school governing boards to seats on the water and soil districts -- on the second Tuesday of every November in odd-numbered years a success. Engaging more voters to show up is essential to keeping our government functioning. The consolidated elections did that.
What would increase participation and interest is for elections to feature greater competition. In Albuquerque, where council races were contested and a number of ballot questions were being considered, voter turnout hit 23 percent of those registered -- competition raises interest and draws people to the polls. As a point of comparison, the New York Times reports that only 27 percent of voters participate in the average municipal election; lagging civic engagement is a nationwide problem.
In Santa Fe, City Council candidates in Districts 1 and 3 ran unopposed. Both Renee Villarreal, District 1, and Chris Rivera, District 3, do a fine job representing constituents and Santa Fe, but opposition improves even the best public servants. Municipal Judge Virginia Vigil also was unopposed. This needs to change, both to increase the quality of public debate and to give voters reasons to get to the polls on Election Day.
Only residents of Districts 2 and 4 had a choice for city councilor; to all those who stepped up to run, citizens owe you thanks.
The two winning candidates, Michael J. Garcia, District 2, and Jamie Cassutt-Sanchez, District 4, represent a younger generation of leadership. Both Garcia and Cassutt-Sanchez are graduates of Santa Fe's public schools who went on to obtain advanced degrees. Both have lived away from Santa Fe
for portions of their adult lives, and both returned to their hometown as adults, ready to make a difference. Both have young children, too, which could translate into fewer meetings that linger into the wee hours of the morning -- adults can be late to work on occasion, but kids can't be tardy to school, so parents have every reason to end discussions at more reasonable hours.
The Santa Fe Public Schools Board of Education also will have another parent of younger children on board. Nurse and mom Sarah Boses won the District 2 seat, replacing outgoing member Maureen Cashmon. Educator Carmen Gonzales won District 1, beating two-term incumbent Steven Carrillo. Unfortunately, Rudy Garcia faced no opposition in District 4, so he was reelected despite a spotty record of missing board meetings. The children and families of his district cannot afford an absentee board member, and neither can the rest of Santa Fe.
But competition won't happen without a better pipeline for grooming future candidates. Yes, voters have a responsibility to participate in elections. They should show up and be counted. At the same time, voters want to have reasons to cast their ballots -- and important reasons include offering smart discussions among a range of candidates.
The decision to consolidate all municipal elections has increased participation -- every second Tuesday in November, there will be an election, whether local, state or national. Now, before another consolidated local election rolls around, let's recruit more candidates and give voters a reason to show up and be counted.

OK, boomer

Texto completo: OK, here's what you need to know about the meme that began with Generation Z, made its way to millennial discourse, and will inevitably be killed by boomers themselves.
The phrase "OK, boomer" has become a universal response from younger generations to baby boomers who complain about the kids these days. High schoolers are too obsessed with climate change? OK, boomer. Millennials are ruining dating, golf, or yet another boomer-beloved tradition? OK, boomer.
Last week, the New York Times ran a feature on the rise of "OK, boomer." Though its use seems confined mostly to TikTok, Twitter, and other forms of social media, "OK, boomer" marks a tongue-in-cheek weapon of the generational wars as they manifest themselves online.
That doesn't mean, however, that the viral trend doesn't have real-world results.
Nineteen-year-old Shannon O'Connor has received more than $10,000 in orders for her shirt that reads, "OK BOOMER: Have A Terrible Day."
One person tweeted, perhaps jokingly, "my parents sent me and my siblings a formal email asking us not to say 'OK Boomer' to anyone at thanksgiving."
Someone hoping to trademark the phrase applied with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office last week.
There are several songs with the name "OK, boomer" on Spotify. One of the iterations begins, "This one goes out to the 65-plus crowd on SoundCloud." (For all of you boomers, SoundCloud is a music platform that many young artists use to release their music.)
This week, a 25-year-old New Zealand lawmaker who was heckled during a speech on climate change responded simply, "OK, boomer," and carried on. It's only a matter of time before Matt Gaetz or Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez says this in a congressional hearing.

Texto completo: Democratic loyalists aren't going to like billionaire and former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg entering the race for the party's presidential nomination. But, whether they acknowledge it or not, they need him right now.
The New York Times on Thursday reported that he's preparing a run:
Should Mr. Bloomberg proceed with a campaign, it could represent a seismic disruption in the Democratic race. With his immense personal wealth, centrist views and close ties to the political establishment, he would present a grave and instantaneous threat to former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., who has been struggling to raise money and assemble a ideologically moderate coalition.
Biden will be mad, but so what?
They need Bloomberg the way Republicans needed Donald Trump.
Democrats got a brief reprieve from their status as a directionless party thanks to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi pursuing impeachment, but the fact remains that they have no real enthusiasm for any one candidate on their side.
Bloomberg isn't going to bring the wattage to a debate stage, but he'll do what Trump did. He'll say what needs to be said, and if no one likes it, he won't give a damn.
Back during the President Barack Obama years, Bloomberg was the conservative idea of government excess. He wanted legislation that limited salt intake, and he wanted to ban oversized sodas from 7-Elevens.
Whatever. Sprinkle more salt on your food and lift your big bottom up to go refill your soda cup. Those issues were so small.
What matters is that Bloomberg is a wildly successful businessman who, by every indication, has sincere beliefs about the direction the country should move. He wants less crime, so he stands by the successful stop-and-frisk policy. He wants a healthier population, so he stands by his positions on the salt and soda stuff. He wants strict standards in the education system, so he stands by performance-based raises for teachers and cellphone bans for public school students.
These aren't the views of a far-left liberal who wants the government to control every part of your life. They're the views of someone who, like Trump, believes that there are some public policy solutions to some problems.
A Bloomberg run is good news for Democrats, whether they like it or not.

Texto completo: El jueves se despedirá con una lluvia fría en Nueva York, pero el temor de una nevada ya está descartado en la ciudad.
Desde temprano esta tarde el cielo se encuentra nublado. Desde las 6 p.m. se esperan lluvias dispersas y temperaturas cercanas a los 55 grados F (13C). También ráfagas de entre 12 y 16 mph , según AccuWeather.
Las tormentas nocturnas darán paso a la luz del sol el viernes, pero las temperaturas caerán hasta 34 grados F (1C).
El pronóstico de clima frío continúa durante el fin de semana con máximas de alrededor de 40 grados F (4C) el sábado, informó News 12.
El año pasado, la primera nevada llegó por sorpresa a NYC el 15 de noviembre, desatando un caos en el transporte y fuertes críticas a las autoridades por la falta de previsión.
Las 6.4 pulgadas de nieve que cayeron ayer esa noche en Central Park constituyeron la mayor nevada en noviembre en al menos 136 años, reportó The New York Times.

Texto completo: Fox News anchor Sean Hannity echoed the president's criticism of his network's own polling after it released unfriendly numbers about President Trump.
Hannity claimed that the network's polling was skewed because they were "oversampling" Democrats on his radio show Monday.
"Anyway, New York Times/Sienna College poll shows Trump in a dead heat in battleground states, matched up against the three leading Democratic candidates: Biden, Sanders, and Warren," he stated.
"And I always say, and I believe — Trump doesn't poll well, and I don't know what's up with the Fox poll. I look at their poll, I'm like, 'Okay, you're sampling — oversampling Democrats by eight points.' I'm like — some outside company they hire — I'm like, 'Okay, they need new methodology because it's really wrong,'" Hannity continued.Sean Hannity attacks Fox News polling: “I don't know what's up with the Fox poll ... they need new methodology”The most recent Fox News poll, which was released on Sunday, shows Trump trailing in a hypothetical general election against former Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Bernie Sanders, and Sen. Elizabeth Warren. He tied with South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg and was within the margin of error against his 2016 campaign opponent, Hillary Clinton.
Biden had the biggest head-to-head lead against the president, with 51% saying they'd vote for him and only 39% responding that they would vote in favor of a second term for the president.
Fox polling also found that nearly half of American voters support impeaching and removing Trump from office.
Hannity's criticism of the Fox News polls comes after Trump has done the same thing on multiple occasions.
"You're reading the wrong polls," Trump told reporters last weekend. "I have the real polls. The CNN polls are fake. The Fox polls have always been lousy. I tell them they ought to get themselves a new pollster."
The president continued, "But the real polls — if you look at the polls that came out this morning — people don’t want anything to do with impeachment. It’s a phony scam. It’s a hoax.”TweetLast month the president tweeted, “From the day I announced I was running for President, I have NEVER had a good @FoxNews Poll. Whoever their Pollster is, they suck. But @FoxNews is also much different than it used to be in the good old days."

Tillie's in Short Hills closes; chef moves to Sojo in Edgewater

Texto completo: Tillie's, a five-year-old seasonal American restaurant, has closed.
Chef and owner Wirt Cook, who ran the 45-seat restaurant with his wife, Karen, is now the executive chef of Sojo Spa Club in Edgewater. Karen is hoping to start a career as a nurse.
"We were in lease renegotiation and Karen was about to finish school and be a nurse," Wirt said. "So when someone came along and offered me a job that frankly provides more security and money, we thought for the family it was best to close the restaurant."
Wirt noted that when the pair opened Tillie's on Millburn Avenue five years ago, they were childless. Today they have four kids — and running the restaurant single-handed was becoming more difficult. "We didn't even have a dishwasher," he said. "It was just Karen and I doing everything."
In a Facebook post announcing the Oct. 26 closing, the two said: "We signed this lease as a family of two, and Tillie's has witnessed the birth of our four beautiful daughters, a move to a new house, countless celebrations, and a few tears as well. Our girls ate their birthday cakes here, we cooked Thanksgiving turkeys in this kitchen, and shared plenty of great conversations over excellent food and drink. Tillie's was to us, exactly what we set out to make it, a place to gather with friends and family, share honest words, laughter and delicious and approachable food. We hope it was some, or all of that to you too."
As the food editor, in August I reviewed the restaurant for this newspaper and Millburn Magazine and found it to be very good: "This small, 45-seat restaurant is serving some of the best seasonal food I've had in North Jersey in a while — and one of the best key lime pies I've had this side of Florida," I wrote then. The New York Times in a 2016 review rated Tillie's "Very Good," just a notch below its highest grade of "Excellent."
Wirt has already begun his job at SoJo Spa, housed in an 8-story-tall complex with 140,000-square feet of pools, specialty baths, saunas, treatment rooms, lounging and dining areas overlooking the Hudson River. It runs in conjunction with Sojo Hotel. Its food hall is not open to the public, however.
"The restaurant is not what it should be right now," Wirt said. "It's split between Asian, Korean and American food. I'm here to get it into shape, make it more efficient and improve on some things. I want to make the food more interesting without making it too fancy."
Wirt said he doesn't know what will happen to his shuttered restaurant's space. "It is set up and ready to go as a restaurant," he said. A restaurateur could open another restaurant right away and "capitalize what should be their holiday business," he said.
But he noted that Tillie's was not located in downtown Millburn, and that there are too many empty storefronts in the area. "A Charlie Brown's closed almost two years ago and it is still empty," he said.
He also noted that it's profoundly difficult to operate a restaurant without a liquor license, which due to the state's antiquated liquor license laws are tough to acquire.
"Maybe some day we will revisit the idea of a restaurant in town," he said. "But until New Jersey changes its liquor license laws, it's nearly impossible to make it as a [BYOB] restaurant."

Texto completo: A documentary about the Apollo Theater airs on HBO. And AMC offers a pair of Martin Scorsese gangster movies.
What's on TV
THE APOLLO (2019) 9 p.m. on HBO. "When you walk out of the wings and you take the mic," the Harlem figure Lana Turner says in this documentary, "you have stood on top of the music scores, the gag lines, the costumes, the singers. You've stood on top of all of them. And their spirit -- and their souls -- are in that floor." She's talking about the Apollo Theater in Harlem, the venerated launching pad of several generations of musicians, comics and other performers. Directed by Roger Ross Williams, "The Apollo" digs into the theater's rich, 85-year history through a trove of archival performance footage (Billie Holiday, Ray Charles, Aretha Franklin and James Brown are among those featured) and recent interviews, which it intersperses with scenes of the preparation and performance of a stage version of Ta-Nehisi Coates's "Between the World and Me" that debuted last year. The results are "conventional but entertaining," Ben Kenigsberg wrote in his review for The New York Times. "While 'The Apollo' itself might have taken a more inventive approach," he added, "it derives its power from the artistry it captures."
THE DEPARTED (2006) 11:05 p.m. on AMC. Martin Scorsese's latest gangster movie, "The Irishman," is now in theaters and will soon be available through your internet browser. Television audiences can revisit two of the director's other mob movies: "The Departed," a story of made men and moles in Boston with Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon, Jack Nicholson and Mark Wahlberg, and the decades-spanning New York crime story GOODFELLAS (1990). That second movie, with Ray Liotta, Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci, will air at 8 p.m. on AMC. Those who watch the two films back to back will hear Boston and New York accents united by a familiar British one: Each movie's soundtrack prominently uses the Rolling Stones' "Gimme Shelter."
What's Streaming
TOM CLANCY'S JACK RYAN Stream on Amazon. While both "The Departed" and "Goodfellas" pair the Rolling Stones with organized crime, this action series mixes Mick Jagger and military operatives. In an episode of the new season, The Stones' "Can't You Hear Me Knocking" can be heard playing as a group of American fighters prepare to hurl themselves from an Air Force plane. The season brings the action to Venezuela, London and other locales where John Krasinski, as the series's titular agent, plays hero.
THE ELEPHANT QUEEN (2019) Stream on Apple TV Plus. Chiwetel Ejiofor narrates this kid-friendly nature documentary from Mark Deeble and Victoria Stone. The film follows a herd of elephants wandering the Kenyan savanna over a period of several years. "Deeble's script spotlights a few daily dramas to raise a bit of tension and humor, and his cinematography is magnificent," Ken Jaworowski wrote in his review for The Times. Though Jaworowski also noted that the documentary "sometimes shies away from tough truths," like the effects that climate change and poaching are having on the animals. "Young viewers," he wrote, "could certainly handle a few more harsh facts."

Texto completo: New York Times couldn’t explain how the most woke political party in history could have allowed this to happen: “Democrats Have the Most Racially Diverse Field Ever, [but] The Top Tier Is All White,” the headline announced last week.
If the top tier comprises three, then you have three whites in their seventies, two of them socialists and one female. If the top tier comprises four candidates, then it includes a third white male — Pete Buttigieg — although his gayness must afford him some victim cred. He feels forced to declare that if he were elected, his administration would have equal proportions of women and men. If he meant what he said, though, he would quit the race now, reducing the numerical dominance of whites and of males over others. Moreover, he would send his backers and money to women and blacks.
He would probably have to send twice as much to Kamala Harris, the only non-white female in the race. She now blames her gender and race for causing her slide in the polls. (Who knew Democratic primary voters were such rank bigots?) But Harris is as non-white and female right now as she was months before, when she first rose in the polls.
And as low as she has slipped, she continues to lead several undoubtedly privileged white male contenders and whose names no one remembers or knows — say, Michael Bennet and Joe Sestak.
Since the Times sees all the world through the lens of race and/or gender, it has to find something to blame for all these misfortunes. Joe Biden, who has been at the top of the polls since the day he announced, seems like a good target. He is male, white (even his hair is white), and one of the oldest. But he’s also sustained by the mass of black voters, whose support for him over all of the others — including the non-white contenders running against him — is formidable.
Are Democrats willing to say that black voters are the ones keeping them from more inclusion? Certainly not, although some may believe it. By the way, Biden was also Barack Obama’s vice president. Also, their black voters are often church-goers and social conservatives, so they’re not likely to back an abortion fanatic, which may turn them from Harris, or Mayor Pete.
Are Democrats likely to say that their most faithful supporters are so hopelessly misled as to oppose “women’s freedom,” which is how they define it now? They surely may think it, but they can’t say it out loud.
True diversity — which comes together when individuals seek careers of their choice and then rise within them, irrespective of race, creed, gender, or circumstances of birth — is a wonderful thing to have happen. And it did happen when two children of Indian immigrants went to the state houses in two of the reddest and most Republican states in the Union.
One of these states, just briefly, had the most diverse leadership in the country, with Nikki Haley as governor and Tim Scott as senator — Sen. Lindsey Graham must have felt lonely as a white male.
This form of inclusion — spontaneous and real — is more erratic and scattershot than the Democrats’ method of selection by quota. Yes, the metrics of “inclusion” may seem much more steady when it’s all planned in advance. But then, one’s rise through such selection may not correspond to one’s having the talent to succeed.

Maureen Dowd: Katie Hill finds that shiny new tools don’t change human nature

Texto completo: Washington • “OK Boomer.”
I hear that dryly dismissive phrase leveled at me quite a bit lately from Shawn McCreesh, the 27-year-old in my office.
It’s gotten so bad that I’ve stopped bothering to ask him to decode the mysteries of millennial behavior and taste, much less to decipher what makes the younger TikTok generation tick.
The Times Style section calls the phrase a declaration of intergenerational war.
“‘OK Boomer’ has become Generation Z’s endlessly repeated retort to the problem of older people who just don’t get it, a rallying cry for millions of fed up kids,” Taylor Lorenz wrote. It’s quickly been adopted by millennials as well.
Shawn OK-Boomered me Friday on the topic of Katie Hill, the 32-year-old freshman California congresswoman who is openly bisexual and ran what Vice dubbed “the most millennial campaign ever.” Her promising career flamed out in a scandal that was both age-old and very millennial, in that it featured revenge porn, a throuple, sexual fluidity and dirty bong water.
Hill was a blast of fresh air on the Hill. And it is amazing that, after two centuries of men treating the political landscape here as a droit du seigneur playground, that the one ensnared in an ethics investigation about the new rules enacted last year on sexual harassment — barring lawmakers from having sexual relationships with staffers — is a woman.
Hill pointed the finger at her “abusive” loser husband, Kenny Heslep, who has been unemployed for the past five years, implying that he leaked the pictures and texts to Hill’s foes. Not since Linda Tripp has there been such a creepy betrayal in politics.
It turned out that one of the people responsible for publishing Hill’s photos and texts is a Republican operative who worked for her opponents.
As The L.A. Times reported, Heslep wrote in divorce papers that Hill came home from Washington and said she was leaving. “She took our only operable vehicle and left me stranded at our residence,” he wrote, adding that his parents had to lend him money to hire a divorce lawyer.
In her fiery exit speech, Hill gave her side: “The forces of revenge by a bitter jealous man, cyber exploitation and sexual shaming that target our gender and a large segment of society that fears and hates powerful women have combined to push a young woman out of power and say that she doesn’t belong here.”
She continued, “Yet a man who brags about his sexual predation, who has had dozens of women come forward to accuse him of sexual assault, who pushes policies that are uniquely harmful to women and who has filled the courts with judges who proudly rule to deprive women of the most fundamental right to control their own bodies, sits in the highest office in the land.”
Hill’s parting vote Thursday was to endorse the impeachment inquiry.
Shawn and I both felt sad watching her implode. But, while I agree with Hill that there are double standards and that we still dwell in a misogynistic culture, I also think she should have realized that we’re operating under new rules now and that they apply to both sexes.
I reiterated to Shawn my bewilderment that every millennial moment — even the most private — can be enjoyed only if it’s documented and uploaded God knows where.
While he agreed that it was reckless for Hill to be in those sort of pictures once she had entered the political arena, he said that I was missing the forest for the trees: Youngs who can’t even imagine that they will one day run for office may already have racy shots somewhere out there.
He pointed to a viral text going around this past month as evidence that most young people have at least one picture on their phones that they don’t want to get out. The first line of the text refers to Instagram and pops up on the recipient’s phone with the most horrifying words known to the millennial mind: “Why is there a nude on your story??” Once the text is opened, it turns out to be a prank. Nonetheless, Shawn said, it caused a lot of spilled coffees and near car crashes among his friends.
He said that iPhones and social media have so reshaped culture that older people would have to accept the new and sometimes naked reality. He had to agree with Rep. Matt Gaetz, the 37-year-old Florida Republican and Trump lap dog, who told Fox News: “This is an issue where a lot of millennials, I think, sympathize with Katie Hill because a lot of young people who grew up with a smartphone in their hands took pictures, sent them, shared messages and materials that are now recoverable later in life.”
I get that young people are digital natives, even cyborgs. But I had to offer a riposte to Shawn that, while society can be reshaped, human nature is immutable. What I learned from studying Shakespeare is that the primary colors of emotions carry through the centuries.
There will always be vengeful exes and envious allies and ruthless opponents and double-crossing friends. Whether the messages are being carried by pigeons or pixels, you have to protect yourself — and your data. Don’t let our shiny new tools blind you to the fact that some horrible truths about humanity never change.
And don’t leave yourself vulnerable by giving people the ammunition — or the nudes — to strip you of your dreams.
OK, millennials?

Texto completo: Former Vice President Joe Biden will hold a private fundraiser Tuesday evening in Pittsburgh with real estate executives, deep-pocketed Democratic donors and the youngest son of late Steelers Chairman Dan Rooney.
Though Mr. Biden's presidential campaign has not publicized details of the private reception, a copy of the invitation obtained by the Post-Gazette revealed the names of the event's co-chairs and co-hosts, who pledged to raise $25,000 and $15,000 for the campaign, respectively.
Listed as a co-host is Jim Rooney, author of a book about his father, who chaired the Steelers and served as the U.S. ambassador to Ireland during the Obama-Biden administration. In March, Mr. Biden spoke at a Duquesne University event honoring the life of Dan Rooney, a lifelong Republican who crossed party lines to support Barack Obama for president in 2008.
Co-chairs of the fundraiser, at the highest tier of fundraising, are real estate developers Jack Piatt and Pascal "Pat" Nardelli. Mr. Piatt, founder and chairman of Millcraft Investments, has a long history of donating to Democrats but also gave to Republican presidential candidate John Kasich in 2016.
Mr. Nardelli, president of Pittsburgh-based Castlebrook Development, also gave to Mr. Kasich in 2016 but has spent the past two years giving several times to Pennsylvania Democrats Conor Lamb, Mike Doyle and Bob Casey. His only donation this presidential campaign has been to Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan, a Democrat who dropped out of the race in October.
The list of co-hosts also includes Dusty Kirk, a partner at Reed Smith LLP law firm; Ray Linsenmayer, a Democratic activist, author and former candidate for Congress; Doug Campbell, a founding member of the Campbell&Levine law firm; Cliff Levine, director at Cohen&Grigsby law firm; Tom VanKirk, executive vice president of Highmark Health; and Gail Klingensmith, co-owner of Pamela's P&G Diner.
Several have made donations to the Biden campaign already, including $2,800 from Mr. Campbell, $2,500 from Ms. Kirk and $2,800 from Ms. Klingensmith.
Mr. Linsenmayer hasn't donated to Democratic causes besides his own congressional campaign in 2018, when he pursued a failed bid for the 17th Congressional District against Mr. Lamb.
Mr. Linsenmayer has organized volunteers in Western Pennsylvania to help turn out Democrats over the past few elections.
"Every single one of the top five candidates can win Allegheny County," Mr. Linsenmayer wrote on Facebook. "However, many of you know how much time I spend with data and I feel certain that to take back the White House, we need a candidate who can capture the votes of those who went from Trump in 2016 to Bob Casey in 2018."
A new New York Times/Siena College poll showed Mr. Biden with a 3-point lead over Donald Trump in a potential general election matchup.
The former vice president's fundraising has lagged behind other Democratic front-runners, though the campaign indicated a surge of online donations in October amid Mr. Trump's string of attacks over the Ukrainian dealings of Mr. Biden's son.
In third-quarter fundraising, Mr. Biden reported raising $15 million, millions less than Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren.
Mr. Biden's Pittsburgh fundraiser coincides with Pennsylvania's municipal elections. This will be his first visit to Western Pennsylvania since April, when he opened his campaign with a speech in Lawrenceville.
The Biden campaign confirmed he will be in town Tuesday for a "finance event" but provided no further details, including where the event will be held.

IRAQ'S DELIVERANCE THE COUNTRY IS PLAGUED BY FECKLESS LEADERSHIP

Texto completo: By rights, the death of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi should have been met with celebrations in the land of his birth. After all, Iraq has endured more suffering than any other nation - and bears more scars - from the depredations of the Islamic State. Prime Minister Adil Abdul-Mahdi should have been the one to share with his countrymen the news from Barisha, Syria, that the monster of their worst nightmares is no more.
Instead, at al-Baghdadi's death, Mr. Abdul-Mahdi was hunkered down in his palace while his countrymen called, in ever larger numbers, for his ouster. The city from which IS' leader took his nom du guerre was convulsed in yet another night of violence, as security forces and Iran-backed militias cracked down on Iraqis protesting against corruption and misrule.
When Baghdad should have been celebrating the ignominious end of the false caliph, authorities were announcing a curfew.
Al-Baghdadi would have derived some comfort in the last few days among the living from the turmoil engulfing his homeland. After the calm that briefly followed the extirpation of IS at the end of 2017, Iraq was once again experiencing conditions most propitious for the terrorist organization's regeneration under his successor.
In many ways, the country is in even greater chaos than in the spring and summer of 2014, when IS stormed the western and northern provinces, taking city after city while the Iraqi state crumbled. Then, Iraq was a deeply corrupt state with an inept military, its society riven with sectarian hatreds. The Islamic State was able to capitalize on the resentment of the minority Sunni sect.
But majority Shiites were, for the most part, united behind the government in Baghdad. Their support allowed Mr. Abdul-Mahdi's predecessor, Haider al-Abadi, to fight back against IS, with the help of the U.S. military and militias trained, armed and commanded by Iran.
Now, the Shiites are leading the protests against the government - and against the security forces and militias they once acclaimed as heroes. The Sunnis, meanwhile, have new resentments: Their cities were destroyed in the war against IS, and Mr. Abdul-Mahdi's government has been slow to release funds for reconstruction. They are anxious, too, about the growing influence of the Shiite militias and of Iran.
The quality of the Iraqi military is significantly better than it was in 2014, but Mr. Abdul-Mahdi's decision to sack the general who led the fight against IS indicates that all is not well among the men in uniform. The integration of Shiite militias into the military has not gone as smoothly as Baghdad - and Tehran - had hoped.
It doesn't help that the American military footprint in Iraq depends on the whims and political calculations of the White House's mercurial occupant. The churlish reception accorded to U.S. troops withdrawing from Syria into Iraqi Kurdistan augurs poorly.
On top of all this, the Iraqi government is even more corrupt than it had been five years ago - not least because there is more scope for graft, thanks to growing oil exports. By Transparency International's reckoning, between 2015 and 2018 Iraq has slipped seven places on the list of the world's most corrupt countries, to 168th (out of 180).
Can IS take advantage of Iraq's chaos? It is no longer the irresistible force it had seemed when al-Baghdadi announced his caliphate. At their peak, his fighters represented the most successful military force in modern Arabian history. Now, the group has no Syrian stronghold from which to mount an assault on Iraq, and thousands of fighters are in prison camps.
But even before al-Baghdadi's death, IS had been rebuilding its networks in northern Iraq. The group had also switched to the suicide bombings and hit-and-run attacks of its early days. The draw-down of U.S. troops from Syria and the distraction of the Syrian Defense Forces will likely reopen spaces for IS fighters to regroup.
The loss of their leader will undoubtedly slow the resurgence, but developments in Iraq will give the terrorists something to cling to as they mourn him. Rather than Mr. Abdul-Mahdi celebrating the tidings from Barisha with his countrymen, it may be al-Baghdadi's successor who rallies his supporters with the news from Baghdad.

PSO's Eckart Preu offers understated take on classical standards

Texto completo: The strong impression that Eckart Preu made as a candidate for the Portland Symphony Orchestra's music directorship, and since his appointment was announced, has been based partly on his unusual repertory choices and his success in drawing vivid performances of these less familiar works.
You could argue, and some do, that new works and rarities are the way to go - that the standard canon, great as it is, overshadows equally worthy scores that go unheard when orchestras keep revisiting the (mostly) 18th and 19th century works that past generations have identified as the towering artistic statements of Western Civilization.
The fact is, as fashionable and useful as the thirst for adventurous programming may be, music directors cannot devote all their stage time to navigating less-traveled terrain. For their own development as interpreters, and as a way to test, build and shape their interactions with the players, the job involves regular forays into repertory for which there are established standards and traditions - and, not incidentally, that listeners know and love.
Preu's mission at Merrill Auditorium on Sunday afternoon was to dive into the heart of that repertory. He presented two big, 19th century Viennese works - Beethoven's Violin Concerto, with Stefan Jackiw as the soloist, and Schubert's Symphony No. 9.
It's not as though works as familiar as the Beethoven and Schubert are impervious to novelty. The reason they have survived this long (the Beethoven was composed in 1806, the Schubert in 1826) is that conductors regularly find something fresh in them - unusual tempo relationships, for example, or buried lines of counterpoint that turn out to be illuminating when given a higher profile. At the very least, a performance should persuade us that there are reasons these works have been so beloved for so long.
I can't say that Preu's performances offered new perspectives about these pieces, but they were unusual in one regard. Typically, both are played as monuments to 19th century grandeur, with their big gestures made especially brawny, and their gentler sections contrasting starkly. Yet Preu offered unusually relaxed readings, as if he were stripping the works of interpretive overstatement, and showing that even in the absence of larger-than-life drama, there is plenty to love in these scores.
That is not to say that there was no drama at all, only that it was on a more human scale. This was especially surprising in the Beethoven, a concerto that pits a virtuoso soloist against the orchestra, with lots of emotionally charged interplay between the soloist and the ensemble.
Jackiw is a powerful player with a superb command of color and ample energy, and based partly on my most recent encounter with his playing - an all-Ives recital with pianist Jeremy Denk, at Bowdoin College in 2015 - I expected a more daredevil approach. But Jackiw and Preu were entirely on the same page. Perhaps taking their cue from the gentleness and reserve of the work's opening, both maintained its laid-back approach, even when the music offered an opportunity to ratchet up the tension.
For Jackiw, this meant focusing on the beauty and inventiveness of the solo line, while avoiding flashiness for its own sake. Instead, he kept Beethoven's supple, sometimes bittersweet themes singing with a rich tone and a lovely sense of shape that complemented Preu's approach to the orchestral writing.
Having taken that approach to the long first movement, it was not surprising that the central Larghetto was similarly restrained, again keeping the focus on the sheer beauty of the solo writing, and the nuance that Jackiw brought to it. It was not until the Larghetto gave way to the brisk finale that Preu and company abandoned the relatively genteel approach they had been taking, in favor of a robust, tightly focused performance.
As an encore, Jackiw gave a lovely, concentrated performance of the Largo from Bach's Sonata in C (BWV 1005) for unaccompanied violin.
The Schubert followed similar contours - graceful, shapely readings of the first three movements, leading to a bright, fast, invitingly detailed performance of the finale. As in the Beethoven, the sheer ingenuity of Schubert's themes held the spotlight, and there was some superb playing: The opening horn figure was perfect, as were contributions from individual winds, and you could not have expected greater warmth from the strings.
Before the Schubert, Preu took a moment to acknowledge four musicians who have played with the orchestra for more than 50 years - violists Ann Stepp and Elizabeth Miller, and bassists Lynn Hannings and George Rubino - as well as one audience member, Paul Vermel, who was the PSO's music director from 1967 to 1975 and, at age 96, still attends the performances.

Texto completo: American leaders have effectively thrown Huawei and a handful of Chinese technology surveillance companies out of the country, warning darkly of the national security and privacy threats of installing Made-in-China products into sensitive parts of the nation's electronic infrastructure.
Now they have cast their fearful gaze on a new Chinese target: the dancing and singing teens and tweens of TikTok.
A secretive federal panel with a national security focus is reviewing the purchase of TikTok two years ago by a Chinese company called Bytedance, The New York Times and others reported last week. Three senators have asked the Trump administration to review potential national security and privacy threats posed by the app, warning that Bytedance could strip out content that displeases the Communist Party, such as videos of pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong.
TikTok denies that it censors political content. Videos supporting the protesters and declaring "Reclaim Hong Kong!" can be found on the app.
Still, TikTok's popularity -- if you're the parent of a teenager, that teenager probably has it on her phone -- blazes uncharted territory. Its unexpected rise is forcing Americans for the first time to consider living in a world influenced by a Chinese-backed social media network.
That invites the public to take a closer look at Bytedance. It is not an arm of the Communist Party. However, it owes much of its success to its ability to navigate Beijing's political currents, as well as its skills in delivering harmless fluff that could pass muster with censors.
In fact, its founder, Zhang Yiming, has echoed the comments of Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg that he runs a technology company, not a media company. And yet that hasn't stopped Facebook from influencing events around the world, with profound and troubling consequences.
No other Chinese tech company has succeeded on the global internet like Bytedance. The country's vibrant social media platforms and viral video apps have had little success elsewhere beyond the Chinese diaspora. In a time when some in Washington are trying to pry apart the close economic ties between the United States in China, the two countries already live in different worlds when it comes to cyberspace.
TikTok, however, is ascending on the global internet scene just as the technological Iron Curtain is drawing. It has had nearly 1.5 billion downloads globally and 122 million in the United States, according to the data firm Sensor Tower.
That alarms some in Washington. In a letter to American intelligence officials, Senators Chuck Schumer and Tom Cotton said the TikTok platform was "a potential target of foreign influence campaigns like those carried out during the 2016 election on U.S.-based social media platforms."
They and others point to recent articles claiming or suggesting that TikTok strips out videos of Hong Kong's protests.
TikTok disputes the allegations, saying that it stores its American user data locally and doesn't "remove content based on sensitivities related to China."
"We have never been asked by the Chinese government to remove any content, and we would not do so if asked," it said. "Period."
That statement doesn't cover the breadth of the pressure Beijing puts on media companies in China. Rather than outright censoring content, Chinese officials often set broad guidelines for media companies and then let them censor themselves.
TikTok at times has avoided uncomfortable topics entirely. A look at the guidelines on the app when downloaded in Hong Kong shows that they forbid politics-related content and comments.
TikTok updated the guidelines after it was asked about them by The Times, saying that they were supposed to be taken down in May and resurfaced by error. Its Hong Kong content moderation team is partly based in mainland China but is moving to Hong Kong, and it will follow the same rules that the company sets everywhere else, TikTok said.
All that said, TikTok's critics have yet to offer evidence that Beijing is using TikTok to spread propaganda to young minds, or that it is misusing user data. That may not help its fortunes in the United States: The American government has never offered proof that Huawei's equipment is a security threat, yet its equipment has been essentially banned from telecommunications networks anyway.
Mr. Zuckerberg, whose company is busily trying to emulate TikTok, argues that the Chinese-owned app represents a competition of values.
"Until recently, the internet in almost every country outside China has been defined by American platforms with strong free expression values. There's no guarantee these values will win out," he said in a recent speech at Georgetown University, where he specifically cited TikTok.
Of course, his company once tried to develop software that would allow potential Chinese partners to block content they didn't like. But the comments strike at a broader truth: To do business on the Chinese internet, any company there has to abide by the government's wishes, whether it wants to or not.
Bytedance is no different. It was founded in 2012 by Mr. Zhang when he was 29. A geeky programmer, Mr. Zhang says the day in second grade when he received a Tetris hand-held game device was one of the happiest of his life. In college, he was known for his skills in repairing personal computers.
Some people in China compare him to Mr. Zuckerberg. Like the Facebook boss, Mr. Zhang had said machines do a better job than people at distributing content. When Bytedance introduced Toutiao, a news aggregation app that became hugely popular in China, it was run by software instead of an editor in chief. Mostly, it delivered headlines to users based on what they had clicked before.
"I can't accurately decide whether something is good or bad, highbrow or lowbrow," Mr. Zhang told a Chinese business magazine in 2016. "I may have my judgment, but I don't want to impose it on Toutiao."
For many users, that system delivered a steady stream of pablum, depending on what they had clicked before: bikini photos, silly videos, pet memes. Soon a backlash developed.
"Zhang Yiming and his engineers train the machine to understand your heart," a blogger, He Jiayan, wrote. "At the same time they're training you so you'll be addicted to the machine."
The TikTok spokesman said the app and other Bytedance apps had a time management feature that allowed users and parents to set limits of 40, 60 or 120 minutes.
The algorithm-driven approach has worked well for Bytedance. By the end of 2016, Toutiao became China's No. 2 app after the messaging app WeChat, based on the time users spent on it per day, according to QuestMobile, a Chinese data firm. Last year, it raised a new round of funding from investors including SoftBank that valued it at $ 75 billion, making it one of the most valuable start-ups in the world.
Toutiao also attracted the attention of Lu Wei, China's heavy-handed internet czar at the time, according to industry executives. When other internet companies complained that Toutiao was stealing their content, one of Mr. Lu's top lieutenants told them that he was a fan and that they should stop complaining and work with the company, said two of them. They asked for anonymity because discussing the work of China's censors in public is tantamount to corporate suicide.
Bytedance denies that it had a close relationship with Mr. Lu or benefited from any connection with him. Mr. Lu stepped down from his post in mid-2016 and was sentenced this year to 14 years in prison for corruption.
Then the company had its own run-ins with the censors. In April 2018, Bytedance and a few other star start-ups were punished for running "unhealthy" content. The company was ordered to shut down an app called Neihan Duanzi for hosting vulgar jokes and videos.
Mr. Zhang apologized, saying in a letter that he took responsibility for content that was incompatible with "core socialist values." He vowed to strengthen party building at Bytedance and announced that he would enhance the role of the editor in chief and expand the content moderation team to 10,000 from 6,000. Like other online outlets, Toutiao also began featuring stories about Xi Jinping, China's leader, at the top of its feed.
His apology seemed to be well received. Within two weeks, he delivered a keynote speech at a technology conference hosted by internet regulators. His topic: Bytedance's global expansion strategy.

Texto completo: House Democrats released the first two transcripts of their closed-door impeachment testimonies.
WASHINGTON -- The House committees leading the impeachment inquiry on Monday moved to open their proceedings to the public, releasing the first two transcripts of hours of testimony they have taken behind closed doors.
The transcripts were the leading edge of a series of expected releases this week, and include witness testimony from two diplomats -- Marie L. Yovanovitch, the former United States ambassador to Ukraine, and Michael McKinley, a former top adviser to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. New York Times reporters combed through the transcripts, identified key excerpts and added context and analysis.
The president's private lawyer tried to meddle in State Department consular affairs to advance his shadow campaign.
Yovanovitch transcript, Page 264: "And the next thing we knew, Mayor Giuliani was calling the White House as well as the assistant secretary for consular affairs, saying that I was blocking the visa for Mr. Shokin, and that Mr. Shokin was coming to meet him and provide information about corruption at the embassy, including my corruption."
Much has been reported about the efforts of the president's private lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani -- both public and behind the scenes -- to court Ukrainian officials who would help in his bid to ultimately damage the reputations of Mr. Trump's political opponents. Ms. Yovanovitch's account of Mr. Giuliani's attempts to interfere in the State Department decision provides additional details about just how open he was about his campaign to enlist Ukraine to help Mr. Trump win re-election.
Viktor Shokin, the former top prosecutor in Ukraine who was ousted in March 2016, applied to the State Department in early 2019 for a visa, stating that he wanted to travel to the United States to visit family. Following longstanding policy, an American consular officer denied the visa application because of Mr. Shokin's corrupt dealings.
When Mr. Giuliani pushed to get Mr. Shokin's visa application approved, he said the purpose of the trip was for a meeting, creating a new reason for the State Department to deny Mr. Shokin a visa -- he lied on his application.
-- Eileen Sullivan
As Yovanovitch fought for her job, allies turned to two Trump standbys: Hannity and Twitter.
Yovanovitch transcript, Page 117: "The secretary or perhaps somebody around him was going to place a call to Mr. Hannity on Fox News to say, 'You know, what is going on? I mean, do you have proof of these kinds of allegations or not? And if you have proof, you know, tell me, and if not, stop."'
Ms. Yovanovitch testified that she was pushed out of her post after Mr. Giuliani and others waged a smear campaign against her. She said that near the end of March, she was told Mr. Pompeo or someone close to him would be calling Sean Hannity, the conservative Fox News host, to complain about the allegations he had been broadcasting against her.
Ms. Yovanovitch said she did not know what was said on that call. A spokeswoman for Mr. Hannity did not respond to a request for comment.
Ms. Yovanovitch said that while the State Department was mostly silent in the face of the public attacks on her, she received one piece of advice from Gordon D. Sondland, the ambassador to the European Union and a key loyalist to Mr. Trump: Tweet something nice about the president.
Asked why she didn't take the advice, she noted that the State Department had been largely silent about the criticism of her: "I just didn't see that there would be any advantage to publicly taking on a fight with those who were criticizing me in the United States."
-- Michael D. Shear
State Department officials knew about Giuliani's activities in Ukraine but did not feel they could do anything about it.
Yovanovitch transcript, Page 270: "It's not like I sent in a formal cable outlining everything. It felt very, very -- very sensitive and very political."
Impeachment investigators have been hammering witnesses on what they knew about Mr. Giuliani's and Mr. Trump's dealings with Ukraine and what they did about it. According to Ms. Yovanovitch, their activities were widely known in Ukraine foreign policy circles, and many believed it was not typical, appropriate government conduct. But it was the politically-sensitive nature of what was going on that worried officials about formally raising concerns.
-- Eileen Sullivan
Yovanovitch learned in late 2018 from Ukrainian officials that Giuliani and a Ukrainian ally were targeting her.
Yovanovitch transcript, Page 27: "Basically, it was people in the Ukrainian government who said that Mr. Lutsenko, the former prosecutor general, was in communication with Mayor Giuliani, and that they had plans, and that they were going to, you know, do things, including to me."
As she recounts it, the story of Ms. Yovanovitch's removal from her posting in Kiev began as abruptly as it ended. In November or December 2018, Ms. Yovanovitch learned from Ukrainian government officials, not Americans, that the president's personal lawyer was working with Yuriy Lutsenko, the prosecutor general in Ukraine, in some shadowy way as both men sought to investigate the Bidens and other issues connected to Democrats.
It would become clearer over time that their goal was to remove her, she said. Democratic investigators do not view this chain of events as a side show. They are preparing to present the two men and others as working to oust Ms. Yovanovitch, who was championing anticorruption initiatives in Ukraine, to clear the decks for investigations that would benefit Mr. Trump politically. Whatever their intention, they succeeded months later, when Mr. Trump recalled Ms. Yovanovitch.
-- Nicholas Fandos
McKinley resigned because he felt the president was using the State Department for political gain.
McKinley transcript, Page 112: "In 37 years in the Foreign Service and different parts of the globe and working on many controversial issues, working 10 years back in Washington, I had never seen that."
Mr. McKinley told investigators that his resignation was prompted by his belief that the State Department was being used to dig up dirt on the president's political opponent, something he characterized as unprecedented.
-- Michael D. Shear
A State Department official described internal bullying to prevent people from speaking out.
Mr. McKinley recounted a conversation he had with George P. Kent, a deputy assistant secretary of state for Europe and Eurasia, who described internal bullying by State Department officials who were trying to mute his concerns. Mr. Kent also worried that the State Department had given inaccurate information to Congress, Mr. McKinley said.
McKinley transcript, Page 110: "THE CHAIRMAN [Representative Adam B. Schiff of California]: But let me ask you about this because you mentioned that he was concerned about bullying. One of the representations apparently made in that letter from the State Department was that State Department witnesses like Mr. Kent or perhaps yourself or others were being bullied, not by the State Department but by Congress. But what Mr. Kent was raising with you was his concern that he was being bullied by the State Department. Is that correct?
MR. MCKINLEY: That's correct.
THE CHAIRMAN: And he felt that what the State Department had represented to Congress included something that he thought was a lie.
MR. MCKINLEY: 'Inaccurate' is the term I'll use because, again, without looking back at the memo word for word, I do want to be, on a subject like that, as accurate as possible. He did question the way it was being presented, absolutely.
THE CHAIRMAN: And I think you said he conveyed to you that he thought that the State Department lawyer, perhaps among others, was trying to shut him up. Is that right?
MR. MCKINLEY: He did, and he focused specifically on the lawyer."
-- Lara Jakes
Yovanovitch was shocked to see that Trump brought her up in a conversation with the president of Ukraine.
Yovanovitch transcript, Page 193: "I was very surprised that President Trump would -- first of all, that I would feature repeatedly in a presidential phone call -- but secondly, that the president would speak about me or any ambassador in that way to a foreign counterpart."
During his conversation with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, Mr. Trump raised Ms. Yovanovitch's ouster and said she was "bad news." He also stated, "Well, she's going to go through some things."
To many who read the transcript released by the White House, including Ms. Yovanovitch, it sounded like an ominous threat. At the time of her testimony, she still did not know what the president meant by it.
-- Eileen Sullivan
McKinley said he had pushed for the department to issue a statement of support for Yovanovitch.
McKinley transcript, Page 38: "My reaction was, well, there's a simple solution for this. We think she's a strong, professional career diplomat who's still on the rolls, who's still a full-time department employee. It shouldn't be difficult to put out a short statement that's not political, stating clearly that we respect the professionalism, the tenure of Ambassador Yovanovitch in the Ukraine."
Mr. McKinley said that he pressed Mr. Pompeo three times to come to the defense of Ms. Yovanovitch and received no response, after it was revealed publicly that Mr. Trump had disparaged her during his July 25 call with the president of Ukraine. Mr. McKinley said his third attempt to do so came as he tendered his resignation. "I was pretty direct. I said, you know, this situation isn't acceptable," Mr. McKinley told House investigators.

Car Owner's License Is Suspended; Can Police Assume It's the Owner Driving?

Texto completo: Is it reasonable for a police officer to assume that the owner of a vehicle is driving it when the owner's license has been suspended?
WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court on Monday debated the meaning of common sense, and it turned out that justices had varying ideas about it.
The question in the case was whether police officers may stop vehicles registered to people whose driver's licenses had been suspended on the assumption that the driver was the owner, rather than, say, a family member.
The case started in the spring of 2016, when a sheriff's deputy in Lawrence, Kan., ran a check of the license plate of a moving Chevrolet pickup truck. The deputy learned that the vehicle was registered to Charles Glover Jr. and that Mr. Glover's driver's license had been revoked.
Based on that information and nothing more, the deputy stopped the truck, which Mr. Glover turned out to be driving. Mr. Glover was prosecuted for driving without a license, and he moved to suppress the evidence against him, arguing that the stop had violated the Fourth Amendment, which forbids unreasonable searches and seizures.
Toby Crouse, the Kansas solicitor general, said common sense suggested that the car's owner could well be its driver. "As a matter of common sense and ordinary human experience," he said, "the registered owner is likely the driver."
Michael R. Huston, a lawyer for the federal government arguing in support of Kansas, made essentially the same argument. "The Fourth Amendment asks police officers to be reasonable," he said. "It does not ask them to set aside common sense when they step into the patrol car."
The Kansas Supreme Court ruled for Mr. Glover, saying the deputy had made two unreasonable assumptions: that a vehicle's registered owner is "likely the primary driver," and that people whose driver's licenses are suspended or revoked "will likely disregard the suspension or revocation and continue to drive."
That second assumption was significant, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg told Mr. Huston. "Your position is that most people who have had their license suspended will break the law?" she asked.
Sarah E. Harrington, a lawyer for Mr. Glover, said common sense cannot provide the answer in those circumstances.
"It's the opposite of common sense," she said, "to think that someone having a suspended or revoked license is going to have no effect at all on whether they drive."
Ms. Harrington said the officer should have done more than make an assumption. One possibility, she said, was to peer into the vehicle to see if the driver matched the general description of the registered owner. Another was to follow the vehicle in case the driver committed a traffic infraction.
The second suggestion met resistance from Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh, who said it would encourage police officers to stop vehicles for contrived reasons.
The parties had stipulated to the basic information about the stop, and the officer did not testify. Several justices said that could be significant.
"You're asking us to make an inference about facts when there are no facts in the record at all," Justice Neil M. Gorsuch told Mr. Crouse, the lawyer representing Kansas.
Justice Gorsuch later added that he was wary of establishing a constitutional rule that could be undermined by changes in driving habits. "The next generation, for example, often rents cars," he said. "They don't buy cars. They don't own cars."
Near the conclusion of the argument in the case, Kansas v. Glover, No. 18-556, Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. assessed the state of play.
On the one hand, he said, the court could rule that the problem in the case was that the officer had failed to testify and explain his decision to stop the vehicle. On the other, the court could require statistical proof of the likelihood that the owners of cars whose licenses had been suspended are still driving.
"What you are proposing is either a trivial decision or a revolutionary decision," Justice Alito told Ms. Harrington. "It's a trivial decision if all that's lacking here is a statement" from the officer about his training and conclusions.
"It's a revolutionary decision," Justice Alito said, "if in every case involving reasonable suspicion there has to be a statistical showing or an examination of all the things that you think are necessary here."

Texto completo: Speaker Pelosi's daughter accused the New York Times of sexism and misogyny for the photo they used as a featured image on an opinion piece about the speaker.
The photo specifically shows what appears to be Pelosi's "calves and heels" from the back, and the accompanying article is titled, "Nancy Pelosi Should Not Be President."
Tweet
"Hey @deanbaquet could you @nytimes be any more misogynistic than to portray the female House Speaker with a photo of her calves and heels? #EverydaySexism," asked Christine Pelosi in a Monday morning tweet.
Tweet
The opinion piece argues that the speaker of the House should not be the second in line for succession in the event the president can no longer fulfill the duties of the office. Should President Trump and Vice President Mike Pence be removed from office, Pelosi would become president.
Pelosi was the first woman to serve as speaker of the House back in 2007. She took the role over again in 2018 after the Democrats won back the House of Representatives.

Texto completo: El presidente Donald Trump empieza la semana con pésimas noticias, ya que el Segundo Circuito Tribunal de Apelaciones determinó que deberá entregar ocho años de sus declaraciones de impuestos personales y corporativas a los fiscales de Manhattan.
Es posible que los defensores del mandatario busquen un nuevo camino para evitar entregar dichos informes: acudir a la Corte Suprema, según The New York Times.
Los fiscales de Manhattan están investigando el papel del presidente y su negocio en los pagos en efectivo hechos la estrella de cine porno Stormy Daniels , y a la exmodelo de Playboy Karen McDougal antes de las elecciones presidenciales de 2016, quienes acusaron tener amoríos con él, pero su silencio fue “comprado”.
Esta batalla legal comenzó a fines de agosto después de que se pidiera a la firma de contabilidad del presidente Trump, Mazars USA, las declaraciones de impuestos y las de su negocio familiar que datan de 2011.
El objetivo es determinar si el mandatario y su empresa, la Organización Trump, violaron alguna ley del estado de Nueva York, al realizar el pago y reembolsar el dinero al exabogado personal del republicano, Michael Cohen.

Inject artistry into your work, no matter what work you do

Texto completo: In today's competitive environment, we can't repress our artistry. Creativity, after all, is the one thing that can't be outsourced or automated. Whether you're a retail artist, a food service artist, or a refrigerator repair artist, the more imagination you inject into your work, the more achievement you'll enjoy.
When we think of an artist, it's easy to envision a tormented soul wearing a beret and a turtleneck, painting with oil on a canvas. Yet despite this stereotype, there are many other types of artists. In fact, you have the opportunity to be one yourself, regardless of your field or job title.
Beyoncé is an incredible musical artist, while Lin Manuel Miranda creates art on Broadway. We generally accept labeling artists in fields such as music, dance, fashion, interior design, poetry and sculpture, but why can't a lawyer also be an artist in her craft? Or a customer service rep, a corporate controller, or a director of human resources?
Instead of defining art in the traditional, restrictive manner, let's explore how we can all be artists. To me, we can inject artistry into any role with this new definition:
Artistry = skill + imagination Yes, someone who is an expert at interpretive dance creates art by combining skill plus their own imagination to create something fresh. But so can a mechanic, a sales person, or an industrial engineer. The output may not be a song or a painting, but the fusion of skill and imagination can yield artistic results in any line of work.
Maybe you're a health care artist. Or a financial services artist. A transportation artist, real estate artist or logistics artist. Instead of apologizing for injecting some creative wonder into our roles, let's recognize that artistry is a core job responsibility if we want to deliver great work and ultimately advance in our careers.
Since all human beings are creative, what's stopping you from being an artist in your craft? To get started, try practicing small creative acts on a daily basis. Don't worry about breakthrough or masterpieces, try sending an email in a more creative manner. Or making a sales call, solving a problem, or even making lunch. A high volume of daily imagination will help you build the habit, awakening your inner artist. Seek out micro-innovations and the big transformations will take care of themselves.
Remove the pressure on yourself to be perfect and replace it with the freedom to explore. If you were learning a new language, you wouldn't be fluent on day one. Artistry, too, takes practice.
In today's competitive environment, we can't repress our artistry. Creativity, after all, is the one thing that can't be outsourced or automated. Whether you're a retail artist, a food service artist, or a refrigerator repair artist, the more imagination you inject into your work, the more achievement you'll enjoy.
You already have the skills, and your inventiveness is there whether you know it or not. Bring it to the surface, and before long you'll be enjoying Grammy-like results.
Here's to the artist within.

WHERE HAS THE 'FISCALLY RESPONSIBLE' GOP GONE?

Texto completo: Winnebago County Executive Mark Harris called the other day and asked me to take a look at what's been happening to the national debt.
Harris, who was Oshkosh's mayor before being elected county executive in 2005, is a CPA and former banker who has always kept an eye on government finances. After all, he's got his own county budget to worry about. He's long been a skeptic on how Congress handles the Social Security Trust Funds for instance, essentially borrowing from the Trust to pay for general fund expenditures, even to cover tax cuts. But, that's another story that needs to be told another time, especially in light of claims that Social Security funds will fall short in the near future when, in fact, Congress someday has to honor the bonding commitments to the pension plans.
What alarmed Harris on this day, though, was how fast the country's debt is growing. On Aug. 1 this year, for instance, it stood at $22.022 trillion. By Oct. 10, it had grown to $22.842 trillion, an increase of $800 billion in less than three months. He keeps tabs on those figures by visiting the "debt to the penny" tracker on TreasuryDirect.gov, where the government keeps updating the figures.
At this rate, we're headed for a crisis, he insisted.
What's astonishing, though, is that few in Washington seem concerned about it. It's as if the entire discussion about the national debt has been swept under the rug, when only a few years ago, Republicans in Congress were berating Barack Obama for asking for a trillion-dollar stimulus program to pull the country out of the Great Recession.
My, how times have changed. A trillion dollars to help unemployed Americans find jobs and help them with their "underwater" mortgages was "reckless spending" in 2009, but funneling a couple of trillion dollars to corporations and the country's upper classes through unfunded tax cuts somehow became "prudent and wise" in 2017.
As of this week, the annual budget deficit has hit $984 billion, about $330 billion more than the Congressional Budget Office had predicted before the Donald Trump-Congressional Republican tax cuts were voted into law. That's about where it was in 2012 when the country was still digging its way out of the Recession; unemployment was high and government revenues short.
Then the annual deficit started to decline as more people went to work, housing regained its footing and business returned to normal. The deficit was declining, that is, until Trump and a Congress led by then-House Speaker Paul Ryan gave away the store, all at a time when stimulus was no longer needed. Now it appears that we'll be adding nearly $1 trillion a year to the already bloated and scary national debt.
As New York Times columnist Paul Krugman wrote earlier this week of the now-retired Ryan, " ... when he and his party got a chance to exercise the fiscal responsibility they declared essential, they blew up the deficit instead. Republicans only pretended to care about debt as an excuse to hobble President Obama and slash social programs."
And isn't it interesting that Republicans, including the party's leaders here in Wisconsin, seldom breathe a word about it? CREDIT: By Dave Zweifel ; Zweifel is editor emeritus of The Capital Times. dzweifel@madison.com, 608-252-6410 and @DaveZweifel.

End of trade war looks like start of cold war

Texto completo: If China agreed to purchase "$40 billion to $50 billion" of U.S. farm goods in "the next two years," as President Donald J. Trump announced Oct. 11, the futures market - where market reality is quickly sorted from political talk - literally wasn't buying it.
In fact, November soybean futures, the nearby contract, opened Monday, Oct. 14 at $9.405 per bushel and closed at $9.405, an almost unheard of result given that U.S. farmers are in the middle of their annual soybean season and the White House is in the middle of another monthly China tariff fight.
The December corn futures were even less impressed. Traders opened corn at $4.01 per bushel that day and finished the session nearly four cents per bushel lower. Prices then drained lower for the next two weeks.
And hogs? Every U.S. market player knows African Swine Flu continues to decimate the Chinese hog herd - some guesses put pig losses at a staggering 45 percent nationwide. So the president's Oct. 11 announcement of "substantial" ag exports to China propelled December hog futures through the roof, right?
Not even close. Indeed, two weeks after the White House's ag-exports talk, December hog futures were $5 per hundredweight, or more than 7%, lower than the day of the announcement.
Traders had a good reason for their cold reception to the president's red-hot news. Most have been burned by fiery White House talk before so few were buying a pound of anything - witness soybean futures' remarkably flat day - until they got confirmation.
Not only did it not come, news the next day proved the traders' worries to be correct; China openly downplayed the White House's giddy enthusiasm for any $50 billion ag deal and claimed no such agreement had been put to paper.
The market's overall sustained, lower reaction, however, is pointing to other, more ominous problems between China and the U.S. than just ag.
For example, the problem that started this trade war - the thorny, unresolved issue of China's required technology transfer by U.S. firms to do business there - is rarely mentioned by either side.
But it's more than just technology transfers. If the U.S. and China agree to any interim ag deal in the coming month, reported Reuters Oct. 25, that deal still "will not cover U.S. allegations of Chinese hacking into U.S. companies and government agencies, state subsidies, [or] Beijing's alleged dumping of lower-priced products on global markets."
How can any U.S.-Chinese ag deal - an increased likelihood - stay above water with all that weight hanging around its neck? The market appears to be betting that it won't.
Another reason to worry is the sudden stern tone that U.S. leaders have taken on China in speeches both there and in the U.S. The first to grumble was Terry Branstad, the former Iowa governor who now serves as U.S. ambassador to China.
On Oct. 21, Branstad publicly offered some "unusually pointed remarks ... [that] turn on a catch phrase - reciprocity - that U.S. officials have invoked to justify a tougher approach toward China on issues including commerce and diplomacy," explained the Washington Post.
Branstad was speaking on behalf of the White House, and proof came three days later when Vice President Mike Pence, reported the New York Times, "denounced American companies that he said had compromised American values like free speech to appease the Chinese Communist Party."
China didn't take either slap lightly. A day after the Pence speech, a Chinese government spokeswoman said the vice president's speech "exuded sheer arrogance and hypocrisy, and was packed with political prejudice and lies."
The American directness and the equally curt Chinese reply do not sound like two nations nearing agreement on anything. In fact, the unusually tough, undiplomatic talk sounds more like two nations preparing for a cold war rather than two nations preparing to end a trade war.
If that's the case - and who knows given this mercurial White House - then the futures traders' bet soon will pay off yet again.

Teen Harvard grad enjoying Washburn

Resumen: Stress relief, he said, was a video game console and World of Warcraft, "which doesn't do anything for the nerd persona, does it?" He began spending summers in Cambridge after his sophomore year of high school, taking classes alongside other young, talented students. "Students like Braxton exemplify the transformative power of our public schools — a place where all Kansas children who strive can reach their potential and overcome any obstacle, no matter where they come from," Kelly said. Public schools, Moral said, allowed him to achieve his goals, and he thinks more people would feel the same way "if the public school system wasn't as demonized as it tends to be."

Texto completo: TOPEKA — This has been a remarkable year for Braxton Moral, the 17-year-old from southwest Kansas who earned a high school diploma and Harvard University degree in May.
His academic prowess has taken him on a journey from his rural hometown of Ulysses to the gallery of the Kansas House for Gov. Laura Kelly's State of the State address and to Cambridge, Mass., where German chancellor Angela Merkel delivered the commencement speech for Harvard graduates.
Moral appeared on NBC's "Today" show and, after the Hutchinson News wrote about his accomplishments, he was profiled by the New York Times and numerous other publications.
He is now a student at Washburn University's School of Law in Topeka. An aspiring politician who is still too young to vote, Moral believes you should know the law before you make laws.
"Washburn's a great school," Moral said. "I really enjoy being there, studying there. I enjoy it. Topeka, it's populated but not too populated. It's not quite intimidating."
Moral talked about growing up in southwest Kansas, the value of public education and his political hopes during a recording of the Capitol Insider podcast.
He chose to continue his education at Washburn in part because of concerns by Harvard and other schools about allowing a juvenile on campus. Moral said he is comfortable in Topeka, where his family is just a six-hour drive away. He hasn't decided what he will do after this school year.
“It's really a pleasure to work with Braxton," said Tonya Kowalski, a professor of law and co-director of the Comparative and International Law Center at Washburn. "He's got a wonderful sense of humor and contributes a great deal to the class.”
Moral jokes that he realized he was different from classmates somewhere around the time they got past the coloring stage in kindergarten. The teachers were great, he said, but he wasn't learning "the content that I needed for that time in my life."
He began testing out of classes, moving up grades, and participating in special programs. His parents encouraged him to stay focused.
"I've been told that as I was getting less and less challenged and less and less enthusiastic about school, they needed a way to keep me interested and keep me working hard," Moral said.
He said he couldn't remember how he first landed on Harvard's radar because he was too young, somewhere around 11, at the time.
His first class at the university was in JavaScript — this was back when "computer programming still held its glamour," he said — but he quickly realized he wasn't interested in the subject. Moral pivoted toward study of classical Greek literature and history courses, and eventually earned a degree in government with a minor in English.
As he pursued Harvard courses online, Moral also made his way through high school curriculum. Stress relief, he said, was a video game console and World of Warcraft, "which doesn't do anything for the nerd persona, does it?"
He began spending summers in Cambridge after his sophomore year of high school, taking classes alongside other young, talented students. On campus, he relished the exposure to a wide variety of people found in an urban setting.
"I think meeting other people is just allowing me to view the world from their lens while not necessarily changing my own, and just understand not every place is like Kansas," Moral said. "Especially in terms of diversity of country — meeting people from all across the globe.
"When you meet somebody from a different country in New York, for instance, people won't blink twice. But if you meet somebody from, you know, Switzerland, and you're from Kansas, that's a big deal because you've never met anybody from Switzerland."
Kelly invited Moral to attend her inaugural State of the State address in January. She singled out the "amazing young Kansan" during her speech, highlighted his achievements and asked the crowd of Kansas lawmakers and dignitaries to recognize him in the House gallery.
"Students like Braxton exemplify the transformative power of our public schools — a place where all Kansas children who strive can reach their potential and overcome any obstacle, no matter where they come from," Kelly said.
Moral said he was grateful for the "surreal" experience and the feeling that working hard had gotten him somewhere.
Public schools, Moral said, allowed him to achieve his goals, and he thinks more people would feel the same way "if the public school system wasn't as demonized as it tends to be."
The State of the State address also provided Moral a window into the political world.
"That event in general is probably the most political thing I've had the opportunity to be a part of, which is very nice when you want to go into politics," Moral said. "It's always great to see how people interact with each other in that setting, how a speech like that is actually put on. It's exposure and inspiration, and it was very nice to be able to come."
Other political inspirations for Moral include President Dwight D. Eisenhower, who may be "even more impressive than we make him out to be," Moral said, and U.S. Sen. Pat Roberts.
Roberts — a fixture for agriculture policy in Washington, D.C., who served in the House for 16 years before winning four terms to the Senate — announced in January he will retire when his current term expires.
"I think people forget just how much of an impact he made, regardless of if you agree with him or not," Moral said. "I think people from both sides of the aisle should at least respect certain statesmen just because of the way they present themselves and the way they interact with other states."
Roberts, responding to an inquiry for this story, offered these words of advice for Moral.
“Politics have gotten so polarizing, but I always work across the aisle and am friends with my colleagues, regardless of their party,” Roberts said. “That’s how you get things done in the Senate. Just look at the Farm Bill — we got a record 86 votes by working with both Republicans and Democrats to get the best bill possible.”

Texto completo: ‘Dad, what’s a lapidary?”
Growing up in blue-collar Carteret, N.J., Dave Haake had come across that weird vocabulary item in the want ads. His father, a printer whose bread and butter was the Jersey City telephone book, had no idea.
Jump-cut to 1981, when Dave and Grace, his bride of 24 hours, waved goodbye to friends and family and went winging west to Maui one Sunday on a pair of one-way tickets.
“We got here,” he said, “I took a look around and I decided, I don’t care what I’ve got to do, I’m not leaving this place.”
The feeling never changed.
Back East, Haake had been delivering auto parts and jobbing in warehouses. But he was intrigued by a want ad looking for someone to do sanding and polishing, so he applied and landed the job. Overnight, a lapidary was born — that’s someone who cuts, polishes, carves and engraves stones or, by extension, other durable materials. And in time, this one proved a self-taught artist of distinction.
“Requests from customers pushed me to expand my skills,” Haake says. “One customer wanted a replacement for an intricately carved Chinese chess piece he had lost. I also got a lot of requests for pistol grips.”
But what turned out to be his true forte was the carving of eye-catching ornamental fishhooks in pre-ban ivory, no two alike.
Fishhooks show up all over the Polynesian Triangle, as tackle in everyday practical use or as a powerful tribal signifier. Here at the apex of the Triangle, the constellation Western astronomers call Scorpio appears as Manaiakalani, the cosmic fishhook by which Maui, legendary snarer of the sun, pulled the island chain from the depths of the ocean floor. Small wonder the motif reappears endlessly in body art, on T-shirts and in souvenir stand bric-a-brac.
In Haake’s variations on the theme, bold curves hold their own with wicked barbs in a timeless but dynamic harmony.
Ask the Mauian transplanted from New York who went back East, got introduced to the president emerita of the Museum of Modern Art at the opera, and found the lady — herself a renowned collector of top-of-the-line contemporary art — transfixed by his Haake pendant. “That,” she said, “is a wonderful piece. Wherever did you find it?”
The answer: at Lahaina Scrimshaw, on the far end of Front Street. But don’t go looking for it now. The shop closed in June 2018, the last vestige of a concern that in its heyday operated out of better than a half-dozen outlets islandwide. Haake had worked there for 37 years.
The studio in the industrial area beyond the highway was a dusty and busy place, with different rooms dedicated to different product lines, from the etched whalebone known as scrimshaw to silver and gold jewelry.
At the beginning, Haake sanded and polished chunks of Alaskan fossil ivory as scrimshaw blanks. Soon he moved on to exotic hardwoods, turning out whatever there was a need for: card holders, letter openers and the like, as well as display stands for the finished pieces. When the business took on a silversmith and then a goldsmith, Haake picked up their trades, too.
Together with the goldsmith, he wound up developing a line of 14-karat gold jewelry in the form of whale tails, dolphins, turtles and mantas. “Back then,” Haake says, “we were really jamming.”
With the passing of the Marine Mammal Protection Act in 1972, the tide began to turn. In 1989 a national ban on the import of elephant ivory went into effect. And in June 2017, Hawaii banned the sale of ivory from any source.
“The ivory trade is dead in Hawaii,” Haake says, without complaint, though it’s a reality even a committed conservationist might see in shades of gray.
With the shuttering of the Lahaina Scrimshaw storefront, the studio closed down, too, leaving Haake without a space to spread out. “I didn’t want to invest in a workshop at this point,” he says. So, his operation is down to fishhooks now, which he carves in the shade of the palms on the beach across from his and Grace’s condo on South Kihei Road.
Transitioning from traditional materials, he tried maple burls compacted with metallic resins, some partially transparent, some fluorescent. To eyes accustomed to his classic work in white and off-white, they could look flashy. Since then Haake has taken up composites made from crushed red coral, as bright as a candy apple, and minerals on the green-to-blue-to-lilac spectrum like malachite, chrysocolla and turquoise.
Though his aesthetic hasn’t changed, the jewel-tone palette gives his new work a jazzier, more contemporary appeal. At an average price point of around $ 220, the gemstone pieces run about 40% off the no- longer-obtainable ivories of yesteryear. The prices on pieces in exotic hardwoods and other materials range both higher and lower.
How many hours go into a fishhook? “It depends,” Haake says. “Usually I work on several pieces at once. I don’t like to worry about how much money I’m making. I just want to make them as nice as I can. I hope it works out. So long as I can get by, I’m good. I’m not trying to get rich.”
—
Where to find Haake’s hooks
In the old days, carvers might initial their pieces, but shops seldom promoted them individually. That practice appears to remain in force today. Once the rival of Lahaina Scrimshaw, Whalers Locker on Front Street carries an attractive assortment of Dave Haake’s recent pieces. There’s more at Totally Hawaiian Gift Gallery in Whalers Village, Maui Ocean Arts on South Kihei Road, and at the Gottling Home Store at the Shops in Wailea. Farther afield, Haake’s hooks can be found at the Hana Coast Gallery in Hana and Makai Glass Maui on Haliimaile Road. “Hey,” an impressed collector remarked, “you’re all over the island.” Haake’s reply: “I’m trying to be!” Most of the salespeople at the listed outlets know his name.

Obamacare enrollment runs through Dec. 15.

Texto completo: South Florida health insurance consumers have more choices for 2020 on the Affordable Health Care marketplace as enrollment gets underway from Nov. 1 through Dec. 15.
With six years of cost and revenue data under their belts, long-established insurers like Blue Cross Blue Shield have figured out how to remain profitable, while leaner, narrow-network insurers have carved out sizable segments for themselves.
Three companies that offered 2019 plans in Broward and Miami-Dade counties are returning next year - market leader Florida Blue, along with Molina Healthcare and Ambetter, owned by Centene.
They are joined by a fourth provider - Oscar Health. Backed by $1.2 billion from investors including Google parent company Alphabet, Oscar debuted in Central Florida last year and in 2020 is expanding into 10 additional Florida counties, including South Florida's tri-county region and the Tampa area. The tech-savvy company has expanded to six new states, for a total of 14.
Palm Beach County consumers can choose from all four of those companies plus two others - Bright Health and Cigna Healthcare.
Is the ACA's future still uncertain?
Yes it is. But that won't affect consumers' ability to purchase coverage for 2020. A federal appellate court is expected to rule any day on a Texas judge's declaration last year that the Affordable Care Act is unconstitutional. But if the appellate court agrees, its decision will be appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which wouldn't be expected to rule on the question until next year.
What's happening with premiums?
Nationwide, premiums are set to decline 4% for one of the most popular 2020 plans, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services reported. In Florida, the cumulative change for plans offered by 10 companies is 0%, according to the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation. Last year, premiums rose a cumulative 5.2%, and for 2018 they rose 44.7%.
What's the difference between on- and off-exchange policies?
First, it's necessary to know that there are two different types of individual health insurance policies - those purchased "on-exchange" and those purchased "off-exchange." Since Jan. 1, 2014, both types have been required to cover 10 essential benefits with no lifetime or annual benefit maximums,and provide consumer protections such as ending exclusions for preexisting conditions.
The key difference is on-exchange plans are eligible for government tax credits and additional cost-sharing revenue. To be eligible, these must be purchased through the government-created marketplace Healthcare.gov. This is why more than 90% of "on-exchange" buyers receive some government subsidies.
Off-exchange plans are not eligible for government help, but are also available from more insurers with a wider range of costs and benefits. Typically, consumers whose incomes are too high to qualify for government subsidies purchase off-exchange plans.
But costs of these unsubsidized plans remain high, forcing an increasing number of higher-income workers to forego insurance, the New York Times reported Oct. 22.
For example, the cheapest plan that a 50-year-old Broward County non-smoking single male or female earning $55,000 a year can buy on-exchange in 2020 costs $438 a month, and that's with a $5,500 deductible and $8,150 out-of-pocket maximum. The same plan would cost a 27-year-old with the same salary $257 a year.
High costs have also prompted expansion of so-called "short term" plans that are exempt from many of the ACA's consumer protections and minimum coverage requirements.
Who can buy an ACA policy?
Subsidy-eligible plans can be purchased by consumers who don't have access to employer-based plans or Medicare. Also, immigrants who are in the country illegally cannot qualify, nor can people who are incarcerated.
Typical ACA purchasers are low-income parents with children, people who are self-employed, workers whose employers don't offer affordable health insurance, and early retirees who don't yet qualify for Medicare.
Who qualifies for tax credits?
Households earning between 100% and 400% of the federal poverty level qualify for tax credits that can lower their monthly premiums.
To be eligible for tax credits, a single-household consumer would need an adjusted gross income between $12,490 and $49,960. For a family of four, the range is $25,750 to $103,000.
Why is Obamacare so important in Florida?
Because of the state's low wage base and high percentage of service jobs, many households qualify for government subsidies and would otherwise go without coverage.
Florida is Obamacare's biggest success story. Enrollment for 2019 plans increased by 73,329 to 1.67 million while it declined in the 38 other states that use the federal exchange.
Nearly half of Florida's enrollees - about 800,000 - live in Broward, Miami-Dade and Palm Beach counties, according to federal data.
Prices are confusing. Why?
Prices vary widely, even with the maximum monthly tax credit.
Generally, the lower the deductible, co-pay and co-insurance and out-of-pocket maximum offered, the higher the monthly premium. For example, a 55-year-old man living alone in Palm Beach County making $25,000 a year qualifies for a $634 monthly tax credit.
If he opted for the highest-benefit "platinum" coverage, he would pay $598 a month for a Blue Select Platinum 1457 plan from Florida Blue with $0 deductible and a maximum $2,000 out-of-pocket cost. He would also pay $75 per emergency room visit, $10 for a generic drug prescription, $10 to visit his primary care physician and $20 to visit his specialist.
But because of the high monthly premium, that plan would end up costing $7,783 over the year if he's a "medium" health care user with regular doctor visits and prescriptions and no hospital stay.
Opting for the highest-deductible plan, Oscar Simple Bronze, would cost the same consumer nothing for monthly premiums but he would have to pay full price for emergency room visits, primary physician and specialist visits until reaching the $8,150 deductible. Generic prescriptions would cost $20 each.
Assuming "medium" health care usage, Healthcare.gov estimates this plan would cost the consumer $2,183 over the coverage year.
Additional benefits:
In addition to eligibility for premium tax credits for households earning between 100% and 400% of the federal poverty level, households earning between 100% and 250% of the federal poverty level are also eligible for special "modified" Silver plans with additional cost-sharing reductions that will bring down the deductibles, copays, coinsurance and out-of-pocket limits.
For example, the 55-year-old in our example above who opts for the Ambetter Balanced Care 15 plan would pay $237 a month after receiving his $633.53 monthly tax credit. That plan comes with a $2,875 deductible and $6,500 out-of-pocket maximum. He would pay 40% of the cost of any emergency room visit up to his out-of-pocket maximum, $25 for for a primary physician visit, $60 to see a specialist and $25 for a generic prescriptions. His estimate total yearly costs for "medium" usage would be $3,491.
With additional cost-sharing reductions, a couple in their 30s with three children under 10 would get the same plan for $135 a month, a $1,900 deductible and $3,700 out-of-pocket maximum. Primary doctor visits and generic prescriptions would be $10 each. A specialist would cost $30 per visit, and estimated "medium" usage would cost $3,643.
Where can I get more information and sign up?
*For on-exchange plans, go to Healthcare.gov. In Florida, enrollment and renewal help is also available at coveringflorida.org.
*Visit a local health insurance broker. They'll sit down with you, answer questions and review costs and benefits.
*Visit insurers' websites:
*Oscar Health Insurance: hioscar.com
*Bright Health: brighthealthplan.com
*Cigna Healthcare: cigna.com
*Ambetter: ambetter.sunshinehealth.com
*Molina Healthcare: molinahealthcare.com
*Florida Blue: floridablue.com
*For off-exchange plans, go to the government's Plan Finder tool at http://finder.healthcare.gov. Be wary about other websites and tools that purport to offer access to low-cost health insurance. These might be scams.

Texto completo: Here's a rundown of what happened in the Democratic primary race this week.
For one day this week, the 2020 Democratic primary included "Gory BOOker," "Steve BOO-lock" and "BoOOLián Castro." How's that for Halloween spirit?
We'll return to the holiday later. For now, here's a look at the more substantive things that happened in the race this week.
Beto O'Rourke is out
Former Representative Beto O'Rourke of Texas ended his presidential campaign on Friday, saying he had concluded that "this campaign does not have the means to move forward successfully."
"My service to the country will not be as a candidate or as the nominee," he said in a message to supporters. "Acknowledging this now is in the best interests of those in the campaign; it is in the best interests of this party as we seek to unify around a nominee; and it is in the best interests of the country."
Mr. O'Rourke began his campaign as a potential front-runner, with some polls early in the year showing him as high as third place. But his numbers have steadily sunk, and by this month he was polling mostly at 2 percent or less.

- Our colleague Alex Burns has the full story on Mr. O'Rourke's decision.

Seventeen candidates are still running. We're tracking the field here.

Warren's plan to pay for 'Medicare for all'
Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts laid out how to pay for her "Medicare for all" plan on Friday, proposing $ 20.5 trillion in new spending through significant tax increases on businesses and wealthy Americans, but not, she said, on the middle class.
Under Ms. Warren's plan, employer-sponsored health insurance would be eliminated and replaced by free government coverage for all Americans. Like Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, she would essentially eliminate medical costs for individuals, including premiums, deductibles and other out-of-pocket expenses.
To fund it, she said that over the next decade, she would require employers to pay trillions of dollars, create a tax on financial transactions like stock trades, change how investment gains are taxed for the top 1 percent of households, and increase her signature wealth tax proposal for billionaires. She also proposed cutting $ 800 billion in military spending.

Kamala Harris is cutting her staff
Senator Kamala Harris of California, once in the top tier of the Democratic field, has fallen as low as 3 percent in recent polls. And on Wednesday, her campaign announced that it would lay off some aides, reduce top staffers' pay and throw its full weight into Iowa.
In a memo to staff members, Ms. Harris's campaign manager, Juan Rodriguez, said the layoffs and pay reductions would free up enough money for more than $ 1 million in advertising.
Mr. Rodriguez also took a thinly veiled jab at Julián Castro and Cory Booker, who raised money by telling supporters they would drop out otherwise. A successful campaign, he wrote, must "make difficult strategic decisions and make clear priorities, not threaten to drop out or deploy gimmicks."

Castro out of danger -- for now
About that fund-raising effort from Mr. Castro, the former housing secretary: As we mentioned last week, he had announced that he would end his campaign if he didn't raise $ 800,000 by Oct. 31.
Well, Oct. 31 was Thursday, and (surprise!) Mr. Castro's team announced Friday that he made it.
"We're not going anywhere," his campaign manager, Maya Rupert, said in a statement. "Julián will keep being a voice for the voiceless, and a champion for the Americans who have been left behind."
A tight race in Iowa
Four Democratic presidential candidates are locked in a close race in Iowa, according to a New York Times/Siena College poll of likely caucusgoers released on Friday.
The survey puts Ms. Warren (22 percent) slightly ahead of Mr. Sanders (19 percent), Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind. (18 percent), and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. (17 percent).

And finally ...
We've got a few Halloween treats for you this weekend.
First off, we like polls, and Monmouth University, one of the most highly respected polling groups out there, gave us this very serious survey on how Americans feel about Halloween. One takeaway: 36 percent of Americans picked Reese's Peanut Butter Cups as their favorite candy, making it the clear leader.
Mr. Buttigieg, Ms. Harris, Mr. O'Rourke and Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado were among the candidates who picked it as their favorite in a survey done by our colleagues in Opinion.
They were also asked to name the worst candy. The entrepreneur Andrew Yang expressed his distaste for candy corn and offered the following observation: "There are better candies and better corn."
Finally, we leave you with this video from Ms. Warren, whose dog, Bailey, channeled his inner tax policy wonk this year, appearing as his mom's two-cent wealth tax.

Texto completo: BY THOMAS BEAUMONT
The Associated Press
DES MOINES - The campaign trips to Iowa are becoming more frequent, the pleas to voters more urgent and the potential for coming up short more vivid.
The three-month sprint to the Iowa caucuses began Friday when more than a dozen Democratic presidential candidates made their increasingly urgent pitches at the state party's marquee annual fundraiser.
Fourteen White House hopefuls were scheduled to speak to the more than 13,000 Democratic activists, party volunteers and campaign supporters who were expected to convene in Des Moines for the Iowa Democratic Party's Liberty and Justice Celebration.
The event, which amounts to the largest gathering of Democrats in an early voting state, is so big that it will serve as something of a dress rehearsal for the Feb. 3 caucuses. The momentum of candidates on the rise will be tested while lagging contenders will face further questions about why they're staying in the race.
The event ushers in a new, critical chapter of the campaign. Candidates must now move beyond simply introducing themselves to voters and activists and focus on a grassroots strategy to ensure their supporters show up at the caucus.
"This dinner is an epic moment," said former state Democratic Chairwoman Sue Dvorsky, who has endorsed California Sen. Kamala Harris. "It kicks off an entirely different phase of the national campaign."
The damp, chilly streets of downtown Des Moines buzzed with the intensifying campaign.
Supporters and campaign volunteers for the candidates waved signs at busy street corners, and congregated in chanting droves outside Wells Fargo Arena, where the evening event takes place.
The leading candidates were going into the banquet with a different set of advantages and vulnerabilities.
Former Vice President Joe Biden faces questions about the intensity of his support in Iowa. His campaign planned to pack the audience with thousands of supporters and flood the hall with members of the International Association of Fire Fighters, a union that threw its support to Biden early in the race.
But his early lead in Iowa is being challenged by Sen. Elizabeth Warren. Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., is building a following in the state that would have seemed far-fetched six months ago. And Sen. Bernie Sanders has a steady base of support that means he can't be written off.
Buttigieg had the largest presence planned for the event, having bought thousands of seats for supporters in the arena, hosting an overflow room in the hall, leading a pre-event rally expected to draw hundreds just blocks away and embarking on a three-day bus tour through the state afterward. Though public polls have shown the 37-year-old mayor trailing Warren, Biden and Sanders, Buttigieg has seized on curiosity about his candidacy to mount an aggressive organizing campaign seen as having traction in recent months. Beyond his youth, Buttigieg is the first major gay candidate for president and is an Afghanistan war veteran and Rhodes scholar.
"It kind of feels Buttigieg has some wind in his sails," said Jeff Link, a veteran Iowa Democratic campaign operative.
Warren entered the weekend under pressure to prove that she can sustain the momentum that built around her campaign over the summer. She brought the audience in a crowded auditorium to its feet in August when she spoke at another Democratic dinner. But as her candidacy rises, she's come under growing scrutiny, especially when it comes to questions of how she would implement and pay for her ambitious policy proposals.
Former Iowa Gov. Tom Vilsack said the race had entered a phase more serious than the festival-like atmosphere in Des Moines suggested.
Vilsack suggested Friday that Warren's plan to finance her universal health care proposal with higher-still taxes on wealth Americans is unrealistic.
"I really, honestly believe people need to get serious about this and say, 'OK, great, this is a great plan, how are you going to get it passed?'" Vilsack said Friday. Vilsack, who was U.S. secretary of agriculture during the Obama administration, has consulted several candidates including Warren on rural issues.
She released new details on Friday about how she would implement a "Medicare for All" program, but independent experts quickly questioned some of her estimates.
Sanders, meanwhile, is just weeks removed from a heart attack that took him off the campaign trail for several days. He will likely need to demonstrate that he's up to the pressure of campaigning.
A New York Times/Sienna College poll of likely caucusgoers released on Friday found Warren, Sanders, Buttigieg and Biden bunched together at the top of the field in Iowa.
One person missing from the weekend's activities: Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, whom some Democrats worry could mount a third-party bid for the presidency.
All of the candidates can look to history for reassurance that a strong performance at the dinner can change the trajectory of their campaigns.
In 1999, then-Vice President Al Gore effectively blocked former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley's advance with the chant during his speech "stay and fight," a nudge at Bradley for leaving the Senate.
Four years later, Massachusetts Sen. John Kerry held off a dire challenge from Howard Dean at the event.
"We need answers not just anger," Kerry said, in a hit at the anti-war Vermont governor who had stirred passions on the left but worried others for challenging a wartime President George W. Bush. "Iowa, don't just send them a message. Send them a president."
More notably, then-Illinois Sen. Barack Obama in 2007 threw down the gauntlet against national Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton, declaring "triangulating and poll-driven positions, because we're worried about what Mitt or Rudy might say about us, just won't do."

Burlas y críticas a Donald Trump por mudarse de Nueva York a Florida

Texto completo: Los críticos del presidente Donald Trump se burlaron en internet y lo acusaron de intentar aligerar su factura de impuestos después de que anunció el jueves que su residencia permanente sería Palm Beach, Florida, en lugar de la Torre Trump en Nueva York.
“Donald Trump no quiere que el estado de Nueva York vea sus impuestos, me pregunto por qué. Digamos esto como es: corrupción, simple y llanamente”, tuiteó el jueves la senadora Elizabeth Warren , candidata presidencial para las elecciones de 2020.
Trump, un neoyorquino de toda la vida, presentó una “declaración de domicilio” ante el Tribunal de Circuito del Condado de Palm Beach en septiembre, renunciando a su residencia en Nueva York y designando el resort Mar-a-Lago de la familia como su residencia principal, según The New York Times. El diario, que informó por primera vez el cambio de residencia de Trump, dijo que la medida tiene motivos fiscales: Florida en particular no tiene impuestos estatales sobre la renta o la herencia.
En Nueva York, Trump enfrenta el escrutinio tanto del fiscal general del estado como del fiscal de distrito de Manhattan sobre sus declaraciones de impuestos.
“Los estadounidenses de a pie no son dueños de resorts que pueden enumerar como direcciones alternativas para modificar su obligación tributaria”, tuiteó el jueves la representante Nita Lowey, demócrata de Nueva York. “Las familias de clase media hoy enfrentan más cargas impositivas mientras el presidente esquiva las consecuencias del proyecto de ley republicano”.
Dan Pfeiffer, exasesor de Obama, bromeó en un tuit el jueves: “El presidente huye a Florida para evitar pagar impuestos”.
Trump tuiteó el jueves por la noche que apreciaba su ciudad natal y “odiaba tener que tomar esta decisión”, pero “a pesar del hecho de que pago millones de dólares en impuestos municipales, estatales y locales cada año, los líderes políticos me han tratado muy mal, tanto de la ciudad como del estado “.
Agregó que Nueva York “siempre tendrá un lugar especial en mi corazón”.
La exrepresentante Gwen Graham, demócrata de Florida, reaccionó a la noticia con solo cuatro palabras: “Nosotros. No. Lo. queremos”.
Y Michael Steele, ex presidente del Comité Nacional Republicano, tuiteó: “Maldita sea, habrás sacado a Trump de #NYC”. #PobreFlorida “.
El alcalde de Nueva York, Bill de Blasio, demócrata y ex candidato de 2020, también opinó.
“No dejes que la puerta te golpee al salir o algo así”, tuiteó el jueves. De Blasio hizo un seguimiento temprano el viernes con otro mensaje: “Nuestro más sentido pésame a la buena gente de Florida mientras Trump intenta escapar de su pasado (y futuro cercano)”.
En un monólogo burlón el viernes por la mañana, Pat Kiernan , presentador de noticias matutinas durante mucho tiempo en NY1, también criticó duramente al presidente por la mudanza, específicamente el costo y las molestias que la ciudad ha soportado para proteger el perímetro de la Torre Trump en Manhattan.

With financial challenges and frustrating polls, Beto O’Rourke’s campaign reaches an abrupt end

Texto completo: DES MOINES — Hours before Beto O'Rourke quit the presidential race Friday evening, his supporters were taking part in the boisterous "sign wars" here outside the Wells Fargo Arena ahead of the season's biggest Democratic gathering.
In New Hampshire, his campaign was building out an upcoming trip, announcing he would participate in the famed "Politics and Eggs" speaking series on Nov. 8.
And in El Paso, staffers were readying a policy on disability issues to coincide with a forum on the topic Saturday in Cedar Rapids.
In many ways, it was business as usual for the campaign — until it wasn't. His exit Friday evening was a relatively abrupt conclusion to a campaign that began with much promise and fell from grace but found new purpose after the El Paso shooting in August and appeared — at least from the outside — to be pressing forward amid mounting challenges.
Breaking the news to supporters on the Des Moines waterfront, O'Rourke hinted at just how swift the decision had been. Lamenting his wife's absence, he called it "a decision we made so recently and so reluctantly she can't be here in person."
O'Rourke decided to drop out just in the last couple days, according to campaign sources, and senior staff did not begin learning about the decision until Thursday. More senior staff learned Friday, and late in the afternoon, just a few hours before his first event of the weekend in Iowa, he held an all-staff call to share his decision.
On the call, O'Rourke discussed the tough financial choices he was facing if he were to continue running, the sources said. He also told staff he would not run for U.S. Senate next year in Texas — something he has previously denied interest in but a possibility that was bound to generate more speculation with him no longer running for president.
O'Rourke's campaign was facing a number of pressures, perhaps none more serious than money. While he raised more in the third quarter than he did in the second, both saw the campaign spending at an alarming rate, burning through significantly more money than it took in. In the third quarter, the campaign spent $1.43 for every $1 it raised, with payroll and related costs taking up the bulk of expenses.
Any course correction at this point would have likely meant cuts to that category, resulting in layoffs.
Unlike rivals Cory Booker and Julián Castro, O'Rourke did not resort to threats to drop out if he did not raise a certain amount of money in a short period of time. But about three weeks ago, his campaign announced it wanted to raise $2 million over the next six weeks to boost its overall standing in the race, and its progress toward that goal was unclear as of Friday evening.
In one potential sign of the campaign's financial woes, its digital ad spending hit its lowest point last week since he entered the race, according to one tracker.
Looming over the cash crunch was the November debate, for which O'Rourke was straining to qualify. While he had the 165,000 donors required for the debate, he had only accumulated two out of four qualifying polls over the past several weeks. The deadline is in 12 days.
In recent days, O'Rourke had become increasingly frank about his frustrations with the polls.
"Look, I would love to be doing a lot better, that’s for sure," O'Rourke said Monday night on Comedy Central's "The Daily Show." He added that he wished his supporters' "enthusiasm and dedication was reflected in the polls."
Appearing Thursday morning on the New York radio show "The Breakfast Club," O'Rourke fielded several blunt questions about his standing, including this one: "How often do you yell 'fuck' at the polls?"
"Um," O'Rourke replied with a knowing grin, "that comes up a lot right now."
It would end up being one of his final media appearances as a presidential candidate. The night before, he held his last campaign event before heading to Iowa — and it was a fitting twilight for a candidate who had become doggedly focused on gun violence: a town hall in Newtown, Connecticut, not far from the site of the tragic 2012 school shooting.
The event appeared to weigh on O'Rourke as he sought to rally supporters Friday evening who had just learned his White House bid was over.
"The very last place that I got to visit before being here in Des Moines as a candidate — just as an American, as a human being — was Newtown, Connecticut," O'Rourke said, "and I listened to a community and to families who had been through so much and today, almost seven years later, show us so much courage and give us an example for the way forward."
In the lead-up to Friday evening, O'Rourke's campaign had shown no signs of slowing down, especially in the early voting states. His campaign announced Wednesday that he would visit New Hampshire on Nov. 8 to file for the state's primary, and on Friday afternoon, the campaign announced his plans to participate in Politics and Eggs.
Then there was his Iowa trip, which was set to be his biggest swing through the state in recent memory, with four days of events planned for after the state party's Liberty and Justice Celebration on Friday night. Notably, O'Rourke was set to return to the counties in southeast Iowa that flipped from Barack Obama to Donald Trump — the "pivot" counties that O'Rourke prioritized with his first Iowa swing right after launching his campaign in March.
His Iowa endorsers, unaware of his decision, were looking forward to joining him when he swung through their parts of the state.
"I'm shocked that he hasn't caught on as much — in the polling at least," said Linn County Supervisor Brent Oleson, who endorsed O'Rourke in June. "On the ground, I see a lot of activity."
In the hours before O'Rourke's dropout announcement, there was no indication in downtown Des Moines that his campaign was on its deathbed ahead of the state party dinner, the biggest event on the political calendar this fall in the Hawkeye State. In addition to the traditional sign wars, which began before sunrise, his staffers had adorned a waterfront park with elaborate decorations for a pre-dinner rally.
Supporters were already gathering for the rally when The New York Times broke the news around 4:30 p.m. that he was dropping out, and moments later he made the announcement himself on social media. The mood quickly turned gloomy at the rally as supporters waited in drizzly weather for O'Rourke — and other campaign's backers happily paraded by on their way to the dinner. Finally, O'Rourke arrived in a minivan, his vehicle of choice as he had crisscrossed the country for months.
After his remarks, O'Rourke spent a long time receiving supporters, some fighting back tears, hugging them and reassuring them he will continue to fight for the issues that animated his campaign. When he finally headed out of the park under nightfall, O'Rourke was uncharacteristically muted as reporters peppered him with questions. He allowed just a few answers, urging supporters to work as hard as possible for the eventual nominee, saying he is focused for now on spending more time with family and friends, and thanking journalists for their work covering the race.
Then, he got into the minivan and was gone.

Texto completo: Readers speculate why President Trump has decided to make Florida his primary residence. Also: The president's Washington hotel for sale; don't shame travelers who fly.
To the Editor:
Re "Trump Makes Florida Resort His New Home" (front page, Nov. 1):
As a native Floridian whose family has been here since 1872, I am deeply saddened that my state is getting one more fast-buck real estate film-flam man, Donald Trump, as a resident.
It's no wonder that Mr. Trump is moving to Florida as it is a tax haven for wealthy retirees. Florida's lack of a state income tax and estate tax has deprived the state of much-needed revenue. Florida has consistently underfunded its public education system and its decaying infrastructure.
Palm Beach County, where Mr. Trump will reside, is a Democratic county. At least Mr. Trump won't have to suffer the hoi polloi demonstrating outside his residence as he will be completely walled off from them.

To the Editor:
The main reason for Donald Trump to change his residence to Florida could be to protect his valuable property, the Mar-a-Lago Club, by filing a homestead exemption form in Palm Beach County. That shields a primary residence from current and future creditors if he files for bankruptcy. Always good to have a plan!

For Sale: A Trump Hotel
To the Editor:
Re "Trumps Put Their Washington Hotel on Market" (front page, Oct. 26):
The news that President Trump (or his wholly owned organization) has offered the Trump International Hotel in Washington for sale seems a tacit admission of his precarious legal position, yet it will not absolve him of corruption and constitutional violations before the sale.
But that's hardly the end of the story. The offer itself creates new opportunities for corruption.
The price of a property is determined by bargaining between buyer and seller. A potential buyer who believes that Mr. Trump will remain in office for five more years, or who wants a more immediate "favor," may well offer a greatly inflated price for the property, just as Russian oligarchs allegedly did with Mr. Trump in the past.

To the Editor:
By putting the Trump International Hotel in Washington on the market while he is still in the White House, President Trump will avoid losing money because if he waits any longer and gets impeached (and perhaps removed from office) or surely not re-elected, the hotel will become a negative asset without all the politicians, diplomats and foreign government officials who stay there just to please and enrich this president.
I consider "hotel for sale" an indicator that Mr. Trump knows that his time is up. And that is a very good sign for our country, indeed.

Not Guilty About Flying
To the Editor:
I was dumbfounded by the article asking "Should Flying Make You Feel Guilty?" (Business Day, Oct. 22).
I guess I would feel guilty if I didn't have to fly for work (more than 30 flights a year), or if there were an alternative (trains). My company takes advantage of electronic meetings as often as we can, but for a two-day conference or training session, there is no substitute for being there.
I would be thrilled if I could avoid flying to Chicago, Detroit, Minneapolis, Kansas City or Dallas. But there is no other practical way to get to those destinations. Train service is limited or nonexistent.
Imagine the carbon emissions generated by the hourly air shuttles between Washington and New York, where train service is relatively frequent but abysmal. And imagine the reduced airport congestion if we eliminated flights of less than 500 miles.
Instead of shaming passengers who would rather not fly in the first place, how about shaming Congress for failing to develop a national transit strategy that includes high-speed rail?

Texto completo: After a lifelong residency in New York City, President Donald Trump is officially trading in the skyscrapers of the Big Apple for the palm trees of the Sunshine State.
The New York Times reported Thursday that Trump and First Lady Melania Trump filed separate “declarations of domicile” in Florida last month, a legal move that shifts his residency from Manhattan to his Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach.
Trump confirmed the move in a series of tweets Thursday night.
“I hated having to make this decision, but in the end it will be best for all concerned,” Trump tweeted. “As President, I will always be there to help New York and the great people of New York. It will always have a special place in my heart!”
According to NBC News, Trump has spent 99 days at his Mar-a-Lago club and golf course compared with 20 days at Trump Tower since he took office. But what prompted the official change in residency?
Why would Trump move to Florida?
Trump and his administration haven’t confirmed why the Queens native decided to officially declare his “Southern White House” as home, but many have speculated that politics and money play a large part.
Trump criticized his political opponents in his “Farewell, New York” tweet Thursday suggesting his decision may have had to do with his treatment by political leaders in the city and state.
“Despite the fact that I pay millions of dollars in city, state and local taxes each year,” he tweeted. “I have been treated very badly by the political leaders of both the city and state. Few have been treated worse. ”
New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo didn’t seem to mind Trump’s move to Florida and instead responded with a “good riddance. ”
“It’s not like Mr. Trump paid taxes here anyway,” Cuomo said in his statement. “He’s all yours, Florida. ”
Trump’s contributions to the state and city can’t be confirmed as he has refused to release his tax returns.
However, moving to Florida could be a huge tax saver. The president and first lady would be escaping an 8. 2% state tax rate and a 3. 87% city tax rate on income over $90,000, according to Joseph Callahan, attorney and president of Mackay, Caswell & Callahan, P. C. in New York.
In order to avoid income tax, the Trumps can’t be in the state of New York for more than 183 days. However, the state can still tax some Trump dollars, Callahan explained, as part of his income tax could come from capital gains through the sale of real estate and, of course, property taxes on his New York properties.
Trump would also be escaping New York state’s estate taxes, which would be a maximum of 16% on an estate worth over $10. 1 million with an exclusion amount of $5 million. Florida doesn’t have income or estate taxes.
"It’s an absolute no-brainer," Callahan said on the president's decision to move. "It's excellent as a tax-saving decision. "
'Good riddance': Gov. Andrew Cuomo's response to Donald Trump moving from New York to Florida
Where does Trump live?
The move means Trump’s permanent residence will no longer be Trump Tower, the Manhattan building that he has long called home.
However, he will still be residing in the White House for the next year with weekend trips to his new, official residence in Mar-a-Lago.
What’s a 'declaration of domicile'?
According to the Palm Beach County Clerk, a declaration of domicile is a sworn statement that basically says an individual is a resident of that state and county. That individual is stating they reside in and maintain a place of residence there and intend to make it a permanent residence.
Not every state requires you to file a declaration of domicile to make your residency official. The states that do require it often don't have state taxes, such as Florida and Texas.
How much?: Trump’s Mar-a-Lago visits cost Coast Guard nearly $20M
Why did President Trump and First Lady Melania Trump file separately?
A married couple cannot file a declaration of domicile jointly like they can file tax returns.
Copies of the president and first lady’s declarations of domicile show that they must file individually.
However, according to paperwork published by the Times, they both declared primary residence at the same address in Mar-a-Lago.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump is expected to return to Manhattan over the weekend to attend a UFC mixed martial arts match, but the lifelong New Yorker may not be calling the Big Apple his home for much longer.
His trip comes as documents obtained by the New York Times indicate the president recently filed paperwork declaring Palm Beach, Florida, his new permanent residence.
And on Thursday evening, Trump confirmed the Times report in a series of tweets saying New York "will always have a special place in my heart" while acknowledging his rocky relationship with the city and state's Democratic leaders.
"I cherish New York, and the people of New York, and always will, but unfortunately, despite the fact that I pay millions of dollars in city, state and local taxes each year, I have been treated very badly by the political leaders of both the city and state. Few have been treated worse," Trump tweeted. "I hated having to make this decision, but in the end it will be best for all concerned. As President, I will always be there to help New York and the great people of New York. It will always have a special place in my heart!"
Last month Trump and his wife, Melania, quietly filed a "declaration of domicile" with the Palm Beach County Clerk's Office declaring his Mar-a-Lago estate his primary residence, while listing his Trump Tower address as his former primary residence, according to documents obtained by the New York Times that were published Thursday night.
"I formerly resided at 721 Fifth Avenue," the document states, referring to Trump's namesake skyscraper in midtown Manhattan that served as his residence, corporate headquarters and the launching pad for his 2016 presidential campaign.
White House officials declined to comment on why Trump, who has long branded himself as a master New York City developer, decided to make the change, but a source close to the president told the Times the move was likely an effort to reduce Trump's tax bill.
The move could also benefit Trump's heirs in the long run by escaping New York's 16 percent estate tax rate for estates larger than $10.1 million according to the Times.
Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, issued a statement shortly after the Times piece published, saying: "Good riddance."
"It's not like Mr. Trump paid taxes here anyway," Cuomo wrote referring to previous reporting by the Times last year that indicated Trump and his family had a long history of filing tax returns with valuations for their properties that were far below their worth, allowing them to pay millions less in taxes.
"He's all yours, Florida," said Cuomo.
Trump is slated to attend the latest Ultimate Fighting Championship bout at Madison Square Garden before spending the night at Trump Tower, according to a source familiar with the planning.
The president's visit will come amid already heightened security and street closures for Sunday's New York City Marathon. It's unclear if the president will return to the White House before the 8:30 a.m. start of the marathon.
The White House has not officially disclosed details of the trip, as is customary due to security concerns, but a Federal Aviation Administration advisory released in advance of the president's Air Force One travel notes that pilots in the area "can expect airspace restrictions" on Saturday and Sunday. The NYPD did not respond to inquiries about security in anticipation of Trump's trip.
UFC president Dana White is an avid Trump supporter, having praised Trump during a prime-time speech during the 2016 Republican National Convention.
"I've been in the fight business my whole life," White said during his July 2016 speech. "I know fighters ... Donald Trump is a fighter and I know he will fight for this country."
UFC spokesman Chris Costello did not respond to an email seeking comment about Trump's attendance at the match between fighters Jorge Masvidal and Nate Diaz.
Masvidal, asked about Trump's possible appearance at the match, told celebrity website TMZ he was "of course" honored by the prospect.
"No matter what your political views on him, not every fighter can say, 'hey, the president is showing up to my fight,'" Masvidal told TMZ in a video posted to its website.
Trump's expected appearance at the sporting event, first reported by the New York Times, comes nearly a week after he was met with jeers and chants of "lock him up" while attending Game 5 of the World Series between the Washington Nationals and Houston Astros.
Washington, D.C., officials have announced plans for a championship parade to honor the Nationals on Saturday.

‘The Social Network’ Screenwriter Bashes Mark Zuckerberg’s Free Speech Double Standard

Texto completo: Mark Zuckerberg’s latest update on Facebook’s content policies regarding political ads (which is none) has not only inspired actions from his fellow social media chief, Jack Dorsey, who announced on Wednesday that Twitter would ban all political ads, but has also drawn ire from one of his old enemies, Aaron Sorkin, the screenwriter behind the 2010 film The Social Network, a biographical drama about Zuckerberg’s founding of Facebook.
In an open letter to the Facebook CEO published by The New York Times on Thursday, Sorkin drew comparisons between Zuckerberg’s recent public addresses advocating for free speech and Facebook’s drastically different treatment of his screenplay a decade ago.
SEE ALSO: How an Eloquent Congressman Stunned Mark Zuckerberg Speechless
“I didn’t push back on your public accusation that the movie was a lie because I’d had my say in the theaters, but you and I both know that the screenplay was vetted to within an inch of its life by a team of studio lawyers with one client and one goal: Don’t get sued by Mark Zuckerberg,” Sorkin wrote. “It was hard not to feel the irony while I was reading excerpts from your recent speech at Georgetown University, in which you defended—on free speech grounds—Facebook’s practice of posting demonstrably false ads from political candidates.”
Sorkin, who’s known for writing TV series and movies focused on political and media themes, including The West Wing and The Newsroom , took issue with several political ads with outright false information about 2020 presidential candidates currently circulating on Facebook and warned Zuckerberg that not fact checking these ads is not “defending free speech,” but “assaulting truth.”
“Right now, on your website, is an ad claiming that Joe Biden gave the Ukrainian attorney general a billion dollars not to investigate his son,” he wrote. “Every square inch of that is a lie and it’s under your logo.”
Back to the topic of The Social Network , Sorkin vividly recalled how Facebook’s management team pushed him to revise his screenplay to the last minute and how offended Zuckerberg’s right-hand woman Sheryl Sandberg was after seeing the final product for the first time. Toward the end of his letter, Sorkin wrote:
Even after the screenplay for ‘The Social Network’ satisfied the standards of Sony’s legal department, we sent the script—as promised over a handshake—to a group of senior lieutenants at your company and invited them to give notes. (I was asked if I would change the name of Harvard University to something else and if Facebook had to be called Facebook.)
After we’d shot the movie, we arranged a private screening of an early cut for your chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg. Ms. Sandberg stood up in the middle of the screening, turned to the producers who were standing in the back of the room, and said, “How can you do this to a kid?” (You were 27 years old at the time, but all right, I get it.)
I hope your COO walks into your office, leans in (as she suggested we do in her best selling book), and says, “How can we do this to tens of millions of kids? Are we really going to run an ad that claims Kamala Harris ran dog fights out of the basement of a pizza place while Elizabeth Warren destroyed evidence that climate change is a hoax and the deep state sold meth to Rashida Tlaib and Colin Kaepernick?”
The point is, these unpleasant memories wouldn’t even exist, if Zuckerberg had believed so strongly in free expression all along, like he recently claimed.
“Now you tell me. If I’d known you felt that way, I’d have had the Winklevoss twins invent Facebook,” the writer concluded.

Attention GOP: The media will hate you no matter where you stand on impeachment so you might as well defend Trump

Texto completo: What every single Republican in Congress needs to understand and prepare for is that no matter what the articles of impeachment that Democrats draw up look like, the national media are going to declare it “a devastating case against President Trump.”
They could be drawn on a napkin in pink jelly pen with little hearts as dots for the i’s and yet still, CNN and the New York Times will blare headlines that the Democrats’ case provides “A Damning Account” of the president’s misdeeds.
If Republicans can get over that in advance, it will make defending the head of their party — who maintains hardened support among their own voters — a lot easier.
The default position of all elected Republicans tends to be on their knees, begging the media not to say mean things about them. This is not a time for that. They must be prepared to have a lot of mean things said if they put up any sort of fight against Democrats’ effort to impeach the president.
Look at what happened with the Robert Mueller report. It concluded that there had been no conspiracy between the Trump 2016 campaign and the Russian government, and it declined to state one way or another whether the president had obstructed justice (a snooty way of admitting the case, if pursued, would have been extraordinarily weak). But any Republican in Congress who states those facts is asked over and over by an indignant media, Why won’t you stand up to Trump?
Look at what happened with Brett Kavanaugh. The allegations he faced — from a woman who can’t remember anything except that he tried to rape her 30 years ago — were over-the-top ridiculous. Yet all the media could do was point out, over and over again, that Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee couldn’t possibly administer a fair hearing, being “old white men.”
The inevitable impeachment articles will look very scary — “quid pro quo,” “abuse of power,” “obstruction” — and the media are sitting by, eager to call any Republican who disputes them cowards.
That’s not fair, but who cares? This entire impeachment gag has been unfair. Republicans have a job to do, and it’s to defend the president. That job will be less difficult if they can accept now that the media won’t like them until they’re out of power.

Texto completo: Learning is about more than school. For one thing, its starts sooner. The evidence is in: when we read to babies they begin to read sooner, and better. When children see books and readers around, they’re interested, especially if the readers are enjoying themselves. When children talk more, with adults and with each other, they build bigger vocabularies, not to mention social skills.
This isn’t just about parents. Uncles and aunts, friends and neighbors help; famously, so do grandparents. Organizations can play a big part. All our local libraries care about children’s reading; they offer books, story-telling sessions, etc. If your local library is small, with limited hours, it can only do so much. Consider joining (for very little money) a bigger library like Norway Memorial, with its spacious, welcoming children’s room, dedicated staff, summer programs, junior graphic novels, board books for the very young, a parenting collection…
Mahoosuc Kids offers out of school programs focusing on STEM (science, technology, engineering, maths), visual and performing arts, and international cultures. The Bethel Historical Society’s summer Mornings at the Museum offers hands-on activities for kids aged 5-10. Other towns and villages do their versions.
Families can learn together. Children’s museums are fun for all, and they fill gaps in adults’ knowledge, too. Adult museums can be fun for kids: keep in mind attention spans, bathroom breaks, etc. A trip to anyplace is a learning experience; make the most of it. (Try Quebec city for a whole new, but very old and very different lesson, pretty close to home.)
Early schooling also works. A file of day care kids marching to the Bethel library every week is a good sign. Scientists say that pre-kindergarten benefits all recipients; Portland’s school superintendent calls it “an investment in our students…”. Later schooling works too. When a parent takes a course, long or short, children notice.
Another thought, not mine but Pamela Paul’s, writing in The New York Times on first September, 2019 (incidentally, the Sunday New York Times for Kids, marked “This section should not be read by grown-ups, is a great read): “Really want your child to hunker down and read one book in particular? Tell her she can’t. She’s not ready yet. That it’s too old for her, too difficult, too dark and entirely inappropriate for children. Put it up on a high shelf and walk away. You may never see it again.”

Texto completo: "It was a shock at first, but maybe we should not have been surprised."
Ken Rosenberg
Applied conservation scientist, Cornell University
When a team of Cornell University researchers and others published a bird study in the online journal Science on Sept. 19, they didn't expect the worldwide reaction that followed.
The findings: North America has lost 2.9 billion birds in the past 50 years — 29% of the avian population.
The impact: An ecosystem is losing a key component and it's a sign of a quickly changing environment that will affect other wildlife, plants and more.
The spotlight: Once the study was released, the New York Times picked up the story and highlighted a startling statement from David Yarnold, president and chief executive of the National Audubon Society, who called the findings "a full-blown crisis." Other major media outlets picked up the story, and conservationists around the world were shocked and inspired to take action.
"The reaction to the study has been phenomenal. We were hoping for a big response," said Ken Rosenberg, an applied conservation scientist at Cornell, the study's lead author and a leader of research and planning on joint initiatives by the Cornell Lab of Ornithology Lab and the American Bird Conservancy.
"We expected some response, but this is the biggest thing we've seen for a bird paper. It was amazing to see the findings on the front page of the New York Times and the Washington Post. All of networks talking birds for one day was so great. The trick now is how to keep the interest and keep the momentum going so it is not a headline that disappears."
From Ithaca and beyond To publish the study, the team of scientists tracked birds for decades, and parts of the study came from Ithaca's backyards and skies, as countless passionate non-professional bird-watchers submitted their observations to databases and helped carry out studies of bird populations every year.
Some of the most fascinating parts of the study came from weather radar maps as the researches found some types of birds were declining in population, but others, such as waterfowl and raptors, were increasing in numbers.
"It was quite overwhelming," said Adriaan Dokter, a research associate at Cornell. "It reached Europe, too. It went all over the world. It was more than what we expected."
Dokter noted he and Rosenberg were interviewed by Australian, Dutch and Spanish media.
"People see this trend not just here, but in Europe," Dokter said. "It's not just a local U.S. phenomenon, but a trend all over the world."
To Dokter, the confirmation of the population decrease across hundreds of bird species is like a canary in a coal mine.
"It's a decrease in the vitality of the ecosystem that we see. Birds depend on insects. Insects are important to the ecosystem of plants," he said. "It means something fundamental in our environment ... It's a warning sign that we have to be careful. Things are rapidly changing."
How scientists researched the decline in birds Surveying: Scientists and amateurs observed birds to complete censuses.
Weather radar: Scientists examined weather radar maps to determine the cumulative weight of birds in the sky.
Research: Researchers examined hundreds of different surveys.
Analysis: After finding the best data from the surveys, scientists conducted statistical analyses to determine how much populations have decreased.
The team at Cornell partnered with the American Bird Conservancy, National Audubon Society, Bird Conservancy of the Rockies, Canadian Wildlife Service, the Georgetown University Georgetown Environment Initiative, United States Geological Survey and the Smithsonian National Zoological Park Conservation Biology Institute.
"'Were there declines or shifts?'" Rosenberg said about the questions researchers had years ago. "Someone never did this comprehensive work."
Researchers then obtained answers they were searching for — there's been an overall decline in the bird population, and the largest declines have been in the most common species.
"It was a shock at first, but maybe we should not have been surprised," Rosenberg said.
Using weather radar, Dokter was able to pick up the cumulative weights of birds migrating, which he later analyzed. The birds he researched tended to be long-distance migratory birds, which contribute more to the bio-life on radar maps.
"The U.S. has a very large network of radars that cover ... anything in the sky — not just weather, but also wildlife," Dokter said. "Birds give strong signals. More and more have realized this, and it's an important data source for biologists. If you look at it on your iPhone, you don't see the individual bird, but a blob of bio-life moving. That's what is used for birds.
"We don't see the numbers, but the kilograms of birds in the skies. What we did see recently is the amount of migration that has changed. It's a nice complement to what's seen on ground. Radar gives really good coverage. With radar, we can count many more birds than what we could count on the ground."
Bird biomass in the skies has decreased by about 14% since 2007, Dokter told the Cornell Chronicle, Cornell University's in-house publication.
"The decline in night skies might be steeper than what we see on the ground. It's migratory birds, especially birds that travel long distance ... they seem to be not doing too well," Dokter said. "It's what I want to document next, and the why and what we can do to turn it around. Where do they face the most problems and challenges?"
Outside of weather radar data, scientists looked through more than 500 surveys, Rosenberg said. They then used a statistical model to analyze the data.
Locals get involved in tracking bird population The primary data source was the North American Breeding Bird Survey, which started in 1966 as a collaboration between scientists and bird-watchers.
While there have been studies on the changes of bird populations on the continent, the most recent study was the first time anyone has ever collected and analyzed 50 years' worth of data and findings in North America.
For decades, countless passionate non-professional bird-watchers have submitted their observations to databases. In the new research, professionals examined those studies to estimate the populations of 529 species from 2006 to 2015.
"The study published in Science was shocking to me, with its report of just how deeply bird populations have crashed since 1970," said Diane Morton, president of the Cayuga Bird Club. "The paper let us know that it is not just our subjective impression that there are fewer birds now, but that hundreds of different bird species really are much, much less abundant than they used to be.
"Among other alarming declines, the authors reported that forest birds like warblers, and grassland species like meadowlarks and sparrows, now number hundreds of millions fewer than in the 1970s."
The Cayuga Bird Club's annual Christmas Bird Count contributed to the findings. In addition, the club also counts birds for the New York State Breeding Bird Atlas.
"It was rewarding for those of us who participate in the annual Christmas Bird Count to know that the numbers we gather in our bird counts year after year were useful for these analyses," Morton said. "We did not provide any direct input, but our participation in citizen science projects generated some of the data that this extensive study used."
Surveys by Rosenberg and other local scientists contributed as well.
"The birders are the eyes of the world," he said. "You need to have all the eyes and ears out there because scientists can't do it alone. But it's not just the observation of amateurs. It's data collected for the purpose of the survey."
Birds that have seen the largest decrease The research shows most of the birds lost belong to 12 families, including warblers, finches, sparrows and swallows.
Birds associated with farmlands have seen the largest decline in numbers and percentage.
"Some birds in our backyards are the steepest in decline that we see," Dokter said. "Hopefully, it will lead to action take care of nature."
Out of all of the bird families, the largest decline was among larks. There are 70 million fewer Eastern meadowlarks, 60 million fewer Western meadowlarks, and a 67% decline for all larks.
"We're seeing this loss of abundance, because birds are integral parts of ecosystems. They perform ecological functions like seed dispersal," Rosenberg said. "The loss of this chunk of birds is causing ecological consequences. Because we have this data on birds, the fear that is happening with birds is happening across the board with other animals."
What's being done for North American birds The National Audubon Society has responded strongly to the report and is mobilizing its 1.65 million members to urge lawmakers to act on bird conservation.
The organization is pushing for the passing of the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative Act and implementation of the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan. Both plans focus on providing an optimal environment and water for birds in the regions.
The group also wants lawmakers to defend and reinforce the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, which the Trump administration has been trying to weaken. Conservationists say the Migratory Bird Treaty Act protects close to 1,000 species of North American birds and is the most import bird conservation law in the U.S.
How you can help the birds Individuals can take a variety of actions to help, including making windows safer, reducing plastic use, keeping cats indoors, using native plants and avoiding the use of pesticides. To learn more, visit 3billionbirds.org/.
What's next for the bird population The Cayuga Bird Club will census birds for the next New York Breeding Bird Atlas, which will have five years of surveys starting from January 2020.
"The Science paper is a call to action," Morton said. "It has sparked more urgent discussion about how to address the decline of bird populations — through conservation management, changing the developed landscape to provide better habitat for birds, and taking individual steps to reduce the threats that birds face. Continued monitoring of bird populations will also be important for prioritizing conservation efforts."
Because the study did not state the reasons for the decrease in bird populations, Rosenberg said he and the researchers are assembling a group of experts early next year to investigate the causes of the declines.
"The most important thing is that this doesn't become a news flash," Rosenberg said "We want people to pay attention and to track birds.
"People who love birds have to speak up. ... We won't reverse the declines unless people who love birds demand action."

Texto completo: Every now and then, a personality comes along to remind you that life really is like the movies and not the other way around. The movie producer Robert Evans was one. He died the other day at 89, but I'm sometimes not certain he existed on our actual, molecular, physical plane. He seemed too good a story to have happened in fact, if only because the stories he told about himself were so fabulous in all senses of the word.
Like all long careers in Hollywood, Evans's was a roller-coaster ride of triumphs and ignominy. Without him as producer and/or studio head, we wouldn't have “The Godfather" (1972) and “The Godfather: Part II" (1974), “Chinatown" (1974) and “Rosemary's Baby" (1968), “Love Story" (1970) and “The Odd Couple" (1968) and “True Grit" (1969). It goes on: “Harold and Maude" (1971) and “Serpico" (1973) and “The Conversation" (1974) and “Marathon Man" (1976) and “Urban Cowboy" (1980). Sometimes it seems as if all the movies worth talking about in the Me Decade trace their genesis or development to him.
But there's also the sense that Robert Evans was his own most glittering production. As the 36-year-old “boy genius" who in five years transformed Paramount Pictures from Hollywood's least-profitable studio to its most-, Evans was an anomaly: a larger-than-life movie executive just as the breed was dying out. The film industry in the late 1960s was a business in flux, with faceless conglomerates buying up the legendary film factories. Yet when Gulf+Western acquired Paramount Pictures, in 1966, CEO Charles Bluhdorn picked Evans to run the show, based primarily on a laudatory New York Times article by journalist Peter Bart. (Evans returned the favor by making Bart one of his first hires.)
The man had a talent for getting noticed. Born Robert Shapera in 1930 to a New York City dentist and his wife, Evans had his eye on the spotlight early on, initially as an actor. When that initially didn't pan out, he joined his brother's clothing company, Evan-Picone. (“I was in women's pants," the producer would later growl with the hubba-hubba terseness that became a trademark.) On a mid-1950s business trip out West, he was spotted poolside by Norma Shearer, an aging queen of MGM, who thought he might play her late husband, the original Hollywood boy genius, Irving Thalberg, in an upcoming film. That's the legend, anyway, as is the anecdote that gave Evans the title of his 1994 autobiography and a subsequent 2002 documentary.
Cast to play the lead in 20th Century Fox's 1957 production of “The Sun Also Rises," Evans found himself opposed by author Ernest Hemingway, costar Ava Gardner, and almost everyone down to the key grip. But Fox head Darryl F. Zanuck watched Evans film a bullfight sequence from a seat in the arena, stood up, and bellowed, “The kid stays in the picture!" And so he did. That's the legend, anyway.
Soon enough, the kid figured he was no actor and that the real money was in what Zanuck was doing. The moguls of the Golden Age had left the building by then; Louis B. Mayer of MGM, Jack Warner of Warner Bros., independent mavericks like Samuel Goldwyn and David O. Selznick, whose lives and sayings sometimes got more press than their pictures. When Evans was tapped to run Paramount, it was a roll of the dice by his new boss Bluhdorn but also a way of keeping faith with the kind of executive Hollywood knew best: an outsize figure who loved the movies as much, if not occasionally more, than the bottom line.
How many studio executives marry a gorgeous movie star? Well, most of them. How many get publicly dumped when that wife runs away with her costar, as Ali MacGraw did with Steve McQueen on the set of “The Getaway" (1972)? She was the only wife Evans mentions in “The Kid Stays in the Picture," but there were six other marriages, none of which lasted more than three years. One marriage, to actress Catherine Oxenberg, in 1998, lasted nine days. In the film version of “Kid," a section is given over to an orgiastic montage of the women in Robert Evans's life in which their glamorous faces eventually become a blur next to his taut, ageless, eternally suntanned grin. God knows what the #MeToo movement would have done with him (or his close friendships with Roman Polanski and other very bad boys of 1970s Hollywood), but he probably would have survived, as he survived everything.
He survived a raging cocaine addiction, which sent his brother and an associate to prison and saw Evans sentenced to producing an all-star (and now hilariously unwatchable) anti-drug special. He survived being linked to the 1983 murder of Roy Radin, a co-producer with Evans on “The Cotton Club." (Radin's coke dealer, Karen Greenberger, and three others were ultimately convicted of the crime.) He survived battles with filmmakers on movie sets and every so often in court, with Francis Ford Coppola earning a status as Best Frenemy on the many projects they worked on together. Coppola accused the producer of meddling above and beyond the call of duty during “The Godfather" shoot, but Evans's defenders claim his input turned a brilliant mess into a classic for the ages.
Evans also survived a 1998 stroke to write his memoirs (a second volume, "The Fat Lady Sings," was published in 2013) and stage a comeback as a grizzled mentor to a new generation of Hollywood wiseguys. A year before the stroke, he had already been immortalized by Dustin Hoffman's swaggeringly Evans-esque producer in the political satire “Wag the Dog." And to watch the documentary version of “The Kid Stays in the Picture," or to listen to the audiobook from which the film takes its voice-over narration, is to hear Robert Evans build and burnish his own myth, that of the ultimate Tinseltown insider/outsider/king/victim, loved by the ladies and tossed about by fate. He leaves behind some great, great movies, and an awful lot of good ones, even if Francis Ford Coppola is getting the last laugh this fall with a director's cut of “The Cotton Club" that's making the rounds.
Above all, Evans leaves behind a promise he extended during the New Hollywood era and that has seemed tantalizingly within reach ever since — that with hustle and luck and confidence and charm, you can make a lot of money and good art while having the time of your life.
That's the legend, anyway. If anyone knew it was all in the telling, it was Robert Evans.

Texto completo: A Superior Court judge sided with Governor Charlie Baker Wednesday when he denied a motion by vape store owners to block the administration from enforcing its emergency regulation banning the sale of nicotine vaping products.
In his ruling, Judge Douglas Wilkins also revealed that the administration is planning a Nov. 22 public hearing on the ban and will file a statement outlining the estimated impact on small business owners on Nov. 1.
“The CDC has issued a clear warning stating that the outbreak of these vaping-associated lung illnesses and deaths cannot at this time be attributed to a single substance or product and has urged consumers to stop vaping, as medical experts continue to research what is making people sick," spokeswoman Anisha Chakrabarti said in a statement.
The ruling came the same day that the state announced the second vaping-related death in Massachusetts of a woman in her 40s who had reported vaping nicotine.

Texto completo: A poll of Florida voters shows a majority oppose impeaching President Donald Trump and removing him from office.
The poll, released Wednesday, shows 53% of Florida voters oppose impeaching and removing Trump, with 42% supporting.
The New York Times Upshot/Siena College poll also found 49% of Florida voters support the impeachment inquiry being conducted by the House of Representatives, with 44% opposing the inquiry.
The results were released a day before the House is set to vote on procedures for public hearings, which are the next step in the impeachment inquiry.
The poll was conducted from Oct. 13-26 - before Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman told investigators on Tuesday that the White House summary of a call between Trump and the Ukranian president left out key information.
Poll results by group
Gender: Women are more supportive of impeachment and removal than men. Among men, it's 38% in support and 57% opposed. Among women, 46% to 48%.
Race: Majorities of black and Hispanic voters support impeachment and removal. White voters are opposed. Among whites, 32% in support and 63% opposed. Among black voters, 67% are in support and 15% opposed. Among Hispanics, the split is 53% to 42%.
Age: There's relatively little difference based on age. The youngest voters, age 18 to 29, split 48% in support and 49% opposed. Voters 65 and older split 46% to 51%.
Political party: The biggest difference, not surprisingly, is shown in people of different political parties. Democrats support impeachment and removal 85% to 11%. Republicans are the opposite, with 8% in support and 88% opposed. Independent voters lean against it, with 35% supporting and 59% opposed.
Trump's Florida
The New York Time Upshot/Siena College Poll is part of its battleground series of surveys that look at voter attitudes in key states likely to decide the outcome of next year's presidential election: Arizona, Florida, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.
Florida stands out in greater support for the president and opposition to acting against him than in the six states as a whole.
Among all six battleground states, 44% support and 52% oppose impeaching and removing Trump. Florida's 42% support is tied with Michigan for the lowest level of support. Florida's 53% opposition is tied for North Carolina at the highest opposition.
The House impeachment inquiry is supported by 51% of voters in the battleground states and opposed by 44%.
Florida's 49% support is lowest of the six states. Florida's opposition to the inquiry matches most of the states at 44%.
Paying attention
The poll found that 75% of Florida voters are following the discussion about Trump, Ukraine and impeachment very or somewhat closely. Another 23% weren't following it closely or weren't following it at all.
Trump's dealings with the Ukrainian president, and whether the president withheld military aid in an attempt to get the Ukrainians to come up with dirt on presidential candidate Joe Biden are a central element of the impeachment inquiry.
Floridians are split about whether Trump's comments and actions related to Ukraine and investigating Biden are business as usual or something different: 42% said it's typical of what politicians do and 44% said much worse than that of typical politicians, and 14% didn't know or didn't answer the question.
The fine print
The polls were conducted in English and Spanish. Pollsters interviewed 650 Florida voters, who were contacted by landline and cellphones. The survey has a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points. The margin of error for smaller groups, such as men and women or white, black and Hispanic voters, is larger.
The most recent pollster ratings from FiveThirtyEight.com give Siena College an A for its data gathering and accuracy. On Twitter, FiveThirtyEight reported that the next pollster ratings, due out shortly, rate the New York Times Upshot/Sienna poll as best in the country.

NBC News Digital forms a union, says network 'mishandled' sexual misconduct allegations

Texto completo: NBC News digital staffers announced the formation of a union Wednesday and accused the network of mishandling multiple allegations of sexual conduct dating back years in their first statement.
Network executives Noah Oppenheim and Andy Lack were accused of squashing Ronan Farrow's reporting on Harvey Weinstein's sexual harassment and sexual assault allegations in his new book, Catch and Kill, and Farrow accused the executives of fumbling the allegations against former Today host Matt Lauer.
The staff has chosen representatives from the NewsGuild of New York, which also represents employees at the New York Times, the New Yorker, according to the New York Times.
"Our mission is to uphold the legacy of NBC News while empowering and protecting those who will build its future," the workers' statement reads. "No organization is perfect, and there are serious issues that keep the company from being as great as it can be. A company with such incredible resources can and should do more to close gender and race wage gaps, address chronic understaffing, meaningfully prioritize diversity, promote transparency, and offer job protections."

They also addressed the allegations that the network mishandled those accusations of sexual misconduct.
"NBC News has mishandled serious incidents of sexual misconduct and racism without the transparency and sensitivity such issues require," it went on. "Recent weeks have highlighted serious questions as to how NBC News has handled incidents of sexual misconduct in the workplace as well as the opaque processes and procedures for reporting on and exposing powerful predators. NBC News repeatedly refused calls for an independent review on both counts despite numerous such requests from staff."
Two of the network's most popular anchors Rachel Maddow and Chris Hayes, have spoken out against their employer during their respective shows. In both cases, they called for an outside investigation of how those matters were handled.

REFLECTING ON WRENCHING, DEFINING IMAGES OF OUR TIMES; PAUL FANLUND

Texto completo: It was Nov. 24, 1963, and I had finagled my way out of attending Sunday school. I was home alone, a little kid mesmerized by television coverage of the aftermath of the Kennedy assassination.
I was watching live as Jack Ruby murdered Lee Harvey Oswald amid all those Texas police officers in their cowboy hats. I ran around the house, frantically, with no one to tell.
A Dallas Times Herald photographer captured the precise moment the bullet struck Oswald in what became one of the most famous images of the 20th century. It won a Pulitzer Prize in 1964.
That picture was among 80 Pulitzer-winning images in an exhibit I visited recently at the Missouri History Museum in St. Louis. (Developed by the Newseum in Washington, D.C., the exhibit runs until Jan. 20.) Perhaps the exhibit's only more famous image showed U.S. Marines raising the American flag on Iwo Jima during World War II. Another deeply iconic photo showed a tiny, screaming Vietnamese girl, her clothes burned away by napalm an image that came to symbolize the horror of the Vietnam War.
Taken as a group, the photos, while brilliant, were deeply unsettling, so much so that parents were warned by a sign outside the exhibit that some material might be too intense for young children.
The photos were intense all right, and not just for young children.
Four involved moment-of-death images, including two firing squads. Most famous of those was a South Vietnamese police official executing a man said to be a Viet Cong officer. He shot him in the head at point-blank range, an image that shocked American audiences in 1968.
Most haunting of all was a 1993 photo of a small, starving girl lying in a fetal position in Sudan, stalked by a nearby vulture. The New York Times photographer who took it, haunted by such memories, later committed suicide.
What struck me, and stuck with me after viewing the exhibit, was the raw violence on display. Back in Madison, I sorted the 80 images by my own themes: depictions of violence, heroism, humanity, and perseverance.
Sadly, far outnumbering the other groups was my "violence" category 30 in all.
And, as you might expect, a recurrent theme in the photographs was our nation's sordid record on race, a civil rights history with renewed resonance in this era of Donald Trump.
One was titled "Racial attack on the football field." It depicted how Drake University running back Johnny Bright, then one of college football's best players, was targeted for injury by the all-white Oklahoma A& M Aggies in 1951. Bright was knocked unconscious in what the New York Times called "one of the ugliest racial incidents in college sports history."
(Bob Spiegel, then a reporter for the Des Moines Register, wrote a story in which the Oklahoma coaches were overheard talking about "getting the n??-." Spiegel later became editor of the Wisconsin State Journal and hired me to come to Madison.) Another image showed the 1966 shooting of James Meredith, who four years earlier had been the first black student at the University of Mississippi. He was ambushed by a sniper on a "march against fear," struck in the back and head. He is shown crawling across a highway. Meredith survived.
Then there was a heartbreaking photo by an Ebony magazine photographer at the 1968 funeral of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. in Atlanta. The photographer, positioned across the aisle from widow Coretta Scott King, caught King's 5-year-old daughter, Bernice, head in her mother's lap, seeming to look right at the lens.
Another picture reflected tensions around school busing in Louisville, Kentucky, in 1975. The image shows armed white policemen on a bus filled with black children with anxious faces on their way to school in a new neighborhood.
For irony, there was the photo titled "The soiling of old glory." In 1976 Boston, there was bitter division over integrating schools through forced busing. A black lawyer on his way to city hall was attacked by a man using a flagpole with an American flag as a lance. The flagpole missed, but the lawyer was beaten and left with cuts, bruises and a broken nose.
There was one joyful picture involving African Americans, part of a 1981 series created by a Chicago Sun-Times photographer depicting life in that city. Children are shown playing in the sunshine, with the notorious Cabrini-Green housing project in the background.
Most of the recent Pulitzer images also involved race some were taken about 10 miles north of the museum in Ferguson, Missouri, where in 2014 unarmed black teenager Michael Brown was shot to death by a white police officer. The photo staff of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch shared the Pulitzer for its pictures of protests that continued for several nights.
The featured image showed a young man named Edward Crawford in an American flag T-shirt hurling a flaming tear gas canister back at police. The image was published around the world and came to represent the defiance, anger and despair of the protesters.
"I didn't celebrate it," St. Louis photographer Robert Cohen said of the Pulitzer, according to exhibit notes, "because it began with an 18-year-old dead in the street."
You would like to think things are improving, but they're not.
Consider that Emmett Till is back in the news.
In 1955, Till was a 14-year-old black child tortured and lynched in Mississippi. A new bulletproof marker has been erected where he died. A previous marker had been stolen; a later one was pocked by bullets.
Earlier this year, three white University of Mississippi fraternity boys were photographed holding guns and grinning in front of the bullet-marked memorial. And now Trump has the racial insensitivity to refer to his current impeachment inquiry as a "lynching."
Just more evidence, I suppose, of his making America great again. CREDIT: By Paul Fanlund

‘'Modern Love' is just like the newspaper column

Autor: Stuever, Hank.

Resumen: Ninguno disponible.

Enlaces: https://upfinder.upf.edu/openurl/34CSUC_UPF/34CSUC_UPF:VU1?genre=article&amp;atitle=%26lsquo%3B%27Modern+Love%27+is+just+like+the+newspaper+column&amp;author=Stuever%2C+Hank&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=4&amp;date=2019-10-30&amp;rft.btitle=&amp;rft.jtitle=Florida+Times+Union&amp;issn=0740-2325&amp;isbn=&amp;sid=ProQ%3Asoutheastnews_

Texto completo: Here's some wonderful news that is also terrible news, sickening yet also irresistibly intriguing: They've made the New York Times' weekly "Modern Love" column into a quasi-fictionalized TV series (streaming Friday on Amazon Prime), and it is so syrupy sweet that it should come with options for a dental plan. The only thing worse would be if the Times turned their smug wedding announcements into little mini-documentaries about elite mergers - and I probably shouldn't even type that, lest they get any more bright ideas.

"Modern Love" once more proves what Orson Welles said: "I hate television. I hate it as much as peanuts. But I can't stop eating peanuts."

Ol' Orson might be surprised how many viewers in 2019 are drawn to watching shows for the sole puporse of loathing them ("hate-watch" being a common verb), or that TV as we know it now serves up peanuts eight, 10, 12 bowls at a time. "Modern Love" is eight deadly episodes long. You won't notice its effects until it has already poisoned you, and if you watch all of them and find it in any way pleasing or relatable, then I'm afraid to say it's over between us. (It's not me; it's you.) If, however, you watch the show as a means of bile deployment, then scooch over and let's not enjoy it together, two shriveled hearts cuddled as one.

For those who are blissfully unaware, "Modern Love" appears Sundays in the Times' Styles section, where it began 15 years ago this month, featuring hideous yet often compelling personal essays by different authors, freelancers and everyday schmoes, each of whom feel some need to tell the rest of us about a time when they discovered certain profundities in their various relationships - from chance encounters, to bitter breakups, to deathbed revelations.

Tidy to a fault, a "Modern Love" essay is for people who think they are too smart for platitudes or perhaps even too smart for rom-coms. A lot of these stories are often about a threesome, of sorts, involving the narrator, the object of their desire and that annoying third wheel in the relationship: the city of New York.

It is on this point that the TV version of "Modern Love" is most annoying, relying on the permanent delusion that New York makes people fall into a special kind of love, unattainable anyplace else (unless on a brief trip abroad). It's the neurotic, entitled sort of love we used to find in Woody Allen movies, before we dumped him, only the show's executive producer, John Carney (who also wrote and directed most of the episodes), has added an extra tang of disinfectant. Some New Yorkers still fall for this crap, that the city is merely the perfect backdrop to the story starring them.

Watching "Modern Love" is about as much fun as listening to a New Yorker complain about not being able to find a good bagel or a decent slice. Like I said, it's a hate-watch.

As with the column, each episode features a different tale and different pair of co-stars. This first batch is drawn from "Modern Love's" least-complex, easily smarmified examples, launching with Cristin Milioti as a single, young woman whose suitors never meet the approval of her overprotective doorman (Laurentiu Possa); it gets cutesy when she gets pregnant and decides to raise the baby on her own. In New York, you see, doormen exist to become supportive father figures.\

Texto completo: In a July op-ed for the New York Times, Meghan McCain broke her silence about a "horrendous" miscarriage she had suffered.
Now, "The View" co-host is continuing to share her story in the hopes that other women going through loss don't feel so alone.
October is Pregnancy and Infant Loss Awareness Month, so McCain reflected on her experience for "Good Morning America. "
"I don't want to be the face of death and miscarriage, but I also feel like life throws things at you that are unexpected and you have to roll with the punches. And I would rather continue to open up dialogues and conversations," she told the outlet. "I just hope that women out there know that they aren't alone and they haven't done anything wrong. And that the pain is real and it's totally understandable. "
McCain, who married conservative pundit Ben Domenech in November 2017, shared in both an op-ed and to "GMA" that she blamed herself for the miscarriage. She blamed her "stressful life," her age and even her personality.
But the co-host is learning now that those thoughts were not "rational," and since then she has tried to be easier on herself.
"It's not easy being a woman," she said. "It's just not. And I know how hard I was on myself and I'm sure a lot of women do the same thing. And you just feel really alone. "
Meghan McCain on husband Ben Domenech: 'Conservative men have better family values'
Vanna White: 'Wheel of Fortune' fans and family helped her through miscarriage, fiance's death
McCain also shared that she leaned on her friend and co-host Abby Huntsman, who at the time was pregnant with twins. She recognized that the dynamic could have been difficult, both for Hunstman to watch while pregnant, but also for McCain to be "going through a miscarriage while she was pregnant. "
"I think it's intense to give birth to twins too. And it's a very specific moment in time that was very, very hard for both of us that made us bond. "

McCain also spoke about experiencing the miscarriage right around the 1-year anniversary of her father's death. Arizona Sen. John McCain died of cancer Aug. 25, 2018.
"My dad was, like, the ending of a beautiful long-lived life and I grieve that and the way I grieved having a miscarriage, and grieved my daughter was what could have been," she told "GMA. "
"It's hard. It's just really, really, really hard, and I empathize with all women who have gone through it and who may go through it. It's just horrific. And it doesn't really get easier either. "
The co-host ended with a final message to women going through pregnancy loss.
"Whatever you feel is totally fine and totally where you're supposed to be. And I wish I had heard that. "

Texto completo: India's own members of Parliament have been kept out of the locked-down region for months, as have journalists and an American senator.
NEW DELHI -- After months of denying journalists, Indian lawmakers and an American senator access to the locked-down Kashmir region, the Indian government on Tuesday allowed a visit by mostly far-right members of the European Parliament, representing anti-immigration parties with histories of anti-Muslim rhetoric.
India stripped the disputed state of Jammu and Kashmir of its autonomy on Aug. 5, and it has stopped international journalists from traveling there, locked up local politicians and severed phone lines and the internet. The government partially restored cellphone service this month, but all other communication remains cut.
The European delegation allowed to visit on Tuesday consists mostly of members of far-right populist parties, including the Alternative for Germany, Poland's governing Law and Justice party and the French party National Rally. Indian news reports said 22 of the 27 lawmakers in the group were from far-right parties. Embassies from some of the countries that the delegation represents confirmed their attendance when contacted by The New York Times.
A United States senator, Chris Van Hollen, was prevented from traveling to Kashmir earlier this month, and the Indian government has consistently blocked the country's own lawmakers from visiting the area to assess the situation.
The Twitter account of Mehbooba Mufti, one of the Kashmiri politicians who have been detained, was scathing about the European delegation's visit. Members of Ms. Mufti's Peoples Democratic Party have been prevented from meeting with her during her detention.
"In its desperation to convince international community that normalcy's restored in Kashmir," the government of India is "engaging with what seem like pro fascist, right leaning and anti immigrant EU MPs. Royal mess," the post read. (Ms. Mufti's Twitter account is being operated by her daughter while she is in detention, supporters say.)
Kashmir is in dispute between Pakistan and India. It became an autonomous Indian state after independence from Britain in 1947, but it did so under an agreement that eventually Kashmiris, who are predominately Muslim, would be allowed to vote on whether to stay with India or join Pakistan. That vote never occurred.
In August, the Indian government suddenly revoked Kashmir's autonomy, in a bid to increase its hold on the territory. On Thursday, India will officially change the status of Jammu and Kashmir, making it a federally controlled territory rather than a state. The move will separate it into two union territories -- Ladakh as one territory, and Jammu and Kashmir as another.
The revocation of Kashmir's autonomy was welcomed by most Indian political parties, even the opposition. But many protested how it was done, including the jailing of elected politicians and the curbs on communication and travel. Doctors say people have died because ambulances have been delayed at checkpoints.
"It's an insult to India's Parliament when democratically elected parliamentarians from India are forbidden from traveling within their own country and must seek permission to travel to Jammu and Kashmir," Gaurav Gogoi, a lawmaker with the opposition Indian National Congress party, said in an interview.
"My only hope is that Indian parliamentarians are allowed the same privileges that the E.U. delegation is being shown," Mr. Gogoi said.
Although the Indian government insisted that the Europeans were visiting in a personal capacity and had not officially been invited by New Delhi, on Monday they met with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his national security adviser, Ajit Doval.
One government official, who insisted on anonymity to brief journalists, said that an Indian nongovernmental organization had arranged the visit. The official declined to elaborate and insisted that the delegation robustly represented various European parties, not just far-right groups.
The European delegation visited Srinagar, the capital of Jammu and Kashmir, on Tuesday and was to receive a briefing from security officials.
When contacted, several of the European embassies in New Delhi whose countries are represented in the delegation said they had been kept in the dark about the visit, and that they had found out about it from media reports.

President should represent integrity, service and excellence

Texto completo: Congressional Democrats want to impeach the president, and Republicans do not. In this Ukraine scenario and many others, I think about "Service Before Self." In the conduct of foreign policy, patriotism is a word that embodies selfless service.
If a president’s first instinct in directing military operations or conducting foreign policy was to better his political prospects, that could have grave impacts on our nation. American military leaders are traditionally apolitical, even in retirement. That tradition has begun to crack.
While stationed in Africa in the late 2000s, I worked with Adm. Bill McRaven, JSOC commander, who later oversaw the successful raid on Bin Laden’s compound. I won’t try to convince you the president has done something gravely wrong, but I will recommend reading Adm. McRaven’s words. His most recent piece is an editorial in the New York Times on Oct. 17.
Dodging the draft via bone spurs doesn’t sound very patriotic to me. Again, don’t believe me, though – read what Gen. Jim Mattis said about bone spurs at an event, also on Oct. 17.
The nice thing about President Trump is you don’t need to listen to CNN or Fox. Watch or read the president’s words on YouTube or Twitter for yourself. I especially recommend the video of the Trump-Putin press conference in Helsinki, Finland, on July 16, 2018.
A more recent example is the decision to host the Group of 7 summit (USA, U.K., Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan) at a Trump property in Miami. Regardless of how much money changes hands with whom, the optics – both domestic and international – are horrible.
Are you a Republican, a Democrat or just an American? If you answered “American,” what core values does that represent? For me, it’s integrity, service and excellence. I don’t think this president represents any of those values.
Many say other presidents have conducted themselves poorly in the past or that other politicians today are sub-par. I agree, but my response is, “so what?” He is the president today, and the president sets the tone for the nation.

David Leonhardt: Climate is more important than health care

Texto completo: When Bill Clinton became president, his top legislative priority was health care. When Barack Obama became president, he first had to prevent a depression, but then he too turned to health care.
The next Democratic president should choose a different priority.
It’s still true that too many Americans suffer from inadequate or expensive insurance coverage, and the next president should certainly look to make progress on health care. But presidents must make choices. Realistically, they have to pick one or two sweeping bills to try to push through Congress in their first year.
To argue that health care should be atop the list, you can’t simply say that it is important. You need to believe that it’s so much more important than everything else — climate change, voting rights, immigration, education, wage stagnation, the unfair tax system — that health care deserves to be the Democrats’ only top priority over four decades of presidencies. All those other issues would once again take a back seat.
And that would be a mistake, because the both moral and political case for some other issues is now stronger than it is for health care.
Climate change threatens the well-being of the planet and everyone who lives on it. The next president can save more lives and better improve human health by slowing climate change than by improving health insurance.
The wounded state of American democracy is also more pressing. If it doesn’t get fixed, any expansion of health insurance could be reversed in a few years anyway. If the political system can be shored up — by guaranteeing voting rights, regulating campaign donations and granting statehood to Washington, D.C., and potentially Puerto Rico, among other things — every other national problem will become easier to address.
Unfortunately, these other issues are getting pushed to the margins in the 2020 campaign, while media attention has focused obsessively on Medicare. At every one of the six debates so far, Medicare has taken up a big chunk of the first half-hour, when the viewing audience is typically largest. In total, the candidates have spent almost 100 minutes talking about the subject onstage, more than they’ve spent on climate change, voting rights and tax policy, combined.
The good news is that some of the candidates are also frustrated by the Medicare preoccupation, based on conversations I’ve had. At a campaign stop in Iowa last week, Elizabeth Warren resorted to asking reporters if any of them wanted to ask her about education. (She could have added: Research suggests that expanding pre-K and college may do more to improve people’s health than expanding health insurance.)
Obama’s presidency shows why the choice of priorities matters so much. He rightly insisted to his aides that they not only combat the financial crisis, but also try to pass major bills on both health care and the climate. Between the two, something had to go at the front of the legislative line, and Obama picked health care.
Partly as a result, the administration ran out of time on climate. The Senate moved slowly on health care — it’s a complicated subject, as you may have heard — and by the time senators were ready to take up a climate bill, the 2010 midterms were looming. Several senators weren’t willing to take another politically risky vote.
Health care became Obama’s signature accomplishment, extending coverage to some 20 million Americans. Climate was arguably his biggest disappointment. More than a decade later, with seas rising and severe storms causing more destruction, the country can’t afford to overlook climate policy again.
The next president can reasonably expect to have time for two big early priorities (barring another financial crisis). Even without health care — and even if the Democrats retake the Senate, a precondition for almost any ambitious bill — the decision would not be easy.
Michael Linden, who runs the Groundwork Collaborative, a Washington group that advocates for a fairer economy, has a suggestion that seems right to me: One priority should be democratic reform, like voting rights. The other should be a major economic bill that increases taxes on the wealthy and spends the money helping the middle-class and poor and promoting economic growth.
This second bill would include funding for clean energy, as well as limits on pollution. Depending on the politics, it might make sense to call the bill a Green New Deal.
Regardless, the bill should be organized around more tangible, immediate benefits than either the Obama or Clinton health care plan was. Remember, the politics of health care can be miserable. Most voters are insured, and they often focus on what they might lose from a new law. That’s a big reason Democrats fared so poorly in both Obama’s and Clinton’s first midterm elections.
What should the next president do on health care? Start by looking for concrete ways to expand insurance access and reduce costs, through narrower legislation or executive action. Many of these ideas — on prescription drugs, for example — are enormously popular, polls show. A radical transformation, on the other hand, is not.
Popularity isn’t everything, of course, and I understand why the next president may still want to go for radical transformation. It just doesn’t deserve to go at the front of the line. Health care should not be the only area where Democratic presidents are willing to spend political capital.

Texto completo: El presidente Donald Trump expresó su rechazo del testimonio del teniente coronel Alexander Vindman , un experto de Ucrania asignado al Consejo de Seguridad Nacional, quien testifica en la Cámara sobre la llamada del mandatario al presidente ucraniano.
“Supuestamente, según los Medios Corruptos, el testigo de hoy que nunca ha sido trumpista calificó de ‘preocupante’ la llama a Ucrania. ¿Estaba en la misma llamada que yo? ¡No puede ser posible! Pídanle que lea la transcripción de la llamada. ¡Cacería de brujas!” , escribió el mandatario.
Supposedly, according to the Corrupt Media, the Ukraine call “concerned” today’s Never Trumper witness. Was he on the same call that I was? Can’t be possible! Please ask him to read the Transcript of the call. Witch Hunt!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 29, 2019

Vindman es el primer testigo de esta primera parte del proceso de juicio político que escuchó la llamada del 25 de julio entre los presidentes Trump y Zelensky, durante la cual Trump dijo que quería un “favor”, luego de que el ucraniano sacara el tema de casi $400 millones de dólares en ayuda militar estadounidense prometida.

Texto completo: El teniente coronel Alexander Vindman , principal experto en Ucrania para el Consejo de Seguridad Nacional, testificó este martes ante los representantes encargados de la investigación previa a al juicio político del presidente Donald Trump. Su testimonio no gustó al mandatario pero reveló información que puede ser clave para que los demócratas sigan adelante con un proceso que puede sacar a Trump de la Casa Blanca.
Vindman estuvo en la llamada telefónica que el presidente hizo el 25 de julio a su homólogo ucraniano y que llevó a la presidenta de la Cámara de Representantes, Nancy Pelosi, a anunciar el inicio de una consulta que reuniera los apoyos necesarios para someter a Trump a un impeachment. En dicha conversación, tal y como confirmó el coronel en su testimonio, Trump presionó a su homólogo ucraniano para que investigara a su rival político Joe Biden y a su hijo Hunter.
Vindman aseguró a los legisladores que la transcripción de la llamada que publicó la Casa Blanca había excluido la palabra “Burisma” , la compañía de gas ucraniana por la que Trump quiere que investiguen a los Biden. En la transcripción tampoco aparece las palabras de Trump afirmando que había grabaciones de Biden .
The New York Times publicó en la tarde del martes que Vindman ofreció correcciones pero las rechazaron. Según sus declaraciones, el excombatiente en Irak no comprendió por qué hicieron unos cambios y no otros.
Su testimonio supuso la quinta confirmación hasta ahora de que Trump condicionó o bien una reunión con Zelenski o bien la entrega de ayuda militar a Ucrania a una investigación de sus rivales políticos, un tema que podría espolear un proceso de destitución del presidente.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - The U.S. government said Monday that it is extending protections for more than 200,000 citizens of El Salvador who have been living in the country under temporary protected status, in a boost for Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele.
U.S. Ambassador Ronald Johnson, appearing in a video with Bukele, said that agreement "extends the (temporary protected status) for Salvadorans who are in the United States for one more year."
Later, Ken Cuccinelli, acting director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, appeared to contradict the ambassador, saying via Twitter that the actual TPS program for Salvadorans wasn't being extended in legal terms: "That's not what happened."
The effect, however, appeared to be essentially the same: Salvadorans who have been living in the U.S. under the TPS program - safe from deportation and allowed to work legally - will continue to do so for at least a year after courts resolve a challenge to the Trump administration's attempt to end TPS for El Salvador and several other countries.
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security said in a statement that Salvadorans with TPS will have the validity of their work permits extended through Jan. 4, 2021.
"This is recognition of the achievements and good work of the government of Nayib Bukele," Johnson said.
The DHS statement said there was concern that "the sudden inflow of 250,000 individuals to El Salvador could spark another mass migration to the U.S. and reinvigorate the crisis at the southern border."
Man arrested in Texas shooting that left 2 dead, 12 hurt at party
GREENVILLE, Texas - A man suspected of opening fire at an off-campus college party in Texas, killing two people and injuring 12 others, was arrested Monday.
Brandon Ray Gonzales, 23, of Greenville, was taken into custody less than 48 hours after Saturday's shooting, Hunt County Sheriff Randy Meeks said. Gonzales, who was arrested at the auto dealership where he worked, was booked into the Hunt County jail on a charge of capital murder of multiple persons. Bond was set at $1 million.
The shooting happened around midnight Saturday outside Greenville, 15 miles southwest of a satellite campus of the Texas A&M University System. Authorities believe the shooter may have been targeting one person at the party of about 750 people, and that others may have been shot at random, Meeks has said.
Air Force's mystery space plane lands, ends 2-year mission
CAPE CANAVERAL - The Air Force's mystery space plane is back on Earth after a record-breaking two-year mission.
The X-37B landed at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida early Sunday. The Air Force is mum about what the plane did in orbit after launching aboard a SpaceX rocket in 2017. The 780-day mission sets an endurance record for the reusable vehicle.
It looks like a space shuttle but is one-fourth the size at 29 feet.
Officials say this latest mission successfully completed its objectives.
This was the fifth spaceflight by a vehicle of this sort. No. 6 is planned next year from Cape Canaveral. According to Air Force Secretary Barbara Barrett, "Each successive mission advances our nation's space capabilities."
Pope declares Secret Archive of Vatican not so secret anymore
VATICAN CITY - Pope Francis has declared that the Vatican Secret Archive isn't so secret after all.
Francis on Monday officially changed the name of the Holy See archive to remove what he said were the "negative" connotations of having "secret" in its name.
From now on, the vast trove of documents, manuscripts and papyrus of popes past will be officially known as the "Vatican Apostolic Archive."
In a new law, Francis noted that the archive has long been open to scholars.
He said the name change better reflects the archive's reality and "its service to the church and the world of culture."
The archive contains the documentation on the life of the universal Catholic Church from the eighth century to the present.
Students join Iraq protests as clashes kill 3
BAGHDAD - Thousands of students joined Iraq's anti-government protests Monday, as clashes with security forces firing tear gas canisters killed at least three demonstrators and wounded more than 100.
The students skipped classes at several universities and secondary schools in Baghdad and across Iraq's majority-Shiite south on Monday to take part in the protests, despite the government ordering schools and universities to operate normally.
One of those killed was a 22-year-old female medical student, the first woman to be killed since the protests began this month.
In a separate development, three rockets struck a large military base north of Baghdad that houses U.S. and Iraqi forces, according to a senior Iraqi security official who said there were no casualties.
NC judges throw out congressional map for 2020
RALEIGH, N.C. - North Carolina judges on Monday blocked the state's congressional map from being used in the 2020 elections, ruling that voters had a strong likelihood of winning a lawsuit that argued Republicans unlawfully manipulated district lines for partisan gain.
The panel of three Superior Court judges issued a preliminary injunction preventing elections under the district lines, starting with the March 3 primary.
In the ruling Monday, the judges - Paul Ridgeway, Alma Hinton and Joseph Crosswhite - agreed that "there is a substantial likelihood that plaintiffs will prevail on the merits of this action by showing beyond a reasonable doubt that the 2016 congressional districts are extreme partisan gerrymanders" in violation of the state constitution.
In Silicon Valley: Hundreds of Facebook employees have signed a letter to CEO Mark Zuckerberg and other executives saying they oppose the social network's policy of letting politicians lie in advertisements.
The New York Times reported Monday that more than 250 workers have signed the letter urging Facebook leaders to change the policy that they say is a "threat to what FB stands for." While that's a small fraction of Facebook's workforce of more than 35,000, it's a rare showing of employee dissent.
Facebook spokeswoman Bertie Thomson said the company appreciates its employees voicing concerns but it "remains committed to not censoring political speech."
Caption: Police officers stand where a Port Authority bus fell into a sinkhole shortly before 8 a.m. Monday in Pittsburgh. Officials said the driver and a 56-year-old female passenger were aboard the bus and that the passenger was treated at a hospital and released.

Texto completo: Un funcionario de seguridad nacional de la Casa Blanca dará declarará este martes ante los legisladores que investigan el impeachment a presidente Donald Trump. El alto cargo, un veterano de la guerra de Irak, escuchó la llamada de Trump al presidente ucraniano y advirtió de a su superior que el mandatario estadounidense había solicitado a su homólogo ucraniano algo “perjudicial para los intereses estadounidenses” .
Según adelantó The New York Times, que tuvo acceso a un borrador de la declaración, el teniente coronel Alexander S. Vindman escuchó a Trump pedir al ucraniano Vlodymyr Zelensky que investigara a uno de sus principales rivales políticos .
El veterano, que es el máximo experto en Ucrania que hay en el Consejo de Seguridad Nacional, notificó en dos ocasiones el modo en el que Trump y su círculo más cercano estaba tratando a Ucrania . El documento al que accedió el Times señala que el comportamiento del gobierno carece de lo que Vindman considera “sentido del deber” .
El teniente coronel sera el primer cargo de la Casa Blanca que escuchó la conversación entre Trump y Zelensky el 25 de julio y que testificará ante el equipo encargado de la investigación que puede llevar al presidente a un juicio político. La llamada entre ambos mandatarios es precisamente la razón que llevó a la presidenta de la Cámara Baja, Nancy Pelosi, a anunciar el inicio del proceso contra Trump. Sin embargo, la Casa Blanca había anunciado que no participaría en la consulta .
“Pensé que no era apropiado exigir que un gobierno extranjero investigue a un ciudadano estadounidense y estaba preocupado por las consecuencias [que tendría sobre] el apoyo del gobierno estadounidense a Ucrania”, dice el coronel Vindman en su declaración. En la llamada que escuchó, Trump presionó a Zelensky para que ordenara una investigación a Joe Biden y a su hijo Hunter por los negocios que este último tenía en su país.
“Me di cuenta de que si Ucrania realizaba una investigación sobre los Biden y Burisma, probablemente se interpretaría como una táctica partidista “, continúa explicando el veterano. En su texto, Vindman hace hincapié en que su preocupación era que este país del este de Europa perdiera el apoyo de los partidos republicano y demócrata “que hasta ahora ha mantenido”.
En agosto, publica el Times, a petición de sus superiores en el Consejo de Seguridad Nacional, el coronel redactó un memorando para reiniciar la ayuda de seguridad que EEUU había retenido de Ucrania, pero Trump se negó a firmarlo.

Ivey, Marshall attack process, not charges

Texto completo: Like other Republicans, Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey and Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall support President Donald Trump amid an impeachment investigation, accusing Democrats of running a political show.
And like their colleagues, neither Ivey nor Marshall appear comfortable addressing the charges underlying that investigation: That Trump withheld military aid from Ukraine to force officials there to provide him embarrassing information on former Vice President Joe Biden, seeking the Democratic presidential nomination.
Marshall on Thursday night and Ivey on Friday morning both put out statements supporting the president and condemning the process used by House Democrats. Marshall said he supported a resolution from U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., that condemned what Republicans called a "closed-door impeachment inquiry." The attorney general likened it to a "star chamber," or a secret body that makes favorable decisions for one side.
Like all legislative bodies, Congress sets its own rules and has made use of closed-door hearings in the past. The Watergate investigations and, more recently, the probe into the attack on the U.S. diplomatic mission in Benghazi in Libya both used closed-door hearings. Republicans sit on all the committees conducting the impeachment inquiry and have equal time to ask questions of witnesses deposed there. Some Republicans say Trump should have counsel present for the hearings, which Democrats have likened to a grand jury investigation.
Ivey's statement accused Democrats of offering "no due process and no transparency."
"When we elected President Trump in 2016, Alabamians and the American people sought progress," the statement said. "We wanted stronger infrastructure, a booming economy, and security for all American citizens. President Trump and his administration are fighting to do that. Congress has a job to do on behalf of the American people, not this political charade that we are currently witnessing."
Trump admitted in the presence of television cameras last month to holding phone conversations with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and discussing the Bidens. Bill Taylor, the chief diplomat at the embassy in Kyiv, testified earlier this week to the House Intelligence Committee that Gordon Sondland, the U.S. Ambassador to the European Union, told him in September that "security assistance" was dependent on a public statement from Ukrainian officials that they would investigate an energy company that employed Biden's son Hunter, as well as alleged interference by Ukraine in the 2016 election.
Republicans have not challenged the veracity of Trump's comments or Taylor's testimony. The New York Times reported on Wednesday that Ukrainian officials knew about the aid freeze in early August, despite administration claims that Ukraine did not know aid had been blocked.
Follow up questions on the charges were sent to Marshall on Friday. Asked about Ivey's feelings about the charges, or whether she considered a president seeking information on a political opponent from a foreign country appropriate, Gina Maiola, a spokeswoman for the governor, replied "The governor's sentiment on all of these things is expressed in her statement of support, and we will let that stand."
House Republicans, including U.S. Reps. Mo Brooks of Huntsville; Bradley Byrne of Mobile and Gary Palmer of Hoover attempted to storm a secure room where the House Intelligence Committee was preparing to take a deposition from a witness. The House members left after five hours to vote on the floor. The Republicans said they wanted the process open. Democrats accused them of compromising the security of the room.
Ivey's statement also suggested that Congress should look to Alabama for "strong, bipartisan efforts," adding that "we are seeing great progress for that." While most Democrats and Republicans supported the state's budgets and an increase in the gas tax earlier this year, Democrats strongly opposed legislation to create a near-total abortion ban in the state. Ivey signed the ban into law in May.

Texto completo: NBC is saddled with another major moment in thoroughbred history but is having to deal with an elephant in the Santa Anita jockeys' room.
This weekend's Breeders' Cup returns to the Arcadia track for a record 10th time, but none of the previous nine had the stigma of a yearlong litany of horses having to be euthanized -- 36 since the Dec. 26, 2018, winter/spring opener, including another last weekend.
Jerry Bailey, the 62-year-old Fort Lauderdale, Fla.,-based Hall of Fame jockey and NBC thoroughbred analyst, can justifiably wax poetic about the surroundings and history of Santa Anita, "and that's why I always enjoy doing it there even if it's a long trip."

"As far as what's been happening ...," Bailey starts as he tries to balance optimism with realism.
Despite pushback from some in the media and a damning report on HBO's "Real Sports," the Breeders' Cup Board of Directors decided last June to give the track a unanimous vote of confidence and keep the event there as planned. Even after the track closed for a month last spring to assess the issue.
"I can't tell you what the cause of the problems are there," continued Bailey, a seven-time Eclipse Award winner who won nearly 5,900 races and earned about $300 million in a 30-plus year riding career. "But I just believe it's going to be a really good event and they're doing all they can to make sure it's a safe event."
As part of 10-plus hours of coverage on NBC and NBCSN, climaxing with the Classic (Saturday, 5 p.m., Channel 4), the network has ample opportunities to address and access what has happened. Essay pieces written and narrated by former Sports Illustrated scribe Tim Layden will include one that covers how the 2019 season unfolded, which can't gloss over the controversial disqualification of Maximum Security as the Kentucky Derby winner. The Breeders' Cup, which started in 1984 at Hollywood Park, has dealt with on-track tragedies. ESPN had the event in 2010 at Churchill Downs when Rough Sailing had a fatal injury in the Juvenile Turf, and in 2007 when Irish colt George Washington was put down in the Classic on a muddy track at Monmouth Park.
The 1990 event NBC covered at Belmont Park had two deaths -- Go For Wand in the Distaff and Mr. Nickerson in the Sprint -- and a New York Times headline the next day read: "Racing's Darkest Day: A Belmont Disaster."
Bailey might rather discuss how this Santa Anita visit marks the 10th anniversary of Zenyatta's Breeders' Cup Classic win there. He's also apt to regale details about when he rode the biggest upset in the event's history, 133-to-1 longshot Arcangues over favorite Bertrando in the '93 Classic, also at Santa Anita. It was one of Bailey's 15 career Breeders' Cup wins.
"We've got to touch on the recent history [of Santa Anita] and realize, we've had catastrophic breakdowns in the Breeders' Cups of the past and dealt with it, and you kind of move on," Bailey said. "I rode for 31 years and that's the last thing I want to have happen being on the backside of these animals. Whatever happens, it's something we just have to deal with."

Crossed up lines
An announcement last week that ESPN's "Outside The Lines" will do away with its weekday half-hour scheduled show and "evolve to meet the changing habits of consumers" incorporating any sort of breaking-news-type segments into the daily SportsCenter shows defeats its purpose.
By more than just habit, our ability to locate "OTL" at 10 a.m. (except on Mondays, when NFL programming dominates the day) might be the best example of how we discovered and interpreted the Houston Astros-Brandon Taubman-Sports Illustrated story, which host Jeremy Schaap was able to meticulously explain and discuss with SI writer Stephanie Apstein.
If that was buried in a random SportsCenter at whatever hour it felt like delivering it, we doubt we would have kept pace.
ESPN's compromise is creating a new hourlong Saturday morning wrap-up "OTL" instead. That's outside our habit zone.

Kickbacks
At least ESPN avoids having any live event leading into the LAFC's MLS Western Conference final against Seattle (Tuesday, 7 p.m.), unlike the mess it created for viewers searching for last Thursday's LAFC-Galaxy conference semifinal where ESPN scheduled it for a 7:30 p.m. start but grinded out a 45-plus-minute overlap with a Southern Methodist-Houston football game that could never have comfortably fit into the scheduled three-hour window.
ESPN2 ended up taking the LAFC-Galaxy pregame and first 30 minutes of the contest, with LAFC leading 1-0, before it turned it back over to ESPN, where play-by-play man Jon Champion greeted the new viewers by telling them they were seeing "without question the biggest MLS occasion of the season ... some people have suggested the biggest playoff occasion ever in the 24-season history of Major League Soccer." It was so big, even the panelists on the next day's "OTL" roundtable couldn't mop up the mess, as co-host Ryan Smith asked: "The battle for L.A. was going on right under our eyes and most of us missed it. ... It just didn't get a lot of attention. It was sort of at the back of the news."
Maybe crane your neck and ask the ESPN programmers in the next room.
At least those who hung on until the end caught Champion's description of the whole affair as "a magnificent spectacle," and then summarized over a live shot of Galaxy's Zlatan Ibrahimovic walking off the field and grabbing his crotch in response to LAFC fans: "Is this the final exit of one of the greatest gladiators our world game has ever seen? And if it is, is it being done with a gesture that he may come to regret? But doesn't that sum up Zlatan Ibrahimovic? The brilliant, sometimes the brutal, and occasionally the inadvisable ... an infectious mix of contradictions."
Champion, analyst Taylor Twellman and reporter Sebastian Salazar, who endured an odd postgame exchange with LAFC coach Bob Bradley last Thursday where Bradley told Salazar to "get lost" and walked away after a question about star Carlos Vela stepping up in big games, return for Tuesday's telecast as well as the Nov. 10 MLS Cup.

Dionne: Warren's plan worked. Now she needs another one.

Texto completo: The Massachusetts senator is unquestionably the front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination, which made her the focal point of attacks from her rivals in a recent Democratic debate. Former Vice President Joe Biden had an easier time of it, but this was not good news for him. At various points in the three-hour marathon, he faded away. His rivals no longer see him as the person to beat.
Beneath the jostling for position lay an important policy subtext. Warren was plainly far more comfortable defending her broader economic positions, particularly her proposed wealth tax, than she was in standing up for Medicare for All. The tax on wealth goes to the heart of her candidacy's purposes. Medicare for All appears to be a position she adopted - somewhat belatedly - to fend off Sen. Bernie Sanders and attacks from her left. Her continued success depends on how she handles this tension.
Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., underscored the ongoing significance of the battle for the party's progressive wing by endorsing Sanders, who strengthened his hand with a solid performance. Their decisions defined the difficult political terrain Warren faces. Her rise depended on her ability, simultaneously, to pull left-wing Democrats away from Sanders while also gaining new support from more moderate progressives. She made it look effortless. It will be effortless no longer.
The debate also marked a reconfiguration at the other end of the party. While Biden remains near (and, in some polls, still at) the top of the field, South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., sense it's now-or-never for them to replace Biden as the moderate alternative to Warren.
Biden had his moments, and he was especially passionate when the conversation turned to foreign policy and President Trump's decision to withdraw American troops from Syria, abandoning the United States' Kurdish allies. "This is shameful, shameful what this man has done," Biden declared.
Nonetheless, it was Buttigieg especially, but also Klobuchar, who dominated the discussion on the party's center-left. Up to now, Buttigieg has prospered as a refreshing new voice in the party, but struggled to break out of single digits. He was earning more acclaim than support. At the debate, he played to win.
He was scalding in challenging Warren's refusal to say whether she would have to raise middle-class taxes to pay for Medicare for All. "Your signature, Senator, is to have a plan for everything. Except this," Buttigieg said. "No plan has been laid out to explain how a multi-trillion-dollar hole in this Medicare for All plan that Senator Warren is putting forward is supposed to get filled in."
Buttigieg shrewdly defined his space: bolder than Biden ("bold" was one of his favorite words), but with more practical, do-able ideas than Warren, and more of an "outsider" than the congressional veterans on the stage. Klobuchar was also forceful - particularly in discussing the opioid crisis - blending moderation with family anecdotes that brought home her Minnesota roots. Still, both Midwesterners need Biden to weaken substantially and rather quickly, and the former vice president may be doing well enough to keep that from happening.
But will Klobuchar and Buttigieg slow Warren's rise? Perhaps surprisingly, the moderates and Sanders share an interest in pointing out that Warren has not always been as enthusiastic about Medicare for All as she is now. She was careful in a New York Times interview earlier this year to endorse it, but she stressed the goal of "moving us to a place where everybody is covered at the lowest possible cost" and stressed "there are a lot of different ways to get there. 'Medicare for All' has a lot of different paths for how we get there." One can imagine her returning to this more circumspect position in a general election campaign, made easier by her choice to avoid issuing a comprehensive health care proposal of her own.
On the other hand, Warren was unabashed and effective defending her wealth tax - "Taxing income is not going to get you where you need to be the way taxing wealth does" - and she can already fairly claim that she has fundamentally altered the national conversation on taxing large fortunes.
"I have a plan for that" has been Warren's iconic soundbite. To this point, her strategy has worked brilliantly. Going forward, she will need to confront challenges from both her left and her right. She needs a plan for that, too.

Why We Have a 'Deep State'

Texto completo: For the last two weeks, diplomats have been walking through secure doors in the basement of the United States Capitol, defying the objection of their politically appointed superiors as they answer questions from members of the House impeachment inquiry.
The inquiry itself began in response to a whistle-blower who raised alarms about the administration's efforts to pressure Ukraine for political purposes. That whistle-blower is a C.I.A. officer who seems to be, like many of those testifying, a career civil servant.
The president and his allies have responded with fury. Those damning testimonials are part of a political vendetta by "Never Trumper" bureaucrats, members of a "deep state" bent on undermining the will of the people, they assert.
But what is this "deep state"? Far from being a tool of political corruption, the Civil Service was created to be an antidote to the very kind of corruption and self-dealing that seems to plague this administration.
The question of who gets to serve in government has been a live one since the earliest days of the republic. In 1829, President Andrew Jackson, newly inaugurated, tossed out officials who had served under his predecessor and rival John Quincy Adams, filling the executive branch with Democratic Party loyalists instead. "Rotation in office" was central to Jackson's vision of egalitarian democracy -- a way, he said, to transform federal service from the domain of a complacent elite into a vigorous voice of the people.
Conveniently, the practice also strengthened party power, as grateful appointees directed chunks of their government salaries as "assessments" to party coffers. "To the victor belong the spoils of the enemy," one Jackson ally quipped. The spoils system was born.
Its flaws became clear after the Civil War as the federal government swelled in size and a rapidly industrializing economy presented irresistible opportunities for government officials to cash in. Into this perfect storm entered a Republican president, Ulysses S. Grant, a war hero with little political experience and terrible judgment in the friends he appointed to high office.
Although Grant himself was upstanding, self-dealing coursed through his administration. The secretary of war was charged with accepting bribes. The secretary of the interior was so thoroughly corrupt that even the once ardently pro-Grant New York Herald called him "a piece of damaged goods which General Grant ought for his own credit and good name to put at once away under the counter." Grant's closest aide, Orville Babcock, was indicted on charges of conspiring to defraud the government of tax money. (He was acquitted after the ever-loyal Grant testified as a character witness.)
These quid pro quo schemes were only one part of what the historian Richard White calls "a zoo of corrupt practices" enabled by enormous Gilded Age wealth. Financiers and corporations, especially the railroads, filled politicians' pockets with bribes and campaign donations, and employed friendship and fealty to bend the public sector to their will.
The swamp of scandal propelled a fed-up cadre of young reformers into action. Boldest and brashest was a patrician New York State assemblyman named Theodore Roosevelt. Government could never work properly until a professional civil service replaced cronyism, Roosevelt declared. "The spoils system of making appointments to and removals from office is so wholly and unmixedly evil, is so emphatically un-American and undemocratic, and is so potent a force for degradation in our public life that it is difficult to believe that any intelligent man of ordinary decency who has looked into the subject can be its advocate."
A healthy dose of elitism drove Roosevelt's crusade, as the spoils system had been the path to power for immigrant-driven political machines in big cities like New York. Yet the Civil Service laws he and others created marked the beginning of a shift toward a fairer, less corrupt public realm. By early 1883, reformers in Congress had pushed through landmark administrative reform that abolished "assessments" and instituted a merit-based system of public appointments. Roosevelt helped pass the nation's first state-level Civil Service law in New York State later that year.
First as Civil Service commissioner and then as president, Roosevelt pushed to eradicate the spoils system. By the time he left the White House in 1909, the majority of federal jobs were merit-based career posts.
Professionalization expanded in the decades that followed. Creation of the Foreign Service established a rigorous entry examination and raised pay. The diplomatic corps was no longer limited to rich young men with time and family money to take overseas postings. The Hatch Act placed sweeping restrictions on political activity by government officials, including the president's political appointees. Merit-based hiring diversified the work force, making the career Civil Service outpace the private sector in representation of women and minorities, especially in executive roles.
Even before the current moment, however, a backward slide had begun. The expertise of government specialists sank in value amid simmering anti-establishment sentiment. A Republican Party that had built the Civil Service now turned against it. As Ronald Reagan put it, "the nine most terrifying words in the English language are: I'm from the government, and I'm here to help."
During both Democratic and Republican administrations, budget cuts stripped away professional staff from departments and regulatory agencies. Government shutdowns furloughed millions of career workers.
These underlying conditions provided fertile ground for the arrival of a Trump administration that sees little purpose in the institutions and traditions of the Civil Service. In the last three years, the president and his aides have challenged government expertise on everything from hurricane tracking to inaugural crowd size. Their vigorous promotion of politics and business while on the job has reflected little worry about the appearance of self-dealing.
Though Mr. Trump scuttled plans to use his Miami resort as a site for next year's Group of 7 summit after bipartisan outcry, Trump properties continue to be popular destinations for foreign officials and political allies. Scandals have chased several cabinet officials out of office, like the former E.P.A. chief Scott Pruitt, and continue to swirl around others still there. Members of Trump's family largely seem to have disregarded earlier vows to separate business interests and politics, and some of his closest advisers have ended up in jail.
The parallels to the bad old days of political corruption are striking. But today's government has something that the Gilded Age did not. While political appointees remain largely silent, career officials show that they don't serve a particular party, but a country.
"The merit system of making appointments is in its essence as democratic and American as the common school system itself," Teddy Roosevelt remarked in 1901. The nation needs to ask itself whether it wants to continue this tradition or heed Mr. Trump's vow to destroy the deep state.

Texto completo: Pop Music: Sleater-Kinney Regroups in New York
Oct. 30-31; ticketmaster.com .
De facto inheritors of the riot grrrl torch, the Olympia, Wash.-born trio Sleater-Kinney began churning out raucous, confrontational rock songs more than two decades ago and have since become latter-day patrons of feminist punk.
In recent years, the group, headed up by Corin Tucker and Carrie Brownstein, has offered up a playbook for female artists who want to achieve longevity in the spotlight -- a relatively rare phenomenon in an industry whose misogyny and ageism tends to cut careers short. One of their best tactics is experimentation: A creative partnership with St. Vincent, for instance, gave their latest album, "The Center Won't Hold," a touch of art-pop flair.
This week, Sleater-Kinney will perform at Brooklyn's Kings Theater and Manhattan's Hammerstein Ballroom as part of their first tour since the departure of their longtime drummer, Janet Weiss. Her sizable shoes will be filled by Angie Boylan, a member of the punk band Aye Nako. OLIVIA HORN
Dance: Paul Taylor's Past and Future
Oct. 29-Nov. 17; ptamd.org .
For the first time since Paul Taylor's death in 2018, the company he founded returns to the David H. Koch Theater in Manhattan for its annual Lincoln Center performances. The season will be full of reflection on the past, honoring not only Taylor -- with two free memorial performances on Oct. 29 and Nov. 5 -- but also Donald McKayle, another modern dance pioneer who died last year.
On Nov. 12, three guest ensembles take the stage in works spanning McKayle's career as a choreographer: Dayton Contemporary Dance Company in "Rainbow 'Round My Shoulder" (1959); Ronald K. Brown/Evidence in "Songs of the Disinherited" (1972); and Juilliard Dance in "Crossing the Rubicon" (2017).
Further widening the Taylor circle, the season features a premiere by Kyle Abraham and recent works by Margie Gillis and Pam Tanowitz, who expertly mines Taylor's style to accentuate its idiosyncrasies. Nov. 17 brings the final performances of three longtime company members: Michelle Fleet, Jamie Rae Walker and Parisa Khobdeh. SIOBHAN BURKE

Film: Searching for a New Homeland in 'Synonyms'
Oct. 25.
When the Israeli filmmaker Nadav Lapid was around 22, shortly after finishing his military service, he packed up his stuff and fled to Paris, certain that he was at heart European and had been born by mistake in the Middle East. Once in France, he learned the language, he recalled, by obsessively studying a dictionary of synonyms.
That's the genesis for his loosely autobiographical "Synonyms," which Manohla Dargis of The New York Times called "a furious, at times splenetically funny squirm-a-thon," and critics have hailed as unmissable.
Tom Mercier, exhilarating in his feature debut, plays Yoav, who, not long after arriving in Paris, finds his Airbnb ransacked and his belongings stolen, and prepares to freeze to death in a bathtub -- only to be rescued by a gorgeous young French couple (Quentin Dolmaire and Louise Chevillotte) living beneath him. But Paris, as Yoav discovers wandering its streets and spewing out words with similar meanings ("nasty, abominable, odious, lamentable") is no more welcoming than the country he left behind.
"Synonyms," opening in New York on Oct. 25 before a national rollout, won the Golden Bear for best feature at the Berlin International Film Festival. KATHRYN SHATTUCK
Classical Music: A Marathon of Electric Guitars
Oct. 27; ditherquartet.com .
The new-music marathon has long been a storied format for adventurous composers and ensembles. In recent years, the electric guitar quartet Dither has launched its own long-form musical festivals, the seventh of which arrives at Brooklyn's Frost Theater of the Arts on Sunday.
Titled "The Dither Extravaganza!" the marathon centers around sets by the quartet, which has a raucously groovy new album out Nov. 1 on New Focus Recordings, featuring sharp-edged works by composers such as Eve Beglarian and Ted Hearne as well as ensemble members themselves.
The extravaganza's programming broadens: the mezzo Alicia Hall Moran will sing some of her own works; the Mivos Quartet plays music by the experimentalist Linda Catlin Smith; and the composer-performer Shelley Washington will blast on her baritone saxophone. There's more, too, making for a total of seven hours of mind-bending music. WILLIAM ROBIN
Art: A Sculptor's Unsettling Insights
Oct. 29-Dec. 21; hauserwirth.com .
I've been thinking about Alina Szapocznikow's dismembered body parts for years. A Polish-born, concentration-camp survivor who found her way to Paris after the war, Szapocznikow died of cancer in 1973, at 46. Before she did, she made goofy desk lamps with bright red lips on them; piles of polyester resin breasts; and a cast of her own jaw with cigarette butts embedded in it.
Comic and disconcerting, these pieces leavened surrealist techniques with a critical woman's perspective. They also found a way to address both the Nazi Holocaust and the dehumanizing violence of misogyny with the same insouciance. "To Exalt the Ephemeral: Alina Szapocznikow, 1962-1972," at Hauser & Wirth in Manhattan, will not be a show to miss. WILL HEINRICH
Theater: Shakespeare's Boy in 'Hamnet'
Oct. 30-Nov. 3, bam.org .
So many plays about fathers and sons owe a debt to "Hamlet," Shakespeare's tragedy about a prince mourning the death of his father, the king. When Shakespeare wrote it, he had reason to feel his own deep and recent grief -- not for a parent but for his only son, Hamnet, who died at age 11 in 1596.
"Hamnet," a play from the Dublin- and London-based theater company Dead Centre, stars 11-year-old Aran Murphy in the title role, onstage alone. Through video, Hamnet meets and converses with Shakespeare, the father who was so absent from his childhood. The Irish Independent newspaper described the show, written and directed by Bush Moukarzel and Ben Kidd, as "an extraordinarily fascinating and moving disposition on the meaning of life and particularly of death." It comes to the Brooklyn Academy of Music's Next Wave festival for five performances, starting on Wednesday at BAM Fisher. LAURA COLLINS-HUGHES

TV: Acorn's Super Sleuth Returns
Oct. 28; acorn.tv .
Praise be to women of a certain age. And while plenty of attention will be heaped this week on Kathryn Hahn's portrayal of a divorced empty-nester confronting her sexual reawakening in HBO's "Mrs. Fletcher," consider stirring Mrs. Raisin into the mix.
"Agatha Raisin & the Haunted House," debuting Oct. 28 on Acorn TV, finds M.C. Beaton's London publicist turned Cotswolds sleuth -- played by the fizzy, delightfully tart Ashley Jensen -- entering her own age of enlightenment: Now reunited with her lost love, James Lacey (Jamie Glover), she has just opened a detective business. To drum up publicity, she investigates an eerie mansion owned by an imperious blue-blood despised by practically everyone. And before her Skittles-colored wardrobe and orange-slice lip gloss has evaporated from the mist, murder has once again stained the cobblestones of Carsely Village.
Jensen will bring her frothy slapstick, like an adult version of Scooby-Doo, to three more mysteries next year to round out Season 3. KATHRYN SHATTUCK

Texto completo: In a small fit of pique wrapped inside the giant fit of pique that is his presidency, Donald Trump, furious about impeachment-related scoops, is cancelling all White House subscriptions to the New York Times and Washington Post.
And, never content to shoot with a beretta when a bazooka is handy, he is ordering federal agencies to follow suit.
We shudder to think how much more impulsive and ignorant Trump's decisionmaking will get now that he is blinding himself and his team to excellent reporting by excellent journalists.
And we sympathize with our reporter colleagues. There was a time when developer Donald Trump not only read the Daily News religiously, but called, often under false names, begging for coverage in our pages. Right after becoming president, he started ignoring The News because, reported Axios, "he thought it treated him shabbily."
The man who ordered the code red isn't supposed to be the one who can't handle the truth.

Heisler: Lakers have hopes, but Clippers are seeing dreams come true

Texto completo: We’re off and running in the capital of professional basketball.
It’s not just local fans who think that way with the Lakers back … they hope … and the Clippers at unprecedented heights of expectation.
All NBA metrics point this way. So many media outlets have moved correspondents here, the Wall Street Journal’s Jason Gay called Los Angeles “the Hemingway’s Paris of NBA dorks.”
Meanwhile, StubHub listed the leaue’s most in-demand teams, which started with:
1. Lakers.
2. Clippers.
As it turned out when No. 1 played No. 2, it was no contest. The opener was a Clippers home game – and one of the most eagerly awaited in franchise history – but so many Lakers fans bought up the place, TNT’s Reggie Miller guessed they made up two-thirds of the crowd.
When the Clippers brought Kawhi Leonard out before tipoff to welcome the crowd, there were audible jeers.
Leonard already knew the deal here. When he was shown on the Jumbotron at a recent Rams game, he was booed a lot more loudly there.
Not that hurt feelings proved a problem. Kawhi outscored the supposed prince of the city, LeBron James, 30-18, as the Clippers eased to a 112-102 victory.
James sniffed afterward, “It’s not a rivalry,” which is correct. The teams are playing for an NBA title, not local bragging rights, which are soon forgotten, even if it wasn’t the most gracious thing Bron could have said under the circumstances.
Of course, it’s a good thing for the Lakers it’s not a rivalry because they’d be losing it, having gone 5-24 against their crosstown, uh, neighbors since the start of the 2012-13 season – so long ago that Kobe Bryant and Dwight Howard were here.
Last week’s handful of games is, of course, only that, offering no proofs.
Nevertheless, however mixed the portents, they sum up the local teams’ relative positions.
The Lakers have reason to hope again with Anthony Davis’ arrival confirming their status as a destination for stars.
They retain their place as local darlings after decades of excellence, above not only the ugly duckling Clippers but the market’s old-time faves, the Dodgers and Rams.
The Clippers have most of the advantages that have been earned lately, starting with a managerial mismatch.
From an afterthought run by Coach Doc Rivers doing double duty, the Clippers have built the NBA’s hottest front office with GM Lawrence Frank and consultant Jerry West, with a deep staff of highly regarded young officials like Michael Winger and Trent Redden who turned down offers from other teams.
Meanwhile, the Lakers have to show they’re past last spring’s meltdown when Magic Johnson fled and Jeanie Buss and her friends and family took over.
Lakers fans still wince at the thought of West yearning to return in 2017, being left out in the cold and going, instead, to the Clippers.
Suggesting that unrest continued to bubble last summer, Jerry’s son, Ryan, another highly regarded young Lakers staffer, joined the Clippers.
Oh, and Ty Lue, the Lakers’ top coaching candidate before turning them down, is now an assistant on Doc Rivers’ staff.
The Clippers are deeper than the Lakers … and perhaps everyone else … with everyone solid in their roles from Patrick Beverley, Landry Shamet and Ivica Zubac to Lou Williams and Montrezl Harrell.
Leonard slides seamlessly into his role as the starters’ missing No. 1 option, able to create shots out of nothing.
The injured Paul George, another two-way star, will add his own dimension upon his return with voluminous three-point shooting – he was No. 3 in makes last season, behind James Harden and Steph Curry – that will keep the floor spread wide open.
At the end of halves and fourth quarters, Kawhi and PG will meld with the crack second unit led by Sweet Lou and Trez.
Old dynamics are changing in the West. Five-time defending conference champion Golden State had dominated the Clippers, but that’s over as the Clips showed, routing the Warriors 141-122 in the opening of sparkling, stunned Chase Arena.
“This is not a one-off,” Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. “This is the reality.”
The Lakers, meanwhile, will need time with a new coaching staff and nine new players, experimenting with James at point guard while awaiting the return of key pieces Kyle Kuzma and Rajon Rondo.
This means showing the necessary poise, although they couldn’t have set the bar much lower.
It was a year ago at this time that they started 1-4 and Johnson called coach Luke Walton in for a loud reproach that the press reported, decibel by decibel, turning Luke into a lame duck.
We still don’t know the whole story, but LeBron’s agent, Rich Paul, was already criticizing Walton privately but widely, including to Commissioner Adam Silver, who acknowledged it (“I think he said something along the lines that ‘Luke Walton is not the right guy to coach LeBron.’”)
This almost certainly came from James and was conveyed to Johnson, which is presumably what tripped out Magic into airing out Luke, and there went their season.
In other words, Frank Vogel had better not take his time to get this working, or do stuff Bron doesn’t like.
Everywhere but here, the rise of the underdog Clippers is as big a story as the saga of the once-majestic Lakers – or bigger.
Eight New York Times writers, asked to make predictions, all picked the Clippers to come out of the West.
Four of the eight picked the Clippers to win the title, with three picking the 76ers.
Five picked Frank to be executive of the year.
Five picked Williams as sixth man of the year and one picked Harrell.
With all the local star power, the New York Times, Washington Post, USA Today, The Athletic, Fox and NBA.com have moved correspondents here. ESPN has an entire bureau on the beat.
“These days, almost every shoe meeting happens in L.A.,” The Ringer’s Bryan Curtis wrote. “Nearly every free-agent courtship is conducted in L.A., whether the team is based here or not. In June, the Timberwolves’ unsuccessful wooing of D’Angelo Russell included a helicopter flight over the city.”
For sure, this is where it’s happening.
Now, to see what “it” is.

So says Reader's Digest in its November 2019 edition, which featured this headline: “50 Nicest Places in America.”
A town or city was chosen in each of the 50 states, with a city in Ohio called Columbiana finishing first in the country.
Resident Kellie Cholette nominated Pembroke for the honor, writing to the magazine, “This town is just a very tight-knit community and everyone I've met has been the nicest.”
The process included a nationwide search and more than 1,000 entries, which all had a common characteristic, a required criteria needed to make the cut: “Where people are kind and civility is winning,” according to Reader's Digest.
Once the nominations had been submitted, Reader's Digest editors and a panel of judges that included journalist David Brooks selected their favorite entries. Before anyone cries bias, that would be New York Times op-ed columnist David Brooks, not Concord Monitor science columnist David Brooks.
A nationwide poll attracted more than 45,000 votes, and Pembroke emerged as the winner in the Granite State, according to Reader's Digest.
Cholette's nomination letter said she and her significant other discovered nothing but kindness and camaraderie after they moved to Pembroke, writing, “My fiance and I were having a hard time viewing the fireworks from our house. Our neighbors spotted this and instantly got chairs out for us to sit with them.”
Cholette also cited the warmth surrounding Pembroke Old Home Day, an annual summer event with an array of activities: live music, hayrides, inflatable slides, bouncy houses, arts and crafts, mini-golf, tractor pulling, basketball tournaments, antique cars and those aforementioned fireworks.
Wrote Cholette, “We also have an old man about 80 years old that goes around streets near him and takes out your trash barrels if you forget and then will put them back once the garbage men come around.”
The town is home to a couple who adopted two neglected boys from a Ukrainian orphanage and addressed their developmental challenges before adopting two more; and a lawn-care professional who heard about a single mother's fight against cancer and began mowing her lawn in the summer and plowing her driveway in the winter. No charge, of course.
The Monitor wrote about Bridget Kelley Nafranowicz and her plowing and mowing angel, Bob Caruso, in February.
Elsewhere, Cholette mentioned nearly $20,000 that was raised through local donations after a family's home was destroyed by fire.
Cholette also cited a pair of Pembroke Academy sports teams as further proof that her town deserved to win.
The boys' basketball team won the state championship without any player averaging more than 17 points per game.
Player Sean Menard told the Monitor last winter, “We've got four or five guys who can put up 20 shots in a game. But we like to give up shots for the other person.”
And when the school's cross-country coach was diagnosed with cancer, her runners organized a 5-kilometer run to help pay her medical bills, an event that was held annually for three years, until the coach died.
A critic on a message-board cited the opioid crisis and addiction as a drawback to the town, but that's a problem affecting large sections of the country.
The rest of the messages were overwhelmingly favorable. And while many towns in New Hampshire have their own warm and welcoming Old Home Day celebrations, Cholette's nomination had enough good stories to propel Pembroke to the top of the family magazine's rankings.
And for good reason, residents said.
“I have lived in Pembroke for most of my life,” wrote Jonna Gaskell. “I've raised my children in this town and my husband is a police officer in this town. I could not be any prouder of each and every person that lives here. It is a tight-knit community.
“It is family.”

Bezos jumps into NASA moon landing project

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - The race is on to build the next spacecraft that will land American astronauts on the moon - and the richest man in the world wants to come in first.
Three major aerospace companies led by Blue Origin, the rocket company started by Jeff Bezos, chief executive of Amazon, announced this week that they would collaborate on a design that they will submit to NASA.
The Trump administration has accelerated the U.S. effort to return to the moon by four years, aiming at 2024 instead of 2028. Private companies are central to this faster timeline, which has driven NASA to turn to nimble startups, like Bezos' Blue Origin. His company, working with other powerhouse corporations, would not only build spacecraft for the agency but also replace NASA in designing them, too, and all at a fixed price.
The hope is that these companies will get the job done faster for less money.
By partnering with Lock-heed Martin, Northrop Grumman and Draper Laboratory, Blue Origin, founded by a billionaire with grand space dreams, will gain skills and experience it lacks. Such a partnership puts Bezos' company on a footing to take a leading role in U.S. efforts to return astronauts to the moon.
"This is the only way to get back to the moon fast," Bezos said Tuesday as he accepted an award from the International Aeronautical Federation.
The inflow of dollars - not just from billionaires, but also venture capitalists and institutional investors - has altered the space industry, said Mary Lynne Dittmar, executive director of the Coalition for Deep Space Exploration, a space advocacy group. Some of the companies now have the resources to develop and build entire systems, like a lunar lander.
"Once you start doing that, then NASA can start leveraging that," Dittmar said.
While NASA has been working on a big rocket known as the Space Launch System and a capsule called Orion for human missions to deep space, it had not yet started on a lunar lander.
In the past, NASA has led the design process and used what are known as cost-plus contracts. The companies were reimbursed for what they paid to build the spacecraft plus an additional fee for their services. But increasingly, NASA is using a markedly different approach with fixed-price contracts.
In contrast to Apollo, in which the giant Saturn 5 rocket carried all of the pieces needed for a moon landing, NASA this time will employ a more complex choreography for the new missions, named Artemis. (In Greek mythology, Artemis is the twin sister of Apollo.)
First, NASA will construct an outpost called Gateway that will orbit the moon. Then the pieces of the landing system will be sent to the Gateway.
The landing system will consist of three pieces - a module that moves the astronauts and the other pieces of the lander from the Gateway to an orbit much closer to the moon; a descent module that guides the lander to the lunar surface; and an ascent module that lifts the astronauts back into space after their stay on the moon.
When all of the pieces are in the place, the astronauts are to launch in an Orion capsule atop a Space Launch System rocket to the Gateway where they will board the lander for the moon. They are expscted to land near the moon's south pole.
NASA is working on compressed timelines, with submissions for the lander contract due Nov. 1. And some companies realized that they might not have all the pieces to put together a strong proposal.
Blue Origin does not yet have experience with sending people to space. It has so far only tested a small reusable rocket and capsule to carry tourists to the edge of space. The company has been working for several years on the Blue Moon lander, but it was originally designed for taking heavy cargo, not people, to the moon.
At the same time, Lockheed Martin, which is building the Orion capsule, had concentrated on a lunar ascent module. "We strongly believe that the best way to safely and quickly accomplish this lunar landing is to leverage existing human-rated technology from Orion," said Lisa Callahan, vice president and general manager for commercial civil space at Lockheed Martin.
Northrop Grumman - the Grumman part of the company built the Apollo lunar lander 50 years ago - thought that its Cygnus spacecraft, which carries cargo to the International Space Station, could be adapted to serve as the orbital transfer module.
There will most likely be other* proposals, notably from Boeing, the biggest space company not part of the Blue Origin partnership. A Boeing spokesman said in an email statement, "We are working on lander systems development under NASA contracts from summer and expect to put in a bid for the lander program."
More than one team will probably advance to the next round of the competition.

Why conservatives should stop being cheerleaders for Tulsi Gabbard

Texto completo: It's easy to like Rep. Tulsi Gabbard. Her calm delivery and non-elitist persona is a sharp contrast to her fellow 2020 candidates, especially when on the debate stage. While others like Sen. Bernie Sanders and Beto O'Rourke loudly compete for who can be the most extreme, she presents herself as a moderate alternative.
Gabbard is less well-known than other, decidedly controversial Democrats. Throughout the campaign, her abysmal poll numbers have hovered around the 2% mark. But while she is not a legitimate election threat, she has gained the admiration of a portion of voters on the right. Her recent tussle with Hillary Clinton, where she defended herself against the claim of being a "Russian asset," only increased Gabbard's popularity. Republicans, eternally frustrated with Hillary, are eager to defend her. Many Democrats, aware that Clinton's comments in no way help their 2020 chances, have done the same.
As personalities go, Gabbard appeals to a vast majority. But in terms of policy, she is as radical as the rest of the Democratic presidential hopefuls.
While she does support Second Amendment rights, Gabbard is a vocal proponent of banning assault-style weapons. As a co-sponsor of H.R. 5087, introduced in the House last year, she is publicly acknowledging her belief that removing certain weapons would be a fruitful and productive step in the fight against gun violence.
But as David French noted at National Review at the time the bill was introduced: "We know it would burden the self-defense rights of law-abiding Americans without meaningfully addressing the problems it’s purportedly designed to address. We know it wouldn’t affect overall gun death rates. We don’t have evidence it would prevent mass shootings." With her stance on assault weapons, Gabbard blends in seamlessly with other leftists and their ideas concerning gun control.
Gabbard may seem more down to earth than Sanders, but when it comes to funding higher education, she is fully on board with his ultra-left plan. Sanders' College for All Act, introduced in 2017, is a liberal's dream. Removing tuition and fees from undergraduate public higher education would be a big price tag for both the federal and state governments. According to Sanders, the bill would involve the following:
"This legislation would provide $47 billion per year to states to eliminate undergraduate tuition and fees at public colleges and universities. Today, total tuition at public colleges and universities amounts to about $70 billion per year. Under the College for All Act, the federal government would cover 67% of this cost, while the states would be responsible for the remaining 33% of the cost. In addition, colleges and universities must reduce their reliance on low-paid adjunct faculty."
With a full one-third of the responsibility on states and restrictions on the hiring of faculty, the proposed legislation is a bloated, big-government nightmare. Still, many Democrats, including Gabbard, support it without reservation.
One of the most disturbing aspects of Gabbard's platform is her attitude toward abortion. In a September appearance on The Rubin Report, Tulsi announced her personal, "more libertarian" position on the issue stating, "I think there should be some restrictions, though."
This would be an encouraging departure from her fellow Democrats if Gabbard allowed her private views to inform her public ones. But unfortunately, she does not. As she states in the interview, "I don’t believe that I should be telling anybody else the kinds of decisions that they should make for themselves or their family and therefore a woman should have the right to choose and I will stand up and fight to protect her right to do so." This varies in no way whatsoever from the other Democratic candidates who refuse to publicly protect life in the womb. Gabbard holds a 100% score from NARAL, having voted against a 20-week abortion ban in 2017 and against the idea of legally protected fetal personhood in 2018. In all the ways that she could make a difference for the unborn, she fails entirely.
Along with these leftist positions, Gabbard also wants to do away with the Electoral College, shut down current nuclear power plants, drastically reduce our defense budget, and look into possible reparations.
A conservative, Tulsi Gabbard most certainly is not.
Gabbard's affable demeanor and recent battle with Hillary Clinton have won her some fans. However, once you look past temperament and adversaries, the substance of her beliefs is just as misguided as the rest of the Democratic pack.
Conservatives may be tempted to defend Tulsi against well-established and corrupt foes, but while doing so, they must remember that the enemy of your enemy is definitely not your friend.

Texto completo: The sixth Democratic debate will reportedly be held in Los Angeles and hosted by PBS and Politico on Dec. 19.
The debate will come less than two months before the Iowa caucuses, but the exact date of the event is not yet known, according to NBC News.
Politico said Friday that in order to qualify, "candidates must either receive 4% or more support in at least four qualifying national polls or single-state polls in Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina, and/or Nevada; or receive 6% or more support in two qualifying single-state polls in Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and/or Nevada."
Candidates also must receive donations from at least 200,000 unique donors and have a minimum of 800 unique donors per state in at least 20 U.S. states.
Democratic National Committee chairman Tom Perez said last year that Democrats were hoping to hold a dozen debates before a nominee is chosen, six in 2019 and six more in 2020.
The next debate is slated for Nov. 20 and will be hosted by MSNBC and the Washington Post in Georgia, and moderated by a panel of all women. So far, nine of the candidates have qualified for the event.
According to a RealClearPolitics national average of polls, former Vice President Joe Biden currently leads Sen. Elizabeth Warren in the polls 27.2% to 21.8%, with South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg trailing with 7% support.

Texto completo: Tras la captura y liberación de Ovidio Guzmán López , el Ratón o el Nuevo Ratón , hijo del narcotraficante Joaquín “ el Chapo ” Guzmán , Mike Vigil, exfuncionario de la DEA, aseguró que el gobierno de México no está diciendo la verdad sobre el dicho operativo.
Según el exjefe de operaciones internacionales de la Administración Estadounidense de Cumplimiento de las Leyes sobre las Drogas (DEA, por sus siglas en inglés), el gobierno del presidente Andrés Manuel López Obrado r (AMLO) no ha revelado que, al intentar detener a Ovidio Guzmán López, las fuerzas de seguridad atraparon a otro hijo del Chapo Guzmán: Iván Archivaldo Guzmán Salazar, el Chapito.

En entrevista para The New York Times, Vigil señaló que el Chapito había sido detenido y liberado cuando hombres armados se impusieron a las autoridades mexicanas, el exfuncionario de la DEA citó “altas fuentes policiales de México”, versión que coincide con otra entrevista que dicho medio publicó a solo un día de lo ocurrido.
A decir de la publicación, ‘ El Chapito ‘ habría sido detenido inicialmente pero pudo escapar según fuentes pues un grupo de sicarios superó a las fuerzas militares mexicanas.

“Una vez libre, el hermano mayor orquestó una asombrosa muestra de fuerza para conseguir la liberación de su hermano, Ovidio”, se lee en la nota en del New York Times en inglés.
“La acción no sólo consistió en tomar como rehenes a los soldados, sino en secuestrar a sus familias, de acuerdo con las dos personas informadas sobre el asunto, quienes no estaban autorizadas a hablar públicamente”, señaló el periódico.
Según versiones que circularon el día de lo ocurrido pero que no han sido desmentidas ni confirmadas por autoridades, sicarios del Cártel de Sinaloa tenían la orden de asesinar a familiares de elementos castrenses, de los cuales habían obtenido direcciones en caso de que no se llegara a ningún acuerdo para la liberación del hijo del Chapo Guzmán .

Texto completo: Tras la captura y liberación de Ovidio Guzmán López , el Ratón o el Nuevo Ratón , hijo del narcotraficante Joaquín “ el Chapo ” Guzmán , Mike Vigil, exfuncionario de la DEA, aseguró que el gobierno de México no está diciendo la verdad sobre el dicho operativo.
Según el exjefe de operaciones internacionales de la Administración Estadounidense de Cumplimiento de las Leyes sobre las Drogas (DEA, por sus siglas en inglés), el gobierno del presidente Andrés Manuel López Obrado r (AMLO) no ha revelado que, al intentar detener a Ovidio Guzmán López, las fuerzas de seguridad atraparon a otro hijo del Chapo Guzmán: Iván Archivaldo Guzmán Salazar, el Chapito.

En entrevista para The New York Times, Vigil señaló que el Chapito había sido detenido y liberado cuando hombres armados se impusieron a las autoridades mexicanas, el exfuncionario de la DEA citó “altas fuentes policiales de México”, versión que coincide con otra entrevista que dicho medio publicó a solo un día de lo ocurrido.
A decir de la publicación, ‘ El Chapito ‘ habría sido detenido inicialmente pero pudo escapar según fuentes pues un grupo de sicarios superó a las fuerzas militares mexicanas.

“Una vez libre, el hermano mayor orquestó una asombrosa muestra de fuerza para conseguir la liberación de su hermano, Ovidio”, se lee en la nota en del New York Times en inglés.
“La acción no sólo consistió en tomar como rehenes a los soldados, sino en secuestrar a sus familias, de acuerdo con las dos personas informadas sobre el asunto, quienes no estaban autorizadas a hablar públicamente”, señaló el periódico.
Según versiones que circularon el día de lo ocurrido pero que no han sido desmentidas ni confirmadas por autoridades, sicarios del Cártel de Sinaloa tenían la orden de asesinar a familiares de elementos castrenses, de los cuales habían obtenido direcciones en caso de que no se llegara a ningún acuerdo para la liberación del hijo del Chapo Guzmán .

The Navy SEALs have a problem with ethics and professionalism

Texto completo: The Navy SEAL commando force is the stuff of legend, lionized for the raid that killed Osama bin Laden, rescuing an American sea captain from Somali pirates and fighting to the death in the mountains of Afghanistan in the "Lone Survivor" story.
This summer, however, the commander of this vaunted band of war fighters warned about an ethical and professional crisis in the ranks. "We have a problem," Rear Adm. Collin Green wrote in a letter to the troops. "Some of our subordinate formations have failed to maintain good order and discipline and as a result and for good reason, our (Naval Special Warfare) culture is being questioned."
There was cocaine abuse in a SEAL team based in Virginia. Two SEALs were accused of killing a U.S. soldier in a hazing in North Africa. Another SEAL allegedly raped an American female service member during a drunken party in Iraq.
And then there was the case of Navy SEAL Edward Gallagher.
A combat veteran with the nickname Blade – who said he craved combat and the chance to "kill as many people as possible," according to The New York Times – Gallagher was accused by members of his platoon of battlefield atrocities in Iraq while fighting the Islamic State terrorist group in 2017.
The allegations included shooting Iraqi civilians from a sniper's nest, firing indiscriminately into neighborhoods with a heavy machine gun, and using a custom-made knife to stab a teenage captive to death before posing with the corpse for a photograph.
The Navy was slow to investigate, and the prosecution's case began falling apart even before trial amid concerns about witness intimidation. Gallagher, who had become the darling of right-wing commentators, was acquitted in July on all charges except the one dealing with posing with a dead body.
Then President Donald Trump entered the picture.
The commander in chief, who has advocated torture and taken a keen interest in pardoning troops convicted of war crimes, complained in a tweet this month that "we train our boys to be killing machines, then prosecute them when they kill!"
He followed Gallagher's case, even discussing it with senior Navy officials. According to The Times, the Navy was faced with a dilemma: It could kick Gallagher out of the SEALs to help restore good order and discipline, but risk a reversal by Trump that would effectively emasculate SEAL leadership. So no action has been taken.
Last week, former Navy SEAL and retired Adm. William McRaven – the highly respected architect of the bin Laden raid – reflected in a column about America's military ethos.
"The Greatest Generation went to war because it believed that we were the good guys," he wrote. "We are the most powerful nation ... because we try to be the good guys."
But with Gallaghers in the ranks and a president in their corner, is the United States still the good guys?

Texto completo: Our guide to plays and musicals coming to New York stages and a few last-chance picks of shows that are about to close. Our reviews of open shows are at nytimes.com/reviews/theater.
Previews & Openings
'A BRIGHT ROOM CALLED DAY' at the Public Theater (previews start on Oct. 29; opens on Nov. 19). Another fantasia on national themes, Tony Kushner's time-vaulting play returns to the Public. The original drew parallels between the Weimar Republic and Reagan-era America. This new version wrenches the action toward the present. Under Oskar Eustis's direction, Nikki M. James, Crystal Lucas-Perry and Jonathan Hadary star.
212-967-7555, publictheater.org
'BROADBEND, ARKANSAS' at the Duke on 42nd Street (previews start on Oct. 25; opens on Nov. 10). A two-character, three-generation, five-decade-spanning musical, this new work from Ellen Fitzhugh, Harrison David Rivers and Ted Shen is produced by Transport Group. Justin Cunningham and Danyel Fulton star as members of an African-American family who navigate autonomy and prejudice in distinct eras. Jack Cummings III directs.
646-223-3010, transportgroup.org
'FOR ALL THE WOMEN WHO THOUGHT THEY WERE MAD' at Soho Rep (in previews; opens on Oct. 27). Eight times each week, the writer and actress Zawe Ashton stays sane portraying a love triangle's hypotenuse in Harold Pinter's "Betrayal." In "For All the Women Who Thought They Were Mad," the play she wrote about the impact of colonialism on the women of the African diaspora, some of the characters aren't as lucky. Whitney White directs.
866-811-4111, sohorep.org
'MACBETH' at Classic Stage Company (in previews; opens on Oct. 27). Scholars have argued that Macbeth and his lady have one of the better marriages in Shakespeare's canon, for a while anyway. Can Corey Stoll and Nadia Bowers survive it? The married actors star in John Doyle's revival of the supernatural tragedy, with Erik Lochtefeld and Mary Beth Peil.
866-811-4111, classicstage.org
'THE MICHAELS' at the Public Theater (in previews; opens on Oct. 27). The playwright Richard Nelson pulls up a chair at another Rhinebeck, N.Y., table. Having written about the Apples and the Gabriels, Nelson infiltrates a new, invented upstate family, the Michaels, this one headed by a lauded choreographer (Brenda Wehle). Nelson regulars Maryann Plunkett and Jay O. Sanders also star.
212-967-7555, publictheater.org
'ON THAT DAY IN AMSTERDAM' at the Cherry Lane Theater (previews start on Oct. 29; opens on Nov. 19). After meeting at a gay club in Amsterdam, two young men visit Rembrandt's house and the Van Gogh Museum as problems of love and migration loom. Abubakr Ali, Jeffrey Omura, Frankie J. Alvarez, Andy Lucien and Rocky Vega star in Clarence Coo's play, directed by Kareem Fahmy for Primary Stages.
866-811-4111, primarystages.org
[Read about the events that our other critics have chosen for the week ahead.]
'SEARED' at the Robert W. Wilson MCC Theater Space (in previews; opens on Oct. 28). How do you like your restaurant comedies? Raw? Well done? Extra crispy? The playwright Theresa Rebeck and the director Moritz von Stuelpnagel introduce a show about a chef who is worried about selling out while his business partner is just interested in selling. Raúl Esparza and Krysta Rodriguez star.
212-727-7722, mcctheater.org
'THE UNDERLYING CHRIS' at the Tony Kiser Theater at Second Stage Theater (previews start on Oct. 29; opens on Nov. 21). Will Eno, a playwright who packs big emotions and big ideas into small nondescript packages, returns with a new play. Inspired in part by his young daughter, it is a meditation on identity and the things that make and mar us. Kenny Leon directs a cast that includes Hannah Cabell and Michael Countryman.
212-246-4422, 2st.com
'A WOMAN OF THE WORLD' at 59E59 Theaters (in previews; opens on Oct. 30). When death kindly stopped for Emily Dickinson, the task of editing of her poems fell to the writer and editor Mabel Loomis Todd. In this new play from Rebecca Gilman, directed by Valentina Fratti for the Acting Company and starring the perpetually radiant Kathleen Chalfant, Loomis Todd, late in life, invites audiences to her Maine home.
646-892-7999, 59e59.org
Last Chance
'BEAUTIFUL: THE CAROLE KING MUSICAL' at the Stephen Sondheim Theater (closes on Oct. 27). Before it's too late, baby, you can see this 2014 musical, which is ending its Broadway run. The show follows Carole King, now played by Sarah Bockel, from her teen mom days as a breakout Brill Building songwriter to her post-divorce triumph. Ben Brantley called it a "friendly, formulaic bio-musical."
212-239-6200, beautifulonbroadway.com


'LINDA VISTA' at the Hayes Theater (closes on Nov. 10). Tracy Letts's comedy about a toxic middle-aged man heads into its final performances. Ian Barford stars as Wheeler, a shambling seducer sucker-punched by his own comeuppance. Ben Brantley wrote that this "very funny, equally unsettling" production from Steppenwolf Theater, directed by Dexter Bullard, "includes several gut-wrenching occasions when Barford's Wheeler flips his appealingly grouchy persona to reveal a black hole of ugly, flailing, desperate narcissism."
2st.com
'VICTOR' at Axis Theater (closes on Oct. 26). Edgar Oliver's new solo show, a chronicle of his friendship and love affair with a homeless man, closes its doors. According to Ben Brantley, Oliver is "a sui generis bard of urban solitude," who conjures an East Village "as cozy as Sherwood Anderson's 'Winesburg, Ohio,' and as otherworldly as a fairy-tale forest from the Brothers Grimm."

Texto completo: Actor and best-selling author John Lithgow skewers President Donald Trump in “Dumpty," his new collection of satirical verse. Inspired by A.A. Milne, Lewis Carroll and even Rodgers and Hammerstein, Lithgow's rhymes chronicle the president's first two tumultuous years in office. Lithgow's long acting career has included starring in the hit television series “Third Rock from the Sun" and portraying Winston Churchill in the Netflix hit “The Crown."
BOOKS: What are you reading currently?
LITHGOW: Just two days ago I finished “She Said: Breaking the Sexual Harassment Story That Helped Ignite a Movement" by the New York Times reporters Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey, which was just fabulous. Now I'm reading a wonderful book by the English actor Stephen Fry called “Mythos." He tells all the stories of Greek mythology in this zippy, sassy, popular culture way. I've never been able to keep track of all those gods, titans and mortals born of gods, so I plunged right in.
BOOKS: What was your last best read?
LITHGOW: Anne Patchett's new book, “The Dutch House."I wrote her a fan email after I read “Commonwealth" and we became email friends. She sends me books that she recommends. I've discovered some wonderful writers through her, such as Maile Meloy. Anne sent me her story collection “Both Ways is the Only Way I Want It," which is just sensational. She also sent me a wonderful book of stories by Kevin Wilson, “Baby, You're Gonna Be Mine."He's got the greatest voice.
BOOKS: Do you lean more toward fiction or nonfiction?
LITHGOW: Definitely fiction. I read about 80% women novelists. I don't know why that would be. Jane Smiley, Anne Tyler, and Elizabeth Strout. I've read a few books by all those women. My goddaughter is Nell Freudenberger, who is an estimable novelist. She has a new book, “Lost and Wanted." I read everything she writes like a good godfather. I generally read nonfiction to prepare for a role. I recently read John Heilemann's “Game Change,"which is about the 2008 presidential election, because I was in the play “Hillary and Clinton" on Broadway. I read “The Loudest Voice in the Room" by Gabriel Sherman, which is about Roger Ailes whom I play in the new movie “Bombshell." To play Churchill in “The Crown" I read William Manchester's big biography, “The Last Lion."
BOOKS: Do you have a favorite literary character?
LITHGOW: I love the outrageous character of Sabbath in Philip Roth's “Sabbath's Theater." I love how George Saunders portrayed President Lincoln in “Lincoln in the Bardo." Basically great writing generates great characters.
BOOKS: What were your favorite classic authors when you studied literature at Harvard?
LITHGOW: I would say Dickens, Jane Austen, and George Eliot. I wrote my senior thesis on satire in Restoration comedy, so I read a lot of poetry and plays from 300 years ago. I rarely ever sit down to read a play for pleasure now but, god knows, I have read a lot of plays.
BOOKS: Are there any classic authors you didn't jibe with?
LITHGOW: “Moby Dick" was such a slog. I played the role of Don Quixote and felt like I had to read the novel by Cervantes. That was like reading the Bible. It was fantastic but it went all over the place. I'm not a great reader really. I'm slow, not persistent, and easily distracted. I have a book with me when I go to the movie set, and I'm lucky to read a paragraph. I'm in a social business, so you tend to sit around talking all day.
BOOKS: Then how do you read as much as you do?
LITHGOW: If a friend sends me a book, I'm grateful because it becomes like required reading for me. My friend David Maraniss sent me his memoir, “A Good American Family," about his father and the blacklist, which I dove into. Every year I go to Harvard and interview the Harvard Arts Medal winner. For that I've interviewed Margaret Atwood and Colson Whitehead so I needed to read their books. I really need an assignment to get off my ass and read. Then I'm relieved that someone made me do it.

Resumen: Filled with folksy advice, such as extolling the value of taking naps, the book was based in the simple lessons of childhood. According to Kimberly E. Schmidt, director of Judson Theatre and assistant professor of Speech Communication and Performing Arts, the university’s production interpretation might not fit the definition of a musical. The plays sticks to the stories contained in "Everything I Need to Know," as well as Fulghum’s other published books: "It Was on Fire When I Lay Down on It," "Uh-Oh, It’s Almost Christmas," and "Maybe, Maybe Not," with created monologues and scenes for the stage.

Texto completo: "Everything I Need to Know I Learned in Kindergarten" is a book made popular in the 1980s, but some are unaware of the play of the same name — or that it contains music. Judson University will present it at 7 p.m. Thursday through Saturday, Oct. 24-26, at Thulin Auditorium in Thompson Hall, on Judson’s Elgin campus, 1151 N. State St. Tickets are $5-$12.
The New York Times bestseller, written in 1986 by Robert Fulghum, has sold 7 million copies. Filled with folksy advice, such as extolling the value of taking naps, the book was based in the simple lessons of childhood.
In 1992, Fulghum worked with David Caldwell, a composer and musical director, to transform the essays into a musical.
According to Kimberly E. Schmidt, director of Judson Theatre and assistant professor of Speech Communication and Performing Arts, the university’s production interpretation might not fit the definition of a musical.
"There are four songs," said Schmidt, an Elgin resident. "One song opens act one and closes act one, and the same with act two. It’s billed as a play with music, not a full on musical."
The plays sticks to the stories contained in "Everything I Need to Know," as well as Fulghum’s other published books: "It Was on Fire When I Lay Down on It," "Uh-Oh, It’s Almost Christmas," and "Maybe, Maybe Not," with created monologues and scenes for the stage.
"It is a storytelling show in that each scene is complete in itself and tells its own story. It’s mostly one person telling the story and then other people come in an add to it," said Schmidt.
One of those bringing the story to the stage is Aneesah Phillips, a freshman at Judson from Bloomingdale.
"In one of the scenes, I play a kindergarten teacher," Phillips said. "In another, I’m a narrator, where I talk about a wedding that went terribly wrong at the last moment."
Phillips thinks people in all stages of life could look at the production as a refresher course in the basic life lessons that develop into road maps as time goes on.
"They seem to be simple lessons at first glance, but during troubles and facts of life we often forget they’re what we need," she said. "I think people of my age to 30 might benefit from this," adding that an older audience might find it insightful as well.
Schmidt said children will be entertained by the fast-moving vignettes.
"It’s totally family friendly," Schmidt said. "A child 8 or 9 (years old) would be able to enjoy it. The scenes are short, so they would be able to follow, pick up things and remember it."
"Everything I Need to Know I Learned in Kindergarten" was not Schmidt’s first choice. There was another play set to be produced, but Schmidt decided on another path after the recent violence in El Paso and California.
"I thought, ‘I don’t want to do anything dark. I want something happy and uplifting,’ and came across this," she said.
"It’s a lot of fun. It ranges from stories where people will almost be falling off their chairs to poignant and wiping a tear or two," she added.
"I want to ... feel good that here are good people in the world and the things that really matter in the world (are) our friends, our family and good people."
Other cast members include Amir Scott, Lydia Alpert, Malina Sanchez, Rose Wodeck, Jacob Choate, Spencer Armstrong, David Larsen and Rachel Rosborough.

Texto completo: There are few places in the United States where the fundamental building blocks of our democratic institutions are on full display.
The nation's capital is certainly one of those places. As is Colonial Williamsburg.
So thought then-President Ronald Reagan when he hosted the Group of 7 summit in 1983 in Williamsburg.
Each year, leaders from the world's seven largest economies meet to discuss financial policies. In May, the summit was held in the French seaside resort town of Biarritz. The United States is scheduled to again hold the meeting in 2020.
White House staff say they considered locations in California, Colorado, Florida, Hawaii, Michigan, North Carolina, Tennessee and Utah before President Donald Trump awarded the event to Trump National Doral, near Miami, last week.
His decision was met with scorn and derision. He has since relented and, at the time of publication, has not announced a new host site.
Let us help: Bring the G-7 back to Virginia, and specifically, to Hampton Roads.
Virginia is uniquely equipped to highlight the democratic principles that make America a special place to live, even on a grand scale the three-day G-7 demands.
A return to Colonial Williamsburg - or a number of other historic Virginia sites - would not be out of the question, especially considering the dialogues being had daily about the role of our democratic institutions in contemporary society.
Federal dollars would cover much of the cost required to accommodate as many as 7,000 people, including security personnel, news media, diplomats, heads of state and support staff, according to The New York Times. The host government also typically covers the cost of 20 hotel rooms per country.
But think of the impact of hosting that many people would have on the local economy. And, likewise, consider the stories of grandeur and historic significance that would reverberate through the international delegations as they returned to their respective countries.
In 1983, the summit effectively closed Colonial Williamsburg's historic area to the public and forced residents to conform to security protocols. But the sight of then-West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau strolling down Duke of Gloucester Street remain a provocative memory of longtime residents and frequent visitors.
Several thousand journalists and media technicians were on hand, and the College of William and Mary's William and Mary Hall (now Kaplan Arena) was designated the
International Press Center.
Sure, the 1983 event may have been a smaller affair, but more than 350 Secret Service agents were involved, along with 150-200 Virginia State Police as well as scores of local law enforcement offices. There also were security representatives from each of the foreign nations involved.
Virginia has hosted the G-7 before and it could do it again.
If Colonial Williamsburg is out of the question, then perhaps somewhere else in the region. The Virginia Beach Oceanfront or downtown Norfolk might be a stretch but meetings could be held in the former TRADOC buildings at Fort Monroe or world leaders could tour the battlefields at Yorktown as a part of the trip.
After all, nothing like showing the British prime minister a bit of our countries' shared history, right?
Hampton Roads has so much to offer that it seems foolhardy not to, at least, consider one of the many historic properties here.
While much can be said about President Trump's initial decision to hold the G-7 at Doral, he rightfully withdrew the award. He may also now consider Camp David, the famous presidential retreat in rural Maryland. President Barack Obama held the G-7 meeting there in 2012, the last time the leaders gathered in the United States.
Now, consider Hampton Roads as the 202 G-7 host. The region has done it before, and it certainly has the chops to do it again.
A version of this editorial appears in The Virginian-Pilot

The Lewd and Sexist Joke That Cost Nearly $2 Billion

Texto completo: Kenneth Fisher, a billionaire money manager, is known for aggressively marketing his firm and attaching his name to books, columns and TV ads.
His marketing acumen has helped build his investment firm into a significant player in the world of money management, managing more than $ 112 billion of investors' money, up from $ 33 billion a decade ago.
But now, Mr. Fisher has lost control of his media narrative, as he gets skewered over sexist and lewd remarks he made this month at a financial services industry conference in San Francisco. Mr. Fisher was slow to acknowledge that he had said anything wrong when he crudely compared the wooing of wealthy clients to trying to pick up a woman at a bar. The firestorm has renewed attention on past crude comments, as well as his criticism of President Abraham Lincoln for fighting the South over slavery.
The damage has been quick and costly. In the past two weeks, public pensions and institutional investors like Fidelity have pulled nearly $ 2 billion from his privately held firm, Fisher Investments, which is based near Portland, Ore., and has 3,500 employees.
The list of state and municipal retirement funds that have said they are severing ties with Mr. Fisher's firm includes ones from Michigan, Iowa and most recently a fund in New Hampshire. The three state pension funds alone have pulled roughly $ 1.2 billion from the firm.
"The sense was, essentially, there was no upside in staying with him," Marty Karlon, a spokesman for the New Hampshire Retirement System, said Tuesday. He added: "We don't support the comments in any way."
Other public pensions are putting Mr. Fisher's firm on a watch list for potential action.
Mr. Fisher's periodic column in USA Today even might be in jeopardy. "Ken Fisher's column is on hold pending review," said Chrissy Terrell, director of corporate communications for USA Today Network.
Mr. Fisher, 68, through a spokesman, declined to comment.
The backlash is an example of the repercussions executives face in a business world that no longer tolerates disparaging comments.
"In his mind, he probably just doesn't mean any harm. He literally doesn't get it," said Denise Shull, a former trader at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange who now serves as a performance coach to Wall Street money managers and corporate executives. "If he were my client, I would walk him through why he says these things and ask him what is he trying to accomplish."
The furor in the financial world began almost immediately after Mr. Fisher spoke at an Oct. 8 conference sponsored by Tiburon Strategic Advisors, where, according to Bloomberg News, he said getting new clients was akin to "trying to get into a girl's pants."
Mr. Fisher's initial response was to brush off the criticism. In an interview with Bloomberg the next day, he remarked that he had "said stuff like this" before and it had never caused a stir. But as the controversy grew, Mr. Fisher was forced to issue an apology, in which he said, "I realize this kind of language has no place in our company or industry."
In a separate statement to clients and employees, Damian Ornani, Fisher Investments' chief executive, said the firm valued diversity and was putting together a "diversity and inclusion task force." The letter, obtained by The New York Times, did not address Mr. Fisher's comments directly but referred to them as having "created an unnecessary distraction."
Over the years, Mr. Fisher has not been shy about making statements that have drawn scorn.
At a Reuters investment summit in December 2011, Mr. Fisher said entrepreneurs had contributed more to the country than any politician and he went on to rank Lincoln as one of the worst presidents. Mr. Fisher said that Lincoln had chosen war over negotiations with the slaveholding states in the South.
Just last year, Mr. Fisher offered up similar statements about Lincoln and slavery on Twitter. Forbes uncovered posts on Twitter in which Mr. Fisher said that Lincoln was his least favorite president and that everyone in the country, including African-Americans, would have been better off if slavery had been allowed to end "peacefully."
And CNBC obtained an audiotape of a 2018 conference in which Mr. Fisher compared selling a mutual fund to asking a woman in a bar for sex.
Mr. Fisher took an unconventional path to the upper echelons of the money management world. A native of San Francisco, he never worked at a traditional Wall Street firm and began his career in the private investment firm owned by his father, Philip A. Fisher, a well-known investor and author.
By 1979, Mr. Fisher struck out on his own, forming his own investment firm. He penned his first book, "Super Stocks," in 1984 and has written 10 more since.
The key to Mr. Fisher's success has been advertising and employing an army of salespeople to cold call investors, often relying on leads generated from internet responses. In a lawsuit 15 years ago, lawyers for Mr. Fisher said he had developed a marketing system that was "unique among asset management firms." At that time, Mr. Fisher's firm estimated it spent $ 14,000 to attract each of it customers.
Last year, Fisher Investments spent just over $ 68 million on advertising, and the firm ranks as the 12th-biggest ad spender in the financial services industry, according to Kantar, a data and consulting firm.
All that spending has attracted a robust client base for Mr. Fisher's firm, which manages about $ 60 billion for more than 65,000 individual investors -- the bulk of its clients. Before the furor erupted, public pensions and state and municipal governments accounted for roughly $ 11 billion of the firm's assets.
Fisher Investments has for several years been a client of Callan, a consulting firm that advises pensions and institutional investors about selecting money managers. A spokeswoman for Callan declined to discuss its relationship with Fisher Investments and its consulting work.
But NEPC, another influential pension consultant, issued a letter last Thursday recommending that its clients terminate holdings with Fisher Investments, saying Mr. Fisher's behavior, his response to criticism and the subsequent prominent redemptions "lead us to question the sustainability of the firm."
The firm's other clients include sovereign wealth funds, corporate profit-sharing plans, other investment advisers and charitable organizations.
Mr. Fisher and his firm make most of their money from fees charged to clients, which can range from 0.5 percent to 1.5 percent.
Fisher invests client money in a variety of stock strategies that include investments in small-cap, emerging-market and so-called frontier market stocks.
It is hard to gauge the performance of those investments because the firm does not focus on traditional mutual funds. But some past Fisher funds with publicly available numbers have underperformed the market substantially.
The Purisima Total Return Fund, a mutual fund that Mr. Fisher managed, had a return of almost 25 percent in the 10 years before its liquidation in 2016, according to Bloomberg data. Yet over the same period, investments in the S&P 500 would have risen roughly 100 percent.

All-Female Panel Set for Next Month's Democratic Debate

Texto completo: Four female journalists will moderate the Democratic primary debate next month in Georgia, including a repeat appearance by the star commentator Rachel Maddow, NBC News said on Wednesday.
Ms. Maddow, who was a moderator at the Democratic debate in June, will be joined by the veteran NBC News correspondent Andrea Mitchell and a pair of prominent White House correspondents: Ashley Parker of The Washington Post and Kristen Welker of NBC News.
The debate, jointly sponsored by MSNBC and The Post, is scheduled for Nov. 20. Eight presidential candidates, so far, have clinched a spot onstage. Candidates have until Nov. 13 to meet the Democratic Party's thresholds for fund-raising and polling performance.
Ms. Parker, who previously covered politics for The New York Times, will be the second print journalist to moderate a primary debate this year. Marc Lacey, the national editor of The Times, appeared alongside two CNN anchors at the Ohio debate this month.
This will not be the first primary debate to feature a lineup of female moderators. In January 2016, Trish Regan and Sandra Smith moderated one of two Republican presidential debates on Fox Business Network. Gwen Ifill and Judy Woodruff of PBS teamed up for a Democratic debate in February 2016.
Only four women have been the sole moderator of a general election presidential debate: Pauline Frederick (1976), Barbara Walters (1976 and 1984), Carole Simpson (1992) and Candy Crowley (2012).
NBC News sponsored the first primary debate this year in Miami, which broke a ratings record and received mostly positive reviews (a major microphone gaffe excepted).
Network executives are preparing for the event next month while facing renewed scrutiny for their handling of workplace sexual misconduct allegations and the reporting of a former employee, the journalist Ronan Farrow.
Mr. Farrow wrote in his new book, "Catch and Kill," that his reporting on Harvey Weinstein had been stymied by NBC News leaders, including the president of the news division, Noah Oppenheim. The book also describes an accusation of rape against the former "Today" anchor Matt Lauer, which Mr. Lauer has denied.
NBC fired Mr. Lauer in 2017, saying that it did so after learning of misconduct allegations against him, and that managers had no prior knowledge of the anchor's behavior. Mr. Oppenheim issued a lengthy memo arguing that Mr. Farrow's reporting on Mr. Weinstein did not meet network standards and that he allowed the journalist to take his work to The New Yorker, where it was eventually published.
The fallout from Mr. Farrow's book has caused some unease inside NBC News and, on Wednesday, outside it: The women's advocacy group UltraViolet staged a small protest outside the network's Manhattan headquarters, calling for executives to be fired.

Texto completo: Nyong'o honors mother for fueling her passion
NEW YORK - As Lupita Nyong'o accepted an award from the Harlem School of Arts - and entered the stage to Beyonce's anthemic hit "Brown Skin Girl" - the actress mainly had two people to thank for fueling her passion for the arts as a child: her parents.
"I was thinking about (the Harlem School of Arts) and what it does for children and its students (and) I didn't have an institution where I'm from in Nairobi, Kenya. And so the only way my interest in the arts thrived was because I had parents who valued those interests," she said Monday night at the school's annual Mask Ball in New York City. "And my mother in particular, she really nurtured my artistic spirit."
The Oscar winner's mother, Dorothy, also received the Visionary Lineage Award alongside her daughter.
"I really didn't do much," Dorothy Nyong'o said to laughs from the audience. Dorothy Nyong'o said she noticed her daughter's interest in the arts as a child and so she looked "for opportunities to nurture that."
"My job was really to facilitate it, and I'd like to encourage parents to do it. Sometimes we make the mistake of trying to make our children what we think we want," she said.
Dorothy Nyong'o won over the audience with more sweet words for her daughter, who has appeared in films such as "Black Panther," "Star Wars," "Us" and "12 Years a Slave," for which she won an Oscar.
"I'm proud of her. She makes me shine."
Lupita Nyong'o, 36, thanked her mom for all of her support, explaining that when she was a teenager, her mother "drove to rehearsals after a long day at work" and sat "in the car for five or so hours and she never complained."

The book, co-written with Sam Koppelman, comes out Nov. 26.

Texto completo: Visitors walk past the wrought iron gate to enter the Anne Arundel County courthouse, under the brick archway and through the white-washed double doors at the building in downtown Annapolis.
Inside they are met by three deputy sheriffs who push their wallet, keys and phone through an x-ray machine as they walk through a metal detector. If the detector beeps, a deputy used a wand to find whatever set it off - usually something like spare change.
On their walk through the building, they might be met by a police K-9 team. They will pass security cameras that dot the inside and outside of the building.
That's a normal day.
But starting Oct. 30 with jury selection, it will be anything but normal. The massive courthouse, parts of which date to the early 1800s, will be the site of a trial in the deadliest attack on journalism in the history of the United States.
Law enforcement officials say they're ready for a three-week trial expected to draw national attention, taking the same steps they would for any high profile case.
"There are plenty of cases where, through intelligence-sharing, we believe there might be some bad actors who might be wanting to come to court," said county Sheriff Jim Fredericks, whose agency oversees courthouse security. "So, the preparation levels won't be different. It just has to be tailored specifically to the type of case you're dealing with."
Another pre-trial motions hearing was set for Monday in the trial of the man charged with the murder of Gerald Fischman, Rob Hiaasen, John McNamara, Rebecca Smith and Wendi Winters. Jury selection, which will draw from a pool of 300 people, is expected to the following week. The trial itself is scheduled to start Nov. 4.
Deputies will be stationed at entrances to handle members of the media members, family members of the victims, survivors of the attack and others expected to fill the courthouse for one of the most high-profile trials in county history. Jarrod Ramos, 39, faces five counts of first-degree murder, one count of attempted murder, six counts of first-degree assault, among a host of other charges.
The court will handle the high volume of visitors by deploying additional deputies and opening multiple security lanes at court entrances to improve efficiency, Fredericks said.
"Us being able to do our job a little more efficiently there is going to make it a little bit safer place," he said.
The court does have policies and procedures in place for high-profile trials but the logistics specific to the Capital Gazette trial are still being finalized, Maryland Judiciary spokeswoman Nadine Maeser wrote in an email.
Courtroom 4C, where Circuit Court Judge Laura Ripken will preside over the trial, has a maximum capacity of 200. News media organizations have asked for an overflow room.
Maintaining order in the courtroom is essential to ensuring the trial proceeds like any other, said Ron Bateman, who served three terms as sheriff until December 2018.
Other high profile cases have included the 2012 trial of former county executive John Leopold on abuse of power charges, the 2014 trial of a New Jersey police officer charged with homicide in a road rage incident and the 1984 trial of Larry Schartz, who was convicted of killing his parents in Cape St. Claire.
In some cases, the court has increased its K-9 rounds in the courthouse, especially on the floor where the courtroom is located, Bateman said. But a trial that draws widespread attention doesn't change how deputies operate day-to-day.
"The deputy sheriffs that are assigned to the courthouse are extra vigilant even on the calmest days," he said. "It's not like they jump up the vigilance ... because of a special trial going on. We trained our deputies to be like that all the time."
As the trial draws closer, the court will be able to better plan for security arrangements based on other judge's caseloads during the weeks of the trial, Fredericks said.
While many aspects of visiting the courthouse will remain the same, visitors may notice stricter enforcement of the long-standing policy prohibiting the use of cellphones and cameras in the courtroom during the trial, Fredericks said.
The enforcement is essential in part because of expansive media coverage the trial is expected to garner from major news organizations such as the Associated Press, The Washington Post, The New York Times, and TV networks.
News organizations with satellite trucks will be given the courtesy of parking outside the courthouse as long as they don't block traffic or impede emergency vehicles, Fredericks said.
Annapolis police have no special plans during the trial, but the department is always available if the situation changes, a city police spokeswoman said. Anne Arundel County police will have a presence in the area as well.
The sheriff's office has also completed training sessions during off-hours to prepare for emergency situations such as confronting an individual with a weapon who enters the courthouse, Fredericks said but the likelihood of an event like that is low.

Texto completo: Re “Terranea Resort, in Rancho Palos Verdes, introduces new panic buttons in lead up to ballot measure” (Oct. 24):
I’m glad to see that Terranea Resort President Terri Haack has provided panic buttons to the hardworking housekeeping workers at Terranea.
The resort also claims they pay their workers at least $15 an hour. If this is true, why not codify these policies so that workers will be guaranteed this protection against sexual assault and a base pay of $15, no matter who the management is? Measure B would do just that.
Terranea has spent an alarming amount of money and energy trying to defeat this measure that they claim to already live up to. This is money that would be better spent implementing these commonsense protections and paying their workers fairly.
Terranea has been promoting their Saints and Sinners Halloween Party. In my opinion, the saints are the hotel workers who work long hours cleaning up after and waiting on hotel guests and making Terranea the place visitors love so much and are willing to pay top dollar for. The sinners? That’s for you to decide.
Ultimately, Measure B’s fate will be decided by residents of Rancho Palos Verdes. If I lived there, I would vote yes.

We’ve seen this before
The year is 1971. Bumbling burglars break into the Democratic campaign office to get dirt on behalf of a Republican president. The cast: Richard Nixon, H. R. Haldeman, John Ehrlichman, G. Gordon Liddy, Charles Colson, John Dean, Archibald Cox, a whistleblower, and the Washington Post. A Republican administration corrupt to the core. Plan begins to fall apart.
Fast forward to 2019. Bumbling Republican president shakes down the president of Ukraine to get dirt on Democrat opponent.
The cast: Donald Trump, Mike Pence, Rudy Giuliani, Stephen Miller, Mike Pompeo, William Barr, Robert Mueller, a whistleblower and The New York Times. A Republican administration corrupt to the core. Plan begins to fall apart.
We’ve seen this movie before. The latest news is just a preview of a sequel. In the previous movie, many of the characters ended up in prison or ignominy. So should many characters in this sequel. Exception, impeach and convict Trump.

Quitan el nombre “Trump” de pistas de hielo en Central Park de Nueva York

Texto completo: Con el inicio de la temporada de patinaje en las dos pistas de hielo en Central Park, los visitantes notarán que la marca “Trump” ya no está.
La impopularidad del mandatario Donald Trump entre muchos neoyorquinos ha llevado a que su nombre sea despojado de algunas propiedades privadas en su ciudad natal, incluido el hotel Trump SoHo -ahora llamado Dominick-, y algunos condominios de Trump Place en Manhattan.
Las pistas, dos de varias concesiones públicas que opera en la ciudad la Organización Trump -el principal vehículo comercial de la familia presidencial-, continuaron mostrando el nombre de manera prominente hasta la primavera pasada.
“Sin embargo, en las últimas semanas, la compañía realizó un cambio significativo, eliminando el nombre de Trump en silencio y sin explicación”, destacó The New York Times.
La presencia de la marca familiar disminuyó considerablemente. Desapareció por completo de los tableros.
El nombre “Trump” quedó reducido a una “T” solitaria sobre el mostrador de alquiler de patines, en letra pequeña en la parte inferior de un letrero con las horas y tarifas.
Los cambios en las pistas, reportados por primera vez por The Washington Post, no fueron solicitados ni requeridos por el Ayuntamiento, dijeron las autoridades.
La Organización Trump -que dirige las pistas Wollman y Lasker, ubicadas en los extremo sureste y noroeste del parque-, informó en el verano a los funcionarios del parque que planeaba alterar la señalización, sin proporcionar detalles ni una justificación.
Un representante de la Organización Trump no ha respondido a una solicitud de comentarios. Los ejecutivos han dicho en el pasado que la opinión pública del presidente no había afectado el negocio de la compañía.
“No hay conexión con la política y el uso de usuarios en nuestras instalaciones aquí en Nueva York”, dijo el año pasado Ronald C. Lieberman, vicepresidente ejecutivo del grupo.
* Inquilinos le huyen a la Torre Trump de la 5ta Avenida de Nueva York
* Piden remover de Central Park negocios de la marca Trump tras confesión de Cohen
With skating season starting, the Trump Organization quietly made the Trump name much less visible at two New York City ice rinks. https://t.co/cQYpNJJ0GJ

Coffee roasted just for you – at a flea market

Texto completo: When shoppers stroll by his Custom Roasts booth at Fleamasters Fleamarket in Fort Myers, Alex Kish is ready.
"This is a Brazil Cerrado," he says, handing over a steamy sample in a small paper cup.
"It's lighter, earthy, low-acid, an all-day-drinking type of coffee."
One sip, and customers are smiling and nodding. Then he hands them the next sample.
"This is a Kenya double-A," he says, "the highest-grade coffee to come out of Kenya. It has more of a floral taste, almost like tea."
Even without sugar or milk, the coffee has a light, natural sweetness that has people reaching for their wallets to buy a bag. Then Kish hands over the third cup.
"My Black Tiger," he says.
"Hands-down my best seller by far."
A blend of Central and South American coffees, the Black Tiger brew has a rich dark-roast flavor without the burnt, bitter, charcoal taste of many dark-roast coffees.
"It's very smooth going down," Kish says, and he's right. By this point, customers are often clamoring for bags of all three.
Kish launched Custom Roasts at Fleamasters in January 2017, but he first started roasting coffee beans back in 2005.
"I was looking for a better cup of coffee, and I had no idea where to go," he says.
He started researching online and found coffee-roasting forums that offered tips and tricks. Soon he bought his first air roaster, which looks similar to a popcorn popper. He started roasting fresh beans in small batches.
"About five ounces," Kish says. "Just enough for a couple of pots."
From there he upgraded to a larger drum roaster and started experimenting with unique, single-origin coffees from around the world.
"I was able to customize more at that level," he says.
Before long his coffee got to be so good that his wife made a suggestion: "Why don't you take this to the masses and let everybody taste what you're doing?" she said. "Try selling your coffee to other people and see if they're interested."
She even had a place in mind: the flea market. So, Kish found a booth at Fleamasters, set up thermoses of his roasted coffee for taste-testing and away he went. His coffee blends were an instant hit. Today he works at Fleamasters on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays and tends to website orders during the week. He delivers his coffee for free to Fort Myers, Cape Coral and North Fort Myers.
In addition to Custom Roasts' standard roasts, Kish also takes orders for custom roasts. He offers his coffee in whole beans but will grind to order if requested.
"I can grind anything from super-fine to super-coarse, that way it totally makes it customized," he says.
He also packages his blends in Keurig-style K-cup Pods.
Coffee is a passion for Kish, and he's happy to talk about all the nuances of it, from his favorite type of bean (Ethiopian yirgacheffe) to the reason why bags of fresh-roasted coffee should come with a valve (coffee de-gases after roasting and will expand the bag; without a valve, the bag explodes).
For customers who swing by his stand inside Fleamasters, such coffee talk comes with free tastings. And chances are good you'll leave with a bag.

Don't bother hunting for ‘Hunted'

Texto completo: TV Q&A

What is the status of the show where two people are given a head start and then chased down by professional manhunters?

It sounds as if you remember "Hunted," a CBS series in which teams of two people each tried to elude investigators for 28 days. It aired in 2017 and was canceled after a single seven-episode season. The show, by the way, was based on a British series of the same name which is still running, including with a celebrity version.

Can you please tell me why NBC did not bring back "Manifest"? I enjoyed the show and was hoping to find out what was behind the disappearance of the plane and the people. I would appreciate any info you can share.

The first info I can share is that the series is coming back. NBC ordered a second season of the thriller; look for it in 2020. As I mentioned in another column, shows no longer begin only in the fall but may arrive in the winter, spring or summer, depending on their networks' plans and when other shows are scheduled. Football, for example, takes up a lot of real estate in the prime-time fall and some shows are held back until after it is done.

Do you know what happened to Dr. Rhodes on "Chicago Med"? Is he coming back? Also, what happened to "Station 19"?

To start with "Station 19," this is another case of a series being held back from fall premieres but planned for later in the season. I do not have an airdate.

The "Chicago" dramas ("Med," "Fire," "P.D.") often make casting changes, as you know from previous questions and answers here about actors coming on going. "Chicago" mastermind Dick Wolf, who is also the maestro of the many "Law & Order" series, has always been willing to shake up casts for a variety of reasons. On "Chicago Med," it was reported back in April that Dr. Connor Rhodes (played by Colin Donnell) was being written out of the series along with Dr. Ava Bekker (Norma Kuhling). Deadline.com reported that those changes -- along with Jon Seda's departure from "Chicago P.D." -- were the result of "creative reasons related to the characters' story evolution."

How many movies did Harold Russell make? What became of him?

For those of you tuning in late, Harold Russell was a real-life World War II veteran who lost both his hands in an accident while teaching demolition work. He then played a returning veteran who lost his hands "The Best Years of Our Lives" and won two Oscars for the role -- a special award and a best supporting actor prize. Not trained as an actor, nor apparently inclined toward the profession, he went decades between acting roles, from "Best Years" in 1946 to "Inside Moves" in 1980, according to the Internet Movie Database. Besides one other film, "Dogtown" in 1997, he made a few TV appearances but spent more time working with veterans' organizations. Life was not always kind to him; in 1993, according to the New York Times, he needed money and sold one of his Oscars to get it. He died in 2002 at the age of 88.

Trump's Energy Department won't clean up the dishwasher industry's mess

Texto completo: Once again, President Trump is breaking the brains of the left-leaning media. This time, it’s his administration’s effort to legalize dishwashers built to wash dishes quickly.
When the New York Times covered this deregulatory push, the reporter framed her piece as a matter of “the dishwasher lobby” teaming up with industry-aligned conservative groups to battle against the Sierra Club. But it isn't so. A few paragraphs in, the reporter changed her attack on the proposed deregulation, painting it as extreme because this “regulatory rollback is in fact opposed by the very industry the White House claims it will help.”
Jason Hartke of the industry-backed Alliance to Save Energy complained of Trump’s Energy Department, “I don’t think they’re listening to industry.”
How thoughtless of the administration, to think of customers instead of industry.
Here’s the truth of the matter: The dishwasher industry, the Sierra Club, and New York Times reporters all want regulations that restrict consumer choice in dishwashers. Free market groups such as the Competitive Enterprise Institute and FreedomWorks oppose those regulations. They seem to have persuaded the Trump administration to expand consumer choice by deregulating.
And here’s the interesting pattern: Trump continues to roll back regulations, and he keeps running into resistance from the very industries being regulated.
The auto industry has fought Trump’s efforts to roll back Obama-era rules on fuel economy. The most aggressive opponents of Trump’s deregulation have formed the National Coalition for Advanced Transportation, which is suing to block any liberalization of fuel economy mandates. That coalition is, in fact, an industry lobby made up of Tesla and electrical utilities such as Exelon that want people to fuel up at the power outlet rather than the pump.
When the Trump administration announced it would roll back Obama’s methane emissions rules for oil and gas producers, relief that small producers desperately wanted, Exxon, BP, and the other biggest producers objected.
It’s the same with dishwashers. The Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers is on the record, both in the federal register and in the press, opposing a deregulation of dishwashers.
This has upset people who believe that if an industry supports a regulation, then everyone is supposed to get on board. Still, there is a contradiction at work here. The game plan of the Left has traditionally been to avoid arguing over the costs and benefits of a proposed regulation but instead to demonize "industry." But, increasingly, industry wants to be regulated.
Why does industry so often support regulation and oppose deregulation?
Sometimes it’s just a hunt for the imaginary creature known as “regulatory certainty.” Sometimes it’s pure regulatory robbery, as with Tesla and Exelon trying to tax their competitors and drive business to themselves. If a dishwasher manufacturer has invested millions in meeting Obama-era standards, it sees the upside of that investment as having raised barriers to entry — it makes it harder for new entrants to the market to compete. Roll back those mandates, and then you have to simply hope that consumers actually value your “improvements,” given a choice. That's a gamble.
But there’s another often missed explanation. Maybe the regulations are just as bad for shareholders as they are for customers. But maybe the regulations are good for the Washington lobbyists, both the in-house lobbyists and the folks at the K Street trade associations. Those folks hate it when Washington gets less involved in their clients’ business. Trump wasn’t elected to serve those people. He wasn’t elected to look after big business, either.
Daniel Simmons in Trump’s Energy Department put it well: “It’s not our job to meet industry’s wishes.”

Clinton, Bloomberg, and Holder reconsidering 2020 bids as Biden stumbles

Texto completo: Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, and former Attorney General Eric Holder may not have ruled out 2020 White House bids after all.
Clinton, the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee, and Bloomberg have both recently told people in confidence that they would reconsider running for president this time around if they thought they could win, according to the New York Times.
Both potential candidates, however, were skeptical that there would be an opening for them to enter the race, Democrats who spoke with them said.
Clinton teased a possible rematch with President Trump after he taunted her to run again earlier this month. “Don’t tempt me. Do your job,” she tweeted at Trump, who mockingly said she should “enter the race to try and steal it away” from Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren.
The former first lady had told friends in January that she was not ready to end her White House dreams, before special counsel Robert Mueller wrapped up his investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. But in March, before the release of Mueller’s report, Clinton said she was “not running.”
Democrats close to Clinton and Bloomberg said they only see either of them reconsidering if former Vice President Joe Biden ends his candidacy or is in a weakened position heading into the general election. Former White House chief strategist Steven Bannon also predicted that the pair will join the race if Biden's campaign deflates by the end of the year. By that time, it could be too late to get on the ballot in many primary states.
A Democrat familiar with Holder’s thinking said the former Obama official is weighing a last-minute entry but believes it may be too late in the process.
Former Secretary of State John Kerry has also questioned his decision to sit out of the 2020 race as he watches Biden slide in the polls and his fundraising slow. Despite being urged to get in, Kerry still believes the former vice president is the Democratic Party’s best nominee.
Other Democrats are also fielding calls about who could be a late entrant into the race to save the party from potential defeat.
“There’s more anxiety than ever,” Connie Schultz, a journalist who is married to Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown, told the New York Times. “We’re both getting the calls. I’ve been surprised by some who’ve called me.”
Former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick said he has also been asked by friends to reconsider running.

Chuck Schumer is wrong and no law gives the Ukraine whisteblower the right to anonymity

Texto completo: Can someone please tell Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer that no, the anonymity of the “whistleblower” in the Ukraine controversy is not “protected by law.”
It’s not. At best, it’s an open question unsettled by any policy or court ruling. But it’s certainly not a matter of settled law.
Schumer nonetheless proceeded to push that lie in a letter he sent Monday to the acting national intelligence director and the intelligence community inspector general.
“I am writing to ask what specific steps you are taking to protect the security of the intelligence community whistleblower,” wrote Schumer. It later continued to say that President Trump had “incorrectly stated that he has a right to ‘confront’ the whistleblower, and has said that he is ‘trying to find out’ the whistleblower’s identity — notwithstanding the fact that the whistleblower anonymity is protected by law.”
I don’t know why Schumer’s letter has the word “confront” in quotes, given that Trump does not appear to have ever used it. (He has said “meet my accuser.”) But in any event, it’s a misconception that there’s any law protecting the anonymity of any career government employee who decides to accuse the president of abusing his power.
The Whistleblower Protection Act and the later changes that enhanced it do nothing more than shield a federal employee from demotion, termination, or disciplinary action by superiors if he discloses information about waste and abuse or a violation of law within the government. (I'll use the pronoun “he” because the New York Times knows who it is and has done the same thing.)
Even the lawyer representing the guy who complained about Trump’s call to Ukraine has admitted that the protections he has amount to little more than prayer. “If [Trump] wants to destroy this person’s life,” attorney Bradley P. Moss told the Washington Post in a late September report, “there’s not a lot to stop him right now.”
In that same report, Moss conceded that “a lot of the protections that we understand to exist are based more on courtesy and custom than anything written down in law.”
Schumer and other Democrats are either desperately uninformed or are lying when they say that the identity of any “whistleblower” is protected by law. Hopefully, this case provides every reason why that isn't so.
We have to know the identity of this person who went to congressional Democrats with a complaint that has started a partisan impeachment effort. Yes, the content of his complaint is relevant. But so far as any reasonable person can tell, it's only political.
That’s why we ought to know his name. Once we do (and we will, it's just a matter of time) we can remove all doubt that this is a partisan witch hunt.

Texto completo: I am a baby killer.
I stopped mid-step on my way into my office in Manhattan, and that thought scrolled through my brain yet again: “I am a baby killer.” It was an April day this year, nine weeks after I ended my child’s life.
I decided to keep walking.
That is a choice I have to make every day: Give up or keep moving. I have been choosing the latter, over and over again.
I consider myself “pro-life.” But that phrase is heavy with multiple meanings. Like “pro-choice.” I identify with both of those terms. I am a walking contradiction.
It all began in January. My husband and I went to our 20-week anatomy scan. We watched in amazement and excitement as the tech showed us all the precious growing parts of our baby girl: her spine, left hand, right ankle, 10 fingers, 10 toes, lips, tiny little tush. After the appointment, I downloaded all of these images to my phone, where they are still stored. “She looks perfect,” the tech said. My heart swelled with pride when she added: “Your baby is being nice. She isn’t moving too much.”
Not until the end of the appointment did we get our first hint that all was not well. “I see something,” the tech said. “I’m not sure what it is. Come back tomorrow.”
What followed was a few weeks of agony: an amniocentesis, a fetal M.R.I., multiple ultrasounds. After much waiting, we learned the diagnosis: severe brain abnormalities. There was a small empty space where brain matter should have developed in our child’s frontal lobe. She also had agenesis of the corpus callosum, which meant that the middle structure joining left and right hemispheres hadn’t grown properly. And there was a third abnormality, a “rough” area of gray matter.
We knew the diagnosis but we didn’t know what it would mean for our daughter’s daily life. It was explained to us that she would face seizures. Hourly, daily, weekly or monthly? No one could say. She would face developmental delays. Could she breathe? Yes. Could she feed herself, crawl, walk, talk? No one could say. She would face cognitive impairment. Would she know what was happening to her? Would she know us as her parents? No one could say.
What was certain was pain, confusion, frustration, isolation. Precisely how much? Exactly how severe? Only time would tell.
If you identify as “pro-life,” what does that phrase mean to you? I know that in advocacy circles, it means, essentially, “anti-abortion.” But what does life mean to you — the life that you are “for”? Does it mean breathing on your own? Does it mean having a heartbeat? What are the markers of a life of quality, of purpose, of meaning? If your brain was not functioning following a traumatic car accident, would you want your body artificially sustained indefinitely? What is the threshold of experience for you to want to continue living?
I’m asking honestly. People’s answers differ. If it’s hard to imagine answering these questions for yourself, can you imagine being asked to answer them for someone else?
My husband and I chose to end our child’s life. Many imagine this as an impossible decision to make, one that would take hours of deliberation. I will be honest with you. You may not want to hear this, but the decision was obvious to us. Our child would not be given a life of pain and suffering. Instead, we would take her pain on as our own.
I regret that we had to make the choice. I regret that she was so sick, so broken. But I do not regret the decision we made. Within 15 minutes of the diagnosis, we knew what we had to do: We would become baby killers.
Am I punishing myself by using that term? I don’t think so. I want people to know: I ended my child’s life. At 23 weeks and six days into my pregnancy, I had a “late term” abortion. When people ask, “How could you?” I reply that allowing her to live would have been a fate worse than death. Her diagnosis was not fatal, not incompatible with the bare mechanics of a living body. But it was incompatible with a fulfilling life. And that makes all the difference to me. That’s why I call myself “pro-life.”
The night before our abortion, President Trump delivered the annual State of the Union address. I did not watch, but later I saw his comments about late-term abortion make the rounds on social media. Who are these monstrous women and doctors that, in his lurid language, “rip” babies “from the mother’s womb moments before birth”?
My child was lovingly cared for until her last heartbeat. She was gently laid to rest after her footprints were stamped in black ink on a rectangle of paper. Those same footprints hang on my bedroom wall along with a locket containing her ashes.
Is this not the picture of maternal feticide you had in mind? I am not a dark shadowy imaginary figure. I am a grieving mother.
President Trump lamented the “living, feeling, beautiful babies who will never get the chance to share their love and their dreams with the world.” I, too, lament their unlived potential. Through a fluke of nature, my beautiful baby was given a broken brain. A brain that would have limited every moment of her life. If she had made it to full term, what love and dreams would she have shared with the world?
Do you know what I find more chilling than the specter of a ghoulish doctor “ripping” babies out of their mothers’ wombs? The idea that my husband and I should have been given the diagnosis, told of the dire outcomes — and then sent home to hope for a natural miscarriage. Is it any less barbaric to be told that your child will suffer and then be deprived of any ability to protect her?
October is Pregnancy and Infant Loss Awareness Month. Most of the related initiatives are designed to help those who have suffered “miscarriage, stillbirth and newborn death.” Where do I fit in? If my body had recognized that my baby was sick and miscarried naturally, I know that I would be offered immediate, unqualified compassion. But because I was faced with a choice, I am made to feel unworthy of support.
I mourn my daughter’s absence every day. I whisper her name in the morning when I wake up. I breathe it out before I go to sleep. She is present in my every thought and action.
I pray you never have to face a decision like the one I faced. You might swear up and down that you could never make the choice I did, but you never know for sure until the time comes. I know I made the best choice for my child. I do not regret it, and I will not hide it.

Texto completo: For many people, "history" is a topic of middle and high school classes, a thing of the past with no application to daily life.

But 32-year-old Allison Horrocks and 33-year-old Mary Mahoney see history as a way of connecting with others. And they're using American Girl dolls to illustrate that point.

Horrocks and Mahoney -- who both earned undergraduate degrees from Hartford's Trinity College and Ph.D.s in history from UConn -- launched a podcast called "American Girls," in February.

In the twice-monthly episodes, the two historians unearth the American Girl books that many of us read as children and tweens. The books follow each American Girl as they live in their respective time period -- the classic series of characters are set anywhere from the 1760s to the 1970s.

American Girl offers an easy point of access into the study of history, something that many listeners don't usually think about in their adult lives, Horrocks said.

"They haven't really been connected to these kinds of topics since they were kids," Horrocks said. "They're listening, in some ways, more eagerly because they haven't thought about this kind of stuff in 25 years."

After inviting listeners to step into a historical world on each episode, Horrocks and Mahoney launch into debates about the problematic aspects of American Girl, draw links to pop culture and talk about the lessons that the characters learn.

And for many, the podcast hits home.

The two women's easy on-air banter -- they're best friends in real life, too -- combined with the sometimes-heavy topics that the American Girl books bring up has spurred many listeners to reach out to the show with their own personal stories.

For example, after airing an episode about the character Josefina Montoya who deals with the grief of losing her mother, listeners sent in stories about their own loss, some of them about the loss of a parent when they were a child.

Horrocks said she answers at least 15 messages a day, including emails and direct messages on social media. At least half of those, she said, are lengthy paragraphs of appreciation and personal connection. Mahoney described many of the messages as "intimate."

"We're getting people's stories," Horrocks said. "I feel like the luckiest woman in the world sometimes."

When Horrocks and Mahoney first launched the podcast, they talked about it at the National Council on Public History's annual meeting -- which was held in Hartford in March. That gave them an early base of listeners, many of whom were already listening to other history podcasts.

But in August, New York Times television critic Margaret Lyons wrote a column about the podcast, touching on her own childhood memories of American Girl and the experiences that shaped her into the person she is today.

The column is, in short, a wholehearted endorsement of the podcast. Shortly after the column published, the podcast's fan base began to grow. On Instagram, the "American Girls" podcast went from 2,000 to 7,000 followers, Horrocks said.

After Lyons' column, Horrocks and Mahoney saw an influx of listeners they hadn't yet truly tapped into: those who don't have a predefined passion for history.

The podcast is made to be friendly to those listeners, Mahoney said.

"I think sometimes people think history is very inaccessible. ... that there's no way it could be of interest to you," Mahoney said. "In reality, it's just a form of storytelling and meaning-making."

As much as the podcast is a story of telling stories, it's also a story of friendship.

Although Horrocks and Mahoney met briefly when they were both undergrads at Trinity, they became actual friends while Ph.D. students at UConn.

And since meeting, they've each labeled the other as their best friend.

Both women said that the idea of a best friend, or even close friendship in general, seems to come more naturally to millennials than to older age groups.

Horrocks said that she once gave a talk, which Mahoney attended. When a man in his 50s asked Mahoney why she was there, she candidly told him it was because Horrocks is her best friend.

The man responded that the idea of a best friend is childish, Horrocks said.

"Maybe in other generations, that's a thing for children," Horrocks said. "I think especially women our age are really open about the importance of friends."

The genuine closeness between Horrocks and Mahoney bleeds into the podcast, smoothing the discussion and keeping listeners engaged.

And when listeners do reach out -- whether with a short comment or an involved saga -- they enter that intimate space, Mahoney said.

"When we started this show, we thought maybe a couple of friends would listen," Mahoney said. "That's how it started, but the life of the show has really been a surprise for us."

THE PULL OF EXTREMISM WHITE NATIONALISM IS GROWING AND DIVIDING

Texto completo: "Screw your optics."
Those were among the last words posted online by Robert Bowers before he attacked the Tree of Life synagogue on Oct. 27, according to the federal indictment against him.
Those words were also a reflection of a debate that has split the white nationalist movement for years but has rarely reached the general public's eye. The reactions to Mr. Bowers' final post reveal much about that movement's direction since then.
The "optics debate" pits those who say they want to achieve a white-only or white-dominated nation through persuasion and politics against others - some calling themselves accelerationists - who want to start a race war as soon as possible.
To some of the former, the Tree of Life massacre was "strategically stupid," as one put it in an audio blog.
For others, though, that last post became a meme. A search for Twitter posts including "screw your optics" reveals 42 of them in August alone - a full nine months after the phrase was coined - including tweets dealing with white nationalism and mass killings, but also some broadly referencing U.S. or European politics, or topics as mundane as gardening and the decision to get contact lenses. A Google search, meanwhile, revealed at least 40 images captioned with some version of "screw your optics."
The Tree of Life massacre didn't end the "optics debate." But it may have shifted the balance as it reverberated through the increasingly networked white nationalist and supremacist movements in the U.S., Europe and the Australian subcontinent.
Some who study the white identity movement say that it continues to gain momentum and stridency, even as the media and many politicians decry violence perpetrated in its name at Tree of Life, Christchurch in New Zealand, El Paso, Texas, and elsewhere.
In the past year, "things have just gotten so much worse," said John Horgan, a psychology professor at Georgia State University who researches terrorism and violent extremism. Ethnic, racial and religious incitement "is insidious. It's pervasive. And it seems to be becoming an attractive counterculture to an increasing number of young people."
From 'amnats' to Atomwaffen
White supremacy today is "on the resurgence," said Kathleen Blee, distinguished professor of sociology and dean of the Dietrich School of Arts and Sciences at the University of Pittsburgh. She traces the growth in the movement to the ease of participation through web forums and social media and in part to the election of President Barack Obama. "What propels white supremacy historically is threat," she said. "The idea that the white race is imperiled by a black presidency. That threat started mobilizing people."
White supremacy today is also distinguished by the prevalence of the "great replacement theory" - the idea that there is a plot, masterminded by Jews, to replace whites with other races. The theory has caught fire among white supremacists in the last decade or so, said Ms. Blee, and was referenced by name by the shooters in Christchurch, El Paso, and at a synagogue in Poway, Calif., near San Diego.
"There's a clear structure to how this works, and what this ideology does is that it focuses attention on certain groups as the enemy and makes the issue seem very, very urgent," she said. "That's the fear part. The race war is going to start right now. The threat is immediate, urgent and that action can be taken. Bowers and many other people buy into that."
What the FBI calls "racially motivated violent extremism" - including anti-Semitism and crime driven by bias related to gender identity - is on the rise nationally and locally, said John Pulcastro, a supervisory intelligence analyst with the bureau's Pittsburgh office. He can't quantify the prevalence of extremism but said that the numbers of acts, tips and preventive interventions have risen, especially since 2017's Unite the Right Rally in Charlottesville, Va.
"It's a major focus of our intelligence unit right now and it's a national threat priority for the FBI nationally as a whole," said Mr. Pulcastro, who has spent 20 of his 30 years with the bureau working on extremism cases.
Optics - the way things look - may not have mattered to white nationalists a century ago, when the movement was epitomized by hooded Ku Klux Klan members and burning crosses. In 2017, though, initial images from Charlottesville conveyed a much different impression - clean-cut young men in polos and khakis, holding tiki torches. Advocates for "optics" won that day.
Only the next morning did the Nazi and Confederate flags appear, followed at the end by some very bad optics - video of a car driven by neo-Nazi James Fields plowing through counterprotesters and killing Heather D. Heyer, 32.
"After Charlottesville there was a huge debate about optics," wrote one self-described American Nationalist, who communicated with the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette in September and October and is profiled in a companion piece on this page. He characterized a divide between "pretenders who want to look tough wearing swastikas, and yell about killing people" and "actual White American Nationalists who disavow violence, promote change through policy, care about America, and refuse to dress up like some costumed freak to gain attention."
His side, he wrote, has "rules such as: If anyone tries to get you to do something illegal or tells you that they're gonna do something illegal, that person gets cut off immediately and forever."
Requests for comment from the other side of the optics debate resulted in long streams of mocking, often vulgar and sometimes threatening social media posts including references to shooting and raping journalists, pictures in which guns are pointed at the viewer and name-calling like "filthy dumb journo scum."
In the days after the Tree of Life massacre, the New York-based Network Contagion Research Institute turned its computer analysis tools to the use of the word "optics" on Gab.com, on which Mr. Bowers posted. "Optics" was closely associated with "infight" and with these extremist terms:
* wn, short for white nationalism, or the desire for a "white homeland."
* amnat, short for American nationalism, an avowedly nonracist reaction to globalism.
* civnat, a far-right term for moderate-to-conservative whites.
* Atomwaffen, a violent neo-Nazi clique.
* blackpill, a term for the act of pushing another person deep into nihilism.
Also associated closely with "optics" was the acronym gtkrwn - extremist code for "gas the kikes, race war now," said Joel Finkelstein, the director of the NCRI, which uses technology to study racism and anti-Semitism.
"When [Mr. Bowers] is talking about optics and passing it off as bravado to the public," said Mr. Finkelstein, "he's telling his own community that, 'we're ready to have a coming out party, and this is it.'"
The FBI, said Mr. Pulcastro, urges the public to be alert to the provocative word "invasion" in reference to immigration, the term "blood and soil," and the 14-word creed of white extremists: "We must secure the existence of our people and a future for white children."
According to Mr. Finkelstein, "screw your optics" put Mr. Bowers solidly into the pantheon of far-right accelerationists.
"Bowers is kind of a meme now," he said. "He's not just a guy. He's a thing to do."
'Then we'll have our way'
From the outside, it may seem ridiculous that slaughtering aging Jews at worship in Pittsburgh or Hispanic shoppers in El Paso could advance any cause. Some fringe figures, though, saw it as a win for the far side of the optics debate.
One Gab poster early this year called Mr. Bowers "a good person who snapped, because of all the Anti-White [stuff] going on," according to the Tampa Bay Times. That post is reportedly attributed to Daniel McMahon, a Tampa-area man who frequently went by the name Jack Corbin online. Mr. Bowers repeatedly shared Jack Corbin posts before the Tree of Life massacre, according to the Network Contagion Research Institute.
In September, federal prosecutors in Charlottesville indicted Mr. McMahon, 31, for electronically intimidating an African American man into dropping a bid for a seat on that city's council.
Screwing the optics makes perfect sense to some self-described accelerationists, who believe that provoking society and speeding its decline is the surest path to a white nation, said Peter Simi, an associate professor of sociology at Chapman University in Irvine, Calif., and author of "American Swastika: Inside the White Power Movement's Hidden Spaces of Hate."
The term "accelerationist" originally referred to people who believe that ever-speeding technological and social change can prompt painful - but ultimately desirable - change. In recent years, some on the right fringe have adopted the term.
The rightist accelerationist logic, Mr. Simi said, is that by repeatedly damaging the prevailing system, they "can get to this total collapse, 'and then we'll have our way.'"
Those accelerationists have gained urgency from anti-immigrant rhetoric in politics and the media, experts agreed.
"Their view is, we don't need to just act, we need to act now, rather than later, because if we don't act, our very way of life is at risk," said Mr. Horgan, the Georgia State psychology professor. "We can't wait because we are being invaded."
Since Tree of Life, Poway and the Christchurch mosque massacre in New Zealand - before which the accused echoed "screw your optics" in his online posts - Mr. Simi has seen the emergence of a discussion thread more chilling than the optics conversation.
"I saw discussion that was very, kind of, strategic about how the person got radicalized, how they could have been more effective in terms of killing more people - this kind of after-incident assessment," he said.
International nationalism
The Anti-Defamation League counted 18 known attacks or plots by white supremacists in the U.S. between Oct. 27 and mid-September. Several were anti-Semitic, including Poway, in which a 19-year-old, following a script chillingly reminiscent of Tree of Life, killed one and injured three before his gun jammed.
Bari Weiss, New York Times columnist and author of the recently released book "How to Fight Anti-Semitism," still calls modern American Jews "the luckiest diaspora in Jewish history." Compared with anti-Semitism in Europe, "the cancer here is at stage 1 rather than at stage 4," she said. Ms. Weiss grew up in Squirrel Hill and celebrated her bat mitzvah at Tree of Life.
"In no way did I think that what happened in Pittsburgh would happen in America," she said. "I thought that violent anti-Semitism was something that happened in other places."
But white nationalism has become more overtly international.
"We had European white supremacists marching in Charlottesville, and American white supremacists marching in Poland," said Jonathan Greenblatt, CEO and national director of the ADL. "White supremacy is a global terror threat."
Organizations on both sides of the Atlantic are increasingly networked, according to an ADL report released in September.
Americans have attended far-right events and conferences in Poland and Scandinavia, the ADL and partner organizations reported. A few prominent figures from the movement even took up temporary residence in Hungary, where anti-immigrant Prime Minister Viktor Orbán has emerged as a hero to xenophobes. And U.S.-based groups like Women for Aryan Unity have established chapters in Europe.
On Oct. 9, the suspected gunman in the Yom Kippur synagogue attack in Halle, Germany, livestreamed the attack on the Amazon-owned Twitch platform, narrating his actions in English in an apparent attempt at maximizing exposure. The Halle gunman failed to enter the synagogue, and then killed two and injured two others nearby.
The video was removed quickly by Twitch but had already been downloaded and copied to Telegram, an encrypted messaging app favored by extremists.

Texto completo: The past few weeks have been momentous for those of us tracking and preparing for the arrival of quantum supremacy — the tipping point when quantum computers functionally outperform classical computers. Among their many capabilities, these machines will have the power to unlock the digital encryption we use today.
That matters right now . Bad actors and nation states have been harvesting communications for years knowing that technology will soon allow them to unlock the secrets encrypted within those messages.
Glenn Gerstell, general counsel for the National Security Agency, addressed the global stakes in a September New York Times Op-Ed, “Imagine the overwhelming leverage that the winner would have — such a decryption ability could render the military capabilities of the loser almost irrelevant and its economy overturned.”
When the chief adviser for the most powerful intelligence organization the world has ever known publicly cautions that quantum computers will be capable of shifting the global balance of power, it’s time to start paying attention.
The only truly unknown factor is when quantum supremacy will be achieved. Estimates vary from five to 20 years, with a loose scientific consensus that quantum supremacy is at least a decade away. Yet…
Google and NASA claimed they achieved quantum supremacy last month.
A paper authored by a NASA senior research scientist was posted on the federal agency’s Ames Research Center website (Google and NASA partner in quantum computer testing) announcing that a quantum processor ran a calculation in 200 seconds that would take Summit, the fastest supercomputer in the world, 10,000 years to perform. To put that in perspective, it would take Summit — a computer 80 million times more powerful than a Macbook Pro — 10 millennia to do what a nascent quantum computer can do in less than 4 minutes .
Mysteriously, the research paper vanished within hours of its appearance. Neither Google nor NASA responded to reporter queries and neither has issued so much as an acknowledgement that the leaked paper exists, let alone contains the truth.
Flatly ignoring what may be the greatest technological achievement in modern history seems like odd behavior, but not if you consider the stakes.
The major quantum computing players are among the wealthiest, most successful countries and companies on Earth: Google, IBM, Intel, Alibaba, China, Russia and the United States. Each is deeply and powerfully incentivized to reach quantum supremacy first. As Jim Clarke, Intel’s director of quantum hardware said, “This feels like my generation’s space race.”
China is a notoriously secretive nation whose technological advancements remain concealed until being sprung, fully realized, upon the world stage. Russia, which, like China, has invested billions of dollars in quantum technology, remains steadfastly engaged in the world’s most absurd and determined global disinformation campaign.
Here in America, bleeding-edge technology is almost always clandestine. For companies working concurrently on similar technology, secrecy is an essential component of competition. Broadcasting too much information about progress gives competitors the opportunity and motivation to redouble their own efforts.
Considering the players and the stakes surrounding quantum computers, why would anyone — whether a government or company — tip their hand?
As Gerstell said, “The strategic advantage here would be for one country to surreptitiously acquire such a capability and maintain it for perhaps several years or more.”
Therein lies the true endgame — not just quantum supremacy, but quantum secrecy that can be leveraged indefinitely without notice. The wonder isn’t that the NASA paper summarily vanished, but that it ever appeared in the first place.
We don’t know when quantum supremacy will be achieved, but one thing seems certain. It will happen before we even know it .

Texto completo: Washington • President Donald Trump, increasingly embittered by an impeachment inquiry that Democrats are intensifying by the day, complained on Monday that Republicans were not united enough in defending him against what he called “vicious” adversaries bent on removing him.
Trump lashed out at Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, the only member of his party who has signaled he may be open to impeaching Trump, arguing that the senator’s defection showed weakness in the party.
Launching into a series of attacks on Democrats, Trump said approvingly that they were “vicious and they stick together. They don’t have Mitt Romney in their midst — they don’t have people like that.”
“They stick together,” Trump added, during a lengthy question-and-answer session with reporters at a Cabinet meeting. “You never see them break off.”
It was the second time in as many days that Trump — coming to terms with the fact that he will most likely be impeached by the Democrat-led House within weeks and face a Senate trial immediately after — has complained about a lack of support from Republicans as he faces the greatest threat yet to his presidency.
“When do the Do Nothing Democrats pay a price for what they are doing to our Country, & when do the Republicans finally fight back?” Trump tweeted late Sunday night.
The president’s angry response comes as Democrats, determined to sustain public attention and support for the impeachment inquiry, keep up a daily drumbeat of depositions, subpoenas and new revelations. They are pressing to keep momentum for the investigation with meticulous planning, frequent talking points for lawmakers and a steady menu of incremental developments to feed to a press corps hungry to cover a historic proceeding.
At the same time, cracks have emerged in the normally unapologetic monolith of Republican support for Trump on Capitol Hill as the impeachment inquiry marches on. Some Republicans, already uneasy about the allegations at the heart of the Ukraine inquiry, have grown increasingly uncomfortable with Trump’s behavior, and unwilling to defend him on a range of topics, including his decision to pull back U.S. troops from Syria and his plan — abruptly abandoned in the face of a bipartisan outcry — to hold the Group of 7 summit of world leaders at one of his resorts in Florida.
The admission — later recanted — by Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff, of a quid pro quo linking foreign aid to Trump’s effort to pressure Ukraine to investigate his political rivals, was a worrying piece of evidence for nervous Republicans that the president and his team are woefully unprepared to confront the impeachment onslaught.
Romney, a frequent Trump critic, has called the president’s attempts to solicit dirt on a political rival “wrong and appalling,” making him one of the most outspoken Republicans on the president’s behavior in office, and has declined to rule out impeaching him. In a fiery speech last week, Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee, said the Syria withdrawal would be seen as “a bloodstain on the annals of American history.”
While there is no evidence that other Republicans are taking their cues from Romney, he is not the only member of the party to publicly express concern. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, said last week that a president should never “hold up foreign aid that we had previously appropriated for a political initiative. Period.” Rep. Francis Rooney, R-Fla., who announced that he will not run for reelection, refused to rule out supporting impeachment. John Kasich, the former Republican governor of Ohio, said impeachment should move forward.
During remarks at the White House, the president blasted House Democrats for pursuing impeachment, calling the effort to oust him “very bad for our country” and suggesting that dealing with the inquiry was getting in the way of more important presidential actions.
“In the midst of that, I’m trying to get our country out of wars,” Trump said. “I have to fight off these lowlifes at the same time I’m negotiating these very important things.”
But his anger at his own party was also clearly on display, as he chastised a group of lawmakers, operatives and former officials who sought to prevent Trump from becoming the Republican presidential nominee in 2016 and vowed that they would never work for or support him, often referred to as “Never Trumpers.”
“Those people may be worse than the Democrats, the Never Trumpers,” he said.

Texto completo: You can learn anything on the internet, so why do I so often learn things I don't want to know? When I'm surfing the web I want to be drawn in by articles on Europe's political history or the nature of quasars, but I end up reading trivia like a menu from Alcatraz prison. Why am I not curious about the things I want to be curious about?
Curiosity feels like it's outside your control, and trying to direct it sounds as ill conceived as forcing yourself to find a joke funny. But if you understand what prompts curiosity, you may be able to channel it a little better.
Across evolutionary time, curious animals were more likely to survive because they learned about their environments; a forager that occasionally skipped a reliable feeding ground to explore might find an even better place to eat.
Humans, too, will forgo a known payoff to investigate the unknown. In one experiment, subjects were asked to choose one of four photos, each carrying some chance of paying a cash prize. Photos repeated, so subjects learned to pick the best-paying, but when a novel photo popped up, they chose it more often than the odds dictated they should. This preference for novelty is, of course, the reason manufacturers periodically tweak product packaging and advertising.
But it's good to know about your environment even if it doesn't promise a reward right now; knowledge may be useless today, but vital next week. Therefore, evolution has left us with a brain that can reward itself; satisfying curiosity feels pleasurable, so you explore the environment even when you don't expect any concrete payoff. Infants prefer to look at novel pictures compared with familiar ones. Preschoolers play longer with a mechanical toy if it's difficult to deduce how it works.
What's more, curiosity doesn't just ensure new opportunities for learning, it enhances learning itself. In a recent experiment, subjects read trivia questions and rated how curious each made them feel. Later, they saw the questions again, each followed by a photograph of a face, and judged whether that person looked like he or she would know the answer. In a surprise final memory test for the faces, subjects better remembered those appearing after trivia questions that made them curious. Curiosity causes a brain state that amplifies learning.
This function of curiosity -- to heighten memory -- is the key to understanding why we're curious about some things and not others. We feel most curious when exploration will yield the most learning.
Suppose I ask you, "What's the most common type of star in the Milky Way?" You'll obviously feel no curiosity if you already know the answer. But you'll also feel little interest if you know nothing about stars; if you learned the answer, you couldn't connect it to other knowledge, so it would seem nearly meaningless, an isolated factoid. We're maximally curious when we sense that the environment offers new information in the right proportion to complement what we already know.
Note that your brain calculates what you might learn in the short term -- your long-term interests aren't a factor. That's why a cardiac surgeon who is passionate about her job will nevertheless find a conference presentation on the subject boring if her brain decides that the talk won't add to her knowledge. Conversely, when a friend persuades her to watch a documentary on type fonts, her brain may calculate that this will be a rich source of information -- and she finds herself fascinated.
It's that disconnect between long- and short-term interests that makes frothy articles so frustrating. The feeling of curiosity promised you'd learn something and, admittedly, you did -- now you know French citizens' favorite macaron flavor -- but you're disappointed because your new knowledge doesn't contribute to your long-term interests. You've been clickbaited by your own brain.
If following curiosity results in disappointment, maybe it shouldn't be allowed to take the lead. Why not just search for topics you truly want to learn about? That sounds logical, but a search for "quasars" will yield thousands of hits and no way of knowing which offers the just-right match to your current knowledge that will maintain your curiosity. You'll probably end up like the surgeon at the boring conference talk.
If you wish for more serious reading when you surf the web, the opportunistic approach is actually fine. You just need to frequent better foraging grounds.
Many websites that snare your time feature scores of stories on the front page, banking that one will strike each reader's sweet spot of knowledge. So visit websites that use the same strategy but offer richer content, for example, JSTOR Daily, Arts & Letters Daily or ScienceDaily.
And pay more attention to bylines. Curiosity arises from the right balance of the familiar and the novel. Naturally, writers vary in what they assume their audience already knows and wants to know; when you find an author who tends to have your number, stick with her.
Einstein famously advised a young student to "never lose a holy curiosity." Given our evolutionary history, there's little danger any of us will. The challenge is changing its focus from the momentary to something more enduring.

Texto completo: Famed for purported anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, the botanical is hailed for helping a host of conditions. Is that true?
Have you noticed lattes, ice cream and smoothies with a tawny hue? That could be a sign of a not-so-secret ingredient: turmeric. The botanical is omnipresent in health food aisles, in the form of pills and powders.
Turmeric, native to South Asia, is one of the fastest-growing dietary supplements. In 2018 products racked up an estimated $ 328 million in sales in the United States, a more than sevenfold increase from a decade earlier, according to a report from Nutrition Business Journal.
Brightening up the pantries of many homes in India, the spice is interwoven into daily life, the cuisine, and cultural and healing traditions. A member of the ginger family, it has been used in Ayurvedic medicine for thousands of years. Apply turmeric to wounds, and it's believed to fight infection. Mix it with milk, and the mind calms. Tint the entrance of new homes with a paste to welcome prosperity.
"Turmeric is auspicious and one of the most important herbs," said Anupama Kizhakkeveettil, a board member of the National Ayurvedic Medical Association.
Sliced open, or dried into a spice, the Curcuma longa plant imparts its amber color and earthy, bitter flavor to food like curry. The active ingredient captured in many turmeric supplements is curcumin. Curcumin, along with the other curcuminoid compounds, compose only about 3 percent of the dried spice.
And bottles will often say turmeric on the front but list curcumin in the ingredients.
______
What do turmeric proponents claim as its benefits?
Turmeric is hailed for helping a host of conditions: high cholesterol, hay fever, depression, gingivitis, premenstrual syndrome and even hangovers. In Ayurvedic medicine, it is believed to act as an antiviral, antibacterial and antiparasitic, and has long been used to help with diabetes, pain, rheumatism, osteoarthritis, memory and skin conditions like eczema.
"We use it for so many different conditions, it's a time-tested herb," Dr. Kizhakkeveettil said. "Unfortunately, our science doesn't fit into complete randomized controlled trials. That is alternative medicine's biggest challenge."
Does curcumin work?
A group of researchers sought to answer this by sifting through the available literature. In a 2017 paper in the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, they concluded it's fool's gold. "There are claims that it can cure everything," said Kathryn M. Nelson, a research assistant professor at the University of Minnesota and the study's lead author. "To me, that is a red flag."
Dr. Amit X. Garg, a professor of medicine at Western University in London, Ontario, knew about turmeric's medicinal use because of his Indian heritage. He knew firsthand of its rich cultural significance too: On his wedding day, his relatives rubbed the spice all over him because it is believed to be cleansing.
After seeing the effectiveness of curcumin, in smaller studies, Dr. Garg and his colleagues decided to test it on a larger scale in hopes it would make elective aortic surgery safer by reducing the risk of complications, which include heart attacks, kidney injury and death. In the randomized clinical trial that followed, about half of the 606 patients were administered 2,000 milligrams of curcumin eight times over for four days, while the others were given a placebo. "It was a bit disappointing, but we couldn't demonstrate any benefit used in this setting," Dr. Garg said of the study, published last year in the Canadian Medical Association Journal.
In fact, there is not enough reliable evidence in humans to recommend turmeric or curcumin for any condition, according to the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health. Turmeric became a nutritional golden child partly because of its promise in laboratory studies -- cellular and animal. Some research indicates that both turmeric and curcumin, the active ingredient in turmeric supplements, have anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antibacterial, antiviral and antiparasitic activity. But this has mostly been demonstrated in laboratory studies, and, in many cases, the benefits of preclinical research isn't observed in clinical trials.
According to Natural Medicines, a database that provides monographs for dietary supplements, herbal medicines, and complementary and integrative therapies, while some clinical evidence shows that curcumin might be beneficial for depression, hay fever, hyperlipidemia, ulcerative colitis, osteoarthritis and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, it's still too early to recommend the compound for any of these conditions.
And Natural Medicines has found there isn't enough good scientific evidence to rate turmeric or curcumin's use for memory, diabetes, fatigue, rheumatoid arthritis, gingivitis, joint pain, PMS, eczema or hangovers.
Physicians say more research is needed. Dr. Gary W. Small, a professor of psychiatry and biobehavioral sciences at the David Geffen School of Medicine at the University of California, Los Angeles, who studies curcumin's effect on memory, sees a lot of therapeutic potential. He also states that existing research demonstrates curcumin's biological effects.

Is there an optimum way for turmeric to be absorbed?
What may be affecting curcumin's efficacy, doctors say, is that it is poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. In Indian cooking, turmeric is usually heated in a fat, like oil, which can increase absorption. Certain supplement manufacturers are also taking steps to improve this -- curcumin's bioavailability -- by combining the compound with other components. For instance, a chemical found in black pepper -- called piperine -- is sometimes added to curcumin supplements in proprietary blends to increase its absorption.
Researching curcumin can be challenging because some blends have better bioavailability than others, and varying amounts of the active ingredient. "If you did the study over and over again but used slightly different preparations, you would probably have different results," said Dr. Janet Funk, a professor of medicine at the University of Arizona College of Medicine-Tucson, who studies curcumin's effect on bone.
Still, even if absorption improved, Dr. Nelson contends that curcumin would not have any biological effects. Turmeric may still have health benefits, she said, but they just may be from another compound or combination of compounds.

So is turmeric safe?
Consuming it by mouth is safe, up to 2 grams of turmeric daily for a year, and 4 grams daily of curcumin for a month, according to Natural Medicines. Turmeric aficionados who also use it as a face mask can relax too; the database indicates it is most likely safe to apply to the skin.
Doctors recommend that patients tell a physician they are taking turmeric. High doses of turmeric and its isolated constituents can have some rather unpleasant side effects, including diarrhea and nausea. Curcumin may also interact with anticoagulants and antiplatelets, antacids, and drugs used for chemotherapy and to control blood pressure. While the spice is considered safe in food, therapeutic doses should be avoided during pregnancy.
The Food and Drug Administration does not test dietary supplements like turmeric for safety and effectiveness but announced earlier this year that it would improve oversight of the growing industry.
One study published in 2018 in Molecular Nutrition & Food Research, found that the cheaper the turmeric product, the more likely it was to have chemical compounds suggestive of synthetic curcumin; and products with turmeric root were more likely to have higher lead levels. One sample exceeded recommended limits for lead.
How about all those turmeric lattes? Doctors do say that sprinkling a little bit of the bitter spice into frothed milk doesn't have proven health benefits. But that doesn't mean it isn't delicious.
As for Dr. Garg, he is not closing the bottle cap on curcumin. To wit: He is in the middle of a randomized study with a different preparation and dosing to see if curcumin prevents the progression of kidney disease. "There are still many promising things about curcumin and turmeric," he said. "I remain open-minded."

Texto completo: Her book became a standard reference for women suffering abuse in the home. "What did you do right today?" it asked, calling for a daily checklist.
She was working as a waitress at a Howard Johnson's when she met her first husband, a customer who always had books with him. "I'll marry you," she said when he proposed, "but I won't do any housework." The year was 1953.
When her self-help book "Getting Free: You Can End Abuse and Take Back Your Life" was published in 1982, she was just as straightforward. "If you decide to change your life, it may be challenging, exciting and rewarding," she wrote, "but it will also probably be difficult, lonely and frightening at first."
The battered women's movement was in its infancy, and the book, translated into several languages, became widely used at women's shelters and in support groups for victims of domestic violence.
Ginny NiCarthy -- author, activist, social worker and truth teller -- died on Sept. 23 in Seattle in a mountain-view home that she had rented in order to greet visitors in her final days. She was 92 and had been battling dementia for four years.
The death was confirmed by her daughter, Iskra Johnson, an artist.
Over the decades, Ms. NiCarthy's political protests landed her in jail more than once. While serving two months for civil disobedience after a demonstration at the Trident Submarine Base in Bangor, Wash., in 1976, she took up knitting.
"There is nothing quite like talking to your mother through bulletproof glass as she knits 1 and purls 2," Ms. Johnson recalled in a tribute recently posted on Facebook. . "That may have been the last traditionally domestic act of her life."
Virginia Jane McCarthy was born on April 30, 1927, in San Francisco, the youngest of five children of Paul McCarthy, a lawyer who was at one time the mayor of Redwood City, Calif., and Alice (Byrne) McCarthy. She later changed her surname to NiCarthy, using an Irish prefix that means "daughter of" rather than "Mc," which means "son of."
Ginny originally wanted to pursue an acting or writing career, friends said, but her interests shifted to social work after she became a psychiatric aide at a mental hospital. She received her master's degree in the field from the University of Washington.
"Getting Free" used a workbook structure to guide readers through self-discovery and, ultimately, action. "What did you do right today?" it asked, calling for a daily checklist. "What are you telling yourself?" was the lead-in for a section on self-criticisms. If you feel that you broke a rule today, whose rule was it, anyway?
"No intellectual or moral evaluation is made of the act of burning toast," she pointed out. "If you do this exercise regularly, you'll avoid the guilt, depression and anxiety that often follow self-blame. And you'll be free to consider how you can change the behavior."
A 1982 article in The New York Times called "Getting Free" "two guides in one," explaining: "One is for women who need to explore their feelings about their relationships with their abusers before making a decision about leaving. The other is for those who want to know their options if they move out immediately."
Over the years Ms. NiCarthy was also active in movements for other feminist causes, civil rights, an end to the Vietnam War, nuclear disarmament and death with dignity.
Her other books include "The Ones Who Got Away: Women Who Left Abusive Partners" (1987); "You Don't Have to Take It: A Woman's Guide to Confronting Emotional Abuse at Work" (1993), written with Naomi Gottlieb and Sandra Coffman; and "Seeing for Myself: A Political Traveler's Memoir" (2012), in which she reflected on her visits to Iran, Afghanistan and other unlikely vacation destinations.
Both her marriages, to Robert S. Johnson and Bill Crow, ended in divorce. In addition to her daughter, survivors include two sons, Matthew and Nathan Crow, and a granddaughter.
In the 1995 book "Feminist Foremothers in Women's Studies, Psychology and Mental Health," Ms. NiCarthy recalled her childhood objections, in the 1930s, to being forced to wash dishes while her brother only had to take out the garbage.
"I can't remember a time when I didn't resent the unfairness of arbitrary status discrimination, especially related to gender," she said. "I think I must have been born a feminist."

Texto completo: Proponents claim that activated charcoal is a "natural detoxifier" that can remove harmful substances from the body.
Active charcoal comes in many forms: toothpaste; powders, black-colored ice-cream, or "goth lattes." On Instagram, it is used as a prop. Medically, activated charcoal is used in emergency hospital settings, typically to absorb drugs after an overdose.

What is activated charcoal said to do?
Proponents contend that activated charcoal is a natural detoxifier of the body that can, for example, remove teeth stains and even work as an anti-aging product. After all, if it can medically detoxify the body of poisons, a smaller dose probably works too, right?
Not necessarily. Just to clarify so no one goes sprinkling charcoal in their latte: Activated charcoal is charcoal that has undergone a process in which gases like oxygen are added at high temperatures, resulting in pores that provide a high surface area that allows it to bind to other substances.

Does activated charcoal do anything?
A review in the British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology in 2015 reported that activated charcoal has pores that soak up fluid. It is often derived from burned organic substances, such as coconut shells (as in coconut ash). Dr. Mark Su, a medical toxicologist and director of the New York City Poison Control Center, said that activated charcoal worked by binding to drugs to prevent absorption in the body.
There are side effects in the emergency department setting, like vomiting or pulmonary aspiration. Activated charcoal also doesn't work on certain alcohols. Some hospitals prefer not to use it in the emergency department and instead opt for more specific antidotes to poisonings and overdoses.
For the rest of us, our liver and our kidneys do a great job of detoxifying things on a day-to-day basis.
If optimal health is the goal, eating healthfully -- plenty of green, leafy vegetables -- sleeping at least seven to eight hours a day, exercising at least three times a week at an intensity where you sweat (sweat is detoxifying), reducing stress through mindfulness, journaling, and cultivating community and a strong support network are helpful habits to introduce.

Can activated charcoal harm you?
It's possible that activated charcoal may reduce the effectiveness of certain medications like those for high blood pressure or seizures.
In New York, Morgenstern's Finest Ice Cream, made with coconut ash, was wildly popular, but in 2018 the company was served "commissioner's orders" from the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene to stop serving it. The company complied, and the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene has continued to crack down on coconut ash, though Michael Lanza, the assistant press secretary for the department, said in an emailed statement, "Restaurants may serve foods with activated charcoal after securing approval from the F.D.A." (Stores like Pressed Juicery still sell activated charcoal lemonade in stores outside New York, though not online, citing the ban.)
In the 1960s, the Food and Drug Administration prohibited the use of activated charcoal in food additives or coloring, but an F.D.A. spokeswoman said in an email that the ban was precautionary, as there was a lack of safety data.

What about activated charcoal in health and beauty?
The questions about the use of activated charcoal in foods have not stopped the trend of activated charcoal moving into health and beauty. A study from January 2019, which involved staining cow, goat and sheep teeth with concentrated black tea, found that activated charcoal in toothpaste was not as effective as other whitening agents like hydrogen peroxide or microbeads.
A previous review from 2017 of 118 studies found that there was not enough evidence to support the safety or efficacy of charcoal-based toothpastes and powders and that their safety hadn't been demonstrated. On balance, given the alternatives, and the risks of ingestion, it is better to stick with safer toothpaste substances, the review suggests.
On the other hand, Dr. Su said there was no clear concern at this time about charcoal's safety for beauty products for external use.

Texto completo: The service for Atatiana Jefferson was expected to draw large crowds on Saturday but has been delayed following a judge's ruling.
DALLAS -- The funeral for Atatiana Jefferson, the 28-year-old woman shot and killed by a Fort Worth police officer now charged with murder, has been postponed after a family dispute.
Ms. Jefferson's funeral had been scheduled to take place at The Potter's House Church in Dallas on Saturday, and was expected to draw crowds of mourners, including the Rev. Al Sharpton, who had planned to speak.
The delay followed a Dallas judge's order that Marquis Jefferson, who says he is Ms. Jefferson's father, should have the "full authority" to make funeral and burial arrangements. The ruling from the judge, Brenda Hull Thompson, also included a restraining order keeping funeral home staff and Venitta Body, an aunt of Ms. Jefferson, from making any arrangements without Mr. Jefferson's approval.
Ms. Jefferson's family members have said that she had recently been living with and taking care of her mother, Yolanda Carr, whose health was declining. Mr. Jefferson is listed as Ms. Jefferson's father on a birth certificate that he filed with his petition to the court, but Ms. Body said at a news conference this week that Mr. Jefferson was not the biological father.
A hearing is scheduled for Monday in the case, according to court records.
Ms. Jefferson's viewing is now scheduled for Wednesday night at the Golden Gate Funeral Home in Dallas, and funeral services are planned for Thursday, said John Beckwith, the owner of the funeral home. A church has not yet been selected for the funeral, he said.
Mr. Beckwith said the plan was to have both the Carrs and the Jeffersons attend the services on Wednesday and Thursday. "We are bringing both families together," he said.
Ms. Jefferson, who was black, was killed early on the morning of Oct. 12 by a white Fort Worth police officer, Aaron Dean, who fired a single, fatal shot through her bedroom window without ever identifying himself as a police officer. He and another officer had responded to her home in southeast Fort Worth after a worried neighbor saw Ms. Jefferson's doors open for hours and called a nonemergency line.
Mr. Dean has been charged with murder and the Fort Worth district attorney plans to seek a murder indictment from a grand jury.
The killing quickly reverberated around the country and was seen by many as yet another instance of a white police officer killing a black civilian who was minding her own business. Ms. Jefferson had been playing video games with her 8-year-old nephew when the police officers arrived at her home. The officer's actions were widely criticized by residents and city leaders in Fort Worth.
On Friday night, mourners gathered at a smaller memorial service, including some who had never met Ms. Jefferson but felt compelled to be there.
Howard Young, a landscaper, said he had made the 30-mile trip from Fort Worth because he had been moved by Ms. Jefferson's death and felt obliged to help. He offered to clean up the lawn of her home before grieving relatives and families stopped by.
"I want to make sure it looks presentable," Mr. Young said.
Mitchell Ferman reported from Dallas and Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs from New York.

Media meltdowns and political polarization: Joel Kotkin

Texto completo: The mainstream media increasing appears much like the classic tale of the boy who cried wolf so often that when the wolf showed up no one believed him.
Similarly, since the bust of the Mueller report, and the evaporation of countless other “blockbuster” exposés, the media’s credibility in the ongoing impeachment saga is now widely doubted, even if this time they may actually be right about presidential misdeeds.
This divide can be seen in public perceptions of the news media. Although somewhat improved from its low point in 2016, only 40 percent of Americans, according to Gallup, trust the media, compared to over 50 percent in 1999. As befits the media’s increasingly partisan stance, the small improvement over 2016 comes almost entirely from Democrats. Only 15% of Republicans and barely a third of independents now trust media compared to nearly 70% of Democrats.
Once the news business had enough sense of propriety and professionalism to at least maintain an appearance of objectivity. There’s ample reason, as Glenn Reynolds suggests, to see many mainstream journalists as little more than “Democrats with bylines,” willing participants in what long-time leftist and fiercely anti-Trump reporter Matt Taibbi describes as the upper bureaucracy’s “permanent coup” against Trump. If this “coup” now actually succeeds, it will be one that will simply accentuate hostility to the media among a large segment of the population.
Media faces an economic crisis
No president has suffered such total opposition from powerful media. In his first year in office, stories about Trump were 62 percent negative, notes Pew, almost three the rate for Obama and more than twice that for George W. Bush, certainly no media favorite. His positive coverage was barely 5 percent, one eighth that enjoyed by President Obama. Some have thrived from naked partisanship, including an increasingly aggressive series of pro-Trump outlets. The New York Times, de facto leader of the anti-Trump media lynch mob, has seen its subscriptions burgeon, notably online.
But the Times enjoys a unique status with upper-class, educated readers. In contrast the mass audience seems to be turned off with the non-stop political haranguing. The almost comically anti-Trump CNN has seen its ratings drop so far that it now trails not only primetime leaders Fox, but has fallen to 15th behind ESPN, Hallmark Channel, History, TBS and others. Overall, all forms of media — television, radio, newspapers — have been suffered double-digit drops since 2016, according to Pew.
The timing couldn’t be worse, given the economic decline of traditional media stemming from the shift to online. Google alone made $4.7 billion last year from news publishers whose industry continues to shrink, losing an estimated 40 percent of its 2001 job base.
The collapse is most evident on the local level, including local television stations whose ratings have plummeted. Over 1,800 local papers have gone out of existence since 2004, notes a recent University of North Carolina study, and many more have stripped their staffing levels, creating numerous “news deserts” across the country.
The decline in local coverage, suggests the Nieman Lab at Harvard, has been filled by national partisan online media, giving ever more influence to media based in New York, Washington and San Francisco.
The new sociology of media
In the past independent, or at least quirky, voices could emerge from the hinterlands. When I was a young reporter, papers like the Kansas City Star, the Louisville Courier and the old Los Angeles Herald Examiner were well-staffed, great dailies that not only covered news, but often with a very different perspective than the large coastal media.
Even in places like New York and Washington, the editorial workforce has been transformed, in part because of high housing costs. The journalist of the 1980s was often a middle-class homeowner who could afford to live in the suburbs of New York and Washington. My neighbor at the Washington Post was a hard-drinking Italian working-class guy whose brother was a Baltimore cop.
Today that kind of working-class journalist has been replaced by younger reporters who often hail from elite universities. These young journalists, as Obama speechwriter Ben Rhodes noted, did not have to cover city councils and other boring local minutiae, leaping directly from graduate school into major newspapers and radio and television outlets. They may be good test-takers, but literally know nothing about the real world that people unlike themselves inhabit.
Overall, the new breed of reporters almost universally follow the progressive party line. In 2018, barely 7 percent of U.S. reporters identified themselves as Republicans; some 97 percent of journalists’ political donations go to Democrats.
But the new class order in journalism is not just a problem for conservatives. The gaping chasm between the elite journalists and working-class people, suggest left-leaning sociologists John Russo and Sheri Linkon, leads reporters to blame small-town residents and rural people for Trump without taking time to actually examine their voting behavior, life experience and attitudes.
Ahead: A troubled future
It was widely hoped the internet would forge an ever more diverse media. Yet, so far, we see a sad trend to homogeneity. This is likely to get worse as the tech oligarchs expand their control of media pipelines and continue to purchase major publications that were once proud exemplars of independent American journalism.
This takeover could become downright scary, particularly if there is a change of parties in Washington. There are growing calls, notably in The New York Times, to have Washington limit media that might appeal to the unhinged elements of the alt-right; progressives in some states, including New Jersey, have even called for the creation of state-supported media, not exactly something healthy for a democracy built on free speech and open discussion.
Many in media hope non-stop impeachment coverage, or continued unraveling of Trump’s inner circle, will both revive their fortunes and expel the hated Trump. The murky events in Ukraine also could undermine the credibility of the fledgling pro-Trump media, which could lead to even greater media homogeneity.
The emerging impeachment saga is likely to accelerate not only the alienation of much of the population from the press, but also create challenges for our democracy. With the demise of press diversity and openness, readers will be increasingly faced with a media that barely hides its prejudices, but instead offers largely alternative realities that may be only occasionally real and rarely edifying.

Texto completo: The New York Times aseguró que Iván Archivaldo Guzmán alias ‘El Chapito’, hermanastro de Ovidio Guzmán López , alias ‘ El Ratón ‘ o ‘ El Nuevo Ratón ‘ fue quien encabezó el rescate del también hijo del narcotraficante Joaquín ‘ El Chapo ‘ Guzmán , exlíder del Cártel de Sinaloa (CDS).
A decir de la publicación, ‘El Chapito’ habría sido detenido inicialmente pero pudo escapar según fuentes pues un grupo de sicarios superó a las fuerzas militares mexicanas.

Leer más: Liberan a Ovidio Guzmán, hijo de El Chapo, poco después de anunciar su captura
‘Una vez libre, el hermano mayor orquestó una asombrosa muestra de fuerza para conseguir la liberación de su hermano, Ovidio’, se lee en la nota en del New York Times en inglés.
‘La acción no sólo consistió en tomar como rehenes a los soldados, sino en secuestrar a sus familias, de acuerdo con las dos personas informadas sobre el asunto, quienes no estaban autorizadas a hablar públicamente’, señaló el periódico.
Según versiones que circularon el día de lo ocurrido pero que no han sido desmentidas ni confirmadas por autoridades, sicarios del Cártel de Sinaloa tenían la orden de asesinar a familiares de elementos castrenses, de los cuales habían obtenido direcciones en caso de que no se llegara a ningún acuerdo para la liberación del hijo de ‘ El Chapo ‘ Guzmán .
Y aunque dichas versiones no han sido confirmadas, basta con recordar las declaraciones del propio presidente Andrés Manuel López Obrador ( AMLO ) quien aseguró que respalda a quienes tomaron la decisión de liberar a Ovidio Guzmán López pues estaban en riesgo las vidas de muchos seres humanos, ‘porque no se trata de masacres pues eso ya se terminó’.
Recordemos que el pasado 17 de junio, Ovidio Guzmán , alias ‘ El Ratón ‘, fue detenido por autoridades federales en la capital de Sinaloa, Culiacán, lo que provocó una serie de balaceras y hechos violentos donde se reportó un saldo de 8 muertos, 16 heridos y 51 reos prófugos.

Texto completo: The Bullock 2020 presidential campaign is touting numbers in a poll that showed Gov. Steve Bullock outpolled seven of the Democratic candidates in Tuesday's debate.
The findings by Emerson Polling had Bullock at 4% in Iowa. However, the campaign did not directly name the poll in its email.
"This is GREAT news!" his campaign said in an email Thursday. "It shows that our plan to talk one-on-one with as many Iowans as we can is working."
The poll showed former Vice President Joe Biden and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren tied at 23%, South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg at 16%, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders at 13%, entrepreneur Andrew Yang at 5% and Bullock at 4%.
Bullock was ahead of New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, who had 3%, and entrepreneur Tom Steyer, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii and California Sen. Kamala Harris, who each had 2%.
Bullock placed sixth overall out of 19 candidates and also did better than Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, who had 1% and Julian Castro and former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke, who both had 0%.
A news release from Emerson focused on the front runners.
"The good news for Biden is he did not lose much ground since March's poll that had him at 25% of the vote," said Spencer Kimball, director of Emerson Polling. "It appears that Warren has been the beneficiary of Sanders's drop from 24% to 13%; Mayor Pete appears to have solidified his base in Iowa, going from 0% in February, to 11% in March, and now 16% in the Hawkeye state."
President Donald Trump holds a 47% disapproval and a 44% approval rating in Iowa, the poll noted.
The poll of 888 voters was done Oct. 13-16 and said it had a margin of error of 3.2%.
While it may be encouraging news for the Bullock campaign, Emerson is not among the 15 qualifying poll sponsors for the November debate, according to the Democratic National Committee.
Those sponsors are: Associated Press; ABC News/Washington Post; CBS News/YouGov; CNN; Des Moines Register; Fox News; Monmouth University; National Public Radio and; NBC News/Wall Street Journal.
Others are NBC News/Marist; New York Times; Quinnipiac University; University of New Hampshire; USA Today/Suffolk University; Winthrop University.
The next debate is Nov. 20 in the Atlanta area and will be hosted by MSNBC and The Washington Post. Candidates have until Nov. 13 to qualify.
Earlier this week three prominent Iowa Democrats said Bullock could win the Iowa caucus in February. Two of the three, Iowa Attorney General Tom Miller and Democratic Party member Jan Bauer, directly supported Bullock and former Rep. Dave Nagle had not.

The most powerful office in the world is occupied — and being abused — by a man who is entirely unfit and is spinning dangerously out of control. Everyone needs to stop pretending otherwise.
And it's all getting worse.
President Trump's train wreck of a performance Wednesday, at a meeting with congressional leaders, represented a new low on a scale that seems to have no bottom.
"I pray for the president all the time ... I think now, we have to pray for his health," House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said later, because "this was a very serious meltdown on the part of the president."
Trump began by complaining about having to attend a meeting initiated by his own White House aides, according to published accounts.
The subject was Trump's sudden decision to move U.S. military personnel in Syria aside, allowing Turkish troops and affiliated militias to sweep across the border and attack the Kurds, who had been loyal U.S. allies.
Trump then tried to make the case that he did not actually condone the Turkish invasion. Attendees were given copies of a truly bizarre and alarming letter Trump had sent to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Oct. 9.
Just four short paragraphs long, the letter begins, "Let's work out a good deal!" It ends by telling Erdogan, "History will look upon you favorably if you get this done the right and humane way. It will look upon you forever as the devil if good things don't happen. Don't be a tough guy. Don't be a fool! I will call you later."
That is how the president of the United States communicated with a powerful foreign leader at a moment of crisis. We have all witnessed more sophisticated attempts at persuasion on kindergarten playgrounds. Erdogan reportedly threw the letter in the trash.
At the White House meeting, Trump went on to denigrate James Mattis, the decorated and highly esteemed Marine Corps general who served as Trump's defense secretary before resigning last year over Syria policy. Mattis is "the world's most overrated general," Trump announced, according to The New York Times. "You know why? He wasn't tough enough. I captured ISIS. Mattis said it would take two years. I captured them in one month."
Anyone in touch with reality knows that none of this is true. The territory held by ISIS — the Islamic State — was reclaimed by Kurdish fighters with the aid and guidance of U.S. troops and intelligence operatives.
Shortly before the meeting, the House voted 354-60 to condemn Trump's abandonment of the Kurds, with most Republicans joining their Democratic colleagues in expressing outrage.
Senators, pay attention.
You may prefer to let voters judge Trump in next year's election.
But you must realize, at this point, that we may not have that long.

Three ways to save money on Halloween

Texto completo: 'Tis the season for fake spiders, light-up ghosts, tiny candy bars, and tacky costumes. All that Halloween stuff can make your bank account balance look downright scary! So, let's talk about three simple tips for saving money on Halloween.
1. Don't buy name-brand candy
There was a time in my life when I was overly concerned with being the "cool" house on the block. You know, the one with the really legit, exciting candy at Halloween — maybe even some full-size candy bars.
But when I saw the price tag at the store, that need to impress the neighbors left quick. I thought, Nope! Sorry, cute neighbor kids. You're getting the generic brand. I can buy a huge bag of it for half the price!
If you're on a tight budget, don't feel pressured to splurge and get the expensive candy. The kids will get plenty, and they'll all be on sugar highs anyway, so they'll never know the difference.
2. Scale back on Halloween parties
Halloween parties are pretty elaborate these days with huge spreads of food, amazing costumes, and even signature cocktails. If you're hosting or attending one, just be wise with what you spend. After all, Halloween is just one day!
If you're hosting, ask your guests to bring a dish to share. Set a budget for yourself on party supplies and decorations, and stick to it!
If you're attending someone else's party, don't feel pressured to bring the fanciest bottle of wine or go overboard with buying the most impressive costume. You don't want to go into November stressed out about overspending on this one day.
3. You can decide not to celebrate Halloween
Okay, I honestly don't love Halloween. Not for any spiritual or moral reason, it's simply because I'm not creative. And I'm terrible at coming up with costumes! Thankfully, my girls usually want to be princesses. That's something Amazon can fix. But I dread the day when they want something more imaginative. I'm not the mom who just whips up a costume out of odds and ends in my craft closet.
But guess what? No one says we must celebrate Halloween. There's no shame or guilt in a graceful no if Halloween doesn't fit your budget this year. If you sit this holiday out, you'll save so much money on candy, costumes, and ugly plastic partywear. Plus, you'll save time and energy. You can always jump back in next year, when you have room in your budget.

Judge Blocks Florida Law On Felons' Voting Rights

Texto completo: A judge issued a preliminary injunction against a law that civil rights groups have called an unconstitutional "poll tax."
Florida cannot prevent people with felony convictions from registering to vote if they cannot pay fines and other costs stemming from their convictions, a federal judge ruled on Friday, temporarily blocking a state law that civil rights' groups have called an unconstitutional "poll tax."
The ruling was a rebuke to the state's Republican governor, Ron DeSantis, and its Republican-controlled Legislature. Legislators had enacted a law requiring the fine and fee payments this year after voters resoundingly approved an amendment to the State Constitution that restored voting rights to as many as 1.5 million former felons.
The law was widely seen as an attempt to suppress voting by the former felons, many of them African-Americans or Hispanics who appeared likely to support Democrats.
The injunction technically affects only 17 plaintiffs in the suit challenging the law, all of whom said they lacked the money to pay costs stemming from their convictions. But the principle behind the ruling applies to all people convicted of felonies and will require the state to change its repayment policy if it stands, said Julie Ebenstein, a senior staff attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union.
Evidence in the lawsuit indicated that roughly four in five felons who have completed their sentences had unpaid fines, court costs or restitution to victims of their crimes.
"People can't be disenfranchised for outstanding legal financial obligations that they are unable to pay" she said. "Even though the ruling applies only to the individual plaintiffs, the process is obviously problematic" regardless of whom it is applied to.
Voting rights advocates who sought Friday's ruling hailed the injunction as a crucial step toward limiting the Legislature's effort to restrict access to the ballot.
The decision is "a critical step towards ensuring that the voting rights of other people with felony convictions are not trampled on by Florida officials," Leah Aden, the deputy director of litigation for the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, said in a statement. "We will continue to fight for full relief for Florida voters who must not pay to vote."
Florida officials had no immediate response to the ruling by Judge Robert L. Hinkle of the United States District Court in Tallahassee. The state could challenge the injunction in a higher court, change the law when the Legislature convenes next year or postpone action until a trial in the lawsuit, now scheduled for April, produces a definitive ruling on the law's legality.
Floridians restored the voting rights of felons who had completed their sentences -- except those convicted of murder or sex offenses -- in a referendum last November that passed with the backing of nearly 65 percent of voters. The Legislature sought to blunt the effect of the vote by passing a law that included any court-imposed financial obligations linked to a felony in the definition of "sentence."
The legislators went even further by specifying that those obligations included fines and other costs that had been converted to civil liens, a common court practice applied to costs that felons are unable to pay. Civil liens cancel the criminal nature of the obligations, converting them to ordinary debts like loans or credit card purchases.
By requiring people with felony convictions to pay legal obligations before registering to vote, the lawsuit's plaintiffs had argued, Florida legislators had effectively created a modern version of the notorious poll taxes used to disenfranchise African-Americans during the Jim Crow era. The United States Constitution's 24th Amendment did away with the practice, stating that the right to vote in a federal election could not be denied for failure to pay "any poll tax or other tax."
In his ruling, Judge Hinkle, who was appointed by President Bill Clinton in 1996, left open the question of whether the repayment provisions were in fact a poll tax.
He noted that the drafters of the constitutional amendment approved in November had indicated to the state Supreme Court that fines and other court costs were indeed considered part of a sentence, but he said that it was up to Florida courts to decide whether the amendment approved by voters required their repayment.
In any case, the judge said, it was clear that states have the right to deny voting privileges to people who can afford to pay such costs but choose not to.
But Judge Hinkle said the law was equally clear that Florida cannot refuse to restore a former felon's voting rights simply because the felon is unable to pay legal debts. In fact, he wrote, a 2005 ruling in the United States Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit involving a Florida felon who was unable to pay restitution stated that "access to the franchise cannot be made to depend on an individual's financial resources."
The state can investigate whether a former felon's claim of poverty is legitimate, the judge wrote, and can establish a process for deciding whether and how voting rights should be restored. But "what the state cannot do," he wrote, "is deny the right to vote to a felon who would be allowed to vote but for the failure to pay amounts the felon has been genuinely unable to pay."
Under the preliminary injunction, the judge wrote, the 17 former felons who are plaintiffs in the case can seek to regain their voting rights by proving to the state that they are unable to pay their legal debts.
"When an eligible citizen misses an opportunity to vote, the opportunity is gone forever; the vote cannot later be cast," he wrote, adding: "Each of these plaintiffs have a constitutional right to vote so long as the state's only reason for denying the vote is failure to pay an amount the plaintiff is genuinely unable to pay. The preliminary injunction is necessary to prevent irreparable harm to any such plaintiff."
Micah Kubic, the executive director of the A.C.L.U. of Florida, hailed the ruling.
"The court's decision is clear: The right to vote cannot be denied to anyone based on their inability to pay," he said in a statement. "The state must create a clear and unencumbered process that provides Florida's returning citizens the ability to vote. This is an important win for our democracy."

In New Energy Chief, A Familiar Role: Lobbyist

WASHINGTON -- President Trump likes to say that people in his political orbit come straight out of central casting, "tough hombres" from far beyond the Capital Beltway ready to roil the swamp.
Increasingly, though, his cabinet is full of lobbyists.
On Friday came the latest lobbyist elevation. Out went Energy Secretary Rick Perry, the genial former governor of Texas and onetime Dancing with the Stars contestant. In came his deputy, Dan Brouillette, who spent much of his career as a senior vice president of the United Services Automobile Association, a financial services company, and at the Ford Motor Company.
Mr. Trump called him "a total professional," in a staff change by Tweet: "Dan's experience in the sector is unparalleled," the president said.
The pattern holds throughout the agencies trusted to provide for the common defense, promote clean air and water, care for public lands and waters, and safeguard energy supplies and nuclear weapons.
Mr. Trump, who campaigned for president on the oft-repeated pledge to "drain the swamp," initially favored charismatic former politicians with a flair for the dramatic, like Mr. Perry; or former Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, a former member of the Navy SEALs who arrived to work on horseback; his first Environmental Protection Agency administrator, Scott Pruitt, a bellicose Oklahoma attorney general; or his first defense secretary, Jim Mattis, a former Marine Corps general whom Mr. Trump introduced as "Mad Dog."
All are gone, replaced by lobbyists -- less camera-ready but more familiar with the inner workings of their agencies, if only because they spent years trying to influence them.
"Trump's rhetoric about draining the swamp, I don't think anyone really took seriously," said Tim LaPira, a professor of political science at James Madison University who studies Washington's revolving door.
A ProPublica and Columbia Journalism Investigations analysis this week found Mr. Trump brought in 281 former lobbyists since the start of the administration. His cabinet now includes a former coal lobbyist running the Environmental Protection Agency, a former oil and gas lobbyist in charge of the Department of Interior, a top lobbyist for the defense contractor Raytheon leading the Defense Department -- and, if he is confirmed, an automobile lobbyist at the Energy Department.
That might seem like business as usual for Americans who accepted candidate Trump's description of Washington as rife with influence peddlers and profiteers. But it might actually be worse than usual. Because of the extraordinarily high rate of turnover that is a hallmark of the Trump administration, the White House's human resources professionals have had little time to come up with outside-the-Beltway replacements for the constant stream of openings, Mr. LaPira said.
Jordan Libowitz, a spokesman for Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a liberal watchdog group, called the proliferation of lobbyists in Mr. Trump's cabinet deeply worrisome. He pointed to David Bernhardt, a former oil and gas lobbyist who served as deputy secretary of the Interior Department before he replaced Mr. Zinke in April as Interior secretary.
Mr. Bernhardt has been dogged by ethics investigations since he joined the Trump administration, in large part because of his lobbyist past. In April the Interior Department's internal watchdog opened an inquiry into allegations, revealed by New York Times investigations, that Mr. Bernhardt used his position to advance a policy pushed by his former lobbying client.
"The revolving door between industries and lobbying in the administration has always been a thing, but it is much more pronounced right now," Mr. Libowitz said. "It raises the question of whether things are being tilted in favor of industry as a rule, over what may be in the interest of the American people."
Elevating officials working as deputies or in the agency's trenches is nothing new. But Mr. Trump's penchant for simply promoting No. 2 officials to cabinet posts appears to be more a matter of expediency than a reward for hard work. Deputy secretaries have already been through grueling Senate confirmations, thus mostly eliminating the element of surprise in an administration not known for employing a stringent vetting process.
And for a president who has openly expressed his preference for having "acting" secretaries instead of confirmed ones, elevating a No. 2 to "acting secretary" avoids running afoul of a longstanding law, the Vacancies Act, that requires secretary positions to go to ranked officials in the department who have been confirmed by the Senate.
"The desirability of working for this president and working in these high profile jobs gets riskier and riskier over time, so I suspect the pool of applicants has also declined," said Kathryn Dunn Tenpas, a nonresident senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. Elevating a No. 2, she added, is "the path of least resistance."
Mr. Brouillette has a far less flashy history than Mr. Perry, having served behind the scenes for much of his career. Before working in the automobile industry, Mr. Brouillette served as the chief of staff to Billy Tauzin, a former Republican House member from Louisiana who became a lobbyist himself. Mr. Brouillette did a stint in the Department of Energy under George W. Bush as an assistant secretary for congressional affairs.
Others follow similar patterns. Andrew Wheeler, a coal lobbyist and longtime Capitol Hill aide, took the helm of the E.P.A. after Mr. Pruitt resigned amid scandal.
At the Department of Veterans Affairs, Mr. Trump turned to Robert L. Wilkie, an under secretary of defense, when an effort to install his personal physician failed. And in May Mr. Trump announced his intention to nominate Patrick M. Shanahan, the deputy defense secretary and former Boeing executive, to replace Mr. Mattis. Mr. Shanahan withdrew his name from consideration after facing questions about a domestic violence episode in 2010. In July the Senate confirmed Defense Secretary Mark Esper, the secretary of the Army who previously lobbied for Raytheon.
The No. 2s sliding into the No. 1 slots don't often appear at rallies or on the Sunday news programs. But historians noted that their deep experience as both lobbyists and lower-ranking agency officials means they know how to operate the levers of the federal government to change policy.
Alex M. Azar II, the secretary of health and human services, and William P. Barr, the attorney general, came to their posts with high levels of government and private sector experience, replacing predecessors who came straight from elective politics. Mr. Azar, a former drug company executive who served in the administration of George W. Bush, succeeded Tom Price, a former congressman. Mr. Barr succeeded Jeff Sessions, who came to the post straight from the Senate.
In some cases that has allowed them to affect policy in ways their predecessors had not -- particularly in energy and environment policy. Mr. Wheeler, for example, is more meticulous than Mr. Pruitt in following the rules as he rolls back environmental regulations. That could lead to fewer losses in court and far more success.
In the case of Mr. Brouillette, energy analysts said he shares Mr. Perry's personable style, but is known more for his deep knowledge of key policy issues related to nuclear weapons, cyber security and energy exports.
"He's more in the weeds of the management and the policy than Perry, who's more casting the vision and selling American energy technology and abundance," said Rich Powell, executive director of ClearPath Foundation, a conservative clean-energy group in Washington.
Charles Untermeyer, who served as director of presidential personnel under the first President George Bush, said the average tenure of a presidential appointment was about two years, so the departure of Mr. Perry at this point in the administration is not unusual. And, he said, the promotion of seconds-in-command who have knowledge and experience is commendable.
"We can only applaud this because these are people who know how Washington runs," Mr. Untermeyer said. "You need people who know how to make the machinery work."

Texto completo: Mexico City • Cartel gunmen paralyzed a major Mexican city Thursday, unleashing hails of automatic gunfire in broad daylight in a staggering show of force after soldiers arrested and then released Ovidio Guzmán López, the son of infamous drug lord Joaquín Guzmán Loera.
The violence began shortly after 3:30 p.m. in the city of Culiacán, the capital of Sinaloa state, when a patrol of 30 soldiers came under attack by individuals in a home in the neighborhood of Tres Ríos, according to government officials.
After taking control of the home, the security forces encountered and detained four men — among them Guzmán López, a leader in the Sinaloa cartel. Cartel gunmen then surrounded the home and engaged the armed forces, the officials said. But they ultimately decided to release him
Later, the cartel deployed fighters throughout the neighborhood and began burning vehicles and blockading streets throughout the city.
Gunfire continued into Thursday night, as soldiers and cartel fighters battled in the streets. In its brief statement, the government said it had opted to suspend its operation but did not elaborate on what exactly that meant. Later, it became clear through local media that the government forces had indeed released Guzmán López back into the custody of the cartel.
The development was a major humiliation for the government of President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, who has struggled to articulate a clear security strategy to combat Mexico’s record violence. Some analysts even cast doubt on the government narrative that 30 soldiers and national guardsmen were patrolling and came under attack by a small contingent of gunmen.
“My suspicion is that they went after him and they lost,” said Eduardo Guerrero, a security analyst in Mexico City.
The echoes of gunfire sent citizens fleeing for safety as the assault began, while others sat trapped in their vehicles, capturing footage on cellphone cameras. The harrowing videos, uploaded onto social media, showed heavily armed men in ski masks blocking streets and halting traffic while plumes of black smoke filled the sky.
Others showed the powerful weaponry wielded by the traffickers, including mounted .50-caliber guns.
The gunmen’s efforts, and successful overpowering of the government, offered a harrowing glimpse at the power and impunity with which drug cartels operate in Mexico. In capturing Guzmán López on his home turf, the government dealt yet another — but fleeting — blow to the Sinaloa cartel, which has struggled to regain its footing after the arrest and conviction of the elder Guzman, its longtime leader, known as El Chapo.
In its response, the cartel appeared to be sending a message of its own.
“In my 21 years of covering crime at the heart of drug world, this has been the worst shootout and the most horrible situation I have ever encountered,” said Ernesto Martínez, a local crime reporter who was caught in the middle of a gunbattle only a few feet away from his vehicle.
Martínez had gone to report on a separate shooting when he ran into an army vehicle, which had stopped a car with individuals carrying machine guns. Suddenly, he said, the gunfire started and the soldiers yelled: “Everybody down, shootout!”
Martínez said he then noticed a white vehicle with masked men shooting at the soldiers. He was still recording video of the scene as he drove to the nearest gas station looking for shelter.
“The sound of the bullets was so strong, I could almost smell the gunpowder,” he said.
The gunfight lasted for 20 minutes before another one erupted, he said. The second shootout lasted for almost four hours, he said, and continued late into Thursday.
Martínez said most of the confrontations took place in Tres Ríos, an upscale commercial and business district, but he said chaos reigned throughout the city with burned vehicles and houses and roadblocks in different locations, and gunshots being fired at government buildings, including the state attorney’s office.
Hours after the mayhem began, most businesses had closed, with people locked down in their houses and public transportation suspended in what Martínez described as a “self-imposed” state of emergency.
Mexico is facing its deadliest year since the country began recording homicide statistics more than 20 years ago. Warfare between rival cartels fighting for control of the drug trade to the United States has turned parts of the country into some of the deadliest places on Earth.
The government has continued to target top cartel leaders in its now 13-year war on drugs. This despite the fact that the so-called kingpin strategy has helped usher in the nation’s most violent period in recent history.
It is not unheard-of for cartel assassins to stage brazen attacks in broad daylight, often in response to an arrest of a high-ranking member or to target their enemies. In May 2018, gunmen stormed a Japanese restaurant in Guadalajara, targeting a former state prosecutor and setting off a gunbattle in an upscale area of the city.
Rumors quickly began circulating on social media late Thursday that the gunfights were related to the cartel that was run by Joaquín Guzmán Loera, which remains powerful in Sinaloa, his home state. He was convicted in February in the United States on drug, murder and money laundering charges, and was sentenced to life in prison.
In February, the Justice Department charged two of his sons, Joaquín Guzmán López and Ovidio Guzmán López, with one count each of conspiracy to “knowingly, intentionally, and willfully” distribute cocaine, methamphetamine and marijuana for import into the United States.
Two of Joaquín Guzmán Loera’s older sons who helped take over his business after his arrest in 2016, Iván Archivaldo Guzmán Salazar and Jesús Alfredo Guzmán Salazar, also face charges in the United States. The drug kingpin’s sons were often mentioned during his trial, and they were accused of helping to orchestrate his tunnel escape from a maximum-security prison in Almoloya, Mexico, in 2015.
But Thursday’s brazen display of firepower in the streets of Culiacán was extraordinary behavior for the Sinaloa cartel, which has generally tried to keep a lower profile, analysts said, a potential harbinger of a split in the nation’s once-dominant criminal organization.
Some believe the cartel’s show of force might reflect a schism within the group, one that deepened with the arrest of El Chapo. Since then, various factions have been jockeying for control and some suspected that it might have been one of those factions that engaged in Thursday’s mayhem.
“This break from the pattern signals a major disruption,” said Jaime López Aranda, a security analyst based in Mexico City. “I think that being so brazen and so open is the kind of thing done by organizations that are less disciplined and coherent and organized.”
“The ability to exercise restraint is key to an organization’s survival in the long term,” he added. “Successful criminal organizations are able to restrain themselves, and Sinaloa has been successful for a long time.”

Texto completo: Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is facing scrutiny after she alleged that Democratic presidential candidate Tulsi Gabbard is a "Russian asset" being used by Moscow to run as a third-party spoiler candidate in 2020.
Clinton, 71, pushed the theory on Campaign HQ podcast, which is hosted by former President Barack Obama's 2008 campaign manager, David Plouffe.
"They are also going to do third party again. I'm not making any predictions, but I think they’ve got their eye on somebody who is currently in the Democratic primary and are grooming her to be the third-party candidate," Clinton stated, referring to Gabbard without mentioning the Hawaii representative by name.
The failed presidential candidate's allegations levied against Gabbard, a major in the Army National Guard, went viral and received backlash.
Tweet Tweet Tweet Tweet Tweet
Despite the criticism, Nick Merrill, a top aide for Clinton said, "If the nesting doll fits" and added that "this isn't some outlandish claim."
Gabbard faced more accusations of being a "Russian asset" earlier this week when the New York Times published an article with the allegation and also labeled her an "Assad apologist." More recently, CNN analyst Bakari Sellers alleged that she is "a puppet for the Russian government."

‘Baseless smears’: Tulsi Gabbard fundraises off ‘outrageous’ Hillary Clinton accusation

Texto completo: 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Tulsi Gabbard is using Hillary Clinton's recent attack against her to ask for donations to her campaign.
"Hillary Clinton just went on David Plouffe’s podcast and accused Tulsi Gabbard — a combat veteran, soldier and Major in the Army National Guard — of being 'groomed' to be a 'Russian asset,'" the Hawaii congresswoman said in a Friday email to supporters. "When Tulsi said on that debate stage Tuesday night 'when I look out at our country, I do not see deplorables, I see fellow Americans,' she was talking about this. She was standing up to a corrupt party elite that holds exactly this kind of contempt for We, the People."
Gabbard, who served in Iraq from 2004 to 2005 and was deployed to Kuwait from 2008 to 2009, continued hitting back at the former secretary of state.
"The utter disdain for the truth — and refusal to face their own failures and hypocrisy — shown by establishment warmongers and their corporate media lackeys is not only insulting, it’s a threat to our democracy. From media blackouts, to baseless smears about Tulsi’s religion and progressive record, to outright despicable attacks by the New York Times, CNN, Neera Tanden and now Hillary Clinton on Tulsi's loyalty to the country she risked her life to serve: Hillary Clinton and her establishment cronies have their knives out for Tulsi, using her as an example in their campaign to intimidate and silence those who dare to stand up for peace," the email continued.
After calling Clinton's "outrageous" attack an attack on "anyone who stands up for peace," Gabbard asked supporters to contribute $25 "so we can put it straight to work in getting Tulsi’s message against the divisive smear merchants in front of as many Americans as possible before the end of the weekend."
In a Thursday podcast interview, the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee insinuated that Gabbard is a "Russian asset," arguing that the country is "grooming" her to spoil the 2020 election for Democrats via a third party run without mentioning the Hawaii Democrat my name.
In response, Gabbard called Clinton "the queen of warmongers, embodiment of corruption, and personification of the rot that has sickened the Democratic Party for so long." She also called Clinton's statement a message to "every veteran" that "you're also a traitor to this country."
Additionally, the New York Times published an article earlier this week accusing Gabbard of being a Russian stooge and alt-right figurehead, and a CNN commentator called her a "puppet for the Russian government." Gabbard slammed both criticisms during Tuesday night's Democratic primary debate as "completely despicable."

Honest socialists vs. Elizabeth Warren

Texto completo: The best way to expose an imposter is to stand her next to the real thing.
Elizabeth Warren had to stand next to Bernie Sanders at the Oct. 15 debate, and the comparison was not flattering for the former wonk from Massachusetts.
Warren, in preparation for her 2020 presidential run, attached herself to many of Sanders’ most popular socialist policies. Sanders proposed a wealth tax for billionaires in 2017, and Warren rolled hers out in 2019.
Most notably, when Sanders introduced a Medicare for All bill in 2017, codifying the plan he had championed during his 2016 run, Warren signed on as a cosponsor. Maybe she just thought she could say “I’m with Bernie” and thus take that issue off the table.
But she’s not actually with Sanders. An exquisite exchange at the latest debate illuminated the self-contradiction that is Warren.
“Will you raise taxes on the middle class to pay for it, yes or no?” New York Times political editor Marc Lacey asked Warren.
Warren’s subsequent comment (we can’t rightly call it a “response”) took the viewers on a magical journey across America, including a jaunt to Puerto Rico. She told stories of three different voters she had met. She spoke about her 70,000 selfies, arguing that such self-portraits should be “a new measure of democracy.” She wrapped up by saying that she thinks Medicare for All would help sick people, a belief that had already been stipulated in the question.
So Lacey followed up. “Sen. Sanders acknowledges he's going to raise taxes on the middle class to pay for Medicare for All. You've endorsed his plan. Should you acknowledge it, too?”
She didn’t acknowledge it.
In two subsequent remarks on the topic, the most she would say was that “costs are going to go up for the wealthy. They're going to go up for big corporations. They will not go up for middle-class families.”
But what about taxes?
Pete Buttigieg couldn’t help but notice exactly what had just happened: “A yes or no question that didn't get a yes or no answer."
Buttigieg went on: “No plan has been laid out to explain how a multitrillion-dollar hole in this Medicare for All plan that Sen. Warren is putting forward is supposed to get filled in.”
But that’s not exactly true.
Sanders, who “wrote the damn bill,” as Sanders himself put it, explained what Warren wouldn’t.
“I do think it is appropriate to acknowledge that taxes will go up,” Sanders said after five minutes of Warren’s evasions. “They're going to go up significantly for the wealthy. And for virtually everybody, the tax increase they pay will be substantially less — substantially less than what they were paying for premiums and out-of-pocket expansions.”
That is the honest articulation of the funding theory behind this legislation: Hike taxes on everyone, particularly the rich, then hope that for the middle class, the tax hike is smaller than the savings in medical expenses.
Sanders, who admits he is a socialist, is perfectly willing to say this. He believes in high taxes on everyone and in Washington as the redistributor of wealth. Warren can’t admit that, and if not for Sanders, she might get away with hiding what she’s up to.
We can guess why. For one thing, ordinary people, that is, non-accountants and non-socialists, don’t see paying taxes as the same thing as paying a service provider to provide services or paying an insurer to provide insurance. Not everyone is ready to embrace Uncle Sam as an all-powerful benign sovereign.
A second reason Warren might not be as frank as Sanders is that the math isn’t as simple as Sanders makes it out to be.
A recent study by the Urban Institute found that the Sanders-Warren plan would actually increase total healthcare spending by $7 trillion. That means Sanders and Warren can’t just redistribute healthcare costs around by removing them from the market and shifting them to Washington. They also have to shift spending from other things, such as food, education, and housing, into a new massive federal health insurance plan.
That means tax hikes for everyone.
An honest socialist could argue that these sacrifices are worth it. But a dishonest socialist, such as Elizabeth Warren, won't fess up.

Governor Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, signed a bill into law this summer that will kick in more government premium help for more people and that adds a penalty on the uninsured, substituting for the federal individual mandate zeroed out by Republicans. The state’s open enrollment is also much longer than the federal government’s because it began Oct. 15 and stretches until Jan. 31. In comparison, the federal marketplace that covers most states runs Nov. 1 to Dec. 15.
The state estimates that nearly 1 million people will pay less for their coverage when they shop on the state exchange, Covered California. Officials will spend $110 million on marketing and outreach about the law, a sum similar to recent years.
California’s marketing investment hasn’t always paid off: The Trump administration has come under fire by Obamacare critics for only paying $10 million toward marketing and another $10 million toward groups that help people enroll for coverage, but the enrollment in California hasn’t fared better overall despite the effort it put into marketing. Enrollment fell 2.3% in 2018 and in the last enrollment period they remained about the same. The boosted premium help that make the plans cheaper, however, may change the calculus. This year Covered California will be partnering with athletes to get the word out.
California’s expansion is similar to what House Democratic leaders want: The bill, Protecting Pre-Existing Conditions and Making Healthcare More Affordable Act, funnels more dollars into Obamacare so that more people will qualify for premium help, and adds more money for marketing. It does not, however, reinstitute the individual mandate. It’s worth noting that expanding subsidies is an idea that lowers premiums for people without instituting price controls, so it has the full backing of the healthcare industry.
Notably, there’s no public option in California: Not that state elected officials haven’t tired over the years, but the absence of a state example could create a hard sell for a future Democratic president. By Inauguration Day 2021, no state is slated to have tried a public option that candidates envision. One “public option” in Washington state is set to take effect in 2021, but that plan appears different than what candidates like Joe Biden have in mind because it would really be a private plan that pays healthcare providers less. When lawmakers passed Obamacare, they were able to point to the Massachusetts example.

PELOSI DRUG PRICING BILL MOVES AHEAD: Despite protests from Republicans, two House committees advanced legislation on Thursday introduced by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to let the federal government negotiate the price of up to 250 drugs.
Republicans trolled Pelosi’s top health aide. They introduced an amendment in the Energy and Commerce markup that would have renamed the bill the "Promoting Rationing in Medicine Under Socialism Act." And yes, that stands for “PRIMUS Act,” after senior Pelosi aide Wendell Primus.
The bill actually is being renamed. But it’s after Rep. Elijah Cummings, who died Thursday morning and during his time in Congress fought to have the government negotiate drug prices.
FORMER PLANNED PARENTHOOD HEAD EXPLAINS HER TWEETS ABOUT ABORTION: Former Planned Parenthood president Leana Wen said at the TIME 100 Health Summit that there needs to be a more nuanced discussion about abortion. “A lot of us believe that abortion is a complex moral issue,” she said. “And we may not want to have an abortion ourselves but would never get in the way of somebody else making this deeply personal medical decision for themselves. Or maybe we’re even uncomfortable about abortion but would not want women to die because they don’t have access to safe, legal abortion either.”
JUUL WILL NO LONGER SELL FRUIT-FLAVORED PODS, EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY: Embattled e-cigarette manufacturer Juul Labs announced Thursday it will halt nationwide sales of non-tobacco and non-menthol-flavored pods, including mango, cucumber, creme, and fruit. “We must reset the vapor category by earning the trust of society and working cooperatively with regulators, policymakers, and stakeholders to combat underage use while providing an alternative to adult smokers,” said CEO K.C. Crosthwaite:
The move is the latest in several that Juul is taking to paint itself as innocent in the huge run-up in vaping that has over 2 million teens using flavored e-cigarettes. In September, Crosthwaite announced that Juul would suspend all lobbying efforts in Washington, as well as broadcast and print advertising. President Trump teased an all-out ban on flavors in September.
VAPING-RELATED LUNG INJURIES AND DEATHS HAVE RISEN: The number of vaping-related lung injuries reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has risen to 1,479 and the death toll has hit 33.
JOHNSON & JOHNSON WILL PAY STATES OVER $115 MILLION IN A SURGICAL DEVICE SETTLEMENT: In the latest dust-up with the legal system, pharmaceutical giant Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiary Ethicon Inc. will pay 41 states and the District of Columbia $116.9 million to settle disputes over its marketing of an unsafe vaginal surgical mesh device.
The case against the company over the device, which was pulled from the market in 2012, is one of many against the company for shady marketing tactics for several products, from baby powder to opioids.
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK TO HEAR ARGUMENTS IN CONSCIENCE OBJECTION CASE: The American Civil Liberties Union will give oral arguments Friday in two cases against the Trump administration’s rule that would protect healthcare providers with religious objections from performing certain procedures, such as abortion, sterilization, and medically assisted suicide. The ACLU argued that the rule “would create a new pathway for discrimination, and be particularly devastating for patients who rely on federally funded healthcare.”
The rule, announced May 2 by Health and Human Services, has been heavily contested in court by liberal groups, including the Center for Reproductive Rights, Lambda Legal, Americans United for Separation of Church and State. They call it a “denial of care rule,” and argue that it allows providers to put patients’ health at risk for the sake of advancing religious beliefs.
PHYSICIAN GROUPS KEEP UP ARBITRATION PUSH: More than 110 national physician groups including the American Medical Association and the American Academy of Emergency Medicine are continuing their push to have Congress add arbitration to surprise billing legislation, telling Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer in a letter this week that it would incentivize insurers to make fair out-of-network payments on behalf of their customers. The Senate bill moved out of committee only has benchmarked prices, which would limit what doctors and hospitals can charge. McConnell hasn’t made any promises about the bill’s future.
DOUBLE TAKE — PETE BUTTIGIEG WAS A ‘MEDICARE FOR ALL’ SUPPORTER: Turns out Pete Buttigieg, who has come out in strong opposition of “Medicare for all” in his presidential campaign, used to be pretty fond of the plan.
He tweeted in February 2018, as Mayor of South Bend, Indiana: “I, Pete Buttigieg, politician, do henceforth and forthwith declare, most affirmatively and indubitably, unto the ages, that I do favor Medicare for All, as I do favor any measure that would help get all Americans covered. Now if you'll excuse me, potholes await.”
Buttigieg was responding to tweets from The People’s Summit, a progressive political organization, which had pressed him on whether he supported Medicare for all.

Hillary Clinton says Tulsi Gabbard is a 'Russian asset' groomed to ensure Trump reelection

Texto completo: Hillary Clinton said that Rep. Tulsi Gabbard is being groomed by Moscow to run as a third-party spoiler candidate in 2020 to help President Trump win reelection.
The former secretary of state pushed the theory on Campaign HQ podcast hosted by David Plouffe, President Barack Obama’s campaign manager in 2008.
Plouffe and Clinton discussed hurdles the Democratic nominee would face and compared the 2020 race to Clinton’s loss to Trump in 2016. Plouffe asked Clinton about the part third-party candidates, such as Jill Stein of the Green Party, played in 2016, allowing Trump to secure key states.
"They are also going to do third party again," Clinton, 71, said. "I'm not making any predictions, but I think they’ve got their eye on somebody who is currently in the Democratic primary and are grooming her to be the third-party candidate," Clinton said, referring to Gabbard, without mentioning the Hawaii representative by name.
"She is a favorite of the Russians. They have a bunch of sites and bots and other ways of supporting her so far. That's assuming Jill Stein will give it up, which she might not because she is also a Russian asset.
"They know they can't win without a third-party candidate, and so I do not know who it's going to be, but I can guarantee you they will have a vigorous third-party challenge in the key states that they most need it."
Gabbard, 38, has represented Hawaii in the House of Representatives since 2013. A major in the Hawaii Army National Guard, she served in a field medical unit in Iraq from 2004 to 2005 and was deployed to Kuwait from 2008 to 2009. This summer, she spent two weeks in Indonesia on a military training exercise.
In Tuesday's Democratic debate, Gabbard accused the New York Times of calling her a "Russian asset."
The newspaper published an Oct. 12 news article about Gabbard stating, "She is injecting a bit of chaos into her own party’s primary race, threatening to boycott that debate to protest what she sees as a 'rigging' of the 2020 election. That’s left some Democrats wondering what, exactly, she is up to in the race, while others worry about supportive signs from online bot activity and the Russian news media."
Gabbard said on the debate stage, "The New York Times and CNN have also smeared veterans like myself for calling for an end to this regime change war [in Syria]. Just two days ago, the New York Times put out an article saying that I’m a Russian asset and an Assad apologist and all these different smears."
In 2016, Gabbard supported Bernie Sanders over Clinton. But she congratulated Clinton on becoming the Democratic presidential nominee, saying, "She becomes the first woman to lead a major political party into the general election. Say what you will about her, let's give credit where it due. This is one tough, smart woman. Most might wilt under the fire and criticism she's endured."
Gabbard faces a 2020 primary challenge for her House seat from Democratic state Sen. Kai Kahele.

Emily Bautista grew up on "Miss Saigon." The original cast recording, at least.
"Growing up, being a Filipino-American, this show is a very big deal in our culture," she said. "Growing up, I heard the music ... it was always playing. I remember a lot of songs being like lullabies for me as a child."
Bautista was speaking from Denver, where the U.S. tour of "Miss Saigon" was playing. The tour comes to Spokane on Wednesday for seven performances, with Bautista in the lead role of Kim.
She'd never seen the show but knew she wanted to be part of it. When word got out that a revival of "Miss Saigon" was transferring from London to New York, Bautista's father wrote an email to an address he found on producer Cameron Mackintosh's website.
He was not in show business. He had no connections to show business. He was just a dad who thought his daughter would be perfect as Kim, the young woman at the center of "Miss Saigon" and wanted to hear about audition opportunities.
"A year later, it was going on in London at that point, but we didn't know it was coming to New York," the Connecticut-raised actress said. "So it was right timing, right place, right age. It was a bunch of things that lined up."
Ten auditions later, she was offered the understudy role to Eva Noblezada, who earned a Tony nomination for her performance of Kim, and a spot in the ensemble.
"I'd never done anything professional theater-related before, so they put me through the wringer," she said. "I think a lot of it was a test to see if I had the stamina to do it, if I had the commitment to do it. And those were two things I really strived to show that I had.
The show, from "Les Miserables" creators Claude-Michel Schönberg and Alain Boublil, is a reworking of Giacomo Puccini's opera "Madame Butterfly." Set in 1904, "Madame Butterfly" tells the story of a doomed Japanese girl who marries - and is betrayed by - an American Navy officer.
Set against the backdrop of the war in Vietnam, "Miss Saigon" tells the story of a doomed Vietnamese girl, Kim, a prostitute who falls in love with an American soldier as the war is accelerating to a close.
As one would expect from the creators of "Les Miserables," the show is a spectacle with a capital "S" complete with a helicopter to help re-create the evacuation of the U.S. Embassy in Saigon as the city fell to North Vietnamese forces.
The revival is directed by Laurence Connor. He made it a "top priority to make it as gritty and real as it could possibly be," Bautista said. The cast watched documentaries about Vietnam and the war during rehearsal to bring added realism to their performances.
She recently traveled to Vietnam, she said, and is "proud to see that what we're doing onstage is very realistic in comparison to what happened in Vietnam."
Controversy has always found "Miss Saigon." When the show opened in London in 1989, white actor Jonathan Pryce portrayed the Eurasian pimp called the Engineer complete with makeup to change his skin tone and prosthetics to change the shape of his eyes.
By the time the show came to Broadway in 1991, Pryce had left the makeup and slanted eyes at home and won a Tony for his performance. Since then, producers have made a point of casting Asian actors in Asian roles.
Other changes have been made. When the show was revived, first in London in 2014 and New York in 2017, the lyrics to the song "The Ceremony" were rewritten from the nonsense words featured in the original to actual Vietnamese words.
Not everyone has been mollified. Viet Thanh Nguyen, author of the Pulitzer Prize-winning novel "The Sympathizer," wrote an op-ed in the New York Times this summer arguing that "Miss Saigon" continues to perpetuate stereotypes that Asians are small, weak and effeminate.
While he appreciates that the show offers important roles for actors of Asian ancestry, the fantasy it depicts - that Asia, and thus Asians, are in need of "Western benevolent guidance" - isn't worth it.
"Perhaps those of us who detest the musical would not be so upset if there were other stories about Asians or Vietnamese people that showed their diversity," he wrote.
"If there were a thousand stories onstage and onscreen about us - or even if there were just a dozen - we might forgive 'Miss Saigon.' " For Bautista and her fellow castmates, the criticism seems misguided.
"Being an Asian-American actress, this is one of the roles I've wanted to play because of how strong she is. I can't begin to describe how proud I am to be able to portray a character like Kim," Bautista said.
"And when I was in the ensemble, I was proud to portray the characters I was portraying because it was real life, and it showed the strength and power that these women had. This is what they had to do to feed their families, and there is so much strength in that."
She hopes that when audiences see "Miss Saigon," they attend with an open mind and heart.
"It's not an easy topic ... but it did happen. It is history, and I think we have to learn from history. A lot of the morals in our show are not dead today," she said. These are two people who meet in a brothel. "Their two souls connect, and they fall in love, past racial differences, past political differences, past all this stuff. Love trumps at the end of the day."

Marine Corps says second man in Iwo Jima flag photo was misidentified

Texto completo: It's among the best-known photographs in American military history: six U.S. Marines raising an American flag over the Japanese island of Iwo Jima during World War II.
But for the second time in more than three years, the Marine Corps said that one of the men in the picture had been misidentified for decades.
The Marine Corps said the man, mostly obscured behind the Marine who is second from the right, is not Pfc. Rene Gagnon, as had been previously thought. Rather, it is Cpl. Harold Keller, according to a letter from the Marine Corps received by Keller's daughter last week and news reports.
The corps had formed a board to review the possibility after private historians presented new evidence, according to the letter.
“The identities of the flag raisers is something the Marine Corps has always been obligated to confirm, and the board findings do so," Gen. David Berger of the Marine Corps wrote in the letter.
The finding was reported Wednesday evening by NBC News. The Marine Corps did not immediately respond to requests for comment Wednesday night.
Days after the photograph was captured Feb. 23, 1945, during the battle of Iwo Jima, one of the bloodiest in World War II, it appeared on the front pages of newspapers across the country. The scene has been engraved on stamps and memorialized in a sculpture near Arlington National Cemetery, which depicts six 32-foot-tall figures in the same positions as the men in the photograph.
Joe Rosenthal of The Associated Press won a Pulitzer Prize for the picture.
But the image has also generated scrutiny, including from those who have questioned whether the scene was staged. Rosenthal defended the photograph's authenticity until his death in 2006. The Marines have fended off similar accusations.
In June 2016, the corps said that it had wrongly identified one of the men in the picture following an internal investigation that was opened in response to questions raised by producers working on the documentary “The Unknown Flag Raiser of Iwo Jima."
The corps found in 2016 that Pfc. Harold Schultz, was one of the six men in the photograph. It also determined that a Navy hospital corpsman, John Bradley, whose son wrote a best-selling book about his father's role in the flag-raising that was made into a movie directed by Clint Eastwood, was not in the image.
The corps began investigating the photograph again in July 2018 after a trio of researchers — Stephen Foley, Dustin Spence and Brent Westemeyer — unearthed new photographs and film footage of the scene atop Mount Suribachi on Iwo Jima.
Photographs showed the patterns of Keller's fatigues matching those of one of the flag raisers. It also showed that he, like the man raising the flag, was holding a cigarette, Spence said.
“It's like a court case," Spence said. “You're putting together evidence. If I was a prosecutor, a lawyer, that's what I'm presenting. That's our case."
Kay Maurer, Keller's daughter, who lives in Clarence, Iowa, said in an interview Wednesday night that the corps told her last year that it was looking into the possibility that her father, who died in 1979, was in the picture. The corps told her it had used facial recognition technology and had enlisted the Army's help to verify the researchers' findings.
Last month, the corps called again with the news that her father was, in fact, in the photograph, Maurer said. She said that her father rarely discussed the war, probably because many of his friends died or were injured in it.
She said she felt proud to learn that her father had raised the flag but also “heartbreak that he didn't feel he could share that with us."
She said, “I think he lost so many buddies, that I think he just didn't want to bring any glory into a conversation about that flag."

Texto completo: President Trump and his allies seized on debate moments over taxes, health care and economic inequality to portray the Democratic candidates as tax-and-spend liberals.
WASHINGTON -- President Trump and his allies sought to turn the Democratic debate on Tuesday night into a referendum on the congressional impeachment inquiry, accusing the party's presidential candidates and its leaders in Washington of pursuing a vendetta against Mr. Trump while ignoring more pressing pocketbook issues.
But Republicans also saw an opportunity to seize on debate moments over middle-class tax increases, health care reform and economic inequality to portray the Democrats as tax-and-spend liberals -- in hopes of redirecting the national conversation at a time when public opinion is moving against the president.
In a series of early-morning tweets, Mr. Trump referred to the 12 Democrats onstage Tuesday night in Ohio as "clowns" who would wreck the economy if ever elected.
During the debate, he and his campaign manager, Brad Parscale, gloated about his prospects for re-election, sharing an image from a recent Moody's Analytics model that showed Mr. Trump was favored to win virtually every swing state in the country, including ones he failed to carry in 2016 like Virginia and New Hampshire.
This was consistent with the nonchalance that Mr. Trump has tried to project about impeachment and questions of his political vulnerabilities. What the tweets did not include, however, was a second graphic in the model showing a likely Democratic victory if voter turnout is historically high, as it was in the 2018 midterm elections.
Tuesday's CNN/New York Times debate was the first since Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced that the House of Representatives would formally look into whether Mr. Trump committed impeachable offenses for soliciting Ukrainian assistance with his re-election campaign.
It was clear from the tenor of the Republican statements -- which were laced with defiance, bluster and scorn -- that the Trump campaign and its allies hope the president can still win over an American public that, polls show, increasingly supports the impeachment inquiry and does not believe Mr. Trump has been truthful about his actions. The remarks also were a preview of the defense that G.O.P. leaders said they were planning as the impeachment inquiry enters a critical new phase on Capitol Hill, with House Democrats calling witnesses and issuing subpoenas to associates of Mr. Trump, like Rudolph W. Giuliani.
Republicans intend to argue, in effect, that a wide range of economic indicators -- from the unemployment rate to job growth -- show that Mr. Trump has been far more of a success than he gets credit for, while Democrats remain fixated on attacking him personally and politically.
"Democrats spent more time talking about President Trump's Twitter account and their phony impeachment charade than they did a positive vision for America," said Ronna McDaniel, chairman of the Republican National Committee. "That's because they don't have one, and it's going to cost them at the ballot box next November."
Republicans also hope that the more that Democrats talk about impeachment, the more opening they will have to cast it as illegitimate.
"It's not lost on people that many of these candidates were actually on the record supporting impeachment before anyone was even talking about Ukraine," said Andy Surabian, a Republican strategist and former Trump White House official.
The debate, held outside Columbus, Ohio, allowed Republicans to try to make their case in a state that Mr. Trump won by eight percentage points in 2016 and has many of the middle-class, blue-collar voters that he hopes to turn out again in next year's election. To underscore the point, the Trump campaign took out a full-page ad in the Columbus Dispatch on Tuesday that blared, "Democrats Will Kill Ohio Jobs ... President Trump's Fighting for the Economy."
The president remains historically unpopular, however. The Gallup presidential approval poll has measured public support for his job performance at below 50 percent for his entire presidency. To overcome this skepticism, Republicans have attempted to define the Democrats as out of touch and too far to the left of where most Americans' views are. Some of the Democratic candidates, like former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., hold moderate and liberal views, while Senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont are generally more progressive.
Senator Marco Rubio of Florida on Wednesday expressed the kind of binary argument that Republicans hope prevails on voters. "Last night's debate was a reminder that while you may not always agree with everything Trump says or does, the leading alternatives to Trump mock people with traditional beliefs & support socialism, gun confiscation & free government funded health care for unlawful immigrants," he wrote on Twitter.
With Ms. Warren the target of sustained attacks from the other Democrats onstage, Mr. Trump and his Republican allies moved to frame the race around the question of whether voters want a strongly liberal president and government in 2021.
On Tuesday night, after Mr. Sanders picked up the support of two high-profile liberals in the House Democratic caucus -- Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ilhan Omar -- Republicans jumped at the chance to make them a focal point in the morning-after debate analysis. The two freshmen are a favorite target of conservatives, who have caricatured them as the true leaders of their party.
"With this endorsement," Ms. McDaniel said later, speaking on Fox News, "everyone should be paying attention. They will take away our freedom, our fundamental rights."
Other Republicans saw a bigger story in the leading Democrat who was a less prominent presence on Tuesday: Mr. Biden, who seemed to veer from indignant at times to detached at others. They said his uneven performance was a sign that other candidates who displayed more gusto -- like Ms. Warren, Mr. Buttigieg and Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota -- were gaining prominence at his expense.
Alex Castellanos, a veteran Republican strategist, said the debate could be a turning point when "a new race began, one without Joe Biden."

Texto completo: WESTERVILLE, Ohio - The impeachment inquiry into President Trump unfolding in Washington was front and center on Tuesday as the largest field of candidates to date for a single presidential primary debate took to an Ohio stage.

Our framers have imagined this moment, a moment when we can have a corrupt president..., California Sen. Kamala Harris said. This is one of those moments, and so Congress must act. ... As a former prosecutor, I know a confession when I see it. He did it in plain sight.

Said Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren: Sometimes there are issues that are bigger than politics. ... Donald Trump broke the law in the summer. He broke it again this fall. We took a constitutional oath, and that is that no one is above the law, and that includes the president of the United States. Impeachment is the way that we establish that this man will not be permitted to break the law over and over again without consequences.

The surging Ms. Warren was the most frequent target of other candidates on the stage, as they sought to pin her down on whether her take on Medicare-for-all health insurance would come with a tax increase.

South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg said his plan would be Medicare for all those who want it, preserving private insurance as part of the system. That is not an option under the concept as outlined by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.

Medicare for all is the gold standard, Ms. Warren said. It's the way we get health-care coverage for every single American. ... We can pay for this. ... Costs are going to go up for the wealthy. They're going to go up for big corporations. They will not go up for middle-class families, and I will not sign a bill into law if it raises their costs.

Former Vice President Joe Biden also went after Ms. Warren on her plan as he and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar voiced support for expanding Obamacare to include a public option.

The [Medicare-for-all] plan is going to cost least $30 trillion over 10 years, he said. That is more on a yearly basis than the entire federal budget. ... A fireman and a school teacher making $100,000 a year, their taxes are going to go up about 10 grand. That's more than they will possibly save from this health-care plan.

Said Mr. Sanders: We spend twice as much per person as the people in any other major country on Earth. I'd like to see the Democratic Party have the guts to stand up to the drug companies and the insurance companies and tell them that the function of health care is the guaranteed care to all people, not to make a hundred zillion dollars in profit.

Mr. Biden also found himself on the defensive in addressing conflicts of interest with his son Hunter's role on the board of a Ukrainian gas company while his father was in the White House.

On Sunday, Mr. Biden had vowed that no one in my family will have an office in the White House, will sit in on meetings as if they're a cabinet member, will in fact have any business relationship with anyone that relates to a foreign corporation or a foreign country.

But CNN anchor Anderson Cooper asked, If it's not OK for a president's family to be involved in foreign businesses, why was it OK for your son when you were vice president?

Mr. Biden faltered some before offering, My son did nothing wrong, he said. I did nothing wrong. I carried out the policy of the United States government in rooting out corruption in Ukraine.''

Democrats are investigating whether President Trump used the power of his office to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to investigate his potential 2020 opponent and son. Tuesday's lively debate was the first since the U.S. House launched its impeachment investigation and since Mr. Sanders suffered a heart attack.

Half of the 12 candidates on that debate stage - Mr. Sanders, Ms. Warren. New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, Ms. Harris, and Ms. Klobuchar - may also have direct votes in determining Mr. Trump's fate, either for impeachment in the House or during a trial in the Senate.

The candidates also took aim at Mr. Trump over his decision last week to pull troops from northern Syria, seen as paving the way for NATO ally Turkey to launch a long-planned offensive to clear the region of Kurds, allies to the United States in the fight against ISIS, but considered to be terrorists by Turkey.

I would have a hard time today looking at Afghan civilians or soldiers in the eye after what just happened over there, Mr. Buttigieg, a military veteran, said. You take away the honor of our soldiers, you might as well go after their body armor next. This President has betrayed American values. Our credibility is in tatters.

Some of the field also exchanged attacks on gun reform in the wake of recent mass shootings, including in downtown Dayton two months ago where a shooter with a semi-automatic rifle took the lives of nine people, including his sister, in a downtown open-air entertainment district. Dayton Mayor Nan Whaley, a Democrat and outspoken advocate for gun reform, was seated in front of the candidates in the audience.

Mr. O'Rourke was asked a follow-up to his remark in the last debate - Hell yeah, we're going to take away your AR-15, your AK-47 - about how he would enforce a mandatory assault weapon buyback.

I expect my fellow Americans to follow the law, the same way that we enforce any provision, any law that we have right now, he said. We don't go door-to-door to do anything in this country. I expect Republicans, Democrats, gun owners, alike to respect and follow the law.

When addressing laws written by the Republican-controlled General Assembly in Ohio seen as restricting access to abortion rights, Ms. Harris said she would have her justice department review any such law to see if it is in line with Roe vs. Wade, the landmark Supreme Court ruling legalizing abortion.

These state legislators who are outdated and out of touch, mostly men who are telling women what to do with their bodies, there has to be accountability and consequence, she said.

Ms. Klobuchar said she would have Roe vs. Wade written into law.

You, Donald Trump, are not on the side of women, she said. You are not on the side of people of this country when over 75 percent of people who want to keep Roe vs. Wade on the books.

Otterbein University hosted the fourth primary debate for CNN and the New York Times in the affluent Columbus suburb of Westerville. The area is an example of a blue-leaning suburb that experts say Democrats need to take back the White House.

Mr. Sanders, who at 78 is the oldest candidate on the stage, sought to reassure supporters of his vigor going into the debate following his recent heart attack and stent procedure that took him off the campaign trail.

I'm healthy. I'm feeling great, he said at one point to laughs from the audience as he was asked about concerns about his age upon taking office.

Said Mr. Booker, We know that the unhealthiest person running for president is Donald Trump.

Also trying to make the case for their candidacies in the few minutes they were afforded were former housing secretary JuliÃ¡n Castro; tech businessman Andrew Yang, and, for the first time, billionaire Tom Steyer, whose campaign has revolved around Mr. Trump's impeachment.

In the hours before the debate, the Trump campaign took to the skies over Westerville with aerial advertising highlighting what it says is the Democratic field's lurch to the far left. Socialism Destroys Ohio Jobs. Vote Trump, read the green and white sign trailing the plane.

Tonight, we saw the Democrats pander to the progressive left during their visit to Westerville, but their vision of the future is a radical one that includes higher taxes, government controlled health care, and more government intervention overall, said Ohio Republican Party spokesman Evan Machan. As we saw in 2016, that agenda simply won't win here.

Texto completo: This column begins in Arkansas, pivots to Wisconsin and concludes with facts that have me rethinking part of my long-held antagonism toward the out-state voters who helped bring us Republicans Scott Walker and Donald Trump. First to Arkansas.
The New York Times recently published a Sunday Review cover story provocatively headlined: "In the land of self-defeat." Author Monica Potts returned to her rural Arkansas home of Van Buren County in 2017 and is writing a book about low-income women in her native state.
Her Times piece told of a fight over a local library and what Potts described as the "goit- alone" mythology that plagues small-town America. She described how a plan to pay a librarian $25 per hour met a hailstorm of opposition. She quoted one Facebook critic: "Call me narrow-minded but I've never understood why a librarian needs a four-year degree. We were taught Dewey decimal system in grade school. Never sounded like anything too tough."
Wrote Potts: "The library fight was, itself, a fight over the future of rural America, what it meant to choose to live in a county like mine, what my neighbors were willing to do for one another, what they were willing to sacrifice to foster a sense of community here. The answer was, for the most part, not very much."
Her conclusions were dark ones.
"I've realized that it is true that people here think life here has taken a turn for the worse. What's also true, though, is that many here seem determined to get rid of the last institutions trying to help them, to keep people with educations out, and to retreat from community life and concentrate on taking care of themselves and their own families. It's an attitude that is against taxes, immigrants and government, but also against helping your neighbor."
Later she wrote: "Most Americans live in cities, but our political system gives rural areas like Van Buren outsize voting power. My time here makes me believe that the impeachment scandal will not hurt Mr. Trump and that Democrats who promise to make the lives of people like my neighbors better might actually help him." Dark, indeed.
I emailed the article to Kathy Cramer because Potts prominently quoted the University of Wisconsin-Madison political scientist from a 2016 column Cramer wrote for Vox. Cramer, of course, gained national notoriety this decade for revealing the politics of rural resentment in Wisconsin before it was a widely understood thing.
Cramer quickly emailed me back with a note of caution.
"Such an interesting article, and of course I was flattered to be quoted," she said. "But it was awfully dire."
Two things, she told me, give her pause about its relevance to Wisconsin.
"One is a curiosity I have about whether the impact of the trade wars on our dairy farms is causing some folks to question Trump's leadership. Democrats should recognize, though, that losing faith in Trump does not automatically mean support for a Democratic candidate. The trouble is that lots of people, in rural America and elsewhere, think neither party represents them.
"The other thing is that in Wisconsin, rural communities have passed a ton of school referenda in recent years. Seems to me like people are quite willing to support their local schools with taxes if they know that money is going to stay in their community."
Cramer suggested I visit with Rob DeMeuse, a former public school teacher and current Ph.D. candidate in the UW-Madison School of Education, who has exhaustively researched school referenda across the state. He is developing a tool to predict which referenda will pass based on some 60 local factors. Cramer is on his dissertation committee.
So I met with DeMeuse at a local Panera and in less than an hour he blew up much of my oversimplified perception of out-state voters and how much they value public education.
Some necessary background: Walker was elected governor in 2010, then dropped his Act 10 bomb attacking teachers' pay and benefits and their collective bargaining rights, shepherding in a decade of curtailing Wisconsin's tradition of state support for public education. Because rural and small-town voters elected Walker three times (counting a failed recall vote), it was easy to see them as complicit in his anti-education efforts.
Now comes DeMeuse with his deep-dive data demonstrating that rural and small-town areas that strongly back Republicans have supported spending on their schools at the same historically high rates this decade as have all regions of the state.
"Trust in federal and state government has basically cratered," DeMeuse told me, "but trust in local government (which includes schools) is still relatively high."
He shared charts that showed that in the eight most recent years under Act 10, the proportion of approved referenda statewide has steadily increased from about 63 percent to 86 percent in the 2018-19 school year.
Surprisingly, at least to me, referenda in the subset of rural districts were approved at almost the same pace increasing from 61 to 86 percent in the most recent school year. So, while some rural voters may think teachers are overpaid and have cushy benefits, that didn't stop them from putting their own money into their local schools.
"These referendum dollar amounts and passage rates are only getting higher," he said, adding that $2.2 billion in school spending in Wisconsin was approved via referenda in the most recent academic year. Another way of looking at it, he said, is that the average person in Wisconsin spent $1,349 on school referenda in the eight years under Act 10 compared to only $606 in the eight years that preceded it.
DeMeuse's analysis is that rural voters back school spending because "they know that they are going to get their fair share of it, it's not going anywhere, and that's really appealing."
Now, a liberal's spin on all of this is that local voters were blackmailed into voting for extra local money because Walker and his allies decimated public education in pursuit of their real motive destroying the statewide teachers' union as a progressive political force. Then they were able to brag about cutting taxes, when all they actually did was force property taxpayers to step up.
That said, it's heartening to realize that all of Wisconsin apparently still cares mightily about the quality of local public education. Which, to me, hadn't always been clear.
Arkansas, it seems, we're not. CREDIT: By Paul Fanlund

Texto completo: Joe Biden's campaign burn rate is one of the highest of any top-tier presidential primary candidate since 2008, in July through September spending 12.1% more than it took in and more than 30% higher than his chief rivals, such as Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, according to data analyzed by the Washington Examiner.
In the third quarter of 2019, covering July through September, Biden's campaign raised $15.7 million and spent $17.6 million. The only candidate with a higher spending deficit was California Sen. Kamala Harris, who raised $11.8 million and spent $14.5 million, a 122.9% burn rate.
Among Biden's most costly expenditures, aside from staffing, was the use of private jets, which ran him $924,000. Biden also spent over $230,000 on "fundraising consultants" and tens of thousands of dollars on ritzy hotels such as the Carlyle Hotel in New York City.
At the end of September, Biden's campaign had $8.98 million cash on hand, compared to Sanders, the Vermont senator who sits on $33.7 million, Massachusetts Sen. Warren at $25.7 million, South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg at $23.4 million, and Harris at $10.5 million.
Biden's campaign dismissed concerns that its spending was unsustainable after Tuesday night's Democratic debate in Ohio.
“I think that we have the resources that we need to run our race. I think at the end of the day, decisions about money — it’s more important how you spend the money than how you raise it. We have the resources that we need to continue to run our race. We’ve always said we think that this race is going to be a dogfight, and it’s going to go long," said Biden spokeswoman Kate Bedingfield Tuesday night in the post-debate spin room. "We’re building an operation that is going to, that is going to be sustained that, you know, we think we’re going to be able to communicate with voters that we need to communicate with. So, we are 100% confident that we have what we need to run our race.”
The only other candidate closest to Biden's burn rate was Buttigieg, who spent 96.3% of what he took in. Billionaire businessman Tom Steyer, who is virtually funding his entire campaign, had a 94.8% burn rate.
For comparison, Barack Obama in the third quarter of 2007 ran a 100.9% burn rate in his successful Democratic primary fight against Hillary Clinton. In the third quarter of 2011, future Republican nominee Mitt Romney ran a 86.6% burn rate.
More discouragingly for Biden, his campaign's current burn rate closely echoes the 2007 fundraising number of Republican candidate Rudy Giuliani's, who brought in $11.6 million and spent $13.3, a 114.7% burn rate.
At the time, Giuliani was the front-runner of the GOP. The former New York City mayor held double-digit leads over his Republican opponents. But his campaign soon fell apart, as the former New York City mayor skipped early voting states such as Iowa in favor of Florida, weeks later. He soon dropped out, with Arizona Sen. John McCain claiming the Republican nomination in 2008.
Biden's fundraising report, which like all 2020 candidates was due with the Federal Elections Commission by the end of Tuesday, also shows top donors are growing skittish over his chances to pull out a win. In the second quarter, covering April through June, Biden raised $22 million and refunded $540,000 of that to donors at a 2.5% rate.
This latest quarter, however, Biden refunded $836,000, or 5.3%. Of that, 156 individuals received back their $2,700 donation. Warren's refund rate during her entire presidential run was only 0.4%.
And Biden raised relatively paltry amounts from supporters in early voting states. Biden raised $59,541 from Iowa residents and $46,479 from New Hampshire residents.
Recent surveys have shown a precipitous drop of support for Biden's candidacy among Democratic voters. In Iowa, Warren leads Biden by over 3 points in an average of recent polls. Multiple surveys released last month show Warren pulling ahead in New Hampshire as well. A September poll of Nevada voters showed Biden tied with Sanders.

Texto completo: “I think it is important for us to send a signal that we are not hellbent on regime change,” presidential candidate Barack Obama said in 2007. He was talking about Iran but citing former President George W. Bush’s disastrous precedent of ousting Saddam Hussein in Iraq. Obama defined his candidacy in opposition to that 2003 regime change war and eventually became president.
Times have changed. Most Democrats in Tuesday night’s CNN/New York Times presidential debate blasted President Trump’s decision to withdraw American troops from northern Syria and said they believe his decision endangers the Kurds. But only one candidate said the United States should also stop pursuing an overall “regime change war” in that country.
Rep. Tulsi Gabbard said, “We've got to understand the reality of the situation there, which is that the slaughter of the Kurds being done by Turkey is yet another negative consequence of the regime change war that we've been waging in Syria.”
“Donald Trump has the blood of the Kurds on his hands,” the Hawaii Democrat continued, “but so do many of the politicians in our country from both parties who have supported this ongoing regime change war in Syria that started in 2011, along with many in the mainstream media, who have been championing and cheerleading this regime change war."
Gabbard cited U.S. sanctions on Syria, American military intervention, and our aid to rebel groups that have included al Qaeda, all in the name of undermining Syrian dictator Bashar Assad’s regime.
Gabbard noted that this “started in 2011,” offering a reminder that this “regime change war” began and was overseen mostly by Obama. Her fellow Democrats weren’t having it.
South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg shot back, “Respectfully congresswoman, I think that is dead wrong. The slaughter going on in Syria is not a consequence of American presence, it's a consequence of a withdrawal and betrayal by this president of American allies and American values.”
This sounded like most Republicans who criticized Obama for winding down the U.S. presence in Iraq in 2011.
“I didn't think we should have gone to Iraq in the first place,” Buttigieg continued. “I think we need to get out of Afghanistan. But it is also the case that a small number of special operations forces and intelligence capabilities were the only thing that stood between that part of Syria and what we're seeing now, which is the beginning of a genocide and resurgence of ISIS.”
Gabbard asked Buttigieg if he wanted to have “U.S. troops in Syria for an indefinite period of time.”
“You can put an end to endless war without embracing Donald Trump's policies,” Buttigieg replied.
And there you have it.
Regime change wars are just fine with most 2020 Democrats, so long as it allows them to oppose Trump. The president’s recent policy in Syria is not unlike the anti-regime change stance Obama promoted as a candidate in 2008. The Obama-Biden ticket won the White House by opposing Bush’s regime change war in Iraq and promising not to repeat that mistake (although they eventually did).
They've completely flip-flopped. Biden himself said Tuesday that if the U.S. military didn’t remain engaged in Syria, “ISIS is going to come here.” This was pure Dick Cheney.
To their credit, most of the Democrat candidates Tuesday said they wanted the U.S. out of the Middle East. But the only one who took the same stance as the throngs of liberals who marched in the streets in 2003 to protest the Iraq War was Gabbard.
After the debate, it’s clear why the Democratic establishment hates Tulsi Gabbard so much: She is more concerned with being anti-war than anti-Trump. Most Democrats today are not.

Curb Cost Of Health Care

Texto completo: American health care is by far the most expensive in the world. It accounts for about 18 percent of the entire economy and costs more than $10,000 per person every year.
Now, a major study published Oct. 7 in the Journal of the American Medical Association has concluded that between 20% and 25% of that spending is wasteful.
In terms of money, that is about $760 billion every year, roughly equal to the cost of the Medicare program, more than the entire U.S. defense budget and comparable to total spending nationwide on public education.
The study, conducted by researchers for the University of Pittsburgh and the health insurer Humana, analyzed 54 academic studies on health care waste that have been conducted since 2012. They concluded that the single largest source of wasteful health care spending, about $266 billion per year, is in the area of administration - the vast system for billing and reporting among health care providers and public and private health insurers.
Don Berwick, a physician and senior fellow at the Institute for Healthcare Improvement, told The New York Times that much of that administrative waste could be resolved by moving to a single-payer system.
“What stands in the way of reducing waste, especially administrative waste and out-of-control prices, is much more a lack of political will than a lack of ideas about how to do it,” he said.
The second-leading area of wasteful spending is in pricing, the study found, in the amount of more than $230 billion a year. That could be resolved through true competition rather than the ongoing wave of consolidated regional health monopolies, or by the sort of health care price controls that governments impose in most other developed countries, or both.

Texto completo: The majority of the vaping-related illnesses in Massachusetts remain tied to marijuana, but state health officials said Wednesday that they still can't say whether the vapes making people sick are from regulated stores or the illicit market.
“We don't have all of those details yet, because as the investigation is ongoing, that's one of the questions we hope to be able to better explain, and we'll bring that back to you when we have that," Dr. Monica Bharel, the state's public health commissioner, told reporters Wednesday.
Bharel said researchers have been performing “investigatory work" that includes interviewing patients and reviewing their records.
Federal authorities, meanwhile, said Wednesday that most of the mysterious illnesses nationwide linked to vaping THC, the psychoactive compound of marijuana, have been traced to the illicit market.
“For the lung injury outbreak, while the vast majority report using THC-containing pre-filled cartridges, they report getting them from informal sources or off the street, not necessarily from licensed dispensaries," Anne Schuchat, of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told a House subcommittee.
Massachusetts officials have reported 29 cases of vaping-related illnesses to the CDC, and 20 of the cases have involved patients who vaped THC. Thirteen of those 20 patients said they used marijuana vaporizers only. The other seven reported using marijuana and nicotine vaporizers.
Of the 29 cases, 10 are confirmed and 19 are probable. The state has received 123 other reports of vaping-related illnesses since Sept. 11. Sixty have been ruled out as confirmed or probable vaping-related illnesses. Even in the cases that were ruled out, Bharel said, the patients were “still having some symptoms related to using the products."
Some of the cases may have occurred before Sept. 11, when Bharel mandated thatclinicians report suspected vaping illnesses to the state.
State investigators are using the CDC's definition of “probable" and “confirmed" cases, employing chest X-rays, the patient's symptoms, and the patient's reported vaping behavior to determine whether vaping was a likely cause.
One person has died in Massachusetts from a vaping-related illness: a Hampshire County woman in her 60s. When officials announced her death in early October, they said initial reports indicated she had vaped nicotine. Across the country, at least 31 vaping-related deaths have been reported by state officials, 26 of which have been confirmed by the CDC.
In Massachusetts, vaping-related illnesses have affected people of all ages. Of the cases reported to the CDC, nine were under age 20, seven from 20 to 29, seven from 30 to 49, and six 50 or older.
Governor Charlie Baker last month instituted a four-month ban on the sale of vaping products. Bharel said the ban is “absolutely" still the right move.
“Right now, we do not know what is causing this," Bharel said. “And the ban allows us a pause, so we can do these investigations and further understand and put in regulatory framework to protect all of us, and especially our youth."

Texto completo: He was a guest star on such classics of boomer kitsch as "The Monkees," "The Munsters" and "The Mod Squad." But if you do remember him, it's likely for one thing only: his imitation of inebriation. Brooks made his slurring, stammering "funny drunk act" a TV staple, back when drunks were still considered, well ... funny.
To recall his career is to marvel at what a difference a generation or two makes.
That era produced another TV trope that, in hindsight, seems equally bizarre: the funny sexual harasser. A hundred times, you saw it: the lecherous boss chasing the nubile secretary around the desk. A hundred times, it didn't register as anything but a joke.
And again, the memory makes you marvel at how the times, they have changed.
In their new book, "She Said," Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey, the New York Times reporters who broke the Harvey Weinstein sexual harassment story, remind us that early October contains three anniversaries, each a milestone of the progress we have - and have not - made in learning to take sexual assault seriously.
October 7, 2016: The Washington Post releases the now-infamous "Access Hollywood" video where presidential candidate Donald Trump brags about sexually assaulting women. "And when you're a star, they let you do it," he says. "Grab them by the p-y. You can do anything."
October 5, 2018: The Senate advances the nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court despite a credible allegation that, as a drunken teenager, he attempted to rape a then-classmate, research psychologist Christine Blasey Ford.
Between those two dates - October 5, 2017 - the Times published its report on the film producer Weinstein and his alleged assaults on women in his professional circle, including the actor Ashley Judd. Later, Gwyneth Paltrow and Annabella Sciorra would also number themselves among the accusers.
The story opened a floodgate. By the time the wave of accusations crested, it had splashed dozens of famous men: Matt Lauer, Charlie Rose, Mario Batali, Louis C.K., George H.W. Bush and Al Franken among them. Once-silent women found their voices under a hashtag - #MeToo.
"She Said" recounts the journalistic detective work that led to the breakthrough. It's a compelling story that leaves one pleased to see the good guys - the good "gals," really - get a win. But let us be clear on the limitations of that win. Indeed, the convergence of those anniversaries speaks eloquently to America's ongoing irresolution on matters of sexual harassment and assault. Sure, Weinstein is facing charges, but Kavanaugh went to the Supreme Court, and Trump, to the White House.
Still, the story Twohey and Kantor broke changed gender politics. Predictably, there came a backlash, increasing numbers of male managers reportedly refusing to mentor female subordinates. That would seem to open them to civil sanctions. It will be fun to watch one of them try to defend his sexism in court, perhaps before a judge with lady parts.
Elsewhere, folks just want to know, where is the line? Is it allowed to tell a coworker you find her attractive? Can you share - or laugh at - a bawdy joke? "So much was suddenly open to question," write Kantor and Twohey.
And it is. And that is surely frustrating and difficult.
On the other hand, some of us remember when the boss chased the secretary while the laugh track howled. We thought nothing of it. Now people are wondering what's acceptable? Maybe that's not the worst thing in the world.

How toxic should we let political speech get?

Texto completo: When I heard that President Trump had condemned a violent video parody that depicted a fake Trump shooting mainstream media and his political critics, I wondered whether he actually was upset that he hadn't tweeted the grisly video first.
After all, the president was nowhere to be seen as he announced his criticism through a White House spokeswoman. But while his fingerprints might not be on the video, its creator is part of a loose network of right-wing provocateurs who have a direct line to the White House, including Trump's social media director Dan Scavino, according to The New York Times and NBC News.
The controversial video made news after it was screened in a side room at a three-day event last week by a pro-Trump organization called American Priority at the Trump National Doral Miami, according to The New York Times, which obtained footage from the event.
It shows a fake President Trump superimposed over actor Colin Firth as he shoots up a crowd in a church in the 2014 action-comedy "Kingsman: The Secret Service." Labels or faces superimposed on the mowed-down identify them as major news media and political celebrities, including Kathy Griffin and Rosie O'Donnell, as well as political rivals former President Barack Obama, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Sen. Bernie Sanders, Rep. Maxine Waters and the late Sen. John McCain.
I couldn't help but wonder how many of the sickos who came up with this video -- or applauded it -- were among the multitudes who demanded Griffin's firing and worse in May 2017 when she posted a video of herself holding a bloody Donald Trump mask like a severed head.
After a ferocious blowback in which lost her annual job as co-host on CNN's New Year's Eve special and was interviewed by the Secret Service, Griffin tearfully apologized in an online video in which she admitted she "went way too far."
Now it's Griffin's turn to be offended. On Sunday she spoke out, along with Meghan McCain, daughter of the late senator, and others, in expressing outrage over the new video from Trump's online supporters.
But an early version of the video actually appeared online about 18 months before it made national news, NBC reported. A video creator who goes by TheGeekzTeam uploaded it on Reddit, where it went viral and attracted donations. This led to 20 more videos, almost all of them variations on the same theme of Trump as superhero battling media and political rivals like Superman battling Lex Luthor.
By late summer, TheGeekzTeam joined MemeWorld, a community of pro-Trump digital creators, which was invited to a White House conference of what turned out to be mostly conservative internet content creators.
Welcome to the meme wars, the use of internet memes -- humorous images, clips and statements intended to go viral on the web -- to spread propaganda against one's political rivals. Past presidential candidates would openly condemn such vile viral messages for degrading our electoral process. Trump's strategy has encouraged them.
In his new and well-timed book, "Antisocial: Online Extremists, Techno-Utopians, and the Hijacking of the American Conversation," New Yorker writer Andrew Marantz argues that the "edge lords," slang for the nihilists, conspiracy theorists, right-wing nationalists and white supremacists who pollute internet message boards, have worked to undermine the reasonable online discourse that the web at its best can provide.
Marantz is so distressed by such "gate crashers" that he recently has called for some second thoughts on the value of free speech and free press. In interviews and a recent New York Times op-ed, "Free Speech is Killing Us," he observes after years of internet-inspired violence, "I no longer have any doubt that the brutality that germinates on the internet can leap into the world of flesh and blood."
In an interview on public radio's "On the Media," Marantz clarified that he's not questioning the value of free speech, just "free speech absolutism." Just as the Supreme Court has said it's criminal to shout "fire" in a crowded theater -- unless there really is a fire -- he says we should take other virtues such as public safety into account when defending free speech. Perhaps, but how?
Marantz raises important points, but I still lean toward the absolutists. While internet companies, like any other media giants, have a civic obligation to do no harm, efforts to have government take on that role tend to sweep with too broad of a broom. We, the public, have an obligation to root out dangerous or offensive speech and counter it with more speech in pursuit of the truth. It's hard work in an increasingly complex media age, but it's worth the effort.

Texto completo: Former New Jersey Gov. Christie Whitman insinuated that President Donald Trump is worse than Adolf Hitler while tweeting a New York Times story Monday about a fake video of Trump killing members of the media.
"#Hitler has nothing on #Trump," Whitman wrote, with a link to the story.
The fake video was played at a conference hosted by a pro-Trump group at his Miami resort last week, The New York Times reported. The video is an edited version of a scene from the movie "Kingsman: The Secret Service" and has Trump's face inserted over the face of a character from the film as he enters the "Church of Fake News."
The character then opens fire on the people inside, who have news organizations' logos or the faces of Democratic lawmakers and other critics superimposed on their bodies.
The White House on Monday said Trump has not seen the video but condemns its contents.
Whitman was New Jersey's 50th governor and served from 1994 to 2001. She has long been a critic of Trump, tweeting earlier this month: "This is NOT my Republican party."
She added that Trump has done enough to warrant an impeachment inquiry, with several of her tweets ending with that or a similar hashtag, and that if the allegations are true he "has to go."

Trump Vetoes Bill to End National Emergency at Border

Texto completo: The move will return the border resolution to Congress, which is unlikely to garner the votes needed to override the veto.
WASHINGTON -- President Trump on Tuesday issued his second veto against legislation seeking to end his national emergency at the southwestern border, rejecting bipartisan objections to his efforts to obtain funds for a border wall.
His move, announced late Tuesday night, was expected and will return the resolution to Congress. It is unlikely to garner the two-thirds majority needed there to override the veto.
The announcement comes exactly seven months after Mr. Trump issued the first veto of his presidency against a nearly identical resolution that would have terminated the national emergency. He declared the emergency earlier this year after Congress declined to designate money for his border wall; he has sought to allocate funds from other government agencies to the southwestern border.
Mr. Trump, announcing the veto, noted that he had vetoed the earlier measure "because it was a dangerous resolution that would undermine United States sovereignty and threaten the lives and safety of countless Americans."
He added, "It is similarly my duty, in order to protect the safety and security of our nation, to return S.J. Res. 54 to the Senate without my approval."
Lawmakers can force votes on the issue every six months. Democrats have seized upon the tactic as a way to corner vulnerable Republicans into defending either the president's national security policies or Congress's constitutional responsibility to dictate government spending.
But Mr. Trump, in his veto message, argued that the national emergency had "empowered my administration's governmentwide strategy to counter large-scale unlawful migration" and said that a national emergency was still warranted at the border.
Eleven Republicans in each chamber joined Democrats last month in rejecting the national emergency declaration, short of a veto-proof majority. When Senate Democrats forced the vote in September, the debate was heightened by details of what specific military projects the Pentagon would delay in order to allocate $ 3.6 billion to the border wall.
The veto comes as lawmakers are struggling to resolve a debate over funding both Mr. Trump's border wall and other elements of his hard-line immigration policy before the government runs out of money on Nov. 21.

Housing, human dignity and a ‘state of emergency’

Texto completo: The push by Los Angeles officials to get Governor Newsom to declare a State of Emergency over homelessness is like a warning light flashing.
It draws our attention to a massive problem that people closed their eyes to for too long. But like any flashing light, the “State of Emergency” idea only helps us see part of the problem but not the whole—and ultimately it would deepen the quagmire and probably result in bigger and worse emergencies later.
Where the idea points in the right direction is easy to see: proponents of the State of Emergency rightly say it would streamline red tape on construction, reduce and shorten building approval processes, and block the frivolous use of environmental review to delay housing construction. That’s needed.
But let’s face it, here’s what’s really happening: First California passes laws that generate the crisis, then we declare a state of emergency to bypass those laws. But as a State of Emergency exemption, it’s an ad-hoc fix. It doesn’t address the systemic problem with the laws it sidesteps, and in fact it politicizes the whole situation further by allowing sensible construction only if political support for a formal Emergency can be cultivated.
But it gets worse. Some of the people who favor a State of Emergency also favor a so-called “legal right to shelter” which would create a basis to sue governments if they don’t directly provide housing to the poorest citizens. This would permanently turn the homeless into wards of the state and enrich those who would litigate on their behalf.
The homeless are indeed “victims of the system,” but not the system that most people think of. They are not victims of a free market in housing, because California has built a regulatory system that killed a free market in housing at all but the top price levels. Middle-income Californians are squeezed by this, too, but the most vulnerable Californians are pushed out on to the streets. The bottom rungs of the housing market ladder—where economically marginal citizens could once afford a place to live—have effectively been removed by bad public policy.
Let me give examples from a study soon to be published by the Independent Institute.
Los Angeles currently bans any housing other than detached single-family homes on about 75 percent of its residential land. Whereas in 1960 Los Angeles was zoned for up to 10 million people, by 1990 the city “had downzoned to a capacity of about 3.9 million, a number that is only slightly higher today,” according to the New York Times.
Then there are so-called “prevailing wage” (read: union scale) laws. Prevailing-wage mandates increased average California construction costs for affordable housing projects by between 10 percent and 25 percent, according to a May 2017 report from the California Center for Jobs and the Economy. In areas such as Los Angeles, PLAs could hike market-rate housing prices by as much as 46 percent. Then there are the endless faux-environmental lawsuits against residential construction, which are invited and inadvertently enabled by the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). And the list of anti-housing obstacles goes on.
What the homeless really need is a residential construction market that operates by normal rules that induce entrepreneurs to build housing all the way up and down the price spectrum—not just at the top where they can afford to overcome the regulatory and NIMBY hurdles. Don’t give the homeless a “right to shelter” by government; instead, give property owners a “right to build residential housing” on land they own. No, this would not eliminate restrictions on residential building, but it would raise a much higher bar by which to justify them. A ballot initiative amending the California Constitution would be the way to achieve this potent reform.
Less dramatic reforms would make a difference, too.
Allow builders to give homeowners’ associations incentives to accept new construction, so as to counterbalance the disincentives that lead to NIMBYism. Stop suppressing housing through rent controls and so-called “affordable housing” mandates; these are the functional equivalent of taxes on housing development. What you tax you get less of. Another obvious change would be to put an end to the favoritism shown to unions through “prevailing wage” rules that swell construction costs. And why not abolish or at least vastly modify CEQA?
The people who care the most about the homeless are those who want to reintroduce a real housing market—and incentivize nongovernmental programs that treat people like people rather than like dependent clients.
How can we expect the homeless to rebuild their lives when government programs warehouse them like surplus merchandise, and when we kick the bottom rungs out of the housing market ladder so that even if they start getting themselves together, they can’t find a room or apartment they can afford to rent?

Texto completo: The Democratic presidential debate being held tonight — Tuesday, Oct. 15, 2019 — in a suburb near Ohio’s capital will bring back a candidate who has been absent from the stage for a while and introduce one who has never before been seen on the party’s debate lineup.
Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard failed to qualify for the September debate but will be back on stage tonight after meeting the Democratic National Committee’s qualifications:
* Earning at least 2% support in four DNC-approved polls
* Receiving contributions from at least 130,000 individual donors
* Of those donors, at least 400 each must come from 20 different states
Also making that cut will be first-time presidential debater Tom Steyer of California. The billionaire hedge fund founder is known for his large contributions to environmental causes and political campaigns.
Along with those two will be the 10 candidates you would expect to see on the stage at Otterbein University in Westerville, Ohio, listed alphabetically:
* Former Vice President Joe Biden
* New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker
* South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg
* Former HUD Secretary Julián Castro
* California Sen. Kamala Harris
* Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar
* Former Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke
* Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders
* Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren
* Businessman Andrew Yang
Tonight’s debate from 5 to 8 p.m. Pacific time is sponsored by the New York Times and CNN and will be carried on the cable network. The moderators are CNN anchors Erin Burnett and Anderson Cooper, and New York Times editor Marc Lacey.
There are many streaming options, and the debate will air on broadcast radio.

Trump's Ukraine maneuvering seems to have triggered John Bolton's exit

Texto completo: Former national security adviser John Bolton exited the White House in September after a series of fundamental disputes with President Trump over foreign policy challenges in hotbed regions such as Iran, North Korea, and Afghanistan. But it seems Bolton was also concerned about another region: Ukraine.

In fact, Bolton was so alarmed by the nature of Trump’s phone call with Ukraine President Volodomyr Zelensky that he told an aide to alert White House lawyers about the potential conflict of interest, according to the New York Times.

The aide — Fiona Hill, who was also the White House’s top Russia adviser — testified in a closed-door hearing for nearly 10 hours on Capitol Hill yesterday. According to reports, she explained how Trump’s Ukraine actions led to tense disputes among national security advisers, State Department, and White House officials alike.

Bolton’s main concern? Rudy Giuliani.

“Giuliani’s a hand grenade who’s going to blow everybody up,” Hill quoted Bolton saying.

Giuliani has been at the center of the Ukraine controversy since its beginning. During his conversation with Zelensky, Trump urged the Ukrainian president to speak to his personal lawyer about potential dirt on Joe Biden. Shortly after, Giuliani met with a series of Ukrainian officials despite the fact that he did not have the security clearance or authorization to serve as a liaison between the United States and Ukraine.

Giuliani set himself up as a back channel, circumventing the White House’s national security protocol to run his own negotiations alongside Gordon Sondland, Trump’s ambassador to the European Union, and Mick Mulvaney, Trump’s acting chief of staff, Hill said during her testimony. Giuliani’s actions alarmed State Department officials, who felt like they would be forced to clean up Giuliani’s mess, she said.

Bolton knew Giuliani and Sondland’s efforts were going to blow up in Trump’s face because he instructed Hill to go to the White House lawyers and absolve herself from the situation. “I am not part of whatever drug deal Sondland and Mulvaney are cooking up,” Bolton instructed Hill to tell the lawyers, according to the Times.

Say what you will about Bolton, but he saw things clearly. He knew Giuliani would be a national security risk, and he understood that Trump’s dealings with Ukraine were questionable at best and illegal at worst. From what we know of Bolton and Trump’s combative relationship, it’s likely Bolton took his concerns directly to the president.

It seems the Ukraine controversy was one of the final strikes that led Bolton to resign (though Trump claims he fired Bolton). Trump’s phone call with Zelensky took place in July, Giuliani’s shadow maneuvering continued through August, and Bolton’s exit occurred in September. The calendar lines up, as do Bolton’s frustrations.

Bolton’s hawkish foreign policy is worth criticizing. But on this, he was right. If only Trump had listened.

Commentary: Are school debate competitions bad for our political discourse?

Texto completo: What do conservative political figures like Ted Cruz, Steve Bannon, Karl Rove and Richard Nixon have in common with liberal politicians like Elizabeth Warren, Andrew Yang, Kamala Harris and Bill Clinton? They all honed their skills of rhetoric, reasoning and persuasion on school debate teams.
That’s no surprise. Excelling in school debate opens many academic and professional doors, conferring prestige and signaling exceptional verbal and logical aptitude. Some of those skills will no doubt be on display at the Democratic presidential primary debate on Tuesday.
But while school debate can be good for aspiring politicians, it may not be good for our politics. In particular, it may contribute to the closed-minded, partisan and self-interested nature of so much of today’s public and political dialogue.
Why? Because school debate ultimately strengthens and rewards biased reasoning.
In traditional debate competitions, teams are assigned at random to argue one or the other side of an issue. Each round, one team is assigned the affirmative view — say, “Recreational drug use should be legalized” — and the other team, the negative. That means teams start with a conclusion, whether they endorse it or not, and work backward from there, marshaling the best arguments they can devise to make that conclusion come out on top.
The goal is not to determine the most reasonable or fair-minded approach to an issue, but to defend a given claim at all costs. This is an exercise not in deliberation but in reasoning with an agenda.
This also happens to be the kind of argumentation we find so corrosive in today’s politics. Politicians and pundits have their favored view and then emphasize the information that fortifies it. Evidence that threatens their position is rationalized away. Problems for the opposing view are hunted for and magnified.
This criticism is not new. The philosopher and logician Willard Van Orman Quine argued that school debate elevates “the goal of persuasion above the goal of truth” and that the strength of a good debater “lies not in intellectual curiosity nor in amenability to rational persuasion by others, but in his skill in defending a preconception come what may.”
School debate reinforces this mode of reasoning. By celebrating those who are most adept at it, schools hold it up as a model form of thinking.
Don’t get us wrong. This style of reasoning can be useful. Legal advocacy, for instance, often requires it. And in preparing to argue both sides of a question, as you do in school debate, you can gain valuable perspective on the topic at hand. You develop the ability to approach a topic from different angles. You might even learn the critical lesson that there is often more to an opposing view than it may initially seem.
Nevertheless, traditional school debate discourages the kind of listening and reasoning that is critical to a healthy democracy. Student debaters don’t deliberate about what they themselves believe, or should believe. They don’t cultivate the disposition to listen to others with the real possibility of changing their minds. On the contrary, they practice listening with eagle ears for opposing points to pounce on. Rather than increasing their comfort with being wrong, they can deepen an attitude of certainty.
School debate doesn’t have to be this way, though. In fact, many schools around the country are gravitating to alternative forms of debate that set the goals of truth and understanding over the goal of persuasion. A good example is the Ethics Bowl.
In the Ethics Bowl, created at the intercollegiate level in 1993 and the high school level around 2012, a team is assigned a question — not a statement or conclusion, as in traditional debate — on a contentious topic, such as “When is the use of military drones morally permissible?” The team then presents and defends whatever conclusion its deliberation has led to. An opposing team and a panel of judges pose questions and raise potential problems, to which the first team responds.
Sometimes the two teams find themselves largely in agreement. When they do, the winner is the team that does the better job of articulating its reasoning, listening and responding to questions, and advancing the collective understanding of the issue at hand.
But disagreement is frequent in the Ethics Bowl, and the discussions are spirited. That’s a good thing. After all, spirited dissent and disagreement are hallmarks of a healthy democracy. Disagreement among citizens is inevitable — about politics, morality, education, religion, nearly everything. What’s crucial is how we disagree, and how we converse and deliberate with those with whom we disagree.
It is precisely when we disagree that it is most critical for our thinking to be clear and our dialogue to be charitable and scrupulous. But disagreement is also when we’re most likely to get irritated, defensive and impatient. The more at stake in the conversation, the more difficult it is to remain poised, thoughtful, open to being wrong and ready to acknowledge fair points from the other side.
Disagreeing constructively is a skill — one of the most difficult and important there is. In encouraging students to practice this skill, the Ethics Bowl fosters what may be the most important intellectual virtue of all: openness to changing your mind.
There is something of a stigma in our culture about changing your mind, especially in politics. If you do, you are often seen as weak or branded a “flip-flopper.” The problem is, holding steadfast to a belief in the face of sound objections or contrary evidence stops conversation. It’s dogmatic and stubborn. Having the courage to admit when you might be wrong, on the other hand, helps move conversations toward meaningful resolutions.
At this seemingly broken political moment, our country’s future may depend on our politicians becoming more comfortable doing that.

Housing, human dignity and a ‘state of emergency’

Texto completo: The push by Los Angeles officials to get Governor Newsom to declare a State of Emergency over homelessness is like a warning light flashing.
It draws our attention to a massive problem that people closed their eyes to for too long. But like any flashing light, the “State of Emergency” idea only helps us see part of the problem but not the whole—and ultimately it would deepen the quagmire and probably result in bigger and worse emergencies later.
Where the idea points in the right direction is easy to see: proponents of the State of Emergency rightly say it would streamline red tape on construction, reduce and shorten building approval processes, and block the frivolous use of environmental review to delay housing construction. That’s needed.
But let’s face it, here’s what’s really happening: First California passes laws that generate the crisis, then we declare a state of emergency to bypass those laws. But as a State of Emergency exemption, it’s an ad-hoc fix. It doesn’t address the systemic problem with the laws it sidesteps, and in fact it politicizes the whole situation further by allowing sensible construction only if political support for a formal Emergency can be cultivated.
But it gets worse. Some of the people who favor a State of Emergency also favor a so-called “legal right to shelter” which would create a basis to sue governments if they don’t directly provide housing to the poorest citizens. This would permanently turn the homeless into wards of the state and enrich those who would litigate on their behalf.
The homeless are indeed “victims of the system,” but not the system that most people think of. They are not victims of a free market in housing, because California has built a regulatory system that killed a free market in housing at all but the top price levels. Middle-income Californians are squeezed by this, too, but the most vulnerable Californians are pushed out on to the streets. The bottom rungs of the housing market ladder—where economically marginal citizens could once afford a place to live—have effectively been removed by bad public policy.
Let me give examples from a study soon to be published by the Independent Institute.
Los Angeles currently bans any housing other than detached single-family homes on about 75 percent of its residential land. Whereas in 1960 Los Angeles was zoned for up to 10 million people, by 1990 the city “had downzoned to a capacity of about 3.9 million, a number that is only slightly higher today,” according to the New York Times.
Then there are so-called “prevailing wage” (read: union scale) laws. Prevailing-wage mandates increased average California construction costs for affordable housing projects by between 10 percent and 25 percent, according to a May 2017 report from the California Center for Jobs and the Economy. In areas such as Los Angeles, PLAs could hike market-rate housing prices by as much as 46 percent. Then there are the endless faux-environmental lawsuits against residential construction, which are invited and inadvertently enabled by the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). And the list of anti-housing obstacles goes on.
What the homeless really need is a residential construction market that operates by normal rules that induce entrepreneurs to build housing all the way up and down the price spectrum—not just at the top where they can afford to overcome the regulatory and NIMBY hurdles. Don’t give the homeless a “right to shelter” by government; instead, give property owners a “right to build residential housing” on land they own. No, this would not eliminate restrictions on residential building, but it would raise a much higher bar by which to justify them. A ballot initiative amending the California Constitution would be the way to achieve this potent reform.
Less dramatic reforms would make a difference, too.
Allow builders to give homeowners’ associations incentives to accept new construction, so as to counterbalance the disincentives that lead to NIMBYism. Stop suppressing housing through rent controls and so-called “affordable housing” mandates; these are the functional equivalent of taxes on housing development. What you tax you get less of. Another obvious change would be to put an end to the favoritism shown to unions through “prevailing wage” rules that swell construction costs. And why not abolish or at least vastly modify CEQA?
The people who care the most about the homeless are those who want to reintroduce a real housing market—and incentivize nongovernmental programs that treat people like people rather than like dependent clients.
How can we expect the homeless to rebuild their lives when government programs warehouse them like surplus merchandise, and when we kick the bottom rungs out of the housing market ladder so that even if they start getting themselves together, they can’t find a room or apartment they can afford to rent?

Scorecard: Grading the debate performance of the Democratic candidates

Texto completo: It was the biggest presidential debate ever. All eyes weren't on the 12 Democratic White House hopefuls on the Ohio stage, but rather focused on the front runners.
Senator Elizabeth Warren came into Tuesday's CNN/New York Times event leading in national and early state polls consistently for the first time.
Former vice president Joe Biden was under pressure from President Trump over his son Hunter's business dealings in China and Ukraine.
And Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont was making one of his first campaign appearances since suffering a heart attack two weeks ago.
Once the cameras turned on and the three hour debate began, it was fiery, especially when it came to health care and foreign policy.
These grades are based on how each candidate did, including the substance and resonance of their responses, as well as whether they accomplished what they needed in the context of their campaigns. For example, success for Warren was different than success for Representative Tulsi Gabbard, who is among the candidates struggling to make the cut-off for next month's debate.
Here's the scorecard for Tuesday:
Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind.
Grade: A
This was the single best moment of Buttigieg's campaign for president. He did well on guns, on impeachment, and particularly on Syria.
Buttigieg had been making the argument that he is the centrist where moderate Democrats can go if Biden fails. That came through Tuesday night.
In this debate, he added a new layer to his national brand: outsider. He kept referring to how he was from “the industrial Midwest" and how Washington had not solved the problems facing a wide swath of the United States.
Buttigieg won the debate.
Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts
Grade: B+
This was a great debate for Warren, the new frontrunner. Most of the other candidates on the stage tried to call her out, and engage her in a back-and-forth. She deftly handled just about all of them.
It seemed like no one came after Biden. Think about that.
But not all her answers were great, and she was too clever by half trying to avoid answering how she would pay for Medicare for All.
Still, it was a big moment for Warren and her campaign.
Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota
Grade: B+
Klobuchar had the second best performance of the evening. Her campaign is very close to the end, and she came out fighting.
She gave strong answers that highlighted why she is running and why she is unique — the voice of the practical person from, as she said, “flyover country." And Klobuchar was able, from the very beginning, to get other candidates to engage with her. She had a good performance, she did exactly what she needed to do in the context of the campaign. Will it be good enough to get her into the next debate? Possibly.
Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont
Grade: B
Let's get the health stuff out of the way: Two weeks after a heart attack, he looked and sounded like the same Bernie Sanders as before. Sanders didn't do a lot to expand support, but in the context of the campaign, it was an important night. Over the course of a very intense three-hour debate, he did hold his own
He can score points at the next debate.
Entrepreneur Andrew Yang
Grade: B
This was Yang's best debate all year. He smartly pivoted from the opening question about impeachment to make his campaign pitch about the state of the economy and push for a universal basic income.
Indeed, he offered solid answers all night, except for a moment where he equated Russian interference in the 2016 American elections with past actions from the United States government, hinting at covert CIA activity during the Cold War. This answer was quickly shot down by Klobuchar, who claimed there was no equating Putin to the United States.
There are only three candidates who could go up in the polls after this debate: Buttigieg, Klobuchar and Yang.
Former vice president Joe Biden
Grade: C+
Biden is slipping in polls, slipping in fund-raising, and on the ropes when it comes to the questions about him and his son that the impeachment process has brought about. On paper, Biden is a co-frontrunner with Warren. On this debate stage, Biden was often forgotten.
He did little to help his cause or make the case he is the inevitable nominee.
One famous Biden-ism is that in politics you are either on the way up or the way down. With this debate, Biden is still on the way down.
Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey
Grade: C-
Booker's cheesy refrain that he is worried “about how we are talking about each other" in, you know, a debate — a debate! — seemed pointless. Then again, in October 2019, what is the point of Booker's candidacy? Why him over anyone else in the field? What is driving his campaign? He has openly talked about the prospect of dropping out. He didn't help himself with this performance.
Senator Kamala Harris of California
Grade: D+
It is hard to express how bad this debate was for Harris. In four months, she went from top-tier candidate to now hanging out with third- or fourth-tier. For a big chunk of the debate, she was just totally forgotten.
Former representative Beto O'Rourke
Grade: D
Give O'Rourke credit: he knows he is on the ropes. After entering the presidential race “born to do this" and jumping on tables, giving speeches live on cable news, O'Rourke now knows he has to throw proverbial spaghetti against the wall and hope against hope that something sticks. He tried to inject himself into the conversation as much as possible. But he lost pretty much every skirmish, particularly against Buttigieg on guns.
Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii
Grade: D
On one level, when there are a dozen candidates the stage, each candidate needs to figure out how they, in particular, can come across as unique. Gabbard did do that, particularly on foreign policy. She stood alone calling for the United States to end a bipartisan policy seeking the removal of Bashar al-Assad, the Syrian leader who has gassed to death his own people, including children.
On all other policy topics, she didn't really stand out. And given that she hasn't qualified for the next debate, she didn't really help herself.
Businessman Tom Steyer
Grade: D
It must be a wild experience to have never been in a single televised campaign debate, even for Congress, and then jump in to a presidential debate. It was clear that he smartly tried to pick his moments. Still, he couldn't define who he was or what his campaign was about — except for some broad statement about corporate corruption that doesn't stand out from the rest of the field.
Despite his meh performance, Steyer has qualified for the next debate by using his wallet on ads. (He clearly isn't spending his fortune on ties.)
Former housing and urban development secretary Julian Castro
Grade: D
Quick: Can you remember a single thing that Castro said tonight? No? That's probably why this will be his last debate as a 2020 Democratic presidential campaign. Castro didn't get a worse grade because he didn't totally disqualify his political future.
***
The next debate in November is expected to have fewer candidates on the stage, and possibly fewer candidates running altogether. There are currently 19 candidates running. Just eight have qualified for the next debate, which will be held in Georgia.

Texto completo: Para John Bolton , el exasesor de seguridad nacional, Rudy Giuliani , abogado personal de presidente Donald Trump era como una “granada en la mano” y alertó sobre ello a los abogados de la Casa Blanca.
Según un reporte de The New York Times, el exasesor –despedido por el presidente Trump– estaba preocupado por los esfuerzos del exalcalde de Nueva York para presionar a Ucrania en busca de ayuda política.
Una serie de informes indican que Fiona Hill , la exasesora principal de la administración de Trump sobre Rusia, recibió instrucciones de notificar al abogado principal del Consejo de Seguridad Nacional que Giuliani estaba trabajando en un esfuerzo de política exterior en la sombra.
Hill detalló las preocupaciones internas sobre los esfuerzos de Giuliani durante 10 horas de testimonio a puerta cerrada como parte de la investigación de juicio político de los demócratas de la Cámara de Representantes.
La experta planteó las preocupaciones al Consejo de Seguridad Nacional el 10 de julio luego de una pelea entre Bolton y Gordon Sondland , embajador de Trump en la Unión Europea, debido a que el segundo estaba trabajando con Giuliani para presionar al mandatario ucraniano a investigar a uno de los principales rivales políticos del presidente, al exvicepresidente Joe Biden y su hijo Hunter Biden .
“Giuliani es una granada de mano que hará explotar a todos” , dijo Bolton durante una conversación relacionada con las preocupaciones sobre el trabajo del abogado y amigo del presidente Trump.
En un comunicado enviado a Fox News, el abogado dijo que estaba “decepcionado” sobre Bolton.
“Estoy decepcionado con John” , dijo Giuliani. “No estoy seguro de que se dé cuenta de que recibí toda esta evidencia como parte de mi representación del presidente”.

Texto completo: Twelve Democratic 2020 candidates will crowd the stage in Westerville, Ohio, on Tuesday for the biggest presidential debate of the election cycle.
The debate is expected to mark the return to the campaign trail for Sen. Bernie Sanders, who suffered a heart attack this month and has limited his once-grueling campaign travel after falling ill. The moment offers the 78-year-old senator from Vermont a chance to try to assuage voter concerns about his health.
Meanwhile, Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, comes to Ohio amid a string of polls that shows her support surging with likely Democratic primary voters. With her exalted status, Warren is likely to take more fire from her fellow Democratic rivals.
But the biggest storyline of the Ohio debate could revolve around how the candidates talk about the fast-moving, 3-week-old impeachment inquiry of President Donald Trump.
Here are five ways the inquiry will loom large over the debate.
1) Can Joe Biden effectively punch back against Trump?
The Trump impeachment inquiry was put in motion after a member of the intelligence community filed a whistleblower's complaint raising concerns that the president was pressuring Ukraine's president to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter over the younger Biden's business dealings in the Eastern European country.
Biden has bristled at Trump's attacks. Trump has pushed the unsubstantiated allegation that the reason Biden, while he was vice president, pushed the Ukrainian government to fire its top prosecutor was to thwart an investigation of Burisma Holdings and to benefit Hunter Biden, who served on Burisma's board. No public evidence has surfaced to support that claim.
Several recent national polls show that a plurality, and in some cases a majority, of Americans support the launch of an impeachment inquiry of Trump. A Quinnipiac University poll published this month found that by a 48% to 42% margin Americans think that "asking a foreign leader to investigate a political rival" is, by itself, a sufficient reason to remove a president from office.
Impeachment polls: Nearly 3 weeks into the Trump impeachment inquiry, polls show a shift in public opinion
Violent anti-media video: Fake video of Trump shooting media and political opponents shown at conference: New York Times
USA TODAY/Ipsos poll: Perilous times for Trump: By 45%-38%, Americans support impeaching him over Ukraine allegations, poll finds
But the situation seems to also have hampered Biden.
By a 42% to 21% margin, Americans say there are valid reasons to look at the behavior of Joe and Hunter Biden in Ukraine, according to a USA TODAY/Ipsos Poll published this month.
And more Democrats say they are somewhat satisfied (47%) than very satisfied (29%) with how Biden has responded to Trump's assertions about him and Ukraine, according to CBS News poll published Sunday. Eighteen percent of Democratic respondents said they were somewhat dissatisfied and 6% said they were very dissatisfied with Biden's response.
"No one has asserted that my son did a single thing wrong," Biden grumbled to reporters following a labor forum in Iowa Sunday. "No one has asserted that I did anything wrong except the lying president. "
Biden's campaign aides have complained that too much media attention has been given to the Trump allegations.
The debate offers the former vice president a prime opportunity to make his case to directly to voters about why they shouldn't pay attention to the noise.
2) Will Democratic rivals continue to go easy on Hunter Biden's business dealings?
It wouldn't be surprising if the CNN and New York Times moderators quiz candidates on whether the younger Biden's business in Ukraine, as well as China, amounted to a conflict of interest for the vice president. Biden played a key role in shaping the Obama administration's policies in those two countries.
Ahead of the debate, Biden has sought to blunt the issue.
The former vice president said Sunday if he is elected president, no one in his family will hold a job or have a business relationship with a foreign corporation or foreign government. He also jabbed at Trump for appointing his daughter, Ivanka, and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, to senior adviser positions.
"No one in my family will have an office in the White House, will sit in on meetings as if they are a cabinet member, will, in fact, have any business relationship with anyone that relates to a foreign corporation or a foreign country," Biden said. "Period. Period. End of story. "
Biden vows no conflicts of interest: Joe Biden: 'No one in my family will have an office in the White House' or be 'a cabinet member' if I'm president
Hunter Biden, through a statement from his attorney, on Sunday also said that he would step down from his seat on the board of a private equity firm in China by the end of this month and vowed not to serve on any boards of foreign companies if his father's elected.
He acknowledged in an interview with ABC News that aired Tuesday that he probably wouldn't have been picked to serve on Burisma's board if his last name wasn't Biden, but insisted he did nothing improper.
"I joined a board, I served honorably. . . I focused on corporate governance," Hunter Biden said. "I didn't have any discussions with my father before or after I joined the board as it related to it, other than that brief exchange that we had. "
The VP's son: Hunter Biden will resign from board of Chinese firm, says he won't serve on foreign boards if Joe Biden elected president
Prior to Biden's comments, Sens. Cory Booker and Amy Klobuchar as well as former Rep. Beto O’Rourke all said they wouldn't allow their family members to sit on boards of foreign companies, but they have only allowed the gentlest of criticism of the Bidens.
“I just do not think that children of presidents, of vice presidents during an administration should be out there doing that,” Booker offered in a recent CNN interview.
Thus far in the primary season, attacks on Biden have backfired or provided limited payoff for those who have attempted taking him on directly.
But more than half the field is hovering in the low-single digit percentages in early voting and national polls. And with the DNC toughening the polling and donor thresholds to make November debate, a candidate at the back of the pack might see raising concerns about Hunter Biden as a risk worth taking.

3) It's about more than impeachment
Candidates will try to demonstrate that they can walk and chew gum at the same time.
Expect to hear candidates talk about the importance of Congress doing its oversight work and moving forward with the impeachment proceeding. But at the same time, they’ll all offer some version of their similar campaign platitude: This election is about more than ousting Trump.
Shannon Watts, founder of the gun control advocacy group Mom's Demand Action, said it's frustrating that impeachment is saturating national media attention.
But she said she believed the Democratic candidates would be mindful of keeping the focus on core issues, including advocating for tightening gun laws, if they hope to improve their standing with female voters.
"For our issue, if you look at polling, it's the No. 1 issue for suburban women regardless of political party," Watts said in an interview.
Since Pelosi opened the impeachment inquiry, Trump has accused his Democratic opponents of using impeachment as a desperate move to try to defeat him.
The polls show a growing support for impeachment among Americans, but the electorate is craving more from its politicians, said Kelly Dietrich, CEO of the National Democratic Training Committee, an organization that trains Democrats on how to run for office and work on campaigns.
"You can't let impeachment take over everything," Dietrich said. "The Democrats challenge in general is to hold Trump and Republicans accountable but to tie it to the bread-and-butter issues that are impacting Americans from health care and clean air to all the things that really effect day-to-day lives. "
4) Tom Steyer, an early impeachment backer, joins the stage
Steyer, the billionaire investor and clean energy advocate, will make his first debate appearance in Westerville.
He didn't jump into the race until July, but he has been pressing lawmakers to begin the process to remove Trump from office since founding the group Need to Impeach in October 2017. He's pumped millions into the project that had the singular goal of removing Trump from office.
In television and digital ads in the early voting states of Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina, Steyer has been trumpeting that he was ahead of the curve among his Democratic rivals in pushing for impeachment.
"When I called for his impeachment two years ago, Washington insiders and every candidate for president said it was too soon," Steyer says in the early voting state ads. "I believed then, as I do now, that doing the right thing was more important than political calculations. "
Steyer to make debate stage debut: Tom Steyer has been pushing impeachment for years. Now it's center stage for his first debate
5) Candidates aware of perils of impeachment inquiry
An already divided nation is in danger of more partisanship as the impeachment inquiry moves along.
The debate marks another opportunity for the Democratic hopefuls to attest to why they can reunite a country that Trump has suggested would tumble into “civil war” if he’s removed from office.
With Republicans in control of the Senate, the odds are long that the upper chamber, at least at this point, would convict Trump should the House vote to impeach him.
Even as polling shows growing American support for the impeachment process, the vast majority, 58% to 37%, think that Trump's fate should be left to the voters when they head to the polls in less than 13 months, according to an NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll published last week.
Candidates face a balancing act in their messaging on the issue.
"Look, this is not something you can do by poll," South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg told CNN. "This is a constitutional process to protect the integrity of the presidency itself. It's not just about holding Donald Trump accountable for abuses of power – it's about making sure that a future president, 10 years or a hundred years from now, looks back at this moment and draws the lesson that nobody is above the law. And at a moment like that, public opinion is just going to have to follow the lead of the Constitution, instead of the other way around. "

5 things to watch for in next debate

Texto completo: Tuesday night's Democratic debate will feature the largest group of presidential candidates in one debate in American history.
A dozen candidates will be spread out on the same stage in Ohio, fighting for a few sentences without interruption.
Yes, it's going to be a circus.
But for good reason. For many on the stage, it could be their last high-profile television appearance.
Meanwhile, there are seven other Democrats running for their party's nod who didn't even make the cut.
If you tune in to the CNN/New York Times debate, here are five dynamics to watch:
So. Many. Candidates.
No one is quite sure how this debate will work given the sheer number of human beings on the stage. CNN and the Times had the option of splitting up the candidates over two nights but demurred.
Still, there probably won't be that much of a noticeable difference for the viewers at home. The front-runners — Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, and former vice president Joe Biden — will probably get a disproportionate amount of the time. The others will try to catch a moderator's eye, hoping to get in a rebuttal or attack.
Like in the previous debates this year, there probably won't be much back and forth, with just a few substantial exchanges over the course of a few hours. Structurally, this will be more of a showcase of some of the candidates running. But keeping to the time cues will be something that will probably be more closely watched than in the past.
Warren, the front-runner
Last week, Warren officially became the front-runner in polling nationally and in the early presidential primary states, taking the top spot from Biden in the Real Clear Politics polling average. With the new status comes a new debate dynamic we haven't seen before: attacks aimed at Warren.
We have seen some previews over the past week of what that might look like. South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg suggested she was more concerned with fighting and he was more concerned with outcomes.
Biden didn't mention Warren by name but told voters, “We are not electing a planner." He was suggesting that Warren, she of many policy plans, does not have the same record of accomplishment.
So far, Warren has had the most consistently good debate performances, but this time, she'll face a new challenge and a new dynamic.
Can Harris turn it around?
As Warren has gone up in the polls, Senator Kamala Harris of California has sunk. A national Quinnipiac poll put her at 3 percent, tied with entrepreneur Andrew Yang. While she has qualified for the November debate, she is almost out of contention for a lot of voters and donors.
To be sure, Harris knows this is a big moment for her campaign. She shook up her campaign staff, and she has vowed to essentially move her White House bid to Iowa. Harris had her best moment of the campaign during the first debate this summer. She has not had the magic since.
Tom Steyer's first debate
California billionaire Tom Steyer will make his first debate appearance Tuesday. He was a late entry into the contest and has pledged to spend $100 million — that's $100,000,000! — on the race. So far, that fortune has bought television ads that helped him get to the necessary polling threshold. It's less clear what his pitch to voters will be. He was once singularly focused on the environment before he was singularly focused on impeachment. How will he introduce himself to voters this time?
Others' last debate
Four of the candidates on the stage have not qualified for November's debate, which has higher donor and polling thresholds: former secretary of housing and urban development Julian Castro, former US representative Beto O'Rourke, Senator Amy Klobuchar, and Representative Tulsi Gabbard. They will have every incentive to craft the debate performance of their lives, hoping that poll numbers improve before the end-of-the-month cut-off.

Texto completo: Despite Ms. Warren's upward momentum in polls and fund-raising, she lacks the support of a single governor, big-city mayor or fellow senator outside Massachusetts.
WASHINGTON -- Senator Elizabeth Warren has built her following in part by taking pictures with thousands of voters deep into evening after campaign events, but her dinner audience here one night last month was far smaller. And Ms. Warren's guests were more interested in hearing, and politely challenging, her campaign pitch than eagerly capturing the moment for posterity on their iPhones.
Addressing a few dozen members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus at a Chinese restaurant a few blocks from the Capitol, she laid out her case for why she could unify Democrats, emphasized that she was not hostile to properly run businesses and made a soft sell to the lawmakers to support her presidential bid.
"She said, 'Nobody could do this alone, I will need your help,"' recalled Representative Chellie Pingree of Maine, who attended the gathering and said Ms. Warren "was great."
But just under a month since the family-style meal, the Massachusetts senator has the same small number of endorsements from congressional colleagues beyond her home state as she did beforehand: three.
Ms. Warren is expected to reveal additional support from Democratic officials this week in conjunction with Tuesday's CNN/New York Times debate and the release of her smashing third-quarter financial disclosure. Yet her growing crowd sizes, soaring fund-raising and surge to the top of a number of national and early-state polls only shine a brighter light on one of the most revealing elements of this primary: the widening gap between the preferences of many Democratic voters and the lawmakers who represent them.
Ms. Warren is now a clear front-runner in the race for her party's nomination, yet just under four months before the leadoff Iowa caucuses she lacks the support of a single governor, big-city mayor or fellow senator outside Massachusetts.
She does have the backing of the Working Families Party, an influential liberal group, and yet she also has fewer total endorsements from state legislators in Iowa and New Hampshire than Senator Cory Booker, who registers in the lower single-digits of surveys and last month had to beseech donors to give him enough money to sustain his stagnant campaign.
The apparent lag between Democratic activists and Democratic elected officials, which comes nearly four years after President Trump's stunning outsider's capture of the Republican nomination and Senator Bernie Sanders' surprisingly potent candidacy in the Democratic primaries, has done little to slow Ms. Warren's momentum.
Yet the reluctance of Democratic lawmakers to embrace Ms. Warren's campaign this deep into the year, after she has plainly emerged as a leading candidate, illustrates both the lingering reservations party elites have about her general election prospects and her unique positioning in this race.
"Racing to the left is not really speaking to the needs of people in the heartland," said Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot, who expressed alarm about scrapping private health insurance, urged the candidates to focus on "pocketbook issues" and, when asked if Ms. Warren could reclaim the Midwestern states Mr. Trump captured in 2016, paused before saying: "I'm not sure."
Ms. Warren is politically neither fish nor fowl.
She is not an anti-establishment insurgent in the style of Mr. Sanders, who were he in the position Ms. Warren is now would almost certainly have inspired a Stop Bernie campaign funded by a petrified donor class. But with her refusal to raise money among rich contributors, her unabashed populism and her pre-Senate roots in academia, she is hardly a Clinton-style creature of the Democratic political class.
As a result, many party officials are neither rushing to oppose her nor racing to her side, instead staying on the sidelines and doing what politicians often do when they are uncertain of what choice to make: buying time.
"It's easier to wait, you keep your relationships good," said Representative Deb Haaland of New Mexico, one of the few lawmakers who is supporting Ms. Warren, noting that some of her colleagues are loath to offend their friends in the race by choosing a candidate.
Reinforcing this instinct toward caution is the fluid nature of a primary still large enough to feature 12 candidates on the debate stage this week as well as the high stakes of next year's general election.
"You had two candidates last time," said longtime Representative Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut, referring to the Sanders-versus-Hillary Clinton race. "People want to see this unfold."
Thanks to his decades-long relationships and the perception in some quarters that he would be a strong candidate against Mr. Trump, Joseph R. Biden Jr. has picked up the most support from Democratic lawmakers of any of the presidential hopefuls. But his uneven performance as a candidate this year and Mr. Trump's daily barrage of attacks on him have left some party officials wondering just how safe a pick he is in 2020.
"People are concerned about Joe, but they ask: Is Elizabeth electable?" said former Senator Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, explaining the dilemma. "So a lot of people are just keeping their powder dry because they have not decided who can best run against Trump."
Defeating a president who may be the first incumbent to seek re-election after being impeached should be the party's overriding focus, said Gov. J.B. Pritzker of Illinois.
"I genuinely feel our republic is in danger," Mr. Pritzker said.
A longtime donor who often immersed himself in primaries before he entered politics, Mr. Pritzker said he was staying out of this race for the time being in part because he was still stung by 2016, when some of Mr. Sanders's supporters protested what they saw as his mistreatment by Mrs. Clinton and her establishment-aligned supporters.
"When he didn't win people folded their arms and stayed home or they voted for Jill Stein or Gary Johnson," said Mr. Pritzker, alluding to two of the third-party candidates whose votes helped cost Mrs. Clinton the election.
He's not the only Democrat who has the echo of the Sanders-Clinton race still throbbing in their ears nor the only one determined to avoid alienating any of the supporters of this cycle's candidates.
"Many believed the primary was rigged in favor of Hillary Clinton," Representative Darren Soto of Florida said. "There is a feeling among many of us that we need to have a broad and diverse field, plenty of debates and let the primary voters decide on their own."
What few lawmakers will say, at least publicly, is that wading into the race can also come with a cost: they run the risk of angering the eventual nominee if they support a losing candidate and they also invite complaints from their own constituents or donors, who may have a different preference.
What's more, they also have to be mindful of their own political branding and how they align themselves. "Politicians are different from voters," said Donna Brazile, the longtime Democratic strategist and former party chair. "They have to say, 'How does this fit with my agenda, my district?"' In Ms. Warren's case, even one of her biggest boosters, Ms. Haaland, conceded it was easier for her to step out early because of the progressive nature of her district.
"Some folks they're just like, 'I better stay out of it for a while because of my district,"' she said of her House colleagues.
And it's not just lawmakers who are taking a wait-and-see approach. Powerful liberal interest groups, including much of organized labor, are also hanging back, which only prompts the politicians to believe it's safer to remain mum.
"That would make a difference if they came out," Representative Dina Titus of Nevada said of unions. "They're all being coy, too."
Ms. Titus said she planned to get behind a candidate later this year, but her state, the third to vote in next year's primary, illustrates just how many party elites were remaining neutral: Nevada's governor, two senators, three Democratic House members and longtime boss, former Senator Harry Reid, have all refrained from endorsing a candidate.
Representative Jamie Raskin of Maryland said that he had also been "drawn in different directions in this race," noting that he wanted to make a decision that's both "passionate and strategic."
But after having lunch in Washington last month with Ms. Warren and her husband, Bruce Mann, Mr. Raskin said he planned on endorsing the senator.
"If all she had to her name was senator from Massachusetts she would not be an ideal candidate," he said, before citing Ms. Warren's record as a consumer advocate and critic of Washington self-dealing. "As a candidate of public integrity and honesty in government, she has a very powerful story to tell at a time of boundless Republican corruption and lawlessness." What's more, Mr. Raskin said, "She made a very eloquent and personal pitch to me."
As for Ms. Pingree, she said she was "watching the wisdom, the perspective of the public" and was eager "to see who people get excited about."
She will also have a chance to gauge the views of her colleagues. When Congress comes back from its recess this week, Ms. Pingree said she and the other House Democrats who live in her Washington high rise planned on having a debate watch party in the building's common room.
Senator Elizabeth Warren is now a clear front-runner in the race for her party's nomination, yet she lacks the support of a single governor, big-city mayor or fellow senator outside Massachusetts. (PHOTOGRAPH BY Bridget Bennett for The New York Times FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES)

Texto completo: A fake video showing President Trump shooting, stabbing, and killing members of the media and his political enemies was shown at a conference for the president's supporters at one of his resorts.
America Priority, a pro-Trump group, hosted a three day conference at Trump National Doral Miami last week. Donald Trump Jr., former White House spokesperson Sarah Sanders, and Republican Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis were all in attendance at the event, but none acknowledged seeing the video.
The video, which shows the president's reelection campaign logo, featured a series of memes and it included Trump's head superimposed on the body of a person opening fire in the "Chruch of Fake News," the New York Times reported Sunday night. It appeared to be an edited scene from the 2014 film Kingsman: The Secret Service.
America Priority later released a statement claiming that "an unauthorized video was shown in a side room at #AMPFest19. This video was not approved, seen, or sanctioned by the #AMPFest19 organizers." The statement goes on to criticize the Times for "not reporting[ing] on any of the sanctioned events in the article."Tweet“That video was not produced by the campaign, and we do not condone violence,” Tim Murtaugh, a Trump campaign spokesperson, told the Times.
ABC's Jonathan Karl, the president of the White House Correspondents' Association, also denounced the video, calling it "vile and dangerous," and asked the president to do the same.TweetCNN, who was one of the president's targets in the video, also called on the White House and Trump to condemn the video.

Texto completo: La Casa Blanca condenó un video falso en el que el presidente Donald Trump aparece matando a sus críticos.
Las imágenes fueron enseñadas el fin de semana a seguidores del mandatario en un hotel de su propiedad en Doral, en el área de Miami. Allí fue donde el grupo pro Trump American Priority celebró una conferencia de tres días.
El video es una parodia que toma imágenes de la película de 2014 Kingsman: The Secret Service . Imágenes de los rostros de Trump y sus críticos son sobrepuestas sobre las originales para recrear la escena de la masacre en una iglesia.
Entre las personas que Trump mata, ya sea a balazos, con cuchillos o con sus propias manos, están el fallecido John McCain, el candidato a la presidencia Bernie Sanders, la congresista Maxine Walters, y la exsecretaria de Estado Hillary Clinton, quien no podía faltar en algo relacionado con la ira de Trump. También aparecen los logos de CNN, The Washington Post, Politico y NPR , medios vistos como productores de noticias falsas por parte de Trump y sus seguidores.
Stephanie Grisham , secretaria de prensa de la Casa Blanca, dijo que el presidente no ha visto el video pero que condena ese tipo de contenido.
Re: the video played over the weekend: The @POTUS @realDonaldTrump has not yet seen the video, he will see it shortly, but based upon everything he has heard, he strongly condemns this video.
— Stephanie Grisham (@PressSec) October 14, 2019
Asociaciones de periodistas también condenaron el video y recordaron que la retórica violenta del presidente es la causante de este tipo de sucesos. Por si parte, Cindy McCain, viuda del exsenador republicano, dijo que las imágenes “violan todas las normas que la sociedad espera de sus líderes”.
Reports describing a violent video played at a Trump Campaign event in which images of reporters & @JohnMcCain are being slain by Pres Trump violate every norm our society expects from its leaders& the institutions that bare their names. I stand w/ @whca in registering my outrage
— Cindy McCain (@cindymccain) October 14, 2019
El grupo American Priority se desentendió del asunto y dijo al New York Times que el video no fue aprobado por los organizadores de la conferencia.

New sitcom 'Perfect Harmony' leads this week's TV picks

Texto completo: 1) "Perfect Harmony," 8:30 p.m. Thursday, NBC. Four weeks into the season, this continues to be the best new broadcast-network show. It has a sharp wit, occasional sight gags, and great characters. Bradley Whitford is Arthur, a former Princeton prof, now widowed, bitter and conducting a tiny church choir. His singers are determined to win contests; nothing can stop them ... except for the start of the hunting season. Now Arthur joins the hunt. Tempers fray, friends fight; funny moments exist alongside bits of warmth.
2) "Treadstone" debut, 10 p.m. Tuesday, USA. Remember when USA and others had cheery dramas in pretty, blue-sky places? Not any more. The first 11 minutes are as dark and brutal as anything on TV; the rest doesn't get much cheerier. This visits Treadstone, the program that molded a super-assassin then stole his memory and made him think his name was Jason Bourne, Now we leap between Russia, Germany, North Korea, Alaska, London and more. It's nasty and exciting, perplexing and interesting.
3) "CMT Artists of the Year," 8 p.m. Wednesday, CMT, rerunning at 9:30. This week is stuffed with honors for music greats. CMT has performances by four of the honorees — Carrie Underwood, Kane Brown, Thomas Rhett and Dan + Shay; Chrissy Metz of "This Is Us" will sing in a tribute to the fifth winner, Luke Combs. Also performing is Ashley McBride, named "breakout artist of the year." And Sam Hunt and Lady Antebellum perform a tribute to Reba McEntire, now named "artist of a lifetime."
4) "Great Performances: Grammy Salute to Music Legends," 9-11 p.m. Friday, PBS. More honors, more music: Many of the honorees will perform; they include Dionne Warwick, Julio Iglesias, Sam Moore (alone and with Garth Brooks), Valerie Simpson (with Kenny Lattimore) and George Clinton (with everyone). Also, honored will be Johnny Mandel, Lou Adler, Billy Eckstine, Black Sabbath, and Donnie Hathaway. We'll hear Patti Austin, Snoop Dogg, Gregory Porter, Jessie Mueller and more.
5) "Patsy & Loretta," 8-10:03 p.m. Saturday, Lifetime. Here are some more music greats, this time depicted in a TV movie. Patsy Cline was big and brash, willing herself to stardom; Loretta Lynn was (at first) timid, expecting nothing. Still, this film says, they had key things in common — great talent, warm hearts and heavy-drinking husbands.This is a big story, fairly well told, with lots of music done by two talented Broadway stars: Jessie Mueller is fine as Lynn; Megan Hilty is superb as Cline
6) "POV," 10 p.m. today, PBS. Growing up in suburban Chicago, Assia Boundaoui felt she was being watched. So did others in her Muslim neighborhood; in the 1990s, FBI agents even knocked on doors and asked questions. Two decades later, Boundaoui (a journalist) linked with others (including her sister, a lawyer) to learn more. They found that the FBI's "Operation Vulgar Betrayal" produced 33,000 pages of reports ... and, apparently, no convictions. It's an intriguing story that has a personal touch.
7) Presidential debate, 5 p.m. PT Tuesday, CNN. This will reportedly be the most crowded presidential debate stage yet. Tulsi Gabbard and Tom Steyer have been added to the 10 candidates in the previous debate. That includes front-runners Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders, and Elizabeth Warren, plus Cory Booker, Pete Buttigieg, Julian Castro, Kamala Harris, Beto O'Rourke, Amy Klobuchar and Andrew Yang. CNN's Erin Burnett and Anderson Cooper will anchor with the New York Times' Marc Lacey.
8) "Arrow" season-opener, 9 p.m. Tuesday, CW. It's the end of the beginning, sort of: There are 82 series on the five big commercial broadcast networks this fall; "Arrow" is the last to arrive. It's also the show that has propelled much of the CW line-up, with six series in what's called the "Arrowverse." Now the eighth and final season – with only 10 episodes – begins. Oliver returns to Starling City, trying to figure The Monitor's mission. Meanwhile, Mia and William have their team collide with a new foe.
9) "Chicago Fire," "Chicago Med" and "Chicago P.D.," 8-11 p.m. Wednesday, NBC. It's crossover time, flipping the order of the first two shows. Things start with firefighters and paramedics, rushing to a bacteria outbreak at a Bears game; a fire at a university causes Sevaride to suspect there's something bigger. Then "Med" has an apartment complex under quarantine; Will comes across a bioterrorism suspect. That leads to "P.D." and a massive manhunt; Voight fears it's just a wild goose chase.
10) And more. One key series ends ("The Terror: Infamy," 9 p.m. today, AMC) and another starts ("Watchmen," 9 p.m. Sunday, HBO). Both are beautifully filmed ... both are rooted in a real-life tragedy (the detainment of Japanese-Americans during World War II, the massacre of blacks in 1921 Tulsa) ... and both then go in wild, supernatural directions. And a streaming note: On Friday, Amazon Prime introduces a real gem: "Modern Love" is an anthology, dramatizing eight real-life stories.
Patsy Cline released a hit version of the Willie Nelson song "Crazy" in 1961. Here, Cline performs during The Nashville Tennessean Centennial Park concert June 26, 1955.

Cristin Milioti in Amazon's “Modern Love," an anthology series inspired by the New York Times column of the same name.
2. If you're a romantic comedy devotee, you'll find a lot to like in “Modern Love." The Amazon anthology series, from John Carney of “Once" and “Sing Street," is based on The New York Times column about love and all its countless ways. The eight separate episode-long stories feature some vivid one-off work from Anne Hathaway, Cristin Milioti, John Slattery, Tina Fey, Dev Patel, and Mr. Hot Priest himself, Andrew Scott. The season is available on Friday.
3. The tears of a clone: In his new Netflix series, “Living With Yourself," Paul Rudd plays a depressed guy as well as a cheerier version of himself. Rudd's good, and Aisling Bea is too, as his wife caught in the middle. The story tries to undo the myth of easy answers, but ultimately it's also, to use my colleague Isaac Feldberg's word, “rudderless." It debuts Friday.
4. Hulu's miniseries “Looking for Alaska," premiering Friday, is based on John Green's novel about a boy who transfers to a boarding school and falls for a girl named Alaska. Charlie Plummer and the intriguing Kristine Froseth star, with Ron Cephas Jones and Timothy Simons adding expert support as teachers. There are boarding school cliches, but also lovely moments between the bright but struggling kids.
5. Like “Homecoming," “Limetown" is adapted from a fictional podcast — this one about a radio reporter looking into the disappearance of over 300 people at a neuroscience research facility in Tennessee. Jessica Biel was riveting in “The Sinner"; let's see if she is here, too, as the reporter. Stanley Tucci and Marlee Matlin are also onboard. There are 10 half-hour episodes, premiering Wednesday on Facebook Watch.
6. Damon Lindelof of “Lost' and “The Leftovers" has adapted — or, as he put it, “remixed" — the comic-book series “Watchmen" for HBO. It's set in an alternate 2019, under President Robert Redford, with white supremacists conflicting with cops in Oklahoma. Regina King, Jeremy Irons, Louis Gossett Jr., Don Johnson, Jean Smart, and Tim Blake Nelson star. It premieres Sunday at 9 p.m.

Texto completo: Ronan Farrow was not surprised that even before the official publication date of his bombshell-dropping book "Catch and Kill: Lies, Spies, and a Conspiracy to Protect Predators" people were calling him a liar.
"In most of the stories I report on, there are similar kind of smear campaigns that spin up," he said recently. "There's an effort to make it as underhanded and personal as possible; there are outright untrue statements that are trafficked."
Only this time, at least one of the statements he was referring to comes from his former employers at NBC News, where, ironically enough, he began the investigation that would eventually result in this book.

It was for NBC News that he began investigating Harvey Weinstein after Rose McGowan tweeted that a producer, whom many assumed was Weinstein, had raped her. And it was NBC News that, according to Farrow in "Catch and Kill," shut down his story under pressure from Weinstein.
Pressure that included threats to expose then-"Today" host Matt Lauer, who according to Farrow's book also had been accused of harassment by several women, who were given settlements and nondisclosure agreements by NBC News, long before Lauer was fired in 2017.
As news of the book's contents -- including the first revelation of the rape allegation made by Brooke Nevils that led to Lauer's dismissal -- got out, Lauer issued a categorical denial, as did Andy Lack, chairman of NBC News and MSNBC. Lauer says the sexual relationship he had with Nevils was consensual; Lack says the decision to spike Farrow's story was because it did not meet NBC's journalist standards. Farrow took his reporting to the New Yorker, which published the investigation, for which Farrow won a Pulitzer.
"It disappoints me to say that even with passage of time," Lack wrote in a memo to staff last week, "Farrow's account has become neither more accurate, nor more respectful of the dedicated colleagues he worked with here at NBC News. He uses a variety of tactics to paint a fundamentally untrue picture."
Those "tactics" include documenting in "Catch and Kill" a series of highly detailed and increasingly excruciating conversations in which the president of NBC News, Noah Oppenheim, tells Farrow to back-burner, then stop reporting the Weinstein story, even when that means canceling on-camera interviews with women who had already gone on the record to Farrow with their accusations. According to "Catch and Kill," after the story breaks of how Farrow came to be reporting for the New Yorker (much of it via pointed on-camera questioning of Farrow by MSNBC's Rachel Maddow), Oppenheim begs Farrow to tell people that he "was not the villain."
"There was never a reasonable interpretation that was about journalism, the order to stop pursuing this," Farrow says. Indeed, on the day of our conversation, Farrow's then producer, Rich McHugh had written an essay in Vanity Fair in which he backed up the exchanges chronicled in "Catch and Kill" and accused Lack and Oppenheim of being "more like members of Weinstein's PR team than the journalists they claim to be." When asked how these conversations were so meticulously re-created for the book, Farrow points to the author's note that prefaces "Catch and Kill."
"While I cannot reveal any sources or methods for any one scene what I can say is that any time you see quotations it is from a direct first person contemporaneous account, transcript or recording, and you'll notice that those quotes have not been disputed as part of the conversation.
"I also note that because this is a story about surveillance there are a lot of cases in which third persons were present on the line for calls or surreptitiously recording calls. And in cases where I made my own recording, I adhered to legal and ethical standards."
If that sounds more like a spy novel than a reporter's chronicle, that was one of the reason's Farrow decided to write the book.
"As I looked at what became a bible of documentation of what happened every single day over a two-year period I realized there was a coherent story to tell and I didn't know the conclusion -- some of the twists weren't revealed until 2019 -- but I did know what the arc would be."
A coherent story about how Weinstein and other powerful men could allegedly get away with years of sexual abuse and settlements that included not just NBC's refusal to air the story (or, as Farrow points out in the book, to report on the Weinstein scandal much at all in the early days after it broke) but also the revelations of agents and double agents working on Weinstein's behalf.
One of whom, as detailed in "She Said," Megan Twohey and Jodi Kantor's chronicle of their Weinstein investigation for the New York Times, was Lisa Bloom. In the early days of his reporting, Farrow called his sister Dylan for aid and insight. Dylan recommended talking with Bloom, who had been supportive of Dylan's repeated allegations that her (and Farrow's) father, Woody Allen, had sexually abused her. Farrow confided in Bloom, only to learn that she had been feeding Weinstein information on Farrow's reporting.
It was a personal blow to both siblings.
"I, who considered Lisa Bloom a staunch advocate for justice and for the voices of survivors of sexual violence and had her as a regular on my program talking about these issues and complicity in the circles of power, and my sister, who had been galvanized by pieces and op eds written by Lisa Bloom talking about my sister's credibility, and the culture were shocked," he said.
"This is deeply unethical behavior, and it is remarkable to me that she is still a member of the California bar."
But it was the realization that Weinstein had allegedly hired an international private espionage company, Black Cube, to spy on and attempt to intimidate Farrow, McGowan and other reporters and sources that was the real "gut punch."
Throughout the book, Farrow chronicles his growing suspicion that he was being followed, the email requests that seemed off, the weird weather alerts showing up on his phone and the repeated suggestions that he should arm himself (which led him to a shooting range for target practice, though he would not say whether he had bought a gun), only to find that this was not a case of self-aggrandizing paranoia. He was being followed and tracked and approached by agents of Black Cube.
"It is a very serious point to emphasize that these cloak-and-dagger tactics should stay in the world of [Robert] Ludlum novels and not be directed at real world journalists and sources in our country," he says. "On a personal level, there were many moments that felt stranger than fiction, and it was only after rigorous investigation that I realized, 'Holy moly, this is really happening.'
"You can imagine," he adds with a laugh, "going to your editor, as I did, saying, 'Hi, there's a secret Israeli spy group staffed by former Mossad agents after me and my sources; they're called Black Cube.' The unanimous reaction was: 'This can't be true.' But it really was, it's all true."
Including the Black Cube mole, called Sleeper1973 (which, in the book, Farrow suspects is a reference to his father's movie of the same name and release date), who supplied him with a document trail of requests and reports.
"At the institutions I am reporting on, whether Black Cube or NBC or the Weinstein Co., there is a significant constituency of really good people who helped me get the story," he says. And who continue to do so, even as Lack and Lauer deny the accuracy of "Catch and Kill."
"I'm not going to talk about specific leads coming in, but I will say in general that when I break a story, it leads to a lot of people reaching out with additional corroborative evidence."
"Catch and Kill," he says, is designed to be a testament to all the great journalists who "bang their head against these stories and don't give up" and to the profession of journalism itself, which Farrow characterizes as "precious" and "imperiled."
Also, he adds, to fact-checkers, especially Sean Lavery, a senior fact-checker at the New Yorker.
"I hope the impact this book is having," Farrow says, "also serves as a reminder to news outlets that fact checking is really important."

A Weinstein Is Returning To Hollywood

Texto completo: LOS ANGELES -- While Harvey Weinstein awaits trial on five felony charges related to allegations of sexual abuse, his brother, Bob, has announced his re-entry into Hollywood.
On Friday, the younger of the two brothers revealed to the trade publication Deadline Hollywood that he would be starting a new production company with a focus on family films, comedies and upscale adult thrillers. The company will be called Watch This Entertainment and its first movie will be an animated family adventure called "Endangered." The film will be co-produced by the actress Tea Leoni, who will also be the voice of the lead character.
Pantea Ghaderi, a longtime publicity executive at the Weinstein Company, will be the president of creative development at the company, which intends to produce two to three films a year.
The news comes two years after Harvey Weinstein was fired from the Weinstein Company after accusations from dozens of women of sexual misconduct and one year after Bob Weinstein stepped down from the company's board. The company filed for bankruptcy in March 2018, and its assets were later sold to Lantern Capital Partners, a private equity firm.
Harvey Weinstein was arrested in May 2018 on rape charges, and posted a $ 1 million bail. He has denied ever having nonconsensual sex.
Time's Up, a Hollywood-based advocacy group begun in the wake of the Weinstein revelations and the #MeToo effort, quickly issued a statement after learning of Bob Weinstein's new production company.
"There could have been no Harvey Weinstein without the complicity of Bob Weinstein, who for years put profits ahead of people's lives as Harvey terrorized women throughout the industry," the statement read. "Bob Weinstein has no business running anything, let alone launching a new production company while dozens of survivors are still searching for some small measure of justice."
Bob Weinstein declined to comment. He told The Hollywood Reporter in 2017 that his brother was "sick and depraved." He also said that, until The New York Times, The New Yorker and others revealed sexual harassment and rape allegations against his brother, he thought his sibling's "philandering" with women involved "all consensual situations."
Ms. Ghaderi, a spokeswoman for Dimension Films, the Weinstein Company genre division that Bob Weinstein oversaw, told The New York Times that same year, that she and others were "shocked and sickened" to read the accusations against Harvey Weinstein.
She added: "I have been lucky enough to get to know Bob closely for years now. He has always shown me the utmost respect as a boss, mentor and friend."
Harvey Weinstein last appeared in court in August, pleading not guilty to a new indictment intended to allow testimony from the actress Annabella Sciorra, who has accused Mr. Weinstein of raping her at her Gramercy Park apartment in the 1990s. The additional indictment, which includes two counts of predatory sexual assault, has delayed his trial to January.

Texto completo: Hotel collapse in New Orleans leaves 1 dead, 2 missing
NEW ORLEANS — A large section of a Hard Rock Hotel under construction at the edge of New Orleans’ historic French Quarter collapsed Saturday amid blinding dust and flying debris, killing one person and injuring more than 20 as rescue workers rushed into what was left of the largely unstable building to locate two people still unaccounted for.
Nearby buildings were evacuated and a 270-foot construction crane — one of two still looming over the multistory building — also was dangerously unstable, fire officials said.
“I heard a huge noise and thought it was a plane crashing,” said Sue Hurley, 68, a guest at a hostel just across the street that shuddered with the force of the explosion. Hurley said she was reminded of news accounts of the 9/11 terrorist attacks.
WWL-TV aired and tweeted a viewer’s dramatic video of the collapse, showing upper floors falling on top of each other before one side of the building crashed to the ground.
Another video on social media showed what looked like a metal structure — part of the building or a piece of construction equipment — tumbling to the ground and people running from the scene as clouds of dust billowed up, obscuring the view like a thick fog.
Trump backs Giuliani, but some aides wish he would cut ties
WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump on Saturday stood behind personal attorney Rudy Giuliani, one of his highest-profile and most vocal defenders, amid reports that federal prosecutors in the city Giuliani led as mayor are eyeing him for possible lobbying violations.
Behind the scenes, however, many of Trump’s closest aides and advisers, inside and outside the White House, quietly wish the president would cut ties with Giuliani, whose leadership of New York after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks earned him worldwide admiration and the moniker of “America’s mayor.”
Giuliani was a force in Trump’s defense during the lengthy Russia investigation by the special counsel. Yet the effort to undermine special counsel Robert Mueller led Giuliani to Ukraine, which now entangles the former federal prosecutor and mayor in legal jeopardy and is central to the danger threatening the presidency he labored to protect.
The New York Times reported Friday, citing a pair of anonymous sources familiar with the matter, that the investigation is linked to Giuliani’s efforts to undermine Marie Yovanovitch, formerly the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine. The U.S. attorney’s office in Manhattan has declined to comment on the Times report.
Two Florida businessmen with ties to Giuliani were charged Thursday with federal campaign finance violations. Both played key roles in Giuliani’s efforts to get Ukraine to launch a corruption investigation into Democratic presidential contender Joe Biden and his son Hunter, who sat on the board of a gas company there.
Authorities: 3 deaths tied to Southern California wildfires
LOS ANGELES — Three people have died at the scene of Southern California wildfires this week, authorities said Saturday, as firefighters aided by diminishing winds beat back a blaze on the edge of Los Angeles that damaged or destroyed more than 30 structures and sent a blanket of smoke across a swath of neighborhoods.
Los Angeles officials said the fire in the city’s San Fernando Valley area hadn’t grown significantly since Friday, and ground crews were tamping down lingering hotspots. Evacuation orders were lifted in all of Los Angeles County and in parts of Riverside County, where a second blaze was burning.
Shortly before 5 p.m., the Los Angeles Police Department said in a tweet: “We thank members of the community for promptly heeding the evacuation orders and their patience as we worked to contain the fire.”
Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti told residents to be cautious returning home to neighborhoods where fire crews could still be operating.
In Los Angeles, one man who tried to fight the blaze died of a heart attack, and one firefighter reported a minor eye injury.
Man sentenced to death for Texas attack that killed 6
HOUSTON — A man who prosecutors say was driven by vengeance when he fatally shot six members of his ex-wife’s family in Texas, including four children, was sentenced Friday to death, a decision the lone survivor of the attack says will help her let go of “hurt and anger.”
Jurors sentenced Ronald Lee Haskell after deliberating for little more than four hours. The jury had to choose between life in prison without parole or a death sentence.
The same jury last month convicted Haskell of capital murder in the 2014 killings of Stephen and Katie Stay at their home in suburban Houston. The jury rejected his attorneys’ efforts to have him found not guilty by reason of insanity.
Haskell killed the couple and four of their children in the living room of their suburban Houston home in 2014. A fifth child, 15-year-old Cassidy Stay, was shot in the head but she survived by playing dead.
After the sentence was announced, Cassidy Stay, now 20, read a victim impact statement from the witness stand, saying she had initially had felt “hurt and anger” after learning that Haskell felt no remorse for killing her family.

CNN’s Brian Stelter debunks 'left-wing conspiracy theory' on Shepard Smith departure

Texto completo: CNN media analyst Brian Stelter and Fox News' Howard Kurtz both addressed the conspiracies that surfaced after Shepard Smith abruptly announced he was leaving the network he had worked for since its inception.
Following the announcement, many speculated that Attorney General William Barr's recent meeting with Fox mogul Rupert Murdoch could have been the reason behind Smith's departure. However, both the network and Smith denied that his leaving stemmed from anything but his own choice.
“There was also a left-wing conspiracy theory out there about Shep Smith the other day, and I want to debunk it,” Stelter stated on Reliable Sources on Sunday. “There was a report in the New York Times that Rupert Murdoch had a meeting with Attorney General Bill Barr. That’s true they did meet, but it had nothing to do with Smith resigning a day or two later.”

“In fact, Smith had been thinking about this for several weeks. So, I want to put that to rest,” CNN’s top media critic continued, before noting that it does speak volumes "that people wonder, 'Is someone pulling the strings?'"
Kurtz echoed Stelter's remarks on his own Sunday show MediaBuzz.

He stated, "You can forget about the wild conspiracy theories out there, that the Trump team wanted him out, that this means a new direction for Fox, when it was Shep who approached management last month and said he we wanted to step down, and he was asked to reconsider. That’s a fact."

Texto completo: Former First Lady Michelle Obama famously said "the presidency doesn't change who you are, it reveals who you are." And that's the same feeling photographer Pete Souza got from shadowing President Barack Obama during his eight years in office.
"That's certainly true of what I witnessed with him," Souza, the former chief White House photographer, said the day after the moving van showed up in Madison, where Souza and his wife are starting to settle in.
"I don't think that he's any different than people from the outside look at him. I mean, he's a decent human being. He's disciplined, he's intelligent, he thinks things through. He probably has a better sense of humor than people realize. He's competitive," said Souza, who will show behind-the-scenes photographs and talk about his close relationship with the 44th president in a presentation called "Keep Hope Alive" Oct. 25 at the Overture Center.
Souza, 64, was 28 when he started photographing President Ronald Reagan in 1983 in the middle of his first term.
Reagan's chief White House photographer, Michael Evans, had hired Souza to work for him. When Evans left during Reagan's second term, he wasn't replaced, so Souza and two other staff photographers carried on.
With Obama, Souza was the chief photographer and had three people working for him, covering the president, vice president and first lady.
Obama wrote the forward to Souza's 2017 New York Times best-seller, "Obama: An Intimate Portrait: The Historic Presidency in Photographs," what Souza calls his "big book." In it, Obama wrote that in their eight years together, he spent more time with Souza than anybody outside his family.
"Sometimes I think I spent more time with him than his family, but I'm not going to dispute what he wrote," Souza said.
?Professional troll'
Souza had an official White House Instagram account while working for Obama, and after Obama left office, Souza started a personal Instagram account. He's gained 2.1 million followers for the unique way he's able to skewer President Donald Trump.
"Daily Show" host Trevor Noah called Souza the "professional troll of Donald Trump."
Souza has almost as many photos from his Obama years as he has Instagram followers, and he uses them to contrast whatever Trump is doing in the news that day. Each post gets tens of thousands of "likes" and hundreds of comments.
Tuesday alone he had four posts. He posted a photo of a concerned- looking Obama with a finger to his temple, and wrote, "It wasn't that long ago we had a President of the United States who used his brain to think about the country, not himself."
About a photo of Obama sitting at a long table of advisers, Souza wrote, "Back when the person sitting at the head of the table in the Situation Room was making decisions which were in the best interest of our country and our national security."
Souza's 2018 book, "Shade: A Tale of Two Presidents," does the same thing.
In the book's introduction, Souza talks about how in the first week of Trump's presidency he wrote a snarky Instagram comment about the redecorated Oval Office with its emphasis on gold. Trump was trying to turn the "People's house" into "his personal palace," Souza wrote.
The overwhelming positive reaction took him by surprise, but he was bewildered by one comment that he was "dropping shade with a comment on drapes."
Souza had to look up "dropping shade" or "throwing shade" because he wasn't familiar with that expression.
His transition from observer to activist has evolved, in terms of the invective he puts into the comments he makes while contrasting the imagery of the Obama years with what's taking place under Trump.
"I think over the course of the last two-and-a-half years, my commentary has gotten more, at times, provocative, but I still try to be humorous and respond in a respectful way most of the time. But I've definitely gone further the last year than I probably did in the first year and a half."
Souza's nickname for Trump on Instagram, "Comrade minus," started because he didn't want to acknowledge Trump's status as the 45th president, so he started calling him 46 minus one, and people got it.
Then, Jerry Seinfeld's wife, Jessica Seinfeld, who follows Souza on Instagram, sent him a message saying he should just call him Minus, because "everybody will know what you mean."
So, Souza started calling him Minus. "And then when the story came out that the FBI had launched a counter-terrorism investigation on whether he was an unknowing Russian agent, that's when I started calling him Comrade minus.
"And it's funny because people have caught on for the most part, the people that follow me on Instagram. Some people still don't know what it means."
Family ties
Souza moved to Madison because his 32-year-old daughter is in her final year of a medical residency at UW Hospital, and his wife really loves Madison, he said.
Asked if this is just a temporary move, Souza said, "No, no, no. We're here," adding that he hopes his daughter's fellowship will also be at UW. Souza and his wife convinced their 29-year-old son to move here, too.
The biggest adjustment about moving to Madison is a good one, Souza said "that you can kind of walk everywhere." And, after 36 years in Virginia, he's preparing for colder, snowier winters. "We get cold weather and snow in Arlington, but not like Madison. I grew up in Boston, so I know what winters are like."
Souza lives Downtown and has been enjoying trying out Madison restaurants. He said he's had good pizza at Lucille and Salvatore's Tomato Pies.
"I haven't tried Ian's pizza yet," he said. "Not that I just eat pizza, but I've tried lots of the restaurants right Downtown. There's a lot of good restaurants."
He's interested in getting to know the grocery stores, and already has a fondness for the Ace hardware store on Williamson Street. "It's a classic, old hardware store," he said.
Souza who during the interview was wearing a Lumineers T-shirt and said he's friends with the band also touted Pieces Unimagined Furnishings, although he didn't know its name, just that it was near the hardware store and across from the Willy Street Co-op. "It has a lot of cool stuff in it, like tables and turntables."
He talked about local concert venues and was looking forward to a show by Mary Chapin Carpenter and Shawn Colvin Sunday in Overture's Capitol Theater, the same theater where he'll be appearing.
Hope
The message he'll put across during his Overture Center appearance is the same as the theme of "Shade," he said.
"I think President Obama embodied hope, and we can return to that sentiment in the future if we get out and vote," Souza said, adding that he was impressed with voter turnout in Madison during the midterm election.
His presentation will highlight some of the key photographs and events during the Obama admin-istration, Souza said.
Souza sees the former president every once in a while, and noted it's going to be harder now that he lives in Madison. The last time was in Washington, D.C., in late July for Obama's birthday celebration.
Souza said he doesn't have a favored candidate in the 2020 Democratic presidential field. "None that I would say publicly because I will support whoever the nominee is. I like them all actually," he said.
His animus for Trump shouldn't be construed as a disrespect of all Republicans, Souza said. After all, he worked in the Reagan White House. "If John McCain or Mitt Romney or John Kasich or Jeb Bush or any number of Republicans had become president, I wouldn't be doing this.
"I mean, I may still disagree fundamentally with their policies, but I believe that all those individuals I mentioned would have respected the office of the presidency and would have respected other people and wouldn't be calling the press corrupt, and wouldn't be lying to us every day, wouldn't be bullying people."
As far as whether there are any Republicans in office that he holds in high regard, Souza said he's sure there are Republican governors and mayors that he could respect.
"In Congress, none that I can think of," he said.

What makes us all radically equal

Texto completo: Around New Year's 2017, a community organizer named Chris Lambert leased a soon-to-be-empty school building for $1 in one of Detroit's poorer African American neighborhoods. The plan was to pour $5 million into remodeling the building, take on the $1-million-a-year operating expenses and turn the place into a vibrant hub for the surrounding community, with nonprofits, culinary training programs, after-school programs and artists.
Lambert did not communicate this well to the people who actually lived in the community.
When neighbors learned Lambert had acquired the building for a dollar, many wondered why a white outsider, not somebody from within the community, had gotten such a deal. They assumed that he was the cutting edge of gentrification, that he was going to pour money in and push the current folks out. This kind of outsider exploitation is the lived history for many Detroiters.
That month, Lambert hosted some community meetings to mollify fears. They did not go well. People called him a colonizer. They called his black colleagues Oreos. "This white guy is going to subject us to more slavery," somebody declared.
Lambert wanted to argue back. But his black partner, Dwan Dandridge, advised him to just listen. It's a hazing process, Dandridge told Lambert. You feel voiceless tonight. These people have felt voiceless their whole lives. Just listen.
This fullest account of the episode can be found in Bittersweet Monthly in an article written by Anne Snyder, my wife. I visited Lambert and Dandridge in Detroit a few weeks ago, a year and a half after the grand opening.
The building, now called the Durfee Innovation Society, has children teeming the halls, a pizzeria, training programs, yoga classes. Lambert is humbled by the mistakes he made, but his center is fantastic. Some of his angriest critics have now taken part in neighborhood festivities held in the building. There is still distrust, suspicion, rage at injustice coursing through the neighborhood. But there is also life together, happening every day.
I see these messy clash-ups across the country, wherever people are trying to do racial reconciliation. You realize that coming together across race is not a neat two-step process: truth and reconciliation. It's an emotionally complex, thousand-step process, with moments of miscommunication, resentment and embrace. This is the hard process of trying to see each other across centuries of wrong.
The somewhat comforting truth is that it's always been like this. When you read David Blight's brilliant biography of Frederick Douglass, for example, you see that Douglass passed through exactly these many moods in dealing with his countrymen of another race - moments of fury and harmony, despair and hope.
Sometimes he was disgusted with America. "I have no love for America, as such," he once said. Other times he was enraptured: "I am an American citizen. In birth, in sentiment, in ideas, in hopes, in aspirations and responsibilities."
Douglass' genius was his ability to balance his indignation at oppression with his underlying faith in the American project. In his speeches he would praise his white audiences in one movement and thunder condemnation in the next. In an 1876 speech about Abraham Lincoln, he both condemned and complimented the man who inspired and infuriated him: "Viewed from the genuine abolition ground, Mr. Lincoln seemed tardy, cold, dull and indifferent; but measuring him from the sentiment of his country ... he was swift, zealous, radical and determined."
Douglass could withstand all the ups and downs, all the ambivalences, because of an unchanging underlying belief: in the natural rights of all humankind.
He constantly returned to the core belief of America's founding in 1776, that we are endowed by our creator with certain unalienable rights. Slavery and racism were not just wrong - they betrayed the divine natural order of the universe. Douglass had an underlying faith in the providence. Justice would eventually triumph. The "laws which govern the moral universe," he said, would make it so.
And here we get to the nub of what sustained Douglass and what sustains people today as they do this work. It is the belief that all humans have souls. It is the belief that all people of all races have a piece of themselves that has no size, weight, color or shape, but which gives them infinite value and dignity.
It is the belief that our souls make us all radically equal. Our brains and bodies are not equal, but our souls are. It is the belief that the person who is infuriating you most right now still has a soul and so is still, deep down, beautiful and redeemable. It is the belief that when all is said and done all souls have a common home together, a final resting place as pieces of a larger unity.
When people hold fast to their awareness of souls, then they have a fixed center among the messiness of racial reconciliation, and they give each other grace. If they lose the concept of the soul, they've lost everything.

Breast Cancer Awareness Month recognized by VNA

Texto completo: A quick search will show that there are over 1,000 causes represented by various colors and patterns of ribbons. We are awash in a sea of ribbons for causes as diverse as missing children and malaria. But why ribbons, and do they still help to raise awareness on issues?

Penney Laingen is credited with using a yellow ribbon tied around a tree in the 1970s to raise awareness about the plight of her husband, and others, who were held hostage in Iran. The use of ribbons as a symbol for awareness soon caught on, and in fact 1992 was dubbed “the year of the ribbon” by the New York Times.
That same year, Self magazine began to promote breast cancer awareness using a pink ribbon, based on Charlotte Hayley's use of a peach ribbon to prompt legislators and Americans to put more funding towards cancer prevention.
Since then, the pink ribbon has been featured in fundraising walks, car magnets, and a vast variety of products to purchase. It is this last item that should truly give us pause.
Some companies freely note how much of your purchase price goes towards breast cancer research, while others have been discovered to give little or no money to the cause. Disappointingly, pink ribbons have even been found to adorn products that feature cancer-causing ingredients.
So what can you do?
“Knowledge is your best ally,” notes Tabitha Dowd, Executive Director of Franklin VNA & Hospice. “We chose to support breast cancer awareness by participating in the American Cancer Society Making Strides walk. They are transparent in how the money we raised is going towards breast cancer research and prevention, and the visual image of groups walking for a cause makes an impact in a way that words cannot.”
Dowd also notes that knowledge about breast cancer screening is critically important, as well. “Women should ensure they follow guidelines about routine mammograms and ensure that they are getting follow up – without delay – for any abnormal finding. Breast self-exams are also a vital tool for women to practice monthly.”
A Journal of Women's Health study found that 25% of breast cancers are discovered through breast self-exam, so check out breastcancer.org and search for “self-exam” for a user-friendly guide to how to check yourself. Maintaining a healthy diet, quitting smoking, and being physically active, are all ways shown to reduce the risk of breast cancer, as well as a host of other diseases.
“Take steps to get and stay healthy,” finishes Dowd, “Recognize that your health is important, and while we will be here to support you if it fails, we'd rather have you healthy, marching beside us.”

A Threat To Political Discourse?

Texto completo: They can be a good credential for aspiring leaders, but they favor a closed-minded and partisan style of argument.
What do conservative political figures like Ted Cruz, Steve Bannon, Karl Rove and Richard Nixon have in common with liberal politicians like Elizabeth Warren, Andrew Yang, Kamala Harris and Bill Clinton? They all honed their skills of rhetoric, reasoning and persuasion on school debate teams.
That's no surprise. Excelling in school debate opens many academic and professional doors, conferring prestige and signaling exceptional verbal and logical aptitude. Some of those skills will no doubt be on display at the Democratic presidential primary debate on Tuesday.
But while school debate can be good for aspiring politicians, it may not be good for our politics. In particular, it may contribute to the closed-minded, partisan and self-interested nature of so much of today's public and political dialogue.
Why? Because school debate ultimately strengthens and rewards biased reasoning.
In traditional debate competitions, teams are assigned at random to argue one or the other side of an issue. Each round, one team is assigned the affirmative view -- say, "Recreational drug use should be legalized" -- and the other team, the negative. That means teams start with a conclusion, whether they endorse it or not, and work backward from there, marshaling the best arguments they can devise to make that conclusion come out on top.
The goal is not to determine the most reasonable or fair-minded approach to an issue, but to defend a given claim at all costs. This is an exercise not in deliberation but in reasoning with an agenda.
This also happens to be the kind of argumentation we find so corrosive in today's politics. Politicians and pundits have their favored view and then emphasize the information that fortifies it. Evidence that threatens their position is rationalized away. Problems for the opposing view are hunted for and magnified.
This criticism is not new. The philosopher and logician Willard Van Orman Quine argued that school debate elevates "the goal of persuasion above the goal of truth" and that the strength of a good debater "lies not in intellectual curiosity nor in amenability to rational persuasion by others, but in his skill in defending a preconception come what may."
School debate reinforces this mode of reasoning. By celebrating those who are most adept at it, schools hold it up as a model form of thinking.
Don't get us wrong. This style of reasoning can be useful. Legal advocacy, for instance, often requires it. And in preparing to argue both sides of a question, as you do in school debate, you can gain valuable perspective on the topic at hand. You develop the ability to approach a topic from different angles. You might even learn the critical lesson that there is often more to an opposing view than it may initially seem.
Nevertheless, traditional school debate discourages the kind of listening and reasoning that is critical to a healthy democracy. Student debaters don't deliberate about what they themselves believe, or should believe. They don't cultivate the disposition to listen to others with the real possibility of changing their minds. On the contrary, they practice listening with eagle ears for opposing points to pounce on. Rather than increasing their comfort with being wrong, they can deepen an attitude of certainty.
School debate doesn't have to be this way, though. In fact, many schools around the country are gravitating to alternative forms of debate that set the goals of truth and understanding over the goal of persuasion. A good example is the Ethics Bowl.
In the Ethics Bowl, created at the intercollegiate level in 1993 and the high school level around 2012, a team is assigned a question -- not a statement or conclusion, as in traditional debate -- on a contentious topic, such as "When is the use of military drones morally permissible?" The team then presents and defends whatever conclusion its deliberation has led to. An opposing team and a panel of judges pose questions and raise potential problems, to which the first team responds.
Sometimes the two teams find themselves largely in agreement. When they do, the winner is the team that does the better job of articulating its reasoning, listening and responding to questions, and advancing the collective understanding of the issue at hand.
But disagreement is frequent in the Ethics Bowl, and the discussions are spirited. That's a good thing. After all, spirited dissent and disagreement are hallmarks of a healthy democracy. Disagreement among citizens is inevitable -- about politics, morality, education, religion, nearly everything. What's crucial is how we disagree, and how we converse and deliberate with those with whom we disagree.
It is precisely when we disagree that it is most critical for our thinking to be clear and our dialogue to be charitable and scrupulous. But disagreement is also when we're most likely to get irritated, defensive and impatient. The more at stake in the conversation, the more difficult it is to remain poised, thoughtful, open to being wrong and ready to acknowledge fair points from the other side.
Disagreeing constructively is a skill -- one of the most difficult and important there is. In encouraging students to practice this skill, the Ethics Bowl fosters what may be the most important intellectual virtue of all: openness to changing your mind.
There is something of a stigma in our culture about changing your mind, especially in politics. If you do, you are often seen as weak or branded a "flip-flopper." The problem is, holding steadfast to a belief in the face of sound objections or contrary evidence stops conversation. It's dogmatic and stubborn. Having the courage to admit when you might be wrong, on the other hand, helps move conversations toward meaningful resolutions.
At this seemingly broken political moment, our country's future may depend on our politicians' becoming more comfortable doing that.

Texto completo: What: 2019 Booklovers Bash, Laramie County Library Foundation’s annual fundraiser
When: Doors open at 5:30 p.m. Friday, Oct. 18
Where: Little America Resort, 2800 W. Lincolnway
Cost: $85
Phone: 307-634-3561

Walking into writer Joe Posnanski’s home office, it would appear that he’s a Harry Houdini superfan. Seemingly every inch is covered in Houdini posters, figurines and other memorabilia.
But it didn’t always look like a tornado of niche magician fandom hit.
“I was looking for my next book, and I had this idea to write about wonder,” said Posnanski, an award-winning sports journalist and New York Times bestselling author. “That didn’t fit within sports, and then this question came to mind: why do we still know who Harry Houdini is 100 years later? … I didn’t really have an idea why he’s so big and the most famous magician in the world.”
The quest to answer that question resulted in “The Life and Afterlife of Harry Houdini,” a nonfiction book that hits shelves Oct. 22 – unless you’re going to Laramie County Library Foundation’s Booklovers Bash Oct. 18.
Guests at the annual fundraiser – at which Posnanski will be the speaker – will have the opportunity to buy hardcover copies of his latest work before anyone else in the country, which was actually a beautiful accident.
Event chairwoman Rachelle Zimmerman said the group invites a celebrated author to speak at the bash every year, and someone on the foundation board recommended Posnanski because the group has never hosted a sports writer. It wasn’t until talking to the author and his team that the new book was brought up, and the group decided this would be a great way for Posnanski to kickstart publicity for the new work.
“Our goal is to have them (authors) as local as possible because they draw a nice crowd. But when you have someone like Joe who has national appeal and a large base of readers, it’s all about pulling in the most attendees,” Zimmerman said of his appeal as a speaker.
“We’re thrilled,” added Foundation Director Kristi Wallin. “In Cheyenne, there are so many great opportunities to support so many different organizations, but we work really hard to create a really fun, entertaining and valuable experience for the people who come to the Booklovers Bash.”
Posnanski has never been to Cheyenne, so he said he’s excited for the event and the chance to share his writing process.
Attendees will gain insight into the process of writing the book, from inception to publication and all the fun and unexpected happenings in between (including a trip to Las Vegas to meet David Copperfield and see his personal collection of Houdini artifacts, part of what is often considered the largest archive of magic paraphernalia in the world).
Posnanski had no connection to the world of magic prior to writing this book – other than his love of doing card tricks for his daughters, that is – so he said he had to start from scratch in terms of research and finding sources. After a cold email to Copperfield and his team, he quickly dove into the whimsical world of magic experts.
“The Life and Afterlife of Harry Houdini” was actually finished nearly a year ago, but Posnanski’s team decided to wait and release it around Halloween because of the air of creepiness surrounding many of the magician’s acts and his connection to the holiday (he eerily died on Halloween). Posnanski said he’s been itching for the chance to finally get it out to the public, so he’s particularly looking forward to doing so at the bash.
“I love this part of it,” he said. “Sharing this is so much fun. Writing a book is so solitary … you’re just in a room by yourself trying to make this come alive, and you think it’s pretty good when you’re done with it … and you never really know, so then you take it out into the world and some people like it and some don’t.”
Other than a jam-packed silent auction (which attendees will have an additional half hour to bid during this year) and Posnanski’s much-anticipated book talk and signing, Zimmerman is looking forward to her other favorite Booklovers Bash tradition – one that has women taking off their heels in the middle of the fundraiser: the dessert dash.
“It’s sort of the crowning jewel of the bash,” she said. “Everyone bids as a table, and the table that bids the most gets their name announced, and a representative runs up to get the dessert. As that person gets up to run, the next person is announced, so it’s truly a dash for the dessert that you want.”
“There are fewer desserts than there are tables, so that’s why you have to dash!” Wallin added.
Speakers and mad dashes aside, it’s the people who support the event that make it special, Zimmerman said, adding that sponsors often give the tickets they can’t use to library staff – a rare act in the world of philanthropic events.
“They support those people who work so hard for our library and let them have a fun evening out,” Wallin said.

Trump highlights Wyoming man’s battle with EPA

Texto completo: CASPER – A Wyoming man who became a poster child for what some saw as environmental overreach visited the White House for the signing of two executive orders by President Donald Trump intended to “improve the transparency and fairness of government agencies,” the White House said.
Uinta County’s Andy Johnson, who rose to prominence for his legal battle with the Environmental Protection Agency over a pond he had built on his property, was a special guest of the president during a Wednesday news conference on the executive orders in Washington, D.C. – part of Trumps’ effort to reduce regulations on businesses and private citizens.
The executive orders, according to prepared remarks by the president, are intended to end the persecution of private citizens who often learn of the rules only when “federal agents come knocking on their door.” That regulatory overreach, Trump said, is often carried out by bureaucrats with an agenda whose actions are subject to little accountability.
“A permanent bureaucracy cannot become a fourth branch of government unanswerable to American voters,” said Trump. “In America, voters must always reign.”
The executive orders, among other things, will make EPA guidance documents more easily accessible while also creating a grievance procedure for small businesses and property owners to appeal violations they feel are improper. The order also instructs agencies to correspond directly with individuals and businesses so people looking to comply with the law “can learn how,” the White House said.
For the Trump Administration, Johnson – who was acknowledged by the president during the press conference – was a perfect example.
In 2014, the EPA wrote to Johnson claiming that a cow pond he had built on his property (and connected to a nearby creek) was in direct violation of the Clean Water Act, telling him he would be fined up to $37,500 for every day the pond was kept in place.
Johnson’s ensuing battle with the federal government – which culminated in a lawsuit against the EPA – caused a firestorm in the press, with write-ups from news outlets including the Star-Tribune and the New York Times.
Johnson eventually settled his lawsuit against the federal government, writing in a blog post following the ruling “this is a huge victory for us as well as private property owners across the country.” However, he noted he may not have won his case without the pro bono help of a law firm that stepped in to fight on his behalf.
“We won our case,” Johnson said at the White House on Wednesday. “But unlike other middle class Americans, that’s not the case. We could have never fought, the litigation was too, too expensive. So I would just like to thank the president today for signing this executive order, which will hold the EPA and other government agencies more responsible for their actions.”

Millionaires paying a lower tax rate than most

Texto completo: The results are in. The Trump tax cuts resulted in most families saving so little that majorities continue to insist they see no difference in their paychecks. But one very small group made out spectacularly.
According to figures put together by economists Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman, detailed in their soon-to-be-released book, “The Triumph of Injustice,” and reported in the New York Times on Monday, last year the 400 richest Americans “paid a lower total tax rate — spanning federal, state and local taxes - than any other income group.” One impact? Income inequality is at record levels while wealth inequality in the United States is approaching that of Third World countries.
This, however, is still not enough for the richest Americans. Like the starving Oliver Twist, they want some more. They continue to prioritize their wealthy-to-extremely-wealthy bottom line over our welfare and what we stand for as a country.
Even as President Donald Trump melts down in public, tramples long-standing alliances, destroys the integrity of our political and regulatory systems, denies the reality of climate change and inflicts cruelties on the poor and desperate on a seemingly daily basis, the big money remains most concerned about their own bottom lines and the possibility of either Sen. Bernie Sanders or Sen. Elizabeth Warren winning the Democratic presidential nomination.
One prominent Democratic donor toldhe would refuse to vote if Warren was the nominee going up against Trump. Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg claimed a Warren victory would be an “existential” crisis for the social media giant. Wall Streeters and corporate superstars rant about Sanders and Warren so much, they sound all but unhinged — billionaire private equity investor Stephen Schwarzman recently complained, “Maybe Bernie Sanders shouldn’t exist.”
Some of our complainers sound as if they stepped out of a Gilded Age satire. Wall Street Journal columnist John Stoll found yacht and boat manufacturers — already bleeding financially as a result of the Trump tariff wars — stumping for Trump because higher taxes could “slow demand for high-dollar boats.” (I’ll remember that while I’m pondering my soaring bills for health care, housing and my children’s college education.)
The reason is for these rants? Both Sanders and Warren are proposing not just significantly increased taxes on wealth, but crackdowns on big-money influence in politics and big-businesses power over all of us. On Monday morning alone, Sanders, still off the campaign trail while he recovers from a heart attack he suffered last week, called for banning all corporate contributions to funding the Democratic National Convention and presidential inauguration events, while limiting individual donations to $500 for the latter. As Sanders pointed out, Facebook and a number of other companies gave more than $1 million to the party’s 2016 convention.
As for Trump’s 2017 inauguration, it smashed records at $106 million. Also Monday morning, Warren released a plan to end financial conflicts of interest among the judiciary, a complement to other proposals to crack down on corporate lobbying and overall government and business corruption. Both senators have said they will crack down on private equity and break up Facebook.
Beginning in the 1980s, short-term shareholder value became the be-all and end-all, something that almost certainly not so coincidentally befitted the people in charge, who received the bulk of their ever increasing pay in that form. (Yes, Sanders has a plan to fight that, too.) That money allowed them an ever greater influence in our culture, economy and politics, celebrated as people of unique genius and insight. It’s a selfish, shortsighted way of thinking but one that’s been ascendant for the better part of 40 years. The result? Those Trump tax cuts.
While it’s understandable that someone with few or no dollars to spare will ponder which candidate is better for their personal finances, it’s reprehensible that this is the position of these wealthy whiners. They’ll be fine with less in their bank accounts or even one or two fewer zeros off their net worth statement. They can afford to think about the moral and long-range implications of their choice. What should concern them is a would-be strongman in the White House. Unstable, boastful, erratic ignorant rulers are not a sign of a country climbing to greater heights but of one descending to ever deeper depths.

Anthony Davis sprains thumb, Lakers look tired in loss to Nets in China

Texto completo: The start of the sequence was something fans had been craving for months: As Anthony Davis corralled a defensive rebound, he sent an outlet pass sailing past the halfcourt line to a streaking LeBron James.
James ran under the rim for the lay-up … and missed it. He got his own rebound … and missed again right under the hoop.
Multiple blown lay-ups on one play is unusual to see from the 34-year-old star, but then again, it’s been an unusual trip.
Fatigue was the predominant trait of the Lakers in Saturday’s 91-77 loss to the Brooklyn Nets, the second of two exhibition games played under fraught geopolitical circumstances in China. The weight of international travel, atypical drama and playing their second game in three nights seemed to slow the Lakers down in Shenzhen: They scored just 36 points in the first half, looking listless against a Nets team that didn’t even suit up its best player, Kyrie Irving.
The most relevant portion of the night ended with some discouraging news: Davis, who made his first start at center in the team’s third preseason game, sprained his right thumb on a block. The Lakers ended up pulling him after one quarter, setting him up on the bench with a fresh wrap, and the new franchise centerpiece finished with just 6 points on 2-for-7 shooting.
The Lakers announced after the game that Davis would undergo diagnostic testing upon his return to Los Angeles, joining Kyle Kuzma, Quinn Cook and Jared Dudley as players who have been laid up with ailments recently.
No one else picked up the slack. James also played just one quarter, finishing with four assists and six points on 2-for-7 shooting including his misses near the basket. While team sideline reporter Mike Trudell shared that James spent much of the second half interacting with Chinese fans – thawing some of the chill that had set in earlier in the week between the NBA and the host country – he did little on the court to sate them.
The role players that have sparked some intrigue early did little to help blunt the impact of the star power outage. Kentavious Caldwell-Pope and Avery Bradley combined for 25 points, but required 25 shot attempts. Rajon Rondo, who started for the second consecutive game, had no assists and four turnovers in 16 minutes. JaVale McGee stood out in the first two exhibitions – on Saturday, he had a much more down-to-earth performance (9 points, 3 rebounds, 2 blocks). As a team, the Lakers shot just 33 percent, including 5 for 32 from 3-point range.
The small lineup with Davis at center struggled to create offense, but the Nets also struggled to score as well. After one quarter, a buzzer-beating 3-pointer by Alex Caruso had kept the Brooklyn lead to just 20-19 in a rock fight. While Davis has famously wished to play less center, he was a brutally efficient rim protector, getting a pair of blocks despite his injury.
Caris LeVert (22 points) helped pull Brooklyn back in pole position, putting on a well-rounded display after missing most of Thursday’s 114-111 Nets win that provided much more suspense. Taurean Prince added 14 points.
The Lakers were to fly back immediately Saturday, scheduled to reach Los Angeles late Saturday night or early Sunday morning. While the NBA decided Friday to not make media available for the rest of the trip, it seemed safe to assume the Lakers and the league welcomed the end of a whirlwind week that started with a flurry of outrage over Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey tweeting in support of Hong Kong protests against the government.
The NBA has been under fire from both sides, as Chinese businesses pulled sponsorships and state-run television decided to blacklist the games. Back in the United States, the president was among the notable critics of the league for bowing to foreign interests. Shenzhen is just north of Hong Kong, giving rise to some concern that the Lakers’ second exhibition could have more tension than the first, but The New York Times reported that the Chinese government had asked the media and public to tone down the fiery rhetoric earlier in the week, soothing some of the angst.
The Lakers will play their first preseason game at Staples Center against the Golden State Warriors on Monday night. It’s unclear if any players will sit out on a short turnaround after a flight halfway across the globe.

Texto completo: These past few weeks we’ve been discussing “omissions” (you can decide whether these are errors or sins). As an estate planning attorney, I instantly think of “omitted heirs.” And you may think, “huh?”
An omitted heir is a person who would have inherited by law but was not mentioned in a will or trust. A related concept is “pretermitted heir”– someone who was born to, adopted by, or married to the deceased after the date of the will. Both situations have legal consequences, which may or may not have been intended.
Occasionally, I meet with a client who intends to disinherit a child. We always state that clearly and upfront in the will with a statement such as “I have intentionally not provided for my child Badly Behaving Bob and for all purposes hereunder he is to be treated as having predeceased me,” and sometimes we add “leaving no issue” if the client also wishes to disinherit any of Bob’s children (and let’s face it, if the behavior was bad enough those grandchildren could be sprinkled across the globe). This can make clients uncomfortable. But there is a reason for it.
California law
California provides that in the case of an omitted or pretermitted heir the heir will inherit an intestate share (what they would have received had there been no will at all) except in some specific circumstances. In other words, the law assumes you mean to provide for your children, with only a few exceptions, which are:
* The decedent’s failure to provide for the child was intentional and that intention appears from the testamentary instruments.
* The decedent had one or more children and devised or otherwise directed the disposition of substantially all the estate to the other parent of the omitted child.
* The decedent provided for the child by transfer outside of the estate, and the intention that the transfer be in lieu of a provision in said instruments is shown by statements of the decedent or by other evidence.
California law also provides that if at the time the decedent executed the estate plan they failed to provide for a child solely because they were unaware of the child or believed the child was deceased, the child will be entitled to take a share of the decedent’s estate.
Thus, documenting your wishes and intentions becomes important in these situations. And disclosing to your attorney any children, stepchildren, adopted children, or possible children you may have is also extremely important.
Celebrity omissions
Remember when actor Heath Ledger died, leaving behind 2-year-old Matilda, his daughter with Michelle Williams? Ledger’s will pre-dated Matilda’s birth by several years and left everything to his sisters and parents.
His will was signed when his assets were estimated at just above $100,000. When he died, his net worth was said to be more than $16 million. Luckily for Matilda, Ledger’s family agreed to give it all to her and no court battle ensued. Ledger was an Australian citizen; in California, the pretermitted heir law would have given the estate to Matilda anyway, but with a greedier family, a long court battle would have likely ensued.
The family of Michael Crichton, creator of Jurassic Park and ER, was not so lucky. At the time of his death in 2008, he was 66 years old and left behind four ex-wives, a 20-year-old daughter, and a new wife who was six months pregnant.
Crichton executed a will and trust in 2007 and specifically stated, “I have intentionally made no provision in this will for any of my heirs or relatives who are not herein mentioned or designated, and I hereby generally and specifically disinherit every person claiming to be or who may be determined to be my heir-at-law, except as otherwise mentioned in this will.”
If Crichton had updated his estate plan when he learned his wife was expecting, a protracted battle between his daughter (who thought that provision should apply to disinherit her half-brother) and the mother of his son (who had a prenup but fought on behalf of her son) could have been avoided. The court eventually ruled that Crichton’s son was entitled to one-third of his estate as a pretermitted heir since his son was not conceived or known of at the time the will was executed.
Crichton’s $100 million art collection soon went to auction at Christie’s to begin making distributions (and paying legal fees, no doubt).
When is a child not a child?
It is equally important to name those who may not be considered “children” by law. It’s not uncommon for a child to take the last name of a stepfather so that mom, stepdad and child all had the same name and to the world at large they were a family. This is particularly true if biological dad is not part of the child’s life.
But if stepdad did not legally adopt the child, the child will not be a legal heir. The stepdad would need to specifically state that he intended to treat the child as his own.
You forgot you were married?
The laws are similar for omitted spouses. When a testamentary document is executed before a marriage and does not mention the spouse, the surviving spouse will be considered a pretermitted heir entitled to all the community property and a share of separate property.
No contest
If you do intend to disinherit a child or a spouse, you will need to carefully state as much in clear language in your will or trust.
In some circumstances, however, you may want to consider a gift to that person instead. I know that sounds nuts, but hear me out. Most folks are aware of the “no-contest” provisions in testamentary documents — that’s the clause that says “if anyone contests this document, they inherit nothing.”
If you’ve completely disinherited someone, they have nothing to lose by contesting your plan. Instead, if you’ve given them a gift at least they have the loss of that gift to consider.
Let me not omit the best advice of all — implement and regularly review your estate plan.

Is Ohio still a major battleground state?

Texto completo: COLUMBUS, Ohio - By picking Ohio to host the upcoming Oct. 15 Democratic presidential debate, national Democrats are sending a message they still view the state as a top-tier battleground, according to Ohio Democrats.
But is it true?
National Democrats have debated how much they should focus on Ohio ever since the 2016 election, when Donald Trump won here by 8 points while narrowly winning three nearby states - Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin - that propelled him to the White House.
Exhibit A: an interview Michael Halle, the campaign manager for 2018 Democratic governor candidate Richard Cordray, gave shortly after Cordray lost the election in what was a banner year for Democrats elsewhere. Halle, who now works for South Bend Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg’s presidential campaign, told the New York Times that his party might be better off focusing on other states, like Arizona and Georgia.
“It’s kind of scary, because Ohio and Iowa are two states that Obama won in both his presidential campaigns, and now they’re just not competitive in the way they once were,” he said. “We are at a place where we need to expand the map.”
Halle got grief from within Ohio Democratic circles over his comments. But his argument reflects what’s increasingly becoming conventional wisdom within his party: Ohio, with a major bloc of white, blue-collar voters who are turning away from the Democratic Party, and a fragmented media market that makes it more expensive to advertise here than in other states, is no longer the top-tier swing state it once was.
But one person making the case for Ohio is someone with a vested interest in the issue. Ohio Democratic Party Chairman David Pepper has argued Ohio can serve to distract Trump from Midwestern states that were closer in 2016, like Wisconsin and Pennsylvania.
“Look at where they’ve been - Florida, Texas, Michigan,” Pepper said, naming three electorally significant states that hosted the three previous Democratic debates. “People are going to argue about does it move voters, but the fact that they put the debate here, that’s a very clear statement by the DNC about which states they view as battleground states.”
If you want to understand Pepper’s argument, consider Trump’s frequent presence here since he was elected. Trump’s visited six times in 2019, most recently in Wapakoneta in September. A leading pro-Trump Super PAC in May listed Ohio among its priority states, something equivalent groups on the Democratic side haven’t all done.
“Having a debate here is a good way to force Trump to defend a much bigger map, versus signaling to him just go to Wisconsin, and don’t worry about these other states,” Pepper said.
Dayton Mayor Nan Whaley, a prominent Ohio Democrat, said Ohio likely won’t be the white-hot political center that it’s been in past elections.
But she said Sen. Sherrod Brown’s re-election in 2018 shows there is a path for a Democrat to win in Ohio. And current polling in Ohio - as spotty as it’s been here recently - has suggested weaknesses in Trump’s support.
“If the Democrats abdicate Ohio, that’s a big win for the Republicans,” she said. “While we don’t need this state as Democrats, Republicans must have this state, so it’s a battlefield that’s worth fighting on.”
While they’re spending much more time in early-primary states, Democratic 2020 contenders also have staked out a presence here. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders in April visited Lordstown, the site of the shuttered General Motors factory. California Sen. Kamala Harris, who stopped in Ohio as part of the 2018 fundraising circuit, spoke at a state party dinner in March. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren visited Columbus and Chillicothe in March and Toledo in July. Former Congressman Beto O’Rourke stopped in Dayton, Columbus, Kent and Lordstown last month after visiting Cleveland earlier in the year. And former Vice President Joe Biden is visiting later this month, his campaign announced this week.\u200b
But Matt Borges, a former chairman of the Ohio Republican Party, says Ohio is unlikely to be in play in 2020. That’s despite Trump winning only roughly one-third of the vote in Franklin County, which includes Columbus, in 2016, a similar number to what Trump got in deep-blue Massachusetts. He made up for it by overperforming in all other types of counties across the state, especially in Eastern Ohio.
“Even having the largest county in the state being essentially Massachusetts, he still carried Ohio by 8 points,” Borges said. “It’s a willing trade Republicans are now making. What we’ve given up in the suburbs to gain support in rural and exurban areas for Trump and Republicans generally, that math has worked here.”
Kyle Kondik, an Ohio native who’s now a political analyst at the University of Virginia, said Westerville, the Columbus suburb that’s hosting the debate, is the type of place where Democrats likely will need to do well if they want to beat Trump.
“From that standpoint, I think there’s some sort of electoral calculation about having a debate there, or at least wanting to have a strong presence for the party in that part of the state. I don’t think it makes a difference, but the parties only have so many cards they can play,” he said.
Kondik said he thinks Trump will win Ohio in 2020, given his performance in 2016.
“But the president does seem to pay the state a lot of attention, which maybe suggests they don’t see it as 100% in the bag,” he said.

Texto completo: Week three of the House Democrats' impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump has wrapped - and so much happened.
It included a number of dramatic moments, from efforts by the White House to block progress in the investigation, to a marathon testimony from the former ambassador to the Ukraine and, of course, some choice words.
Central to the impeachment probe is whether Trump used the threat of withholding military aid to pressure Ukraine's leader to conduct an investigation into Trump's 2020 rival Joe Biden. That's the allegation that came out of an anonymous whistleblower complaint, which Trump accused of being partisan this week.
While Congress was still technically on recess this week, key developments took place. Here's what happened:
Giuliani associates, witnesses in probe, arrested
On Wednesday evening, two Ukrainian-born businessmen and associates of Trump's lawyer Rudy Giuliani were arrested on campaign finance charges.
Igor Fruman and Lev Parnas helped Giuliani meet with a Ukrainian prosecutor as part of Giuliani's involvement with the push for Ukraine to investigate Biden. They were both scheduled to appear before Congress this week, but were arrested shortly before their slotted appearances. The two were then subpoenaed by House Democrats to testify.
Federal authorities said the businessmen's campaign contributions “conspired to circumvent the federal laws against foreign influence by engaging in a scheme to funnel foreign money to candidates for federal and state office so that the defendants could buy potential influence with candidates, campaigns and the candidates’ governments. "
The two were mega donors to Republican campaigns.
On Friday, The New York Times reported Giuliani is under investigation by federal prosecutors for his dealings in Ukraine.

White House ramps up opposition to the inquiry
The administration is refusing to comply with requests for documents and witnesses related to the Ukraine scandal, the White House said on Tuesday, calling it a "partisan inquiry. "
Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. , said in response that the White House's actions may be considered evidence of obstruction.
A key figure in the Ukraine controversy, Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland, was scheduled to appear before Congress on Tuesday, but the State Department blocked him from testifying at the last minute. So, House Democrats subpoenaed him.
I would love to send Ambassador Sondland, a really good man and great American, to testify, but unfortunately he would be testifying before a totally compromised kangaroo court, where Republican’s rights have been taken away, and true facts are not allowed out for the public. . . .

Sondland said Friday he will testify Thursday instead, an effort to comply with the House subpoena.
Democrats are interested in text messages he is believed to have on his personal phone, some of which were revealed after Kurt Volker's closed-door testimony last week.
"Are we now saying that security assistance and WH meeting are conditioned on investigations?" Top Ukraine diplomat Bill Taylor asked in a text message to Volker and Sondland on Sept. 1.
"Call me," Sondland texted back.

Ousted Ukraine ambassador appears before Congress
Former Ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch, testified on Friday in a 10-hour session before Congress that Trump "pressured" the State Department to remove her from her post in a "concerted campaign" against her.
Yovanovitch appeared despite a State Department direction not to testify.
"We need to rebuild diplomacy as the first resort to advance America’s interests and the front line of America’s defense," she said in her opening statement. "I fear that not doing so will harm our nation’s interest, perhaps irreparably. "

Trump and Biden escalate rhetoric
In campaign stops this week, Trump dished out new rally material targeting the Bidens and top Democrats involved in the impeachment probe.
"They want to erase your vote like it never existed. They want to erase your voice and they want to erase your future. But they will fail because in America the people rule again," Trump said in Minnesota on Thursday.
And Biden has for the first time stated strongly that he is in favor of Trump's impeachment. In the past, his comments on impeachmient have been conditional on failure to cooperate with the inquiry.

What's next on the impeachment agenda?
Next week, Congress officially returns from its two-week recess, and has a slew of depositions and subpoena deadlines on the agenda.
Another Giuliani associate, Semyon Kislin, is scheduled to be deposed on Monday. Also on Monday is the deadline for Sondland to produce documents in response to the subpoena. Fiona Hill, a former Trump adviser on Russia, is also scheduled for a deposition Monday.
Giuliani and Vice President Mike Pence have deadlines to produce documents coming up next week, but both have indicated they will not comply.

'No Meaningful Drop-Off' In Cases of Vaping Illness

Texto completo: Health officials say the flu season may complicate diagnosis of the lung damage from vaping, masking symptoms.
As illnesses and deaths linked to vaping continue to rise, health experts on Friday updated their advice to doctors on how best to recognize symptoms and treat patients, and warned that the start of the flu season would make it harder to arrive at the right diagnosis.
"I can't stress enough the seriousness of these lung injuries associated with e-cigarettes or vaping products," Dr. Anne Schuchat, principal deputy director of the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said at a news briefing. "We are not seeing a meaningful drop-off in new cases, and unfortunately many more people have been hospitalized with lung injury each week."
A new concern has come to light. She said a handful of patients, fewer than five, were hospitalized for vaping illness, recovered and went home, and then wound up back in the hospital again, from five to 55 days later. The reason is not yet known, she said. One possibility is that the patients may have started vaping again.
Dr. Schuchat said those cases highlight the importance of follow-up for patients who have been treated for vaping-related illnesses. The C.D.C. says they should see doctors no later than a week or two after leaving the hospital, and some may need referrals for counseling for marijuana use disorder, a form of dependence.
Of the 1,299 cases reported to the C.D.C. since mid-August, 70 percent of the patients are male, and 80 percent are under 35 years old. The majority, 76 percent, have vaped THC, the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana, and many have also used nicotine. Twenty-nine deaths have been reported. Only Alaska has no reported cases.
The cause of the illnesses is not known, and the C.D.C. says no vaping products can be considered safe. Dr. Schuchat said there might turn out to be more than one cause, and it might take months to find the answer.
Health officials have given the illness a formal name, "e-cigarette, or vaping, product use associated lung injury," or Evali.
The start of the flu season may make it harder to diagnose cases, because some symptoms of lung damage from vaping -- cough, shortness of breath, fever -- can mimic those of influenza. The C.D.C. recommends testing patients with those symptoms for flu and other respiratory infections, but it is possible for patients to have both a lung injury from vaping and the flu or some other viral or bacterial ailment affecting their lungs.
Many patients with vaping illness also have stomach pain, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea, and it is important to ask people with those symptoms about vaping.
Doctors should "strongly consider" admitting patients to the hospital if they have become ill after vaping and are short of breath, have underlying illnesses that could affect their lungs or their blood oxygen level is less than 95 percent, the C.D.C. said. That level, called oxygen saturation, can be measured with a device clipped to the fingertip, the agency said in its Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, published on Friday.
The report also said that some patients who initially had mild symptoms then deteriorated rapidly within 48 hours. And many patients who ended up in the hospital had previously been sent home after seeking help at emergency rooms or clinics.
Because the vaping illnesses often involve severe inflammation in the lungs, many patients have been treated with corticosteroid drugs. But the report said it was not known whether the drugs really helped or whether the patients might have recovered on their own. And corticosteroids can increase the risk of infection.
The report says that "in some circumstances," it might be best to avoid corticosteroids in patients who are being tested for illnesses like fungal pneumonia, which could worsen with the drugs. But the report also says that in patients who are severely ill, it may be necessary to give them corticosteroids along with other drugs to fight infection.
Patients who have had high doses of corticosteroids may need to see a specialist in endocrinology to help minimize or manage the side effects.
Patients older than 50 who become ill after vaping tend to be sicker than younger ones: more likely to need ventilators and to stay longer in the hospital. These older patients may need special consideration, the report said, adding that a quick diagnosis, treatment with steroids and consultation with specialists in pulmonary and critical care "might be lifesaving in this patient population."
Dr. Ned Sharpless, acting commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, said his agency had received more than 700 samples of vaping products for testing. So far, the cause of the outbreak has not been identified. The tests have found varying levels of THC and nicotine in different products, and some of the THC products also contain vitamin E acetate, which some sellers use to dilute the THC.

Texto completo: Hong Kong's protests have disrupted Yang Yang's family life. Though the 29-year-old lives in mainland China, he was inspired by the demonstrations to write a song about freedom and upload it to the internet. When censors deleted it, he complained to his family.
They weren't sympathetic. "How can you support Hong Kong separatists?" they asked. "How can you be anti-China?" His mother threatened to disown him. Before Mr. Yang left on a trip to Japan in August, his father said he hoped his son would die there.
Hong Kong's protests have inflamed tensions in the semiautonomous Chinese city, but passions in the mainland have been just as heated -- and, seemingly, almost exclusively against the demonstrators.
A pro-protest tweet by a Houston Rockets executive, Daryl Morey, ignited a firestorm of anger against the N.B.A., demonstrating the depth of feeling. Joe Tsai, the only N.B.A. owner of Chinese descent, said all of China -- yes, more than one billion people -- felt the same way.
"The one thing that is terribly misunderstood, and often ignored, by the western press and those critical of China is that 1.4 billion Chinese citizens stand united when it comes to the territorial integrity of China and the country's sovereignty over her homeland," he wrote. "This issue is non-negotiable."
For Westerners, this is strange language. You don't hear about the common feelings of 300 million Americans or 60 million Brits, especially in the era of Donald Trump and Brexit.
Yet, in China, there is some truth to it. Of course, it's a vast country brimming with opinions. But the Communist Party has spent decades preparing the Chinese people for a moment like this. The stir over Hong Kong shows, in dramatic fashion, how successful it has been, and how the world could be shaped by it.
"As soon as the Communist Party pushes the patriotism button, Chinese will rise up like zombies to unite against the foreign forces, be it Japan or N.B.A.," said Mr. Yang, the singer-songwriter. "They don't always know why they're against those things. In fact, many Chinese like Japan and the N.B.A."
Until Thursday, when China's internet minders dialed down the passions, the Chinese online world was filled with denunciations of the protests. Some Chinese people have even scaled the Great Firewall, China's highly effective online censorship system, to post anti-protest messages on services like Facebook and Instagram that their own government doesn't want them to see.
Their comments reflect a narrative that China's top-down education system delivers from a young age. A united China, a country with a common purpose, can stand strong against outsiders, according to this narrative. A divided China could slip backward, losing decades of progress and plunging the country back into chaos.
Any Chinese person who has gone to elementary school or watched television news can explain the tale of China's 100 years of humiliation. Starting with the Opium Wars in the 19th century, foreign powers bullied a weak and backward China into turning Hong Kong and Macau into European colonies. Students must memorize the unequal treaties the Qing dynasty signed during that period.
There's even a name for it: "national humiliation education."
This narrative glosses over a lot of history, including the cruelty of Mao's revolution, the starving of millions during Mao's Great Leap Forward and the madness of his decade-long Cultural Revolution. When it does include the 1989 crackdown on protesters in Tiananmen Square, the protest and its aftermath is mentioned in one sentence and portrayed vaguely as a political incident.
These lessons and propaganda sound crude, but they work. For years, I regarded Chris Patten, the last Hong Kong governor under the British rule, as "a sinner condemned by history." That's what state media called him, especially after he approved spending heavily to build Hong Kong's new airport, leading to accusations of waste. Today, I regularly use that airport, a marvel of modern transportation, as do millions of others.
Of course, my friends and I watched with great pride Hong Kong's handover ceremony from Britain to China in 1997. Territorial integrity achieved!
At the graduate school of journalism at Columbia University in 2002, one American student told me about his trip to Tibet. I was so incensed by his remarks that I blurted out, "Tibet is part of China!"
For Westerners, perhaps one way to understand would be to read "Educated," a memoir by Tara Westover about escaping her survivalist Mormon family in the mountains of Idaho. It has nothing to do with China. But her struggle to unlearn what her parents taught her felt familiar to me after I left China and began to learn its history on my own.
The rise of the internet and China's opening were supposed to widen views there. Instead, the party is narrowing them more. Education officials over the past two years have been increasingly enforcing a widely ignored 2004 effort to make education even more Chinese focused.
In some middle school history books, the Cultural Revolution is described as "a detour in the Communist Party's expedition," rather than as a mistake. Some universities have replaced textbooks by Western academics such as Milton Friedman and N. Gregory Mankiw with books written under a program called "Marxist theory research and building project."
Textbook publishers have cut back on essays by Lu Xun, a writer known for his acerbic criticism of the nationalist government in the 1920s and 1930s. They were once a mainstay of school texts, but some Chinese people have used his articles to criticize current events. One, about how Chinese people should welcome criticism from foreigners, was posted on the social media platform Weibo this past week after the N.B.A. debacle, then was pulled down.
Already, China has become more effective at delivering its message to its people. Slogans that I learned without much conviction more than 30 years ago -- like "Without the Communist Party, there would be no China" -- are making a comeback.
These lessons might seem removed from the situation in Hong Kong, where the protesters are mainly Chinese, not foreigners. But state media has portrayed the protests as foreign driven, sometimes identifying Western bystanders and journalists -- including one working for The New York Times -- as American instigators.
State media also portrays the protests as a push for Hong Kong independence from China, a direct effort to tap into those feelings of territorial integrity. That thought has echoed. Mr. Tsai, the N.B.A. owner, called the protests "a separatist movement."
But only a fringe group of protesters support full independence from the mainland. The five core demands of the protesters don't include it. It's an important distinction, one that Mr. Tsai's newspaper -- The South China Morning Post, owned by Alibaba, the Chinese e-commerce giant where Mr. Tsai is executive vice chairman -- is careful to make.
For China, the big danger is that it will become even more intolerant of criticism and different opinions.
A Chinese blogger wrote this week that a renovation project at a top Beijing middle school was causing widespread health issues, giving students bloody noses several times a day. The reaction was strong, and strongly against him. Many students told him there was nothing wrong with their school and even if there was, it was none of his business. "He should have shut his mouth just like N.B.A.'s Morey," wrote one commenter.
Mr. Yang, the singer-songwriter, said "all hell broke loose" after his family and members of his band learned that he supported the Hong Kong protests. His younger brother told him he was sick in his mind. Former classmates castigated him online.
"The Hong Kong protests have definitely made them a lot more patriotic," he said.
Over the years, he had tried to show people around him the videos of the Tiananmen Square crackdown and other events. His family told him that he should look at the brighter side of the history. The party has since provided education, jobs and pensions, they said.
"I feel as alone as an island," he said. "I'm surrounded by very familiar strangers."

Texto completo: ST. PETERSBURG  A historic building and a parking lot in the heart of St. Petersburgs thriving Edge District have been bought for $13 million by a South Florida firm that plans to redevelop the site.

No details have been announced, but the property on Central Avenue between 11th and 13th Streets could be eligible for tax breaks as an opportunity zone  an investment vehicle created under the 2017 federal tax overhaul to provide incentives for investing in low-income areas. Qualifying projects can include hotels and other developments that create jobs.

As part of the transaction, Miamis PTM Partners purchased a nearly century-old building now home to Furnish Me Vintage, a popular store that specializes in mid-century furniture, retro artwork and vintage records. The stores owners could not immediately be reached but have indicated in the past that they would find another location.

The sale price also includes the large parking lot next door and two smaller parcels.

As of now, were not commenting outside of the sale announcement as plans are not final, said Thiago Viana, a PTM spokesperson. Once we can offer more color, we will be sure to reach out to you.

The seller was Tricera Eastman LLC, a partnership between Miamis Tricera Capital and

St. Petersburg developer Jonathan Daou. Tricera and Daou both own several properties in and around the Edge District.

Daou said Thursday that he and Tricera will be minor partners and invest part of their $13 million proceeds in the redevelopment of the site.

The three-story building will be preserved and likely repositioned for local businesses, Daou said. That was part of our sale agreement, that the building would be used again.

Dating to 1926, the building was in the citys Gas Plant District, an historically African-American neighborhood named for two gas towers that once stood on the site that is now Tropicana Field. Still called the Gas Plant Building, it has served as a chicken slaughterhouse  I heard they used to throw chicken necks out the windows, Daou said  an antique mall and most recently, Furnish Me Vintage.

Store owners Todd Wilson and Jackie Williams started what became one of the nations leading dealers in mid-century furniture in their garage in 2010. They bought the Gas Plant Building in 2014 for $1.2 million and sold it last year to Tricera Eastman for $3.4 million.

Although it is a trendy area of restaurants and shops, the Edge District was designated one of Tampas Bay areas 67 opportunity zones, where investors in projects that help low-income residents could reap substantial breaks on capital-gains taxes. While the Tampa Bay Rays were considering a move to Tampa, Ybor City was designated an opportunity zone so stadium construction could have been financed in part by money from investors seeking the tax breaks.

Michael Tilman, chief executive of PTM Partners, told the New York Times in May that his company had an opportunity zone site under contract in St. Petersburg  the one just purchased  and already was working on multi-family housing developments in Miami and a former FBI office building in Washington, D.C.

The goal with opportunity zone projects is to select markets where long-term growth factors are present or in some areas they have already commenced, he said at the time.

Herrera Beutler calls for impeachment vote

Texto completo: Amanda Cowan/The Columbian
U.S. Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler, R-Battle Ground, speaks to members of The Columbian's Editorial Board on Wednesday

U.S. Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler, R-Battle Ground, has said the U.S. House of Representatives should hold a formal impeachment vote in order to grant bipartisan legitimacy to the investigation of President Donald Trump and grant House Republicans subpoena power.
But in a conversation with The Columbian's Editorial Board on Wednesday, the congresswoman said she disagrees with the White House's current strategy to stonewall the House's investigation altogether.
She said she understands the president's unwillingness to participate in a process many perceive as partisan, however.
“I see the point, when one party is saying the other party doesn't get to be part of the investigation. You start to wonder if this is going to be a fair investigation,” Herrera Beutler said.
Despite broad support among House Democrats to formally launch an impeachment inquiry, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has held off on holding a vote — likely to protect 31 House Democrats in vulnerable swing districts where Trump remains popular, Herrera Beutler said.
But Herrera Beutler said the vote is a necessary step. She pointed to the impeachment proceedings surrounding former President Bill Clinton, when the House granted subpoena power to Democrats and Republicans in opening a formal impeachment inquiry.
That's crucial for public perception of legitimacy, Herrera Beutler said. It's the difference between “partisan impeachment” and a “bipartisan investigation.”
“That has to happen here,” Herrera Beutler said. “Otherwise the president's going to have — in the minds of the American public — he's going to have the right to say, ‘that's a total witch hunt.' If they (Democrats) really believe they can prove it, then why not let us subpoena people?”
Herrera Beutler did not specify how she would vote if a bill opening a formal impeachment inquiry came to the House floor.
A “yes” vote would mark a major departure from her party; no other Republican member of Congress has said they'd support an official impeachment inquiry, according to a running list from The New York Times.
Herrera Beutler also repeated her previous assertion that she's seen no proof of a “quid pro quo,” or that the president withheld $400 million in aid in exchange for political favors during a phone call with the president of Ukraine.
Until that can be proved, Herrera Beutler said, she wouldn't support removing Trump from office.
“Do I think the president had an appropriate conversation? No. Do I think that was wise? No. But I don't think that's a high enough bar for impeachment,” Herrera Beutler said.
“It's not about Donald Trump. It's not about me. It's not about who's in charge of the House. This is about our entire institution and how our democracy functions. And unless someone's going to be the adults and do it the right way, we're going to make it worse.”
In her hourlong conversation with The Columbian's Editorial Board, Herrera Beutler touched on several topics in addition to an impeachment inquiry. The congresswoman also discussed her recent spate of bills focused on health and child care, as well as tax policy and transportation.
Health and child care
Herrera Beutler touched on her legislative priorities over the last year, which included introducing or cosponsoring several pieces of legislation centered on maternity and child care.
Her ACE Kids Act, which would help make it easier for children with complex medical conditions to seek care across state lines, was signed into law in April. She cosponsored the Midwives for Maximizing Optimal Maternity Services Act, which allocates $35 million to midwife education, as well as a bill that would attempt to standardize newborn screening across states.
“We've seen some real progress on the maternal mortality front,” Herrera Beutler said.
Herrera Beutler also mentioned her Child Care Workforce and Facilities Act, which would allocate $100 million to help states increase the number of child care facilities and workers. The bill was introduced in March.
“We're what they call a child care desert,” Herrera Beutler said. “There aren't enough actual buildings, and there aren't enough qualified child care providers.”
Employment, tax policy and the deficit
Herrera Beutler defended the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which decreased taxes for individuals and families and slashed the top corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent.
The result, she said, is a booming economy.
“I was excited to see the poverty level has decreased to the lowest number in almost 20 years. Real wages and disposable income is up 3.4 percent over last year,” Herrera Beutler said.
“Because we're letting people, individuals, spend more of what they earn, and what we see is they're putting it into the economy.”
The cuts are also contributing to a ballooning national deficit, she acknowledged. The country is in the hole $954 billion for this year alone; total national debt is now above $22 trillion, expected to reach $28.7 trillion over the next decade.
She said the current tax policy is preferable to that under President Barack Obama, when employment and economic growth tanked under the Great Recession. It amounts to a difference in how she and the Obama administration view the role of government and taxes, she said.
“I'm not saying it's the only way to grow the economy, I'm not saying it's perfect, I'm not saying the Republicans have a corner on how to move things forward. But what we were doing wasn't working,” Herrera Beutler said. “If (cutting taxes) stops working, I'm not wed to any policy.”
On priorities (and Twitter)
When working with any president, Herrera Beutler said she tries to stay focused on legislative priorities. That was true under Obama, she added, and it's true now.
“I tried to keep it within the jurisdiction of my job, keep it about the policies, (whether they) benefit or hurt the people I serve. I try to take that same tack with this president. At times, it's more challenging,” Herrera Beutler said.
She doesn't always agree with the current president's use of his Twitter account, especially when he quoted a Fox News guest last week who said removing Trump from office “will cause a Civil War-like fracture in this Nation from which our Country will never heal.”
“This talk about a civil war just angers me, because I think it's ridiculous,” Herrera Beutler said. “I think it's irresponsible. How is that helpful for anybody?”
But Washington's 3rd Congressional District voted for Trump in 2016 by a comfortable margin, she added, and her job is to represent the district.
“I also think people knew pretty well, warts and all, who Donald Trump was when they voted for him, and I respect where their vote is,” she added.
“I have my opinions. That's not my job.”
The I-5 Bridge
Before wrapping up the interview, Herrera Beutler gave her two cents on what it would take to rebuild the Interstate 5 Bridge.
Ultimately, any progress will depend on the ability of state and local lawmakers to reach a consensus, she said.
“I also believe we need to add congestion relief to that project, because that's what most of us deal with when we cross the bridge,” Herrera Beutler said.
She's not a proponent of light rail. By the time a light rail project is paid off, the technology has become obsolete, Herrera Beutler said. She'd be more supportive of a bus rapid transit link connecting to Portland's light rail system.
The congresswoman is also a proponent of a potential reversible lane on the bridge — a lane that would open to southbound commuters in the morning, and northbound commuters in the evening.

Texto completo: Tuesday night's Democratic debate will feature the largest group of presidential candidates in one debate in American history.
A dozen candidates will be spread out on the same stage in Ohio, fighting for a few sentences without interruption.
Yes, it's going to be a circus.
But for good reason. For many on the stage, it could be their last high-profile television appearance.
Meanwhile, there are seven other Democrats running for their party's nod who didn't even make the cut.
If you tune in to the CNN/New York Times debate, here are five dynamics to watch:
So. Many. Candidates.
No one is quite sure how this debate will work given the sheer number of human beings on the stage. CNN and the Times had the option of splitting up the candidates over two nights but demurred.
Still,there probably won't be that much of a noticeable difference for the viewers at home. The front-runners — Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, and former vice president Joe Biden — will probably get a disproportionate amount of the time. The others will try to catch a moderator's eye, hoping to get in a rebuttal or attack.
Like in the previous debates this year, there probably won't be much back and forth, with just a few substantial exchanges over the course of a few hours. Structurally, this will be more of a showcase of some of the candidates running. But keeping to the time cues will be something that will probably be more closely watched than in the past.
Warren, the new front-runner
This week, Warren officially became the front-runner in polling nationally and in the early presidential primary states, taking the top spot from Biden in the Real Clear Politics polling average. With the new status comes a new debate dynamic we haven't seen before: attacks aimed at Warren.
We have seen some previews over the past week of what that might look like. South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg suggested she was more concerned with fighting and he was more concerned with outcomes.
Biden didn't mention Warren by name but told voters this week, “We are not electing a planner." He was suggesting that Warren, she of many policy plans, does not have the same record of accomplishment.
So far, Warren has had the most consistently good debate performances, but this time, she'll face a new challenge and a new dynamic.
Can Harris turn it around?
As Warren has gone up in the polls, Senator Kamala Harris of California has sunk. A national Quinnipiac poll this week put her at 3 percent, tied with entrepreneur Andrew Yang. While she has qualified for the November debate, she is almost out of contention for a lot of voters and donors.
To be sure, Harris knows this is a big moment for her campaign. She shook up her campaign staff, and she has vowed to essentially move her White House bid to Iowa. Harris had her best moment on the campaign during the first debate this summer. She has not had the magic since.
Tom Steyer's first debate
California billionaire Tom Steyer will make his first debate appearance Tuesday. He was a late entry into the contest and has pledged to spend $100 million — that's $100,000,000! — on the race. So far, that fortune has bought television ads that helped him get to the necessary polling threshold. It's less clear what his pitch to voters will be. He was once singularly focused on the environment before he was singularly focused on impeachment. How will he introduce himself to voters this time?
Others' last debate
Four of the candidates on the stage have not qualified for November's debate, which has higher donor and polling thresholds: former secretary of housing and urban development Julian Castro, former US representative Beto O'Rourke, Senator Amy Klobuchar, and Representative Tulsi Gabbard. They will have every incentive to craft the debate performance of their lives, hoping that poll numbers improve before the end-of-the-month cut-off.

Texto completo: "Fight for freedom. Stand with Hong Kong."
Daryl Morey, the general manager of the Houston Rockets, tweeted that message on Friday (Oct. 4). It's a sentiment that should command broad support in the United States, and throughout the free world.
But the reaction from China, which does not number free expression among its cherished values, was swift and painful for the N.B.A. The shoe company Li Ning and the Shanghai Pudong Development Bank ended sponsorship deals with the Rockets; Chinese broadcasters said they would not show Rockets games; the Chinese Basketball Association — led by the former Rockets star Yao Ming — suspended ties with the team.
"There is no doubt, the economic impact is already clear," said Adam Silver, the league's commissioner.
Mr. Silver went on to add that he supported Mr. Morey, but "what I am supporting is his freedom of political expression in this situation."
The billionaires who control the lucrative basketball league, however, nearly tripped over themselves in their haste to abjure Mr. Morey's remarks. The N.B.A., like many large American businesses, is besotted by the opportunity to make money in China's expanding market. And the league once again made clear it is willing to obey China's rules to preserve that chance.
The owner of the Rockets, Tilman Fertitta, raced for the traditional refuge of international capitalists — the insistence that business can be segregated from political considerations. "We're here to play basketball and not to offend anybody," Mr. Fertitta told ESPN.
But it should be perfectly clear that playing basketball in China is political.
Last year, the N.B.A. staged a game in South Africa for the explicit purpose of celebrating the life of Nelson Mandela. When the N.B.A. goes to China, that's a statement, too.
It means that the N.B.A. has weighed China's human rights abuses against China's potential as a source of revenue, and it has decided that it can live with state policies like the detention of hundreds of thousands of Chinese Muslims in the northwestern province of Xinjiang.
The face of the Rockets, the point guard James Harden, issued a public apology on Monday.
"We apologize," he said.
For what, exactly, remained unclear.
The N.B.A. has an undoubted right to set rules for its workforce, but it cannot simultaneously claim to champion free expression — the value of which consists entirely in the right to say what others don't want to hear.
American executives and policymakers initially reconciled themselves to following China's rules by arguing that China's turn toward capitalism, and its exposure to the United States, would gradually lead toward democracy and a greater respect for human rights. They argued, in effect, that silence was the most productive form of criticism.
It should now be clear that silence is merely complicity, no more or less.
It is the moral price the N.B.A. and other businesses are paying for making money in China.

Texto completo: Fans of Leigh Bardugo's young adult work will recognize her artistic prose, cutting and witty characters and dark fantasy world building in her first adult novel, "Ninth House" (Flatiron, 480 pp., ***1/2).
Bardugo is an acclaimed fantasy novelist, whose YA work "Shadow and Bone" is being adapted into a highly anticipated Netflix series. Those not familiar with Bardugo, or even YA literature, still will be delighted by this dark novel.
Set on the campus of Yale, "Ninth House" imagines that the school's secret societies are no longer just boys clubs but groups that create dark magic to manipulate stock markets and The New York Times bestseller list, see into the future and more. Alex Stern is a freshman when she enters Yale's dangerous Lethe House, one of nine secret societies that practice magic; it polices the other houses on campus.
Alex is not another privileged student from a wealthy or even middle-class family. In fact, Alex would have never entered Lethe House or even stepped into the Ivy League world if not for the fact that she can see ghosts, or "Greys," as they are called. If anything, Alex would have been another victim of the opioid epidemic if the members of Lethe had never found her in the hospital and invited her to Yale.
She is mentored by Darlington, a upperclassman who trains Alex in the dark arts until he mysteriously disappears at the end of her first semester. If that wasn't bad enough, just as the spring semester starts, a young lower-income woman from New Haven, Connecticut, is discovered dead on campus. As part of Lethe House, Alex must investigate whether the murder and disappearance of Darlington have anything to do with the magic that lurks on campus.
"Ninth House" is as much a fantasy murder-mystery as it is an exploration of white privilege, corruption, misogyny and trauma. Bardugo highlights the vast gap between the lower-income neighborhoods that surround the campus and the toxic wealth hoarding of the school's most privileged students. New Haven itself is a character in the novel, one that never willingly bends to magic or wealth even as it drastically changes through gentrification.
The novel alternates between Alex's and Darlington's perspectives from the first semester to the second in Alex's first year. As Alex sees the opportunity of a safe, more stable life for herself, she might have to trade it all for the truth.
"Ninth House" sometimes loses its characters' voices in the dense plot. The theme of privilege is so interwoven throughout the story that the book challenges readers to examine their own environment without being overtly on the nose. It helps that Alex is a straight-shooting, instinct-driven character who understands the game she is in more than the gamemakers themselves.

Texto completo: “Fight for freedom. Stand with Hong Kong.” Daryl Morey, the general manager of the Houston Rockets, tweeted that message last Friday. It’s a sentiment that should command broad support in the United States, and throughout the free world.
But the reaction from China, which does not number free expression among its cherished values, was swift and painful for the NBA. The shoe company Li Ning and the Shanghai Pudong Development Bank ended sponsorship deals with the Rockets; Chinese broadcasters said they would not show Rockets games; the Chinese Basketball Association — led by the former Rockets star Yao Ming — suspended ties with the team.
“There is no doubt, the economic impact is already clear,” said Adam Silver, the league’s commissioner.
Silver went on to add that he supported Morey, but “what I am supporting is his freedom of political expression in this situation.”
The billionaires who control the lucrative basketball league, however, nearly tripped over themselves in their haste to abjure Morey’s remarks. The NBA, like many large American businesses, is besotted by the opportunity to make money in China’s expanding market. And the league once again made clear it is willing to obey China’s rules to preserve that chance.
The owner of the Rockets, Tilman Fertitta, raced for the traditional refuge of international capitalists — the insistence that business can be segregated from political considerations. “We’re here to play basketball and not to offend anybody,” Fertitta told ESPN.
But it should be perfectly clear that playing basketball in China is political.
Last year, the NBA staged a game in South Africa for the explicit purpose of celebrating the life of Nelson Mandela. When the NBA goes to China, that’s a statement, too.
It means that the NBA has weighed China’s human rights abuses against China’s potential as a source of revenue, and it has decided that it can live with state policies like the detention of hundreds of thousands of Chinese Muslims in the northwestern province of Xinjiang.
The owner of the Brooklyn Nets, the Chinese billionaire Joe Tsai, took the opportunity to publish an open letter scolding Americans for talking about the affairs of other nations. He also mischaracterized the Hong Kong protests as a “separatist movement.”
Tsai’s suggestion that people should avoid “third rail” issues may well be good manners when visiting a foreign country, but Morey posted his tweet while visiting Japan — and on a website that is not accessible to the general public in mainland China.
The face of the Rockets, the point guard James Harden, issued a public apology on Monday.
“We apologize,” he said.
For what, exactly, remained unclear.
Do the NBA’s owners appreciate that their wealth is a product of the freedoms they enjoy in this country? Does Harden, the owner of a famous beard, know that Muslims in Xinjiang are not allowed to grow beards like his?
The NBA has an undoubted right to set rules for its workforce, but it cannot simultaneously claim to champion free expression — the value of which consists entirely in the right to say what others don’t want to hear.
American executives and policymakers initially reconciled themselves to following China’s rules by arguing that China’s turn toward capitalism, and its exposure to the United States, would gradually lead toward democracy and a greater respect for human rights. They argued, in effect, that silence was the most productive form of criticism.
It should now be clear that silence is merely complicity, no more or less.

Peloton Sues Competitor Echelon for Attempting to ‘Free Ride’ Off Its Bike

Texto completo: Peloton’s recent IPO hasn’t brushed away its legal hiccups. The fitness startup, which went public in September and has since seen its stock fall by 20%, just filed another lawsuit for copyright infringement.
The company announced on Tuesday that it’s suing Echelon Fitness for attempting to “free ride off Peloton’s innovative technology.”
SEE ALSO: A Recession Would Burst Boutique Fitness Bubble, Expert Predicts
The New York-based startup’s filing claims that since its founding in 2012, it “has disrupted the fitness industry, becoming the largest interactive fitness platform in the world,” from which competitors have since capitalized.
“With Peloton’s hard-fought success, competitors, including Defendant Echelon, have attempted to free ride off Peloton’s innovative technology,” the lawsuit states. “Rather than develop new technology, Echelon chose to simply appropriate Peloton’s intellectual property and flood the market with cheap, copycat products.”
A spokesperson for Peloton declined to comment beyond what’s stated in the lawsuit document.
The legal action, filed with the U.S. District Court in Delaware, claims Echelon manufactured its indoor bikes by “outright” copying Peloton’s registered trademark and “trade dress,” such as the red, black and white branding. It also mentions a New York Times article referring to Echelon’s version of cycling gear as “a blatant knockoff” of Peloton’s famous bike.
In a statement to The Los Angeles Times , Echelon Fitness Multimedia’s president, Lou Lentine, confirmed the company will fight the lawsuit.
“While we just learned of the lawsuit and therefore cannot comment substantively, we can say that we intend to vigorously defend ourselves against these frivolous claims, and we are confident that we will ultimately prevail,” Lentine said.
The latest suit is just one of many Peloton is currently involved in, including a similar one filed against another competitor, Flywheel Sports, for hardware copyright infringement.
Ahead of its anticipated IPO, a long-standing music copyright lawsuit against Peloton was modified to seek additional damages. The fitness startup, which uses popular artists’ songs during its streamed classes, was originally sued in March for music copyright infringement by the National Music Publisher’s Association (NMPA) for $150 million. The NMPA’s lawsuit amendment, which requested to double damages to $300 million after allegedly discovering more than 1,000 additional songs infringed by Peloton, was approved by a Manhattan federal judge on September 28, two day after its public debut.

Word of the Week: Representation

Texto completo: The “Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media has partnered with Walt Disney Studios to deploy a new digital tool that uses AI technology to assess film and television scripts for gender bias,” according to the Hollywood Reporter.
So, what’s the plan here? A censor-bot: “Named ‘GD-IQ: Spellcheck for Bias,’ the new tool leverages patented machine learning technology … to rapidly analyze the text of a script to determine its number of male and female characters and whether they are representative of the real population at large. The technology also can discern the numbers of characters who are people of color, LGBTQI, possess disabilities or belong to other groups typically underrepresented and failed by Hollywood storytelling.”
Now, the problem this program aims to address seems to me to be a real one. Snow White, for example, is the film studies 101 example of screwed up moral messaging about girls and women. The titular hero, when you think about it, basically succeeds whenever she passively (often literally unconsciously) looks pretty while males around her do stuff, and bad things happen to her when she takes any agency.
But good intentions don’t make for good ideas, and an algorithm that enforces representation by self-censorship is a bad idea. Let’s put aside how instrumental and empty the conception of art here is. AI-based onscreen representation raises some serious practical questions.
Are we seriously supposed to believe that a computer program can discern the “appropriate” level of representation of Q folks when there’s no serious agreement on exactly how to define “queer”? Anyway, according to the New York Times, it’s not totally settled whether that letter in LGBTQIA+ stands for “queer” or for “questioning.”
For another, Americans think there are roughly five times as many gay people as there really are according to the best data. Should the robot make sure to correct unconscious bias by dramatically reducing inclusion of gay characters? How can or should GD-IQ “count” the roughly half of Hispanic/”Latinx” Americans who are white-identifying? Seems tricky. Will it “spellcheck” a movie about great black women artists for not including representation of members of those groups in STEM fields?
But the worst part of "Spellcheck for Bias" is the inbuilt idea about language: that bias is ungrammatical or misspelled, rather than wrong. GD-IQ is hardly the first example. In April, I covered a computer application called Catalyst, which autocorrects messages deemed by a computer program to contain “offensive” ideas about demographic groups as though they are writing errors. Back then, I said “the language police got a Robocop.” Now it seems more like Skynet. Since April, Microsoft’s Office announced a similar feature for Word, on the same thinking that “problematic” and prejudicial ideas about historically marginalized demographic groups are a special category of error that can be run out of human thought if we treat them as a misuse of language rather than a morally wicked and factually false category of beliefs.
Censor-bot technology promises that people can have unconscious biases; they just can’t message them to one another, record them in word processors, or include them in a script. The pitch is that eventually, without the words, the ideas will go away too. But this “theory of change,” to use Davis’s consultant-speak cliché, is a false promise. It’s certain to lead to more censorship but unlikely to lead to less bias.

Texto completo: As the impeachment fight between President Donald Trump and House Democrats escalates, it has largely pushed the 2020 Democratic presidential candidates out of the news. 
All, that is, except one. 
On Wednesday, former Vice President Joe Biden became the last of the top-tier Democratic contenders to call for President Trump’s impeachment. It was his most forceful response yet to Mr. Trump’s apparent efforts to get Ukraine – and later, China – to investigate him and his son Hunter for corruption. “Trump will do anything to get reelected, including violating the most basic forms of democracy,” Mr. Biden said at a town hall in New Hampshire. “It’s stunning, and it’s dangerous.” 
There’s no evidence that the Bidens did anything illegal in Ukraine. And so far, the former vice president’s collateral role in the scandal hasn’t appeared to hurt his standing in the polls. The Trump campaign’s focus on him may even be helping perpetuate his image as a front-runner. 
But it’s also serving to highlight a key tension in Mr. Biden’s candidacy: One of his main strengths – his many years at the heart of the Washington establishment – may also be his biggest weakness.
To many voters, Mr. Biden is respected and well liked, a known quantity. Wrapped in the halo of affection Democrats have for former President Barack Obama, he has presented himself as a return to “normalcy” after the turmoil of the Trump years. It’s one of the reasons his poll numbers have held steady despite months of attacks by Mr. Trump, his Democratic rivals, and the social mediaverse. 
Four decades spent in the nation’s capital, however, inevitably bring some baggage. Some younger progressives see Mr. Biden as an unwanted return to now-obsolete ways. As the Ukraine scandal continues to grow, some also suggest he’s too much of an insider, too mired in “the swamp,” to bring about the kind of change that’s needed in Washington. 
“He needs to fight the perception that his presidency could be a return to the status quo,” says Ryan Pougiales, senior political analyst at center-left think tank Third Way. “There is no appetite among voters for going back to the way things were. How can Biden be [seen as] an agent of change and still bring the country together?”
Mr. Biden has made the past central to his campaign, often calling up his relationship with President Obama and advocating a return to a less partisan era. His primary rivals have used those same features to cast the 76-year-old as a relic who needs to “pass the torch” and to question his ability to “carry the ball all the way across the end line without fumbling.”
Mr. Biden’s rambling, gaffe-prone stump appearances haven’t helped. He has confused New Hampshire for Vermont, Margaret Thatcher for Theresa May, and his campaign’s text-message code for its website. His reliance on big-dollar donors when his opponents are raking in small donations online left him fourth in third-quarter fundraising, behind Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg. 
Even his message of bipartisanship – that he can reach across the aisle and work with Republicans – feels a little dated, says Jim Manley, a veteran Democratic strategist.
“He needs to step out of the reality that was the Senate in the 1990s and do a better job showing that he understands the concerns of today and he’s prepared to take them on,” Mr. Manley says. 
The Ukraine issue also could take a toll. Mr. Trump has suggested that the former vice president helped oust a Ukrainian prosecutor in order to protect an energy company where his son Hunter sat on the board. Mr. Biden’s defenders – and many independent experts – say the move, which was backed by the European Union and the International Monetary Fund, was spurred by the prosecutor’s failure to root out corruption. But these days, a claim doesn’t have to be proved, or true, to be damaging. 
Moreover, the story illustrates the kind of elite influence-trading that many Americans hate about Washington – the legal “soft corruption” that candidates like Senator Warren rail against. Some voters will likely recoil when they hear that Hunter Biden earned $50,000 a month thanks to his father’s political cachet (though of course, Mr. Trump’s children have been accused of doing the exact same thing).
“It’s not at all the same as asking a foreign leader to investigate a political rival, but let’s not pretend that this doesn’t feel swampy,” says political scientist Erin O’Brien, who teaches at the University of Massachusetts, Boston.
Still, the situation hasn’t seemed to hurt Mr. Biden. While Senator Warren has crept up in the polls over the summer, cutting his lead in some surveys and even overtaking him in others, her rise seems to have come more at the expense of other candidates. Mr. Biden’s numbers have been stable, especially in crucial states like South Carolina. 
Terry Shumaker, a U.S. ambassador under President Bill Clinton and longtime Biden friend and supporter, says it reflects the fact that these are unusual times. Democratic voters, he notes, usually prefer the fresh and the young. The only three presidents to have been elected while in their 70s – Mr. Trump, Ronald Reagan, and Dwight Eisenhower – were all Republicans.
Now, after three years of Mr. Trump, “the revolution can wait,” Mr. Shumaker says, paraphrasing New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman. 
“On Jan. 20 of 2021, somebody’s gotta go into the Oval Office with not a dustpan, but an enormous shovel, and start cleaning up the mess,” Mr. Shumaker says. Mr. Biden, he argues, “is ready to go on Day One. His bike does not need training wheels.” 
Research conducted by Third Way found that a majority of likely Democratic primary voters want a candidate who can unify the country more than they want someone who’s fighting for a cause, and who takes on urgent problems that Americans are facing rather than someone who’s shifting the national debate. While the nomination race is still “absolutely” anybody’s game, Mr. Biden can point to years of experience doing precisely those things, Mr. Pougiales says.
“People are looking for something they can trust, something they can depend on,” adds Antjuan Seawright, a Democratic strategist in South Carolina. “He has the reliability factor.” 
What Mr. Biden hasn’t done effectively is take charge of the narrative. Few of Mr. Biden’s policy ideas – which include a proposal to invest $5 trillion in public and private money into climate change over the next decade, and a new education plan that calls for two free years of community college – have been able to break through the noise about his age or the chaos over impeachment and Ukraine. Doing so will be key to proving that he can take on Mr. Trump.
“The [Biden] campaign has to block and tackle more: Block out any distractions that may be coming their way from the left or from the right, and tackle the issues that matter to everyday people,” Mr. Seawright says. “The bubble wants to talk about Trump. But the people want to hear about the quality-of-life issues that Joe Biden is known for.”

Texto completo: Many celebrities have made public statements about Diahann Carroll, who died last week. But the most poignant one for me showed up as a piece in The New York Times this week.
Called “Diahann Carroll Was the Only Mother I Knew," it was written by Marc Copage, who played her son, Corey, on the groundbreaking sitcom “Julia" from 1969-71. Copage has acted little since he worked on “Julia" from ages 5 to 8, and he has worked as a waiter, often at parties for famous people. In 2010, he found himself cater-waiting a party attended by Carroll, but he hid from her out of embarrassment.
More recently, in 2017, Copage and Carroll had a meaningful dinner together, during which they talked about marriage (she told him it was “overrated"), later singing together to Tony Bennett in the car. When he told her he was writing a memoir, she suggested he call it “Television's First Black Child Star."
Copage recalls thinking of Carroll as his mother, and staying at her house, since his parents had separated and his mother had moved to Europe. But her daughter, Suzanne, was not pleased about sharing her mother, and Carroll created some distance.
In her memoir, she explained: “Eventually I had to confront the reason for Suzanne's anger and begin to remove myself from Marc. 'Suzie's my real daughter,' I explained. 'And you're my television son. That doesn't mean I don't love you very much. I do. But when the day is over, you must return to your home and I want to do to the same.' It was such a painful moment. Marc couldn't understand what was wrong and was terribly hurt."
I can't imagine ever seeing an episode of “Julia" again without thinking about this bittersweet vignette.

Just as we were expecting

Texto completo: Can we not do this again, please? Can we not magnify some purported fault or misstep of a Democratic presidential candidate and make it seem like it's as big a deal as the daily — no, hourly — assaults on truth and decency and the Constitution committed by President Trump?
False equivalency, after all, is one of the ways we got into this mess. (It's weird how Hillary Clinton's purported crimes of having a private e-mail server and potentially hiding official communications are suddenly so much meh when Trump, his advisers, and his family appear to be doing it, isn't it?)
In this week's installment of Have We Learned Nothing: The controversy over whether Democratic hopeful Elizabeth Warren was really let go in 1971 from her teaching job in a New Jersey public school because she was pregnant. The story is a staple of Warren's stump speech: Once it became clear she was pregnant, her principal wished the young special needs teacher luck and sent her on her way.
The attempted gotcha, in the conservative Washington Free Beacon, cited minutes from school board meetings at the time showing that Warren's job contract was renewed, and that the board later accepted her resignation “with regret" to cast doubt on her claims.
As if Warren could be telling the truth only if the record had shown school officials admitted to canning her for being pregnant.
None of the records unearthed contradict Warren's version of events: Her contract was renewed when she was four months' pregnant, but she was let go when she was visibly pregnant, at six months. She did not always talk about being discriminated against because she wasn't always comfortable sharing that part of her story, she told CBS News. The network also interviewed another teacher who worked at the school at the time, who confirmed that women were required to leave when they were five months' pregnant.
Also, every woman on the planet knows of somebody who suffered a similar fate, and not just way back in the 1970s, before there were laws to protect pregnant women.
But never mind all of that. Trump's bootlickers have sprung into action, accusing Warren of deception and character flaws. The Democrat had been “caught lying," the RNC shrieked. Meanwhile, their own candidate shambles around with his pants on fire all day, every day.
Of course, the truth barely matters anymore. Just ask Joe Biden, forced to defend himself repeatedly against the bald, demonstrable lies Trump and his allies are telling about the former vice president's attempt to fight corruption in Ukraine.
Some voters will cling to the notion that Warren lied about what happened to her in 1971. What's galling is, there's no way to avoid giving the trumped-up scandal oxygen: The president and his allies send the lie up, and even those who debunk it amplify it.
Even more galling: Warren is in the same position as thousands who have paid a professional price for their pregnancies but battle to prove it. Few employers come out and admit they're firing somebody because of a pregnancy — especially since federal and state laws were enacted to outlaw the practice. That doesn't mean it doesn't happen.
“If something is illegal and somebody wants to do it anyway, they will find a way to do it without explicitly making a statement that admits liability," said Rebecca Pontikes, a Boston labor attorney.
Pontikes has seen employers load extra work on pregnant employees in physical jobs in an attempt to force them out. Nearly 31,000 pregnancy discrimination charges were filed with federal and state agencies between 2010 and 2015, according to the National Partnership for Women and Families.
A February New York Times investigation found that pregnancy discrimination remains rampant in corporate America, with employers sidelining pregnant women and mothers, passing them over for promotions, and firing them when they complain. In the most egregious cases, employers admitted they viewed pregnant women differently. But most employers are smarter than that.
They discriminate against pregnant women in ways that are harder to prove, forcing them into the very position Warren is in now: Having to piece together a case from imperfect records, while those who benefit most from the discrimination try to undermine her credibility.
Let's not play right into their hands.

Texto completo: Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
When I tell people that I'm a recipe writer, they often don't know what it means: "Do you write down things that actual chefs do?" I am technically a chef, so, yes? Or more pointedly: "I didn't know you could make a job just writing down recipes." You really can.
So, what exactly do I do? What are the steps that actually go into producing a recipe?
In a word, testing. To me, the scientific method is the most powerful tool we have to work toward the truth, as difficult as it may be to define that term in a field as steeped in culture, tradition and superstition as cooking. What factors go into ensuring my poached eggs don't fall apart? Why does the first pancake always look spotty? Why do we add bread crumbs to meatballs? I am always looking to break down cooking to first principles, to develop ways of thinking that can be applied broadly and improve your confidence in the kitchen.
I've been writing recipes for over a decade, first as a test cook at Cook's Illustrated and America's Test Kitchen, then as culinary director of Serious Eats. My online column, The Food Lab, was published as a book in 2015, and I'm currently working on a follow-up, as well as designing recipes for my California beer hall, Wursthall.
In my new monthly column for The New York Times's Food section, I plan on continuing to explore the science behind everyday cooking, with a particular focus on how an understanding of ingredients and techniques from around the world can help make your cooking tastier and more efficient. In other words, this column is really about how I think about feeding my own family at home.
Sometimes this means using data, as I did last month in my first column. Boiling and peeling close to a thousand eggs revealed that the best way to hard-boil them is to steam them, which produces tender, evenly cooked eggs that slip out of their shells with no damage an average of 87 percent of the time.
It can also mean explaining the science behind a trick that will improve your cooking, like what happens when you add a touch of mayonnaise to marinades for grilled or seared meats, which I'll explore in my second column. (It really is a magical technique.)
To come up with these recipes and techniques, no matter the venue, the basics of good development are the same. They start with research, particularly historical (what is the role of this dish or ingredient in history, how has it changed and what is its modern role?), and cultural (what does this dish mean to people, especially the people of the region or culture in which it was developed?). The last thing you want is to end up with a dish that is not immediately recognizable to the people who created it -- especially if those people are from Texas or Italy.
Research usually reveals my testing goals. One may be increasing efficiency for weeknight cooks. It might be a step in which a technique from another culture could add flavor. It could be a perennial question with dozens of conflicting answers that needs more data to draw real conclusions.
Once I've identified those goals, I can move on to designing tests and cobbling together recipes to build off. Sometimes it takes a half-dozen iterations to achieve my goal, or, as with my chocolate chip cookies, even hundreds. (The keys are using brown butter, creaming the eggs instead of the butter and giving the dough an overnight rest.)
The internet has also changed the way I develop recipes and cook. If I want to learn to make mapo tofu, the Sichuan dish of silken tofu coated in a fiery fermented bean sauce, I can order a carbon steel wok from China and a propane-powered turkey fryer burner from Louisiana. I can get Sichuan peppercorns delivered to my doorstep, and I can follow along on YouTube as a Sichuanese chef cooks the dish. Best of all, I know that if I can get it, my readers can get it, too.
My life has also changed since the early days when I, a newly married man, spent my free time covering our windowless, single-bedroom apartment in Brooklyn in a hazy patina of hamburger grease as I researched my first book.
Now, I spend the bulk of my time writing and raising our toddler, and my cooking reflects that. Like many people, I have limited time and budget. So I aim to write recipes with those constraints in mind, using the access to information and physical goods that the connected world affords us to make daily meals more efficient, more flavorful and more healthful.

Texto completo: The online lives of Teejayx6, DaBaby, Megan Thee Stallion and other breakout rappers are as important as their music.
In August, the Detroit rapper Teejayx6 made his way to California for his first Los Angeles concert, at Rarehouse. In videos from the event, he lumbers around the stage, head down, clutching his microphone like it was an enemy. But then something bizarre happens: Two burly men in navy jackets reading "U.S. Marshal" stomp onto the stage, speak some stern words to the rapper, then take him into custody. They march Teejayx6 outside to a waiting car and drive off.
Within minutes, footage of the incident hit Instagram and Twitter. And within hours, internet sleuths discovered a website with actors for hire playing police officers, including one who was photographed arresting Teejayx6, making it clear the whole bust was a sham.
And yet everyone got what they wanted, more or less. Fans at the show saw a concert, and also a bit of performance art. Fans on the internet got to solve a mystery. And Teejayx6 took what could have been a small show that left a minimal mark and made it into an event that ricocheted across social media.
In Teejayx6's relatively rapid rise to internet notoriety over the past few months, he's made scamming central to his music; his best songs are like "10 Crack Commandments" for online financial crime. But it also manifests in his image: He courts the meme economy assiduously, playing a character in an ongoing social-media drama that's just as important as his music, probably more so.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
The same is true of many of this year's most important breakout rappers -- DaBaby, Blueface, Megan Thee Stallion, NLE Choppa and others -- who understand that in an era in which social media and streaming are interwoven amplifiers, playing a character is as important as making great music. Being loved (and sometimes laughed at) on social media -- see 6ix9ine, Lil Pump and other anime characters of the SoundCloud era -- is just as important as any song. Creating micro-moments that fans can organize around may be the most robust currency of all.
This is true even of the most technically skilled rappers of the current generation, DaBaby and Megan Thee Stallion. DaBaby's impressive new album "Kirk" just debuted at the top of the Billboard album chart. But just a couple of years ago, he appeared at South by Southwest wearing a diaper, planning to go viral. When he performed his breakout hit, "Suge," at the BET Awards this summer, he appeared onstage in a muscle shirt, looking like a pumped-up Popeye. His compact toughness is a frequent subject of memes: There's one that likens the shape of his head to a PT Cruiser, another that shows a furiously stomping Topsy Cat and reads "DaBaby on his way to beat somebody" up.
Megan Thee Stallion's entry into the meme slipstream has been slightly less direct, but no less effective. Her catchphrase "hot girl summer" birthed endless tweets, Instagram captions and memes. And Megan leaned into the phrase, releasing a song with that title in August, and successfully applying for trademark protection for the phrase.
Earlier this year, the Los Angeles rapper Blueface helped structure this pathway during the supernova that was "Thotiana," one of 2019's biggest yet most evanescent rap songs. As he was becoming a rap star, he was becoming a bigger viral sensation, nailing a few signature gestures -- mopping the floor, slicking his eyebrows -- that became easy memes. And he's proven adept at maintaining a spot in the social-media conversation, even if he's been less present on hip-hop radio, as seen in his recent public discussion about his throuple home life.
And he's already sprouting influence. You see some of Blueface's eagerness to entertain in NLE Choppa, whose breakout hit this year was "Shotta Flow." In the song's video, Choppa wields an improbably long gun, but he also dances with athletic verve and comic timing. And it's those sharp-elbowed moves that have become his signature -- in one hilarious clip circulating online, he previews music for the legendary music executive Birdman, one of hip-hop's great stoics, herking and jerking wildly while Birdman maintains a cool distance. Unsurprisingly, the remix of "Shotta Flow" features Blueface. In the video, the two rappers go verse for verse, and dance for dance, each trying to out-GIF the other.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Teejayx6 has said that he, too, has looked to Blueface as an influence, especially in his rapping, which is more spoken than straightforwardly rhythmic. His best songs -- "Dark Web," "Swipe Story" -- are like recitations full of hacker-speak and scam lessons: "The government tried to ban me from the dark web/I downloaded Tor browser and got back in/Went and got a VPN, just bought another BIN."
He's released three albums this year, and his music is improving. But he's committed to stirring up online conversation as well. The day after the Los Angeles show, he stuck with the bit, posting a video of himself at a Wells Fargo with the caption "Bonded out back on the same [expletive]." Later, the caption was changed, and then the video was deleted -- a cycle that's become part of his strategy.
In late September, Teejayx6 came to S.O.B.'s for his first concert in New York. It was an unruly, almost reluctant show -- brief and appealingly raw. The act of rapping for an audience appeared to irritate him. One member of his crew handed out ski masks to audience members like the one Teejayx6 was wearing so they, too, could become the meme.
The next day, his representative began circulating a #FreeTeejayx6 hashtag, suggesting he'd been arrested. Soon after that, a self-evidently fake mug shot made the rounds, as did a fake New York Times tweet announcing the news of his arrest: "He was caught with $ 50,000 cash & fraudulent bank checks."
It was all false, but also plainly entertaining -- how many times could someone fake his own arrest before diminishing returns set in? But Teejayx6 may be the ideal rapper for this age of pervasive disinformation, for an era of almost-true and could-be-factual. When you're never certain what you're seeing is real, an artist who freely bends and invents the truth feels prescient. And even if you can no longer trust your eyes, you can still trust your ears.

Trump should out the whistleblower — we deserve to know who he is

Texto completo: President Trump says he’s serious about fighting the House Democrats’ impeachment sham. If so, there’s only one thing he needs to do right now: devote every resource to outing the whistleblower.
After Trump said last week that he deserved to “to meet my accuser” and that he’d like to “interview” the guy, Democrats and liberals in the national media were hysterical in reminding us that the whistleblower is protected by federal law.
True, there are laws that prevent retaliation — discipline, demotion, or termination — against federal employees who comes forward with allegations of wrongdoing within their agencies. But that only means that a whistleblower's superiors can’t fire him or reduce his status. The law doesn’t guarantee anonymity. Trump has the same right that the rest of us do to confront his accuser and raise any appropriate questions about his credibility.
Yes, we know that the whistleblower is a man because the New York Times has referred to his sex in reports for the last two weeks. It’s a man who works in the CIA and who had previously worked in the White House. We even know the lawyer who's representing him, Mark Zaid.
The inspector general of the intelligence community has likewise already said that the federal employee is a registered Democrat and has reportedly indicated that he has ties with one of the current Democratic presidential candidates. The only question about him left to ask is: What’s his name?
Dimwits are insisting that it doesn’t matter who the government employee is because, after all, it’s the content of his claim that matters!
But the only part of the government employee’s claim from August that has been corroborated is the part about Trump having a phone conversation with the leader of Ukraine and asking that he look into any potential corruption involving Joe Biden. And we only know that's been corroborated because the White House released the transcript of the phone call.
We already knew that the president’s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani had been talking with foreign leaders about the 2016 election and Biden, because Giuliani admitted it back in May. Everything else in the report is unsubstantiated and sourced to other parties.
So what is Trump waiting for? Find out the identity of the government employee and then leak it, the same way Democrats in Congress are certain to leak Trump’s tax returns the moment they get their hands on them. There's nothing illegal or even ethically dubious about letting the public decide whether to believe the serious accusations made against the president of the United States. Democrats think we should wait until the impeachment trial, which will conveniently coincide with the heat of the 2020 election, but I think now is as good as ever.
The Washington Post reported this week that Democrats are taking extra precautions to ensure that Republicans never find out who the whistleblower is. I wonder why. It couldn’t possibly be that there’s something to hide. No, never. I’m sure the Democrat who is linked to one of the president’s opponents is completely unbiased in the concerns he’s brought forth to Democrats in Congress.
The government employee has no right to anonymity. Trump should find out who he is and let the rest of us know.

Rapper's Mother Sues Label Over His Overdose Death

Texto completo: The emo-rapper overdosed on a tour bus in 2017. His mother says those responsible for his welfare pushed him to perform and plied him with drugs.
Before the rising emo-rapper Lil Peep was pronounced dead from an overdose on a tour bus in Tucson, Ariz., almost two years ago, he was "stressed, overwhelmed, burnt out, exhausted and physically unwell," according to a lawsuit filed on Tuesday.
Rather than getting him help, the suit says, those who were meant to guide him instead pushed Lil Peep "onto stage after stage in city after city, plying and propping" him up with illegal drugs and unprescribed controlled substances as he spiraled further.
These were the explosive claims filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court by Liza Womack, the rapper's mother and the administrator of his estate, against First Access Entertainment, the talent agency and label that oversaw Lil Peep's career after signing him to a three-year deal beginning when he was 19.
The suit, which seeks unspecified damages for negligence, breach of contract and wrongful death, also named as defendants Bryant Ortega, known as Chase, a member of Lil Peep's management team; and Belinda Mercer, who was hired as a tour manager for Lil Peep's final tour in the fall of 2017. The suit also raises allegations about Sarah Stennett, First Access's chief executive and a music industry power broker who has worked with the pop singers Ellie Goulding, Rita Ora and Zayn Malik.
In a statement on Tuesday night, First Access Entertainment called claims that any of its employees contributed to Lil Peep's death "categorically untrue." The company said the musician's accidental overdose was a "terrible tragedy," and added that its staff had encouraged him to stop using drugs.
"Unfortunately, in spite of our best efforts, he was an adult who made his own decisions and opted to follow a different, more destructive path," the statement reads. "While First Access is deeply saddened by Lil Peep's untimely death, we will not hesitate to defend ourselves against this groundless and offensive lawsuit."
Mercer and Ortega did not respond to requests for comment.
Lil Peep (born Gustav Ahr) was on the forefront of a genre-bending movement and seemed on the verge of mainstream fame when he died at 21 in November 2017, making him just one in a handful of notable musicians who have overdosed on opioids in recent years; the synthetic drug fentanyl was also cited in the deaths of Prince, Tom Petty and Mac Miller. But Lil Peep's is the first recent case in which an artist's family has attempted to hold the music business itself responsible. There have been no criminal charges in connection to his death.
"This is something that I must do as a mother," Womack said in an interview, citing her ongoing worry for young artists. "I feel very concerned that they not be exploited," she said. "What Gus had to live through is actually horrifying to me, and I'm sure he's not the only person his age in this situation."
The suit contends that the defendants "fostered, promoted and encouraged" drug use as a way to maintain control over Lil Peep and his tours. It paints the musician as an impressionable young man with no entertainment industry experience, who had put his trust in FAE "to guide him through this journey in a reasonable, ethical, and safe manner." The company, the suit says, treated Lil Peep "as a commodity rather than as a human being" and pushed him "to the extreme bounds of what somebody of his age and maturity level could handle emotionally, mentally, and physically."
Detailing specific incidents, the suit claims that Stennett gifted Lil Peep a bottle of pills at a group dinner in early 2017, and cites text messages in which she contacted him about drugs, writing, "I'm about to land at JFK. I have one 2m x and 4 x .25," referring to two different doses of Xanax pills.
Mercer, the suit says, was in a sexual relationship with Lil Peep while working as his tour manager and provided him drugs, including ketamine. The lawsuit also describes an event on Oct. 25, 2017, a few weeks before Lil Peep's death, in which Mercer was detained at the Canadian border after a search by drug-sniffing dogs. The suit alleges that Stennett was made aware of the incident and the potentially dangerous environment on tour but allowed the behavior to persist.
On the night Lil Peep died, Mercer and others associated with FAE saw him on the bus and noted "that he looked alarmingly unwell, but rather than seeking help or contacting authorities, Mercer instead elected to run a personal errand," the suit claims.
Much of what was included in the lawsuit was previously reported by David Peisner in a Rolling Stone story about Lil Peep's last days, published in March. In the article, Stennett denied through a lawyer that she had ever given Lil Peep any drug, and said she was merely trying to comfort him by offering pills that she had no intention of delivering. She also denied that she was aware of what drugs people were doing on the tour bus.
"I wasn't there," Stennett told Rolling Stone. "Anybody who takes drugs makes a decision to take a risk."
In an interview last year, Stennett told The New York Times that her work with Lil Peep had "restored my faith in a higher power," adding that their relationship "made me understand there is a purpose to what I'm doing. It's not just music, it's a much bigger responsibility."
Beyond the issue of whether his management team facilitated his drug use, to win the case Womack may need to convince a jury that the team did so purposefully, or at least that it had a duty to look out for his welfare and did not adequately do so.
Paul A. Matiasic, a lawyer for Womack, Lil Peep's mother, said, "We acknowledge, obviously, that Gus had a role" in his own death. However, "In evaluating the legal responsibility for someone's untimely death, it is not a binary decision," he added, noting that juries in California could assign fault as they see appropriate. (For example, if a plaintiff is 50 percent responsible for their own injury, but the defendant is 50 percent responsible, the plaintiff can recover 50 percent of their damages from the defendant.)
FAE "had the power, they had the influence and control over Gus's career, and specifically this tour," Matiasic said. "There are duties associated with having that type of control."
Gregory C. Keating, a torts professor at the University of Southern California, said that while allegations of record companies providing drugs to rock stars date back decades, and could be seen as a "common practice in a freewheeling industry," that doesn't mean an entertainment company could not be held liable.
"It's a plausible complaint, because a court could reasonably decide that by providing a person with an addiction with prescription medication and illegal substances, they endangered his life, and that brought responsibility upon themselves," he said.
"They would argue that they had no duty to protect him," he continued, "but if you supply him and you know he's got an addiction problem, that could trigger the application of a duty. This person is under your control to some extent, and you're actually enabling them by doing things that you're not authorized to do."
Columbia Records, which released Lil Peep's first posthumous album, "Come Over When You're Sober, Pt. 2," declined to comment.
"Everybody's Everything," a documentary about Lil Peep's life and death, is scheduled for release on Nov. 15, the second anniversary of his fatal overdose. The film, which bears the stamp of First Access Entertainment, includes Womack, the filmmaker Terrence Malick and Stennett as executive producers.

Texto completo: The people who allegedly hectored Celtics center Enes Kanter outside a mosque over his political opposition to Turkey's president didn't commit a crime, Cambridge police have determined.
In a statement Tuesday, police announced their findings in their review of the bizarre incident that occurred Friday afternoon outside the Islamic Society of Boston on Prospect Street in Cambridge.
The statement said police have “conducted a preliminary investigation into a report of threats and harassment based on" the encounter.
“Following this investigation, which included conversations with Mr. Kanter and other involved parties, it has been determined that no criminal activity occurred and that the other individuals featured in a video posted online were exercising their constitutionally protected right to free speech," the statement said. “Mr. Kanter has been advised of the steps that would be necessary to pursue a civil restraining order against the other parties, if he elects to pursue one."
Cops said anyone “with any additional information information related to this incident is asked to call the Cambridge Police at 617-349-3300. Those who wish to submit tips anonymously via phone, email, and text message, should visit www.CambridgePolice.org/Tips."
The statement came days after Kanter flagged the incident on social media, tweeting out a video that showed him and teammate Tacko Fall outside the mosque, which is a short walk from Inman Square. In the video, at least two men can be seen addressing Kanter. One of them holds a cellphone.
Kanter, who is expected to be Boston's starting center this season, is a vocal critic of Turkey's leader, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, previously calling him “the Hitler of our century." Erdogan has been accused of increasingly authoritarian tendencies. In the Friday video, Kanter indicates the two men are his fellow countrymen who support Erdogan.
“They're actually starting a fight outside of a mosque, pro-Erdogan people," Kanter says in the clip.
Later, in a phone interview with the Globe, Kanter said he had never seen the men before and that they cursed at him, called him “traitor," indicated that he should not be here, and made an obscene gesture at him. He said that when he and Fall, a 7-foot-7 rookie, left Friday's prayer service, the men were waiting for him outside. There, the men caused a scene, yelling and screaming at him, Kanter said.
“I told you America, this is crazy," Kanter says in the video.
Kanter told the Globe he has tried to stand up “for human rights, democracy, and freedom" and to bring awareness of “what's really going on in Turkey."
“I'm not going to back down," he said.
He called the harassment unacceptable and said he was shocked by the incident.
“It's a mosque, it's a house of God, this shouldn't happen," he said.
Cambridge police said Tuesday that no one should feel intimidated at a house of worship.
“The Cambridge Police recognizes that places of worship should be places where all can congregate with peace of mind and without fear," cops said. “No group or individual should ever suffer from bias, discrimination or hate. If any member of the community does believe that they have been threatened or harassed due to their faith, they are strongly encouraged to contact the police or organizations like the Anti-Defamation League. We remain committed to supporting and protecting all places of worship, and will continue to closely work with faith leaders, their staff, and those who attend their places of worship."

Texto completo: Having attended single-sex schools from childhood through her early college years, M. Burch Tracy Ford became an advocate for letting girls flourish in an academic setting apart from boys during their formative years.
“Coed classrooms are the norm, but the norm does not serve girls well; it needs to be challenged and, ultimately, changed," she wrote in a letter to the editor of The New York Times in 1994, a year after becoming head of school at Miss Porter's School in Farmington, Conn.
“Single-sex education is counterculture," she added, “but it's good for girls."
Mrs. Ford, who previously was dean of students at Milton Academy and the residential counselor at the Groton School, was 78 when she died Wednesday of complications from Alzheimer's disease.
She and her husband had returned to Greater Boston after she retired in 2008, and most recently she had lived in Concord.
In her early years as head of the Connecticut private school that counted Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis among its alumnae, Mrs. Ford decided Miss Porter's should invest more resources into making its interscholastic teams more competitive.
By her five-year mark, Division I colleges were recruiting nearly a dozen athletes who were seniors at Miss Porter's, the Times reported in 1998. Not all coaches and teachers welcomed the new emphasis on athletics.
“There is still a tremendous amount of ambivalence about girls being competitive in our society," Mrs. Ford told the Times that year.
“But I think for girls to really be successful, in their personal lives, in a business or political context, or any other venue, they have to learn from boys and men about exercising their strength and power, and sports are a perfect vehicle for teaching that," she added.
Mrs. Ford, who also introduced a compulsory course in ethics, believed in the importance of her initiatives, said her husband, Brian W. Ford, who coached crew at Miss Porter's while his wife was head of school and formerly had been a successful girls' crew team coach at Noble and Greenough School.
“She was determined that Miss Porter's was going to compete on an even level with every school in the country," he said. “And she felt that having decent, competitive sports was one element of that."
He added that his wife “had a kind of fierce independent attitude about life."
Running a private girls' school was a natural culmination of her background attending girls' schools as a youth and Trinity College, a women's school in Washington, D.C., until she left to serve in the Peace Corps, he said.
Although she believed women and men should work together as equals, Mrs. Ford thought that would be difficult to achieve in classrooms during their earlier years.
“Our future needs the best of everyone, men and women," she said in the 1994 letter to the Times, adding that “temporary separation of the two in school can serve us all in the long run."
Even in retirement, when she read about research that challenged the notion of single-sex education, Mrs. Ford said her experience as a student and an educator showed the approach had benefits.
In a 2011 letter to the editor of The Boston Globe, when she was president of the National Coalition of Girls' Schools, she wrote that “a major value of single-sex schools is freedom from gender stereotypes, not reinforcement of them. What prepares one for a successful adult life is the opportunity to know oneself apart from the traditional cultural imperatives, and to learn how to use one's strengths and values to become who one really is."
The third of four siblings, and the oldest daughter, Mary Burch Tracy was born in St. Louis on Nov. 27, 1940. She was 7 when her family moved to Baltimore and settled in the Bolton Hill neighborhood.
Burch was a family name and Mrs. Ford stopped going by Mary once she went to college.
Her father, Daniel O'Connell Tracy Sr., worked for a series of companies. Her mother, Virginia Corrigan Tracy, wrote for the Baltimore Sun and the Baltimore News American, interviewing celebrities and often bringing along her children.
“When people used to say that a woman couldn't be a good mother and have a job at the same time, I thought that was just nonsense," Mrs. Ford told the Baltimore Sun in 2000 for her mother's obit. “I thought my mother was much more interesting than any other mother I knew."
The example Virginia Tracy set inspired Mrs. Ford to have “the power of her convictions about how life should be," her husband said, “and that's what made her a great educator."
Mrs. Ford attended the Notre Dame girls' prep school in Baltimore and spent a couple of years at Trinity College, where she was elected class president. She then left to work and to spend time in London before joining the Peace Corps in 1967.
In Senegal, in West Africa, she spent two years staffing a social center that provided services such as a kindergarten, adult literacy courses, and prenatal health classes.
While in Senegal she met Brian Ford, another Peace Corps volunteer. They married in 1969 and initially lived in Boston.
“When we married, we had absolutely nothing," he recalled. “We had no money, we had no place to live, we had no jobs."
They both found work at what was then Peter Bent Brigham Hospital, where she became director of the volunteer department while finishing her bachelor's degree at Boston University, attending night classes.
Mrs. Ford went on to graduate from Simmons College with a master's in social work and from Harvard University with a master's in education.
Her husband said she spent 10 years at Groton as the first full-time residential counselor, followed by five years as dean of students at Milton Academy before being hired as head of school at Miss Porter's, where the school library now bears her name. As a former school counselor, “she taught me how to talk about feelings in ways that I found enormously helpful working as a teacher," her husband said. “She taught me how to listen to kids without judging, without a great deal of expectations. She had a lot of wisdom."
In addition to her husband, Mrs. Ford leaves their two sons, H. Winfield of Avon, Conn., and Randolph of Glenmont, N.Y.; two brothers, Daniel Tracy Jr. of Baltimore and George Tracy of Sarasota, Fla.; a sister, Virginia Tracy Perkins of Austin, Texas; and two granddaughters.
Family and friends will gather to celebrate her life at 2 p.m. Oct. 31 in Trinity Episcopal Church in Concord.
When Mrs. Ford and her husband first began dating in Africa, “I had a feeling I had met the most competent person I had every met in my life," he said. “She had – and the rest of her life bore this out — the ability to take on any task and get it done well," he added. “She was smart. She was strategic. She was also very kind."

Texto completo: An attorney for the whistleblower who sounded the alarm about President Donald Trump's pressure on Ukraine said Sunday that "multiple" whistleblowers have come forward, deepening a political quagmire that has engulfed the president as well as several of his Cabinet members.
The news comes as House Democrats are accelerating their impeachment inquiry and subpoenaing documents related to Trump's efforts to push foreign countries to investigate one of his political opponents, former Vice President Joe Biden.
"I can confirm that my firm and my team represent multiple whistleblowers in connection to the underlying August 12, 2019, disclosure to the Intelligence Community Inspector General," attorney Andrew Bakaj, said in a tweet. "No further comment at this time."
Mark Zaid, who also is a member of the original whistleblower's legal team, confirmed to The Washington Post that the team is now representing a second whistleblower, who works in the intelligence community. The second individual has spoken to the inspector general of the intelligence community and has not filed a complaint. "Doesn't need to," Zaid said.
This person has "first hand knowledge that supported the first whistleblower," Zaid said in a text message to The Post. He added that he does not know whether the individual is the same person mentioned in a New York Times report on Friday.
News that the original whistleblower's team is representing a second whistleblower was first reported Sunday by ABC News.
Trump on Sunday continued to lash out at Democrats and some Republican detractors, including Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, whose impeachment the president demanded Saturday after Romney criticized him.
"The Democrats are lucky that they don't have any Mitt Romney types," Trump tweeted. "They may be lousy politicians, with really bad policies (Open Borders, Sanctuary Cities etc.), but they stick together!"
No White House officials made appearances on the Sunday morning news shows, leaving it up to congressional Republicans to defend the president in heated interviews during which they offered at-times-contradictory explanations for the president's actions.
In a combative exchange on NBC's "Meet the Press," host Chuck Todd urged Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., to explain why he told The Wall Street Journal about his concern in the summer that Trump had sought to link Ukrainian military aid to an investigation of the Bidens.
Johnson repeatedly declined to answer, instead raising a conspiracy theory and criticizing the media before finally stating that Trump had "adamantly denied" any quid pro quo.
Johnson also at one point said he does not trust U.S. intelligence agencies. "Something pretty fishy happened during the 2016 campaign and in the transition, the early part of the Trump presidency, and we still don't know," he said.
"We do know the answer," an exasperated Todd responded, adding: "You're making a choice not to believe the investigations that have taken place."
Trump's Republican primary challengers also sharply criticized the president's actions.
Former Illinois congressman Joe Walsh said on CNN's "State of the Union" that he considers Trump "a traitor" who "is a threat to this country" and "deserves to be impeached."
Former South Carolina governor and Republican congressman Mark Sanford, who appeared on the show alongside Walsh, called the descriptions of Trump's behavior "troubling" and "wrong" but stopped short of deeming it impeachable.
Other Republicans on Sunday sought to play down Trump's comments, including his exchange with reporters outside the White House on Thursday in which he urged China to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, a 2020 Democratic presidential candidate.
In an interview on ABC News's "This Week," Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, echoed a suggestion on Friday by Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., that Trump's China statement was not "a real request."
"George, you really think he was serious about thinking that China's going to investigate the Biden family?" Jordan told host George Stephanopoulos.
During the interview, Stephanopoulos repeatedly sought an answer from Jordan on whether he believes it's appropriate for Trump to ask China and Ukraine to investigate Biden. Jordan dodged the question more than a dozen times.
Democrats, meanwhile, defended their party's efforts to pursue an inquiry into Trump.
Rep. Hakeem Jeffries of New York, a key member of House Democratic leadership, said on "This Week" that "the evidence of wrongdoing by Donald Trump is hiding in plain sight."
"The president betrayed his oath of office," Jeffries said. "He's engaged in serious wrongdoing. The administration, without justification, withheld $391 million in military aid from a vulnerable Ukraine."

Vote out politicians who ignite fear of immigrants

Texto completo: In 2011, a Kansas state lawmaker suggested shooting unlawfully present immigrants from helicopters, the way the state controlled its feral hog population.
He was building on a long history of politicians and other officials who have dehumanized immigrants, especially those at the border.
In fact, in 1911, the federal Dillingham Commission on immigration stated: "We should exercise at least as much care in admitting human beings (to the United States) as we exercise in relation to animals or insect pests or disease germs."
This is why it came as no shock to learn that President Donald Trump suggested shooting migrants in the legs to keep them from coming into the United States.
Trump said this in a fit of rage in March, while his White House aides tried to explain to him why the United States can't just shut down its 2,000-mile southern border, according to a new book, "Border Wars: Inside Trump's Assault on Immigration," by New York Times reporters Michael D. Shear and Julie Hirschfeld Davis.
Fuming and using expletives to berate his staff, Trump shouted, "I ran on this. It's my issue," according to the book.
It's also been the issue of countless hard-line conservatives who took the tack of scaring other white people into believing that their country is being invaded, overrun, flooded and infested with "bad hombres" looking to take white people's jobs, their women and their place at the top of the pecking order in America.
The strategy has proved extremely effective thus far, for Trump and for so many others -- like eight-term Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa, who once took a 12-foot model of a border wall to the floor of Congress. It was topped with wire that could be electrified to stop immigrants in the same way that livestock are managed.
It's a winning strategy to cast those who seek asylum from political violence and economic travail as being simultaneously super-powerful in their ability to take, take, take everything America holds dear and be as intellectually backward as hogs and cattle.
Superpowered is a good way to put it, actually, considering the other ideas Trump had for controlling the border, according to "Border Wars," which was recently excerpted in the Times ahead of its Oct. 8 publication date.
There was talk of fortifying the border wall with a water-filled trench -- you don't need to be a medieval scholar to think of it as a moat -- stocked with snakes or alligators. He actually asked aides to provide him with a cost estimate.
Trump also wanted the wall electrified, with spikes on top that could pierce human flesh, according to the book. (The president has denied the report.)
It's borderline funny.
It has to be for the millions of people with Latin American roots to be able to live another day in a country where the president represents the very real hatred that many white Americans have about new residents from our southern neighbor and multibillion-dollar trading partner.
But it's truly a laugh-so-you-don't-cry situation for the rest of us.
Mostly because crying would play into the hands of Trump and other white supremacists who hope to strike fear in the hearts of the brown people who have the nerve to demand equally funded neighborhoods and schools, and equal opportunities for access to good universities, jobs and housing stock.
Meanwhile, countless jokes and memes have been around the internet for a long time featuring Mexicans on ladders that are a few inches taller than a border wall, alligator costumes for traversing the moat and pictures of the Latino and/or Mexican laborers who'd be the ones building a big, fancy wall -- under budget and on time.
There's really nothing to be done about people who are unreasonably scared of immigrants and become enthralled with a politician who plays into those fears.
Sure, we can talk and engage in dialogues out the wazoo. But too many brown people have put in the effort only to realize that there's only so much individuals can do.
The only method that will work is to dismiss the legislators who keep stoking this fear. And for that, our white friends and allies who see people of color as more than vermin, livestock or worse will need to step up with us at the voting booth in 2020.

Texto completo: The dead sometimes speak louder than the living.
That's especially true when it comes to investing, markets and the economy, topics that generate many opinions from living people, few of which are useful.
I find it's better to ask the deceased what they think. With that in mind, I've profiled seven departed legends whose views should always remain at the top of your mind when you want advice about investing.
Neff: Bragging means selling
John Neff, the last of the legendary mutual fund managers, died June 4. His 31 years running the Windsor Fund, part of Vanguard, averaged 13.7% annually to 1995, more than doubling a comparable S&P 500 investment. How did he do it? Neff avoided fads and focused on fundamental firms and value, seeking to buy stocks cheaply compared with their intrinsic worth. That is a timely reminder.
Neff said things like, "When you feel like bragging about a stock, it's probably time to sell."
Graham: Father of value
Neff, like Warren Buffett, derived from the Ben Graham school of value investing. Buffett often is depicted as 85% Ben Graham (the other 15% being Phil Fisher, see below). Graham often is called "the father of value investing." If you have time for just one investing book, make sure it's Graham's classic, "The Intelligent Investor." Graham's key takeaway? Heeding value provides a margin of safety and higher returns, although those returns are irregular over time. That's because most investors oversell and underappreciate what isn't faddish and hasn't worked recently.
T. Rowe Price & Phil Fisher: Growth gurus
The reverse thinking came from the two "fathers" of growth stock investing, Thomas Rowe Price Jr. and Philip Fisher (disclosure: my father). These two are considered the first major voices claiming that a firm's future growth prospects matter much more than the current perceived "value." Price is best known for founding mutual fund giant T. Rowe Price Group. Fisher's legendary book, "Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits," was the first investing book to ever grace The New York Times best-seller list. Price and Fisher, if active now, would both be riding high in this growth-oriented bull market.
Bogle: Passive champion
Vanguard's Jack Bogle taught the world that most people will do better if they focus on neither growth nor value but instead become passive investors through an S&P 500 Index Fund. Beating the market requires that you know something useful others don't. Do you? If not, Bogle provided a ready path: Combine growth and value passively and match the market without trying to beat it or accidentally lag it. He knew most investors lag the market by in-and-outing the wrong things at all the wrong times.
Loeb: Be a skeptic
Gerald Loeb was an early "contrarian investing" voice, believing that if too many investors thought something would happen, it was already priced into the market and wouldn't happen. He was an active trader, author, columnist and was sometimes called "the most quoted man on Wall Street." He established the gold standard of awards for excellence in financial journalism, the Gerald Loeb Award. Loeb's key takeaway? Always invest, but be skeptically skittish because nothing endures.
Ponzi: Sounds too good to be true
Charles Ponzi's legend lives on, quite infamously: the Ponzi scheme is his namesake. Studying his schemes teaches to avoid being a victim of them. When a deal sounds too good to be true, it isn't true.
Ken Fisher is founder and executive chairman of Fisher Investments, author of 11 books, four of which were New York Times best sellers, and is No. 200 on the Forbes 400 list of richest Americans. Follow him on Twitter: @KennethLFisher

Texto completo: Ginger Baker, who helped redefine the role of the drums in rock and became a superstar in the process, died on Sunday in a hospital in southeastern England. He was 80.
His family confirmed his death in a post on his official Twitter account.
Mr. Baker drew worldwide attention for his approach to the drums, as sophisticated as it was forceful, when he teamed with the guitarist Eric Clapton and the bassist Jack Bruce in the hugely successful British band Cream in 1966.
[ Listen to 15 of Ginger Baker's essential songs. ]
Keith Moon of the Who was more uninhibited; John Bonham of Led Zeppelin -- a band formed in 1968, the year Cream broke up -- was slicker. But Mr. Baker brought a new level of artistry to his instrument, and he was the first rock drummer to be prominently featured as a soloist and to become a star in his own right. Mr. Clapton praised him as "a fully formed musician" whose "musical capabilities are the full spectrum."
Both as a member of the ensemble and as a soloist, Mr. Baker captivated audiences and earned the respect of his fellow percussionists with playing that was, as Neil Peart, the drummer with the band Rush, once said, "extrovert, primal and inventive." Mr. Baker, Mr. Peart added, "set the bar for what rock drumming could be."
But Mr. Baker, who got his start in jazz combos and cited the likes of Max Roach and Elvin Jones as influences, bristled when the word "rock" was applied to his playing. "I'm a jazz drummer," he told the British newspaper The Telegraph in 2013. "You have to swing. There are hardly any rock drummers I know who can do that."
Mr. Baker's appearance behind the drum kit -- flaming red hair, flailing arms, eyes bulging with enthusiasm or shut tight in concentration -- made an indelible impression. So, unfortunately, did his well-publicized drug problems and his volatile personality.
Mr. Baker, who by his own count quit heroin 29 times, was candid about his drug and alcohol abuse in his autobiography, "Hellraiser," published in Britain in 2009.
He recalled driving from Los Angeles to San Francisco while on tour with the band Blind Faith in 1969 and being more amused than surprised when he heard a report on the radio that he had died from a heroin overdose.
Of a later tour, he wrote, "In 1983-84, I formed the Ginger Baker Trio with guitarist John Simms and bassist Ian Macdonald and we did a tour that included Malta, Spain and Germany; but I can't remember anything about it due to the fact that I was drinking so heavily."
He was also, by all accounts, not a very likable man. Journalists who interviewed him tended to find him uncooperative at best, confrontational at worst. The hostility between Mr. Baker and Mr. Bruce, which sometimes led to onstage altercations, was the stuff of rock legend. The 2012 documentary "Beware of Mr. Baker" -- the title is taken from a sign outside the house in South Africa where he was living at the time -- begins with footage of Mr. Baker physically attacking the film's director, Jay Bulger.
"If they've got a problem with me, come and see me and punch me on the nose,"Mr. Baker says in that film. "I ain't going to sue you; I'm going to hit you back."
But if he was difficult to deal with, his talent was impossible to ignore. As A. O. Scott of The New York Times noted in his review of "Beware of Mr. Baker," Mr. Baker's music was ultimately "the only reason anyone should take an interest in him."
Peter Edward Baker -- he became known as Ginger during childhood because of his red hair -- was born on Aug. 19, 1939, in the Lewisham area of southeast London, to Frederick and Ruby (Bayldon) Baker. His father, a bricklayer, was killed in action during World War II.
Drawn to the drums at an early age, Mr. Baker talked his way into a job with a traditional-jazz combo when he was 16 despite his lack of professional experience. Before long, he was well established on the London jazz scene. He also had a heroin habit that would dog him for decades.
In 1962 Mr. Baker joined Blues Incorporated, one of the earliest British rhythm-and-blues bands, beginning his contentious but musically rewarding association with Mr. Bruce. When the organist and saxophonist Graham Bond left that band in 1964 to form his own group, the Graham Bond Organisation, Mr. Baker and Mr. Bruce went with him.
Two years later they teamed with Mr. Clapton, whose work with the Yardbirds and John Mayall's Bluesbreakers had made him one of Britain's most celebrated guitarists, to form Cream.
Performing a repertoire that mixed original compositions with radical reinterpretations of old blues songs, Cream was an instant sensation. Within two years, the band went from nightclubs to stadiums and released four albums, whose total sales were estimated at 35 million. But in 1968, at the height of its success, Cream disbanded.
One reason for the breakup was the continuing animosity between Mr. Baker and Mr. Bruce. Another, Mr. Baker later said, was the extreme volume at which Mr. Clapton and Mr. Bruce played.
"For the first 18 months it was great," he said in 2013. "But things got too bloody big and too bloody loud. They kept piling these huge Marshall speakers one on top of another. That's why my hearing's wrecked."
Mr. Baker's next band was, on paper, even bigger than Cream: Blind Faith, in which he and Mr. Clapton joined forces with the singer, keyboardist and guitarist Steve Winwood, known for his work with the Spencer Davis Group and Traffic. (The less famous Ric Grech was the bassist.) Hopes were high, but Blind Faith imploded after one album and one tour, the victim of excessive hype and conflicting egos.
Following the similarly brief life of his next band, Ginger Baker's Air Force, a jazz-rock outfit with a saxophone section, Mr. Baker led a peripatetic life and stayed largely out of the spotlight.
He spent much of the 1970s in Lagos, Nigeria, where he built a recording studio and became immersed in African music, performing and recording with the singer, songwriter and political activist Fela Kuti. He also developed a love for polo that over the years would prove almost as costly as his drug habit: He drove himself into debt more than once buying and importing polo ponies.
In the ensuing decades he was in and out of various bands, ranging from the hard-rock group Masters of Reality to a jazz trio in which his high-profile sidemen were the guitarist Bill Frisell and the bassist Charlie Haden. He was also in and out of financial trouble and moved frequently, living in England, Italy, Los Angeles and South Africa, where he settled in 1999 and stayed until returning to England in 2012.
Mr. Baker and the other members of Cream were inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 1993. The band reunited for concerts in London and New York in 2005 and received a Grammy Award for lifetime achievement in 2006.
Whatever hope there might have been for another reunion ended when Jack Bruce died in 2014.
Mr. Baker was married four times. He is survived by his wife, Kudzai Baker, a nurse from Zimbabwe with whom he lived in Kent, England, and three children: Nettie Baker, who has written several books about her relationship with him; Leda Baker, a business analyst; and Kofi Baker, a drummer. All were born in the 1960s during Mr. Baker's first marriage, to the artist Liz Finch.
In 2013, although he had serious health problems, Mr. Baker toured and recorded with a quartet whimsically named the Ginger Baker Jazz Confusion. Interviewed that year on the BBC television program "Newsnight," he claimed to have "lost everything six or seven times in my life" and suggested that the motivation for his return to music was more financial than artistic.
"I thought I'd retired," he said. "Managed to sort of outlive my pension, as it were, so I had to go back to work."
Asked in that same interview how he would like to be remembered, he paused for a moment and then gave a one-word answer:
"Drummer."

Texto completo: Readers react to an article about the skyrocketing number of images of abuse on the internet, more than 45 million last year.
To the Editor:
Re "Child Sex Abuse on the Internet: Stolen Innocence Gone Viral" ("Exploited" series, front page, Sept. 29):
I commend The Times for this explosive and honest depiction of the horrific scourge of child sexual abuse that has found an all too welcoming home on the internet.
It is only in the last few years that we have come to realize how devastating this abuse is to the victims and that survivors have found a voice to come forward. And it is only in the last two decades that law enforcement has somewhat haltingly recognized the need to attempt to deal with this abuse more aggressively. Those of us involved in treating survivors of sexual abuse and trauma realize that there are two factors that are frequently overlooked.
Abusers are extremely adept at grooming not just their victims but also the social environment in which they operate. Few who are not abused can believe that such "nice" people can possibly be guilty of such heinous behaviors. The internet adds to this ability of abusers to hide in plain sight.
Additionally, when an abuser is ultimately reported, something that happens in only a small percentage of cases, parents are reluctant to allow their children to testify against their abuser. This protectiveness by parents further emboldens abusers, who know that even if caught they are not likely to be charged.
It is only with continued vigilance, education of children and parents, and the addressing of social ills that we might someday begin to slow and ultimately halt child sexual abuse.

To the Editor:
"The Psychology of Pedophilia: Portrait of a Disorder Emerges" and "Child Sex Abuse on the Internet: Stolen Innocence Gone Viral" draw a terrifying portrait of the threat that untreated pedophiles, and pedophilia, pose to society. Unfortunately, by giving such short shrift to treatment -- and to those who seek it -- you contributed to the shame faced by people who, through no fault of their own, live with an unwelcome sexual attraction to minors. Worse, you provided these people no resources, no place to turn for help in managing unwelcome desires and urges.
This is too bad, as there are a number of communities, organizations and clinicians devoted to working with people facing these sorts of challenges. Here are just a few: B4UAct.org, a nonprofit collaboration of mental health professionals and people who are attracted to children or adolescents to help increase education and access to treatment; Association for Sexual Abuse Prevention International (asapinternational.org), a nonprofit dedicated to preventing child sexual abuse; and, of course, many well-trained psychoanalysts.
These resources can help those struggling against impulses that otherwise might lead to behavior with devastating consequences.

To the Editor:
I cannot stop thinking about your article, which says law enforcement officials are overwhelmed.
What if a task force were set up with the most brilliant minds from the tech titans of Facebook, Apple, Microsoft, Google and so on to come up with ways to find these heinous criminals and save these children's bodies and souls?
They created the platforms that enable these pedophiles; surely they know or can figure out how to find and stop them.

To the Editor:
"Child Sex Abuse on the Internet" reveals a disgraceful problem that existing governmental and corporate entities have been unable or unwilling to address. To protect, honor and love our children, we can take several remedial steps:
Fine the internet companies responsible for transmitting the images $ 100 per image (the article said there were over 45 million images out there).
Share the fine revenue dollars with third-party entities that track and report the images, such as the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, and state and federal agencies that arrest and prosecute offenders.
Confiscate the revenue of suppliers and increase prison penalties.
Fine large users and require completion of rehabilitation treatment.
Nurture the abused children.

Texto completo: "BULLSHIT" is all over the place. Any child could have looked at a TV on Wednesday afternoon and seen the forbidden word superimposed across Wolf Blitzer's tie: "SEETHING TRUMP ACCUSES REP. SCHIFF OF TREASON, DENOUNCES IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY AS 'BULLSHIT.' "
The Washington Post published "bullshit" at least five times that day and obviously continues to do so. So did other news organizations as they reported on an especially angry and profane rant by President Trump.
If the word emanated from almost any other person, it would be considered not fit for repetition, let alone mass broadcast, under the puritanical standards of decency this country is supposedly based on. But because this particular instance of "bullshit" issued from the leader of the United States, it can and possibly even must be shared verbatim with the world.
"It is newsworthy that he wrote it and tweeted it out, and we should show and say it because the president sent it out just that way," an internal CNN memo advised on Wednesday, according to the New York Times.
Before Trump's "bullshit," there was his "shithole countries," and before that, there was "grab them by the pussy" - all disseminated and debated in public as if they were the names of tax bills. Not to mention Trump's rallies, where cusses fall from his mouth liberally. The Post takes a cautious approach to profanity but decided early in the administration that the vulgar utterances of the president or his spokespeople should be reported in full.
Democrats are swearing, too, now, as if in retaliation. "F-- me," Rep. Tim Ryan (Ohio) wrote in an Aug. 5 tweet about the president, who had just misidentified the site of a mass shooting. (Ryan left the vowel out, if that makes it any more decorous.)
Presidential candidate Beto O'Rourke routinely drops f-bombs when he talks about gun violence, and his campaign sells T-shirts quoting his curses. Cory Booker's campaign manager tweeted an image of a text of Booker swearing about Trump, as if we needed to see it that badly.
The Democratic National Committee reportedly warned the candidates not to curse at last month's televised debate. Bernie Sanders and Pete Buttigieg both said "damn" anyway.
The Parents Television Council, which historically has been concerned with cleaning up Hollywood and Super Bowl halftime shows, is urging news broadcasters to be mindful of the words they quote when children might be watching.
"We are also calling on our elected and appointed officials across the political spectrum to recognize the exemplary role they play for children and to tone down the profanity and to use smarter words," the council's president, Tim Winter, said in a statement to The Post. "Perhaps our nation can use this sudden infatuation for harsh profanity as a learning moment and identify words that can more precisely identify our sentiments."
Perhaps, but it feels more as if we're drifting toward the rhetorical hellscape imagined in the movie "Idiocracy," in which President Camacho begins his State of the Union address: "S---. I know s---'s bad right now."
Columbia University linguistics professor John McWhorter thinks our sweary public discourse reflects evolving standards of decency as much as the president's potty mouth.
"What genuinely registers as profane to most Americans is now slurs rather than references to bodily matters such as sex," he said. "It's natural that serious public figures will use the classic four-letter words ever more to signal authenticity. But Trump's unmonitored speech has mainstreamed such words in the media even faster of late, in that the urgency of reporting the appalling things he says requires that 'shithole country' and 'I'm fucked' end up all over the news."
No other president has cursed like Trump: publicly, constantly and even somewhat creatively, as when he dubbed Rep. Adam B. Schiff, the Democratic chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, "little Adam Schitt." On Saturday, he tweeted that Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) was a "pompous 'ass' who has been fighting me from the beginning."
His predecessors were hardly altar boys, but they tended to swear sparingly or exclusively in private. Abraham Lincoln liked to tell a joke about George Washington's effect on an Englishman's bowels. George W. Bush was once caught on a hot mic calling a reporter a "major league asshole," and Barack Obama joked to the U.S. women's soccer team: "Playing like a girl means you're a badass. Perhaps I shouldn't have used that phrase."
The White House tapes that helped bring down Richard Nixon were full of curses and racial slurs, but it notably took congressional intervention and a subpoena before the public could hear any of them. Trump just gives his profanity away - freely seeding it across the cultural landscape.
"This is very different. We're coming to a point where it's not unusual at all to hear politicians and TV hosts cursing," said Julian Zelizer, a presidential historian at Princeton University. "If the president is doing it, that becomes totally legitimate, totally normalized. There's no hot mic needed because they'll just do it right in your face."

Texto completo: President Trump's critics are now complaining that he asked the Australian prime minister to cooperate with the Justice Department's investigation into the origins of the Mueller probe and that Attorney General William Barr has traveled overseas to ask foreign intelligence officials to cooperate with that investigation. The New York Times called it another example of "the president using high-level diplomacy to advance his personal political interests."
No, it's not. The president's critics are conflating two different things: the investigation by Trump's private lawyer, Rudolph Giuliani, into Hunter Biden's business dealings, and the official inquiry by U.S. Attorney John Durham into the counterintelligence investigation directed at the Trump campaign during the 2016 election. The former is opposition research activity; the latter is a criminal justice matter.
There is absolutely nothing wrong with asking foreign heads of state or intelligence officials to cooperate with an official Justice Department investigation. As George Washington University law professor Jonathan Turley explains, "It is not uncommon for an attorney general, or even a president, to ask foreign leaders to assist with ongoing investigations. Such calls can shortcut bureaucratic red tape, particularly if the evidence is held, as in this case, by national security or justice officials."
Americans support the Durham probe. For two years, they were told by Trump's opponents that the president was "working on behalf of the Russians" and had committed "treasonous" acts that were of "a size and scope probably beyond Watergate." Those were serious accusations, and Americans took them seriously. They waited for special counsel Robert Mueller to tell them whether the president had indeed betrayed the country.
Then Mueller issued his report, and they found out that none of it was true. They understandably wanted answers. How did it come to pass that our government was paralyzed for two years and spent tens of millions of their tax dollars, chasing a Trump-Russia collusion conspiracy theory? A Harvard CAPS-Harris Poll following the Mueller report's public release found that 53% of Americans said that "bias against President Trump in the FBI played a role in launching investigations against him," and 62% supported appointing a special counsel to investigate the investigation of Trump.
Instead of a special counsel, Barr appointed Durham, a career prosecutor, to lead the investigation that Americans demanded. Durham is a man of unimpeachable character who was appointed by Obama administration Attorney General Eric Holder to investigate the CIA's terrorist interrogation program. At the conclusion of that probe, which ended without any criminal charges, Holder praised Durham for working "tirelessly to conduct an extraordinarily thorough and complete" investigation.
Now Barr has asked Durham to bring the same tireless professionalism to his investigation into the origins of the Mueller probe. But suddenly, all those who were so eager to find out what happened in 2016 when they thought Mueller would reveal that Trump conspired with the Russians have lost interest. The same people who were outraged at Trump's efforts
See Thiessen/Page f3
to discredit the Mueller probe are now doing the exact same thing to the Durham probe. Back then, Democrats insisted Trump stop criticizing the investigation and "let Mueller follow the facts wherever they lead." Now they need to heed their own advice: Stop criticizing the investigation. Let Durham follow the facts wherever they lead. If there was no wrongdoing, then there is nothing to worry about.
To be sure, Trump bears some responsibility for helping Democrats lump together Durham's official investigation with Giuliani's partisan activities by mentioning them both on the call with Ukraine's president. There should be a firewall between the two inquiries. Instead, Trump and Giuliani have blurred those lines.
But keep in mind, it was the Democrats who told us there is nothing wrong or illegal with a presidential candidate hiring a private lawyer to conduct opposition research in a foreign country on their political opponents. After it emerged that the Clinton campaign and the DNC had paid Christopher Steele to dig up dirt in Russia on Trump, the Democrats' defense was: That's just opposition research. Everyone does it. The biggest problem with the Steele dossier was not that Democrats paid for opposition research, but that the FBI might have used it as the basis for spying on the Trump campaign -- which is part of what Durham is investigating.
Durham is no partisan actor. Despite political pressure, he cleared the CIA of wrongdoing during the Obama administration. Like Mueller, he will follow the facts wherever they lead. Maybe that is why so many Democrats are up in arms.

Texto completo: What is the Midwest? Is Minnesota in it? How about Ohio? Or the Dakotas?
To many Minnesotans, the answers might seem obvious. But there is actually quite a bit of disagreement over which states are truly part of the Midwest. Several people have contacted Curious Minnesota, the Star Tribune's community-driven reporting project serving inquisitive readers, for an answer.
On a map, Minnesota appears roughly midway between the coasts, surrounded by a cluster of states far from either ocean. Minnesota is in the approximate center of the Central Time Zone. The Mississippi River, long the symbolic dividing line between "the East" and "the West," runs through Minnesota. Minnesotans speak in the Midwestern vernacular -- for example, we call carbonated soft drinks "pop."
Defining the Midwest, it turns out, is not as geographically simple as it might seem. In fact, it's not even entirely about geography.
In 2016, the news-explainer website Vox invited readers to name the states that they think compose the Midwest. States receiving the most votes were Minnesota, Iowa, Indiana, Illinois, Wisconsin, Ohio, Michigan, Missouri, Nebraska, Kansas and both Dakotas.
Those are the same states the U.S. Census Bureau, which divides the country into four regions, refers to as the Midwest.
In a recent (and ongoing) poll by the online publication CityLab, readers who identify as Midwestern were asked where they live. Respondents supplied ZIP codes, not states, so the resulting map includes numerous scattered blobs, mostly surrounding cities. But they're also concentrated in those same states.
Yet some places have fuzzier identities, noted David Montgomery, the St. Paul-based CityLab journalist who conducted the survey. Cities such as Pittsburgh, Louisville, Oklahoma City and Rapid City, S.D., are considered sort of Midwestern but are also associated with other regions of the country.
Which brings us to a definition of "the Midwest" that isn't a clump of states, but a land of specific demographics, economies, culture or values.
In July, a New York Times editor tweeted that U.S. Reps. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., and Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., are not "from the Midwest" -- despite their actually being, well, from the Midwest. The tweet was widely denounced as racist and the editor was demoted, but the episode showed that there are people who think a Midwestern identity rests on a particular ethnicity or political viewpoint.
What if, instead of shying away from the label, Midwesterners proudly embraced it -- but on their own terms? The Midwest is large and contains multitudes: people with Norwegian ancestors and others with Somali ancestors; farm fields as well as skyscrapers; Lizzo and the Chmielewski Funtime Band. Someday the Midwest could be considered so cool that beverage drinkers across the country will even call pop by its correct name.

'What you saw is what you got': Kavanaugh marks one year on Supreme Court

Texto completo: Justice Brett Kavanaugh will mark one year on the Supreme Court on Sunday, an anniversary that follows a contentious confirmation fight roiled by allegations of sexual assault and doomsday warnings that life for Americans would be altered due to the high court's new conservative majority.
But Kavanaugh's first year on the Supreme Court didn't yield the seismic shifts predicted. That could change, however, when the justices gather Monday for the start of their next term, which is filled with blockbuster cases involving immigration, abortion, and LGBT rights. Then, Kavanaugh's presence on the bench — and Justice Anthony Kennedy's absence — could be acutely felt for the first time.
Instead, for many court watchers, his inaugural year as a Supreme Court justice differed little from his 12 years as a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, considered the second-most powerful court in the country.
“We're seeing him carry out the same kind of decision-making that he did on the D.C. Circuit, which is consistently approaching the Constitution in a conservative, originalist, textualist manner,” Carrie Severino, chief counsel at the Judicial Crisis Network, said.
Kavanaugh, 54, was sworn in as a Supreme Court justice just hours after the Senate, in a Saturday session, confirmed his nomination in a narrow 50-48 vote. His first move was to hire four female clerks, becoming the first Supreme Court justice to have all-women clerks. By that Tuesday, the newest member of the court was on the bench, participating in arguments in cases involving the Armed Career Criminal Act.
Within the marble halls of One First St., it was business as usual. The justices seemed to play up the collegiality they are known for even as demonstrators protested Kavanaugh’s confirmation outside. Justice Sonia Sotomayor playfully pinched Justice Neil Gorsuch during one line of questioning, and Justice Elena Kagan could be seen conversing with Kavanaugh, whom she had hired at Harvard Law School, before the start of oral arguments.
Severino, who co-authored a book on Kavanaugh’s confirmation process, said many of the justices were “marveling” at the ability of their newest colleague to transition from the fierceness of the confirmation battle to participating in oral arguments a mere two days later.
“It’s really amazing when you’re thinking back on this time last year,” she said. “How on earth do you go from this insane, crazy process to sitting on a week of intense Supreme Court cases virtually overnight?”
Kavanaugh was nominated by President Trump to the Supreme Court in July 2018 following the retirement of Justice Anthony Kennedy, who was the court’s swing vote for more than a decade. The nomination kicked off a bruising confirmation battle, as Kavanaugh’s appointment cemented a conservative 5-4 majority on the Supreme Court.
But the already contentious fight was roiled by accusations from Christine Blasey Ford, a professor from California, that Kavanaugh allegedly sexually assaulted her during a small gathering at a house in suburban Maryland in 1982. Kavanaugh vehemently denied the accusations from Ford and two other women who stepped forward with claims of misconduct.
The FBI conducted a supplemental background investigation into Ford’s allegations, but the probe yielded no corroboration.
The accusations, however, cast a shadow over Kavanaugh’s first year on the Supreme Court and have continued to plague him. Last month, several Democrats running for president called for impeachment proceedings against Kavanaugh after the New York Times published a new allegation of sexual misconduct against him, though the alleged victim had no recollection of the incident.
“It’ll always be an addendum,” said Erwin Chemerinsky, dean of Berkeley Law, who said the parallels between Justice Clarence Thomas and Kavanaugh’s confirmations are “striking.”
“I think that as long as Brett Kavanaugh is on the bench, this will be part of how we see him, just like it’ll always be for Clarence Thomas,” he said. “What we can’t tell is how it will affect Brett Kavanaugh as a justice. One year is not enough to see.”
Severino, though, doesn’t believe the accusations or continued pressure will move Kavanaugh.
“He’s going to just continue as the judge he was,” she said. “He wouldn’t want to change in one direction or the other in response to it, not turn into a reactionary, not roll over and just give in.”
While experts contend one term on the Supreme Court is not enough to predict what Kavanaugh’s legacy as a justice will be, his dozen years on the high court were a north star.
“So far his record as a Supreme Court justice is in line with what kind of judge he was on the D.C. Circuit and what we thought he would be on the Supreme Court,” said Elizabeth Slattery, a legal fellow at The Heritage Foundation. “It’s early days.”
Still, in the major cases the justices heard last term, including a challenge to Trump’s decision to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census and a pair of partisan gerrymandering cases, Kavanaugh voted with his conservative colleagues.
“What you saw is what you got,” Severino said. “This is part of the reason we have a vetting process that tries to ensure you’ve got someone who has a record on the court, because you know what kind of approach they have to the law.”
In the months following his highly contentious confirmation battle, Kavanaugh appears to have kept a relatively low profile.
He has given public remarks only once, at the annual meeting of the 7th Circuit Bar Association in May, where he appeared alongside Kennedy, for whom he clerked. He is scheduled to speak at The Federalist Society's National Lawyers Convention Antonin Scalia Memorial Dinner in November.
This summer, the justice taught a two-week course in England for George Mason University’s Antonin Scalia Law School. Students protested his hiring, but the school stood by its decision to hire Kavanaugh.
On the bench, Kavanaugh voted with the majority 91% of the time, the highest of the justices, according to data compiled by Adam Feldman, who analyzes the court. He also agreed with Chief Justice John Roberts in 92% of cases.
Kavanaugh and Justice Neil Gorsuch, who Trump named to the Supreme Court in 2017, agreed in 70% of cases, putting their agreement level toward the bottom among pairs of justices named by the same president in their first term together in the last 50 years, according to Feldman.
“It sort of shows that people who talk about them as though they’re these cookie-cutter, Republican red-meat judges, they are independent, impartial justices with fully developed views of the law,” Slattery said, “and that does not always lead them to the same results.”
All of the conservative justices, including Kavanaugh, joined the court’s liberal bloc at least once for a five-vote majority, Feldman found.
While Kavanaugh joined the high court early in its term, Chemerinsky noted his first year was “unusual because the Supreme Court ducked so many of the hard cases.”
“Because of the cases on the docket this term and because he’s going to be on the bench for the whole term, we’ll get much of a sense of Brett Kavanaugh’s jurisprudence,” he said.
The Supreme Court is set to hear cases involving LGBT rights, Trump’s efforts to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, and the Second Amendment, and is weighing whether to take up numerous legal disputes involving abortion.
The first set of blockbuster cases will come Tuesday, when the justices hear arguments in three cases involving whether Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, which bars workplace discrimination on the basis of sex, provides protections for gay and transgender employees.
The cases, Chemerinsky said, “will show us, is Kavanaugh going to follow in Justice Kennedy’s lead in that important area, or is Justice Kavanaugh going to be significantly more conservative than Justice Kennedy?”
Kennedy, the court’s swing vote for decades, authored the majority opinions in all the major gay rights cases decided by the Supreme Court.
The high court begins its term Monday.

Texto completo: Medios de comunicación en Kansas City confirmaron que las víctimas mortales del tiroteo en un bar de Kansas City eran de ascendencia hispana.
Alfredo Calderón, Everaldo Meza y Francisco García Anaya fueron identificados entre los muertos por familiares y amigos de acuerdo con la estación KSHB. Se desconoce el nombre de la otra víctima. El tiroteo dejó cinco heridos.
El suceso, que también dejó cinco heridos, se produjo poco antes de la 1:30 a.m. De acuerdo con el New York Times, un hombre fue retirado del bar Tequila KC después de que arrojara un vaso de plástico a un cantinero que no quiso servirle por su mala conducta. El sujeto además peleó con otro cliente.
El sospechoso volvió minutos después acompañado de otro hombre y abrió fuego dentro del bar. Según la información, el sujeto ya había causado problemas un semana antes. El bar no contaba con su guardia de seguridad armado en esta ocasión.
La Policía descartó un crimen de odio por los testimonios recogidos con los sobrevivientes. También reveló imágenes de los sospechosos tomadas de cámaras de vigilancia.
Las edades de los muertos oscilan entre los 20 y los 50 años. El canciller de México Marcelo Ebrard dijo que dos de las víctimas son ciudadanos de ese país.
Les comunico que hay dos mexicanos fallecidos en Kansas, extendemos el más sentido pésame del Gobierno de México a sus familiares y amigos”, dijo Ebrard en un mensaje en Twitter.
“Tendrán nuestro apoyo sus familias”, añadió, al indicar que se esperan datos sobre “quiénes y por qué perpetraron este crimen”.
El bar es un establecimiento privado que solo admite a quienes son miembros. En su web, se describe como “un bar de barrio con bebidas frías y gente fantástica” y su menú incluye tacos, burritos, nachos y pizzas.

Texto completo: Un agente de la Patrulla Fronteriza (CBP) fue arrestado en Tucson, Arizona, por atacar sexualmente a una de sus compañeras de trabajo.
De acuerdo con el New York Times, Gus Zamora, de 51 años y asignado al sector de Yuma, fue arrestado y acusado en junio pasado. El hombre está casado con Gloria Chávez, otra agente de la CBP que es vista como un modelo a seguir para las mujeres que trabajan o quieren trabajar en la institución.
A Zamora se le permitió retirarse de la CBP después que se conoció el arrestó, algo que ha sido criticado por activistas y litigantes.
Según la información, Zamora invitó a la colega, identificada en documentos de corte como R.W., a cenar en mayo pasado. La mujer dijo que el hombre empezó con coqueteos desde antes de la cena al enviar un mensaje de texto que decía “te arreglaste para mí “.
Los agentes estuvieron acompañados por un rato de Roy Villareal, otro miembro de la CBP , amigo de Zamora y supervisor de la denunciante. La mujer dice que el agente, a quien ella veía como un mentor, comenzó a pedir licor al punto que ella se emborrachó y perdió la consciencia. Una mesera dijo que el hombre insistía bastante para que la mujer bebiera.
La denuncia dice que Zamora llevó a la colega a su habitación en un hotel en Tucson, a donde había ido desde El Centro, California, y allí la habría abusado. El agente dijo a los investigadores que había ofrecido llevar a la mujer a su casa, pero que ella le dijo que no quería esta sola y le pidió que la llevara al hotel .
La mujer dijo que recuerda despertar en la habitación varias veces, pero que nunca tuvo conciencia para dar consentimiento a relaciones sexuales.

Villareal dijo a los investigadores que mientras estuvo con sus colegas no vio nada sospechoso.
R.W. llamaría horas después a Zamora para decirle que ella pensaba que lo ocurrido no fue consentido. El hombre le dijo que no fueran tan lejos.
El agente se ha excusado en su avanzado estado de embriaguez desde que empezó la investigación .
“Tampoco estaba en un estado para dar consentimiento”, dijo Zamora a un detective.

Texto completo: Medios de comunicación en Kansas City confirmaron que las víctimas mortales del tiroteo en un bar de Kansas City eran de ascendencia hispana.
Alfredo Calderón, Everaldo Meza y Francisco García Anaya fueron identificados entre los muertos por familiares y amigos de acuerdo con la estación KSHB. Se desconoce el nombre de la otra víctima. El tiroteo dejó cinco heridos.
El suceso, que también dejó cinco heridos, se produjo poco antes de la 1:30 a.m. De acuerdo con el New York Times, un hombre fue retirado del bar Tequila KC después de que arrojara un vaso de plástico a un cantinero que no quiso servirle por su mala conducta. El sujeto además peleó con otro cliente.
El sospechoso volvió minutos después acompañado de otro hombre y abrió fuego dentro del bar. Según la información, el sujeto ya había causado problemas un semana antes. El bar no contaba con su guardia de seguridad armado en esta ocasión.
La Policía descartó un crimen de odio por los testimonios recogidos con los sobrevivientes. También reveló imágenes de los sospechosos tomadas de cámaras de vigilancia.
Las edades de los muertos oscilan entre los 20 y los 50 años. El canciller de México Marcelo Ebrard dijo que dos de las víctimas son ciudadanos de ese país.
Les comunico que hay dos mexicanos fallecidos en Kansas, extendemos el más sentido pésame del Gobierno de México a sus familiares y amigos”, dijo Ebrard en un mensaje en Twitter.
“Tendrán nuestro apoyo sus familias”, añadió, al indicar que se esperan datos sobre “quiénes y por qué perpetraron este crimen”.
El bar es un establecimiento privado que solo admite a quienes son miembros. En su web, se describe como “un bar de barrio con bebidas frías y gente fantástica” y su menú incluye tacos, burritos, nachos y pizzas.

Texto completo: The Tokyo 2020 Olympics are almost here – and if you're going to the games next summer, or simply want to soak up the Olympics-tinged atmosphere, you should start planning your journey.
You probably have a lot of questions. But no need to fret, dear travelers: We're here to answer everything we can.
Here's a guide to all your Tokyo-related travel questions ahead of the 2020 Olympics:
When are the Olympics? July 24 to Aug. 9. U.S. travelers can still get a ticket, but only as part of a package. CoSport, the U.S. Olympics tickets retailer, is sold out of individual tickets but is waiting to see if it will receive more. You can sign up for their email list.Packages are available on its website that include tickets and hotel accommodation. One cheaper price, for a doubles trip, is $4,471.50 per person (for a three-night, four-event package from July 27-30).
But you might want to hurry up: "Packages are still available but are running scarce," Patricia Sweeney, a CoSport customer care associate told USA TODAY in an email.
When should I book flights for the Tokyo Olympics? There are always deals to be had, according to Darci Valiente, a U.S. flight searcher for Scott's Cheap Flights. Valiente recommends booking at least six months in advance. "Because it's for the Olympics, prices will be even more expensive than they already are for peak travel season," Valiente told USA TODAY.
Catherine Heald, CEO and co-founder of Asia tour operator Remote Lands, recommends flying into Haneda Airport as it's closest to the city center. Tokyo's other airport is Narita International Airport.
How much should people expect to pay? Valiente recommends looking for flights under $800, depending on where they are in the U.S.
And don't necessarily set your sights on flying directly into Tokyo. "We saw flights to Osaka for peak summer more (numerous) than Toyko – so be flexible about where you fly into and consider taking the train," Valiente says.
Marian Goldberg, The New York Times Travel Show Japan travel expert, recommends booking through a Japanese or Chinese travel agency if you're connecting from Beijing or Shanghai.
Right now, flight prices are more expensive if you want to be in Tokyo for the first few days of the games and the opening ceremony, according to Valiente. The prices drop in the middle to the end of the games. Travelers looking to make a 10- to 14-day excursion may want to stagger their journey so they arrive early and leave in the middle of the games, or arrive in the middle of the games and depart post-Olympics.
Where should I stay? Travelers have a number of options, including opting for a nearby city like Yokohama, which Amy Tadehara, a senior travel consultant at Inside Japan Tours, refers to as "Tokyo's cosmopolitan younger sibling." Hop on a train between the two in less than 40 minutes.
Edward Granville, chief operating officer at luxury travel company Red Savannah recommends booking with one of the event's official travel partners and says that the best hotels usually give up their inventory to these groups.
"Despite a construction book in preparation to the Olympics, Tokyo is looking at a massive accommodation shortfall," Japan event travel expert Alan Omlin and long-time Tokyo resident says. The Mizuho Research Institute points to a 14,000-room shortfall for the city.
Airbnb has a reduced presence in the city thanks to a law restricting Airbnb rentals. Michael Matsuo, a spokesperson for Airbnb, said some hosts haven't made their calendars open to book yet – though a search during the Olympics period for one guest warranted more than 300 places to stay, varying wildly in price.
If you decide to book a hotel, know that most Japanese hotels don't let more than three (or even two) people in one room. Rooms are also more expensive, according to Goldberg. "In fact, all Japanese-style accommodations charge per person and not per room," Goldberg says.
Chef Hiroki Odo, owner and chef of o.d.o by ODO, the speakeasy kaiseki restaurant in New York's Flatiron neighborhood, recommends a ryokan (traditional Japanese inn).
Besides the Olympics, what should I do in Tokyo? Shibuya Crossing Who knew a crosswalk could double as a tourist attraction? But Shibuya Crossing could be the world's busiest, according to Lonely Planet, noting that at peak times upwards of 3,000 people cross at a time. It's a scramble intersection, which means all vehicle traffic is stopped to allow pedestrians to cross in every direction, including diagonally, at the same time.
Mount Fuji Although Mount Fuji technically isn't in Tokyo, it's just a short car, bus or train ride to the active volcano, which is also Japan's tallest mountain. Visitors can explore trails from early July to early September.
Animal cafes Tokyo has developed a worldwide reputation for its animal cafes. In addition to getting food and drink, visitors to the cafe are treated to interaction with cute, tame animals, such as hedgehogs, meerkats and ferrets. It's a dream come true for animal lovers.
Other notable sights Takao Nishina, travel agency GetYourGuide's regional manager for Japan, recommends the Tokyo Skytree, the tallest broadcast tower in the world, as well as the Ghibli Museum for animation fanatics and the Samurai Museum.
What else should I do? Hakone: "Tucked up in the mountains, it's a beautiful hideaway with a gondola that goes up into the mountains and a boat ride tour that sails the gorgeous Ashino Lake," Jay Allen, the publisher of website Unseen Japan, told USA TODAY. Tadehara from Inside Japan Tours says that Hakone's elevation is a pleasant break from Tokyo's summer heat.
Kyoto: Travelers can take a bullet train to "the cultural heart of Japan," Tadehara says. Nearly 2,000 temples and shrines are in the city.
Osaka or Hiroshima: Tadehara adds that you can take a day trip to see foodie haven Osaka or even Hiroshima, where the first atomic bomb dropped.
Yokohama: Check out Minato Mirai, a portside area that has "spectacular fireworks" in the summer, according to Allen.
Kamakura: Go here to see Komachi-dori, "a rich shopping section filled with small shops and restaurants; the Great Buddha of Kamakura at the Kotoku Temple, which has been preserved from the 13th century until today; and the oceanside shoreline of Kamakura which offers spectacular sunsets," Allen says.
Getting around The city is easy to get around via public transportation, though taxis are an affordable option. "Taxis are easy to get, most take credit cards, and they can be used affordably for short distances within a neighborhood," Goldberg says. "It's just really expensive to take a taxi to transfer between distant regions."

In dishes both classic and modern, East Ender impresses The service can be spotty, but never the food.

Texto completo: Consistency might not thrill in a way that sends your pulse bounding, but that's sort of the point. There is something powerful, almost biological about our attraction to stability. Especially when we're in need of comfort, we crave how the reliable parts of our universe soothe us.
We feel more secure when we're not improvising all the time, when we're napping in our favorite pajamas, following a regular route to work or swapping stories with our oldest friends. And it's not just humans who respond to routine: Make the same gentle, deliberate movements for a few weeks and (with enough tuna) you might slowly earn the trust of a stray cat. Our capacity for thrill-seeking gets the good press, but at our core, we are all creatures with a genetic appreciation for certainty.
Bill Leavy, c o-owner and co-executive chef of East Ender understands this well. "That's the only way to run a neighborhood restaurant, a place where people come in weekly, semi-weekly, sometimes more than that," he said. "Consistency. It's what we want to be known for at the end of the day. We want things for everybody to be as good as the last time they were here, and if they order a special, we want them to know it'll be good."
Leavy and his collaborator, Karl Deuben, have been striving for such steadiness since they converted Small Axe, their former food truck, into East Ender, a casual New American bistro, nearly five years ago.
No surprise then that several of the dishes on the menu are similar to those offered when our then-critic wrote a four-star review of East Ender in 2015. Perhaps the biggest changes made to the bi-level, 80-seater have been to its interior design. After a major renovation two years ago, layers of character and charm have been overlaid on its previously drowsy dining spaces - especially in the smaller downstairs room, where antique mirrors, brass chandeliers and a dark-toned paint job make the restaurant feel descended from a dreamy, nautical heritage.
The gauzy, pleasingly ersatz nostalgic sensibility is only amplified by the soundtrack of 1940s crooners piped in overhead. "This music is making me feel like grappa," a man at a neighboring table told his date. "Frank Sinatra always makes me want a little glass of grappa after dinner."
But our mutual server, who also said she was the bartender, wasn't familiar with the high-octane grape distillate. First, she brought our neighbor a bottle of cassis (a syrupy black currant liqueur), then, after asking, "is grappa the one that tastes like licorice?" gave up and offered a shot of Fernet Branca, describing it as "earthy and made from a root or something." Too polite to refuse, he accepted, then pulled out his phone to look up Fernet when our server left the room. "It's disgusting," he whispered, wincing. "But I don't want to offend her. I can tell she's trying hard."
Indeed, despite a sticky table on one recent visit, and on another, no fork and knife served with the ever-fantastic cold-smoked house cheeseburger with crisp, triple-cooked French fries ($16), service is unfailingly friendly and genuine. It may not always hit the mark, but in its imperfection, service at East Ender is perfectly consistent.
Fortunately, Deuben and Leavy's cooking more than makes up for wobbly service.
Bistro classics shine particularly brightly, especially dishes like chicken rillettes - sort of a mayonnaise-less chicken salad of finely pulled braised thigh meat blended with its own rendered fat, along with parsley, chives and tarragon ($7) - or a crustless chocolate torte prepared pte-Ã -bombe-style, its rich density generated from bubbling sugar whisked into whipped egg yolks ($9).
But East Ender's slightly modernized dishes also impress. Everything from practically weightless gnocchi (really ricotta gnudi), sprinkled with aromatic fried sage leaves and left to luxuriate in a shallow dish of tender, savory mushroom ragu ($15), to a Caesar salad where pecorino Romano replaces Parmesan, delivering fillips of musky tang offset by a barely-set poached egg and brittle pain-de-mie croutons ($10). Deuben and Leavy also pitch-shift the source of the salad's ample umami flavor by substituting shavings of bottarga for the most of the dressing's anchovies.
The duo's collective understanding of flavor even allows them to go a little off-piste, as they do in their Asian-inspired slaw, where thinly shredded red and green cabbage, toasted peanuts and sesame seeds are tossed with a tart, funky vinaigrette of soy, ginger and sesame oil ($10).
And while braised pork shoulder on cheesy grits ($17) may not sound terribly adventurous, East Ender's take on the dish incorporates what Leavy describes as "our weird take on an agrodolce": an orange glaze punched up with Sriracha. Painted onto the collapsingly tender pork and caramelized onto the cut surfaces of cipollini onions, it imparts prickles of heat and a lilting sweetness. This, more than perhaps any other dish on the menu, expresses what East Ender does best: It presents you with something hearty and familiar enough to lure you into taking a bite, then deliberately (but always gently) startles you into taking another.

'GREATEST SHOWMAN' HUGH JACKMAN BRINGS ARENA TOUR TO PITTSBURGH

Texto completo: Hugh Jackman knows how to play to a crowd. He gives his all and gets love in return.
For that, he's hosted prestige awards ceremonies and attracted devoted fans from Broadway to Hollywood.
So a world tour of arenas should be a cinch, right?
The entertainer in him had to find out, and now, so will Pittsburghers, when his world tour "The Man. The Music. The Show." lands in PPG Paints Arena, Uptown.
Backed by a live orchestra and dancers, with giant screens, a central runway and the spectacle worthy of "The Greatest Showman," Jackman will offer up a show that requires the stamina of the muscle-bound mutant Wolverine, his signature screen role in a series of X-Men films.
If you know him only when his claws are out, wait till you see his energy in a live performance - although he may need some of Wolverine's self-healing skills when he arrives in Pittsburgh.
On Sept. 28, Jackman hosted the throng of thousands gathered for the Global Citizens Festival on Central Park's Great Lawn in New York City - a 10-hour live event held on five continents, broadcast live from cities around the world.
If nothing else, Jackman certainly has built up a ton of good will. The actor - who turns 50 on Oct. 12 - is known for living up to his reputation as a nice guy and backing it up with triple-threat talent. His megawatt charisma, so seductive in his Broadway shows, jumped off the screen in the movie musical "The Greatest Showman."
In his Tony-winning "The Boy From Oz" - for which he also won the Fred Astaire Award as the Broadway season's best dancer - he inhabited the singer-songwriter Peter Allen, a fellow Australian whose flamboyance and charisma sold out Radio City Music Hall for a week in 1981.
Next came "Hugh Jackman Back on Broadway," after which he won a special Tony for his "service" to the theater community as a one-man ticket magnet.
He's returning to Broadway next year, opposite the great Sutton Foster in "The Music Man," and tickets are already flying into eager hands.
So Jackman doesn't have to do arena shows to feel the love in person. But for perhaps the hardest-working man in show biz, this is yet another performance mountain to conquer.
Oh, sure, he has the time since hanging up his claws as Wolverine in the R-rated "Logan" (a 93%/90% score from critics/moviegoers on Rotten Tomatoes). He also has an Oscar nomination for "Les Miserables," and although critics weren't particularly kind to another movie musical, "The Greatest Showman," fans ignored them and embraced him, sending the soundtrack soaring to platinum status.
Plus, with songs by Justin Paul and Benj Pasek ("Dear Evan Hansen"), "The Greatest Showman" won the Grammy Award as best compilation soundtrack for visual media. Those songs will be front and center in "The Man. The Music. The Show," along with songs from "The Boy From Oz," his Academy Award-nominated turn as Jean Valjean in "Les Miserables" and more.
You'll also get to witness the Oscar-nominated Golden Globe-winning anthemic song "This Is Me," sung by Keala Settle of "The Greatest Showman." The Broadway singer joins Jackman for just the current leg of his arena tour.
"The Man," however, is the main event.
In a much smaller venue for "Hugh Jackman: Back on Broadway," the "concert residency" by the Australian actor was directed and choreographed by Warren Carlyle, who directs him in the current "Show."
In The New York Times, Ben Brantley called that 2011-12 show "a dream date" and, to paraphrase, a safe-sex one-night stand. The jokes were corny, at times eye-rollingly so, but even that seemed charming coming from Jackman.
In case you can't tell by now, here's where I admit that I am a fan of Hugh Jackman live. If you know me at all, then you know that about me.
How Jackman's energy, talent and audience engagement translate from relatively small Broadway theaters to an arena-sized spectacle remains to be seen. I can't wait to find out.

Texto completo: An imagined conversation between Flyover Man and Urban Guy.
URBAN GUY: I hope you read the rough transcript of that Trump phone call with the Ukrainian president. Trump clearly used public power to ask a foreign leader to dig up dirt on his political opponent. This is impeachable. I don't see how you can deny the facts in front of your face.
FLYOVER MAN: I haven't really had time to look into it. There's always some fight between Trump and the East Coast media. I guess I just try to stay focused on the big picture.
The big picture is this: We knew this guy was a snake when we signed up. But he was the only one who saw us. He was the only one who saw that the America we love is being transformed in front of our eyes. Good jobs for hardworking people were gone. Our communities in tatters. Our kids in trouble. I had one shot at change, so I made a deal with the devil, and you'd have made it, too.
Nothing in this impeachment mess makes me rethink this bargain. If people like you are unable to acknowledge my dignity and see my problems, I'll stay with Trump.
U.G.: The big picture? The big picture is the U.S. Constitution. It's no man is above the law. We can't live in a country in which our leaders flagrantly commit high crimes and nothing happens.
F.M.: I get it. He said some stupid crap on a phone call. But are you going to undo my vote for that? I wouldn't even rank this among the top 25 worst things he's done, and I'm a supporter of his!
Listen, do you remember those months just after the election when people like you were briefly curious about people like me? You sent your reporters out on wild safaris into the hinterlands to interview Trump voters. You read "Hillbilly Elegy." Back then it was fashionable to say that Trump is just a symptom of real problems in America. He's the wrong answer to the right question.
It didn't take you long to lose interest in all that. Now we're just a block of concrete you call "his base." Now, all you care about is Trump, not his supporters or the issues driving us. Your whole media is Trump-O-Centric.
U.G.: We became Trump-O-Centric because his daily outrages undermine norms, spread xenophobia, degrade public morality.
F.M.: You think that because you have the kind of jobs that allow you to follow Twitter all day. I don't have that luxury. So all that passing nonsense seems far away. I have to deal with the actual realities of life.
One, mass immigration is changing my town, region and state. Two, the cultural liberalism you preach but don't practice is leading to the breakdown of families up and down my block. Children out of wedlock. Young men with no dad when they're young and no wife in their life when they're grown. Third, an Ivy League elite running government and the economy for itself and shutting out those of us who actually make things with our hands. Fourth, China is replacing us.
U.G.: I'm happy to talk about these big problems.
F.M.: Like hell you are. The media fixates on scandals because they're easier to talk about than complex issues like why urban and rural America are drifting further apart. You wasted billions of hours speculating about the Mueller report, and now news about Adam Schiff overshadows everything else while my world burns. Let's face it: Bashing Trump is the media's business model. That's what drives eyeballs and profit.
U.G.: We can't have a productive conversation with Trump around. He lies with abandon. He slanders and insults. He pollutes the water near and far.
F.M.: We can't have productive conversations if every time I open my mouth you call me a bigot. You may not realize this, but you have Trump supporters around you all the time. It's just that we've learned to keep our mouths shut in your presence. The crushing climate of blue cultural privilege is too strangulating.
U.G.: OK, I get it. You're not the first person to spin the right-wing victim narrative in front of me. Why don't we focus on impeachment? On rule of law.
F.M.: Fine. Bottom line: I would be open to impeachment if you cared about my problems. I'd be open if all those silent Republican dissenters in the Senate had given me some GOP alternative candidate who speaks our language and addresses our issues. I'd be open if there was a moderate Democratic Party that I thought deserved a shot. But I only see Democrats who'd make everything worse: Open the border! Socialism! More power to Washington! You could have paid attention to the forces driving Trumpism, but you ignored us.
So please don't ask us to sign up for our own obliteration or support your impeachment. This is about identity and pride.
Here's a confession. I used to think Trump was a jerk. Now, after three years of battle, I see him as my captain. He deserves my loyalty, thick and thin.
See ya' in hell, brother.

Democratic donor and accused killer Ed Buck finally arrested: John Phillips

Texto completo: The state of California is home to some of the most infamous serial killers in U.S. history — from the Manson Family, to the Freeway Killers, all the way to the Grim Sleeper.
Well, another accused killer is now awaiting trial in California. This time it’s prolific Democratic donor and West Hollywood resident Ed Buck.
Buck was finally arrested by Los Angeles County Sheriff’s deputies and charged with operating a drug house, as well as providing methamphetamine to a 37 year-old man who suffered an overdose at Buck’s apartment.
This incident was the third known time a man suffered a meth overdose at Buck’s home. The previous two alleged victims, Gemmel Moore and Timothy Dean, did not survive.
Days later, the feds announced that they too would be prosecuting Buck — this time on one count of distribution of methamphetamine resulting in death.
At a press conference, U.S. Attorney Nick Hanna said investigators found 10 more victims, nine of whom said Buck, “administered drugs to them or strongly encouraged them to ingest narcotics as part of agreements to be compensated for sexual services.”
The case is now generating national and international headlines; and I’m noticing that three false storylines seem to be emerging, and they need to be corrected.
First, The New York Times tried to minimize Buck’s power and influence by referring to him as “a small-time Democratic donor and political activist.”
That’s like calling Harvey Weinstein a “love-sick teenager.”
According to federal records, Buck has contributed more than $500,000 to Democratic candidates and groups, and was classified by the California Secretary of State’s office as being a “major donor.”
Before he was nicknamed ‘Dr. Kevorkian’ by his West Hollywood neighbors, Buck could have easily gone by Ed ‘Big Bucks’ with all of the campaign cash he was throwing around.
Second, it has been reported in multiple publications that the politicians and political action committees who took contributions from Buck acted quickly to distance themselves from him.
Some politicians, including former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and former President Obama, still won’t say what they’re doing with Buck’s donations, even after his arrest.
In her defense, Hillary may not even know that Buck has been arrested. If she did, she might have fainted again.
Other candidates, including Congressman Adam Schiff, D-Burbank, and Ted Lieu, D-Torrance, agreed to give their Buck contributions of $2,700 and $19,400 respectively, to charity, only after the second man, Timothy Dean, died in Buck’s apartment in January.
The families of the victims, asked for the contributions to help pay for funeral expenses, but both congressmen declined.
What profiles in courage.
To date, only two elected officials donated the money they received from Buck to the victims’ families. Congresswoman Karen Bass, D-Los Angeles, sent the entire $250 she received from Buck to help pay for Gemmel Moore’s funeral expenses, and West Hollywood Councilman John D’Amico made a $25 contribution toward the funeral.
Finally, Los Angeles County District Attorney Jackie Lacey claimed that her office worked diligently and carefully to find and speak with witnesses over the course of the last two years so they could build a case against Ed Buck.
But the Moore family attorneys say the opposite is true. Nana Gyamfi and Hussain Turk wrote in a statement that, “Our team of activists had to personally escort witnesses to the LASD’s office and pressure them into recording our witnesses’ statements. We later discovered, in May of 2019, that Lacey was not even aware that these reports existed.”
Maybe prosecutors were too busy busting people for possession of plastic drinking straws to go after Ed Buck.
The reality is that Ed Buck abused vulnerable gay black men because powerful people looked the other way and enabled him.
Now that he’s finally been arrested, we shouldn’t try to minimize his power and influence, or rewrite history to make law enforcement and politicians seem as if they cared about the suffering of Ed Buck’s victims more than they actually did.
John Phillips can be heard weekdays from 6 a.m. to 10 a.m. on “The Morning Drive with John Phillips and Jillian Barberie” on KABC/AM 790.

Texto completo: Hace unas semanas, un policía del estado de California tuvo que pedir refuerzos para continuar una persecución de auto debido a que su patrulla Tesla se estaba quedando sin batería.
Otra patrulla continuó la persecución eventualmente, pero los medios de comunicación malinterpretaron la noticia y sus reportes hicieron creer al público que el vehículo eléctrico quedó parado en plena persecución y dejando al sospechoso escapar, informó The New York Times.
La realidad es que el incidente no fue nada diferente a aquellas situaciones donde un auto de gasolina se queda sin combustible o se le poncha una llanta, informó el Departamento de Fremont en un comunicado, agregando que los Teslas han mostrado ser vehículos eficientes y que hay posibilidades de que se agreguen más de estos a la flota del Departamento.
El Departamento de Fremont puso a prueba algunos Teslas para patrulla el pasado marzo de este año.
En estos seis meses, los vehículos han mostrado ganarse el cariño y confianza de los policías debido a su alto rendimiento y capacidad para recolectar información.
“Estamos en las primeras discusiones sobre la expansión del programa”, explica el comunicado.
El Tesla Model S es un auto totalmente eléctrico. Puede acelerar de 0 a 60 en 2.4 segundos y cuenta con un rango de millas de 370 millas por recarga. Además tiene una alta resistencia a los impactos y alcanza una velocidad máxima de 163 millas por hora.

Texto completo: Joan Fontana, R.N., passed away peacefully at her home early Wednesday morning.
Joan was born and raised in Hazleton, the daughter of the late Harold and Elizabeth (Martin) Borden.
Joan was a graduate of St. Gabriel High School, Class of 1950. She continued her education at Hazleton State General Hospital, School of Nursing.
She began her career as head nurse at Muhlenberg Hospital, Plainfield, N.J.
After returning to Hazleton, she worked as an afternoon and evening nurse supervisor at Hazleton State General Hospital. She was well respected in the medical community for her dedication and compassion to patients and served as a wonderful role model. During the busiest hours, there was always a smile on her face.
Prior to retiring in 1996, she was employed by the department of Public Welfare, Harrisburg, as an inspector of care team, inspecting M.H./M.A. and skilled care facilities.
Most important to Joan were her daughters. Her home was always open to their friends and anyone who needed a meal or a place to stay. She was affectionately called “Mom” by all who entered. Active in their school years, she volunteered in the school cafeteria. As students went through the line, many would shout “thanks, Mom!” At one point, one of the other volunteers asked her how many children were in her family.
When Joan became a grandmother, her title went from “Mom” to Nana Fontana. She was a doting grandmother and very active in their lives. She attended every sporting event, cheering with pride, sometimes screaming louder than anyone else in the bleachers. Any opportunity, she would travel to Florida to visit the kids.
As they grew older, she was the first to dance at their weddings, heading the conga line and the last to leave the dance floor.
Joan lived life to the fullest. She was an accomplished equestrian and skier, fearless on roller coasters and enjoyed traveling, especially cruises. She sang and danced through life. At the St. Gabriel Parish St. Patty Day dances, it wasn’t a party until Joan sang with the band. She enjoyed crossword puzzles, especially The New York Times crossword puzzle.
Her love of animals was well known; special to her was her big yellow lab, Zane. Throughout the years she had numerous felines and backyard bird feeders were always filled to attract the greatest variety of birds.
Having devout faith, Joan was a lifelong member of Annunciation Parish, Church of St. Gabriel, and the Parish Women’s Guild. She had a devotion to the Blessed Mother and recited the Rosary daily. She also prayed daily to Padre Pio. She lived her faith giving back to others. She was past treasurer of Hazleton General Hospital Nursing Alumni, and active in the Bishop Hafey Mothers Organization.
Preceding her in death were her parents, Harold and Elizabeth Borden.
Surviving are her loving and devoted daughters, Janice Fontana, Hazleton, caregiver in Joan’s last years; Patrice Saullo and her husband, Robert, Mechanicsville, Va.; Denise Brogan, Mechanicsville, Va.; and her cherished grandchildren; Micki Diana, Melia Laveri and her husband, John; Sean Rogan and his wife, Missy; Michael Stanley and his wife, Jenn; and Matthew Stanley. Also surviving are her treasured great-grandchildren, Caleb Wilfert and John Stanley.
Nana Fontana leaves behind wonderful memories of her zest for life. Remember her as smiling, laughing, singing and dancing. May those memories lift your heart.
A Mass of Christian Burial will be celebrated Tuesday at 10:30 a.m. at Annunciation Parish, Church of St. Gabriel’s, Hazleton. Interment will follow privately in the parish cemetery.
The family will receive friends from 8:30 to 10:30 a.m. at the church prior to the Mass.
Donations in memory of Joan may be made to: Alzheimer’s Association, 225 N. Michigan Ave., Floor 17, Chicago, IL 60601, or Hazleton Animal Shelter, 101 N. Poplar St., Hazleton, PA 18201.

Texto completo: If President Trump's hopes of withdrawing from war zones are realized, his government has a duty to protect the many foreigners who have helped U.S. forces there.
David Petraeus, a retired general and former director of the Central Intelligence Agency, and more than 25 American generals and admirals recently wrote to President Trump supporting a robust refugee resettlement program -- especially for people who have served American military and intelligence agencies in their native countries. But the Trump administration has decided to slash the overall number of refugees to be accepted in the coming year to 18,000 from 30,000, which increases pressure on already limited special programs for foreign friends who risk their lives to help America.
The letter warned that broad cuts could jeopardize the lives of the many foreigners employed abroad by our Defense Department, with a presence in more than 70 countries; by our Peace Corps in over 60; by the United States Agency for International Development in over 100; and by every embassy, where locals are hired as staff. The new quotas ignore that, carving out one meager special program for local people who served the American military in Iraq.
The United States depends on locals everywhere, for their native language skills, cultural knowledge and relationships to do things and obtain information Americans cannot. When these so-called foreign nationals work in war zones, they risk ostracism, imprisonment or death. If the American military presence is large, it can offer them and their families some protection. But when the troops leave, protection can give way to retribution by adversaries.
The latest cut for all refugees comes as the Trump administration and Congress, weary of "endless war," commit inadequate resources to support the foreigners who have worked with us.
In other words, while the United States government looks for the exits in countries like Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan, the moral imperative to extricate loyal friends from our conflicts is in danger of being ignored in favor of curbing immigration at home -- an ethical disaster, signaling an American lack of trustworthiness that would plague American national security efforts for decades.
In war zones, America's military, C.I.A. and other intelligence-gathering agencies depend on locals to conduct counterterrorism missions, among other efforts. Like American intelligence officers, they take on extremely dangerous operations and face near certain death if caught by terrorist and insurgent groups. Despite their status as a special class of prospective refugees, earned by their bravery, risk-taking, loyalty and sacrifices, intelligence agents serving America have few options of escape.
The current mechanisms for their resettlement -- Special Immigrant Visas, P-2 visas and special government-sponsored resettlement programs -- are not enough. When Congress created the S.I.V. program in 2008, it stipulated quotas. Only 18,500 special immigrant visas have been allocated for Afghanistan since 2014, and only 18,000 refugees from all countries are planned for 2019. By comparison, the United States resettled more than 140,000 refugees from the wars in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia in 1975.
Another problem: Intelligence agents typically wouldn't qualify. Their discreet relationship with the American government prevents them from openly proving their employment, a requirement for an S.I.V. or P-2 application. Moreover, their inevitable contacts with terrorists, insurgents and criminals would most likely disqualify them from any visa -- even though those ties were directed by the United States government and despite the strict vetting they had undergone.
Often, the only viable options are the American intelligence community's resettlement program or hastily arranged visas granted case by case. By law, the C.I.A., with the permission of the departments of Justice and Homeland Security, can relocate foreign agents to America regardless of ties to terrorist organizations that would derail a special immigrant application. But even that program is outdated and unequipped to handle the large numbers of foreign intelligence agents managed by American agencies in countries like Afghanistan.
Much has changed since Congress enacted the Central Intelligence Act of 1949, allowing 100 foreign nationals and members of their families entry to America each year. The number of agents has increased many times over in 70 years, but that door to America remains open to only 100. Furthermore, in 1949 the government's clandestine human intelligence and espionage activities were largely consolidated at the C.I.A., so it made sense then that authority to resettle former agents resided with the director.
Today these activities are no longer conducted solely by the C.I.A. Since Sept. 11, the intelligence community has grown significantly. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence was created to control intelligence functions, and the Defense Department expanded its sensitive human intelligence programs, inciting resistance in Congress. The United States Special Operations Command became remarkably effective in fighting terrorism, in part because of the efforts of intelligence agents abroad. Still, unlike the C.I.A., the Defense Department remains without authority of its own to help its agents escape potential death.
These problems must be fixed. If the administration won't act, Congress can. It can allow more foreign nationals to relocate to America, perhaps eliminating any cap. It can appropriate funds for the Defense Department and other agencies to cooperate in joint resettlement programs, cutting costs by consolidating such programs' functions in one office.
Lower costs and more efficiency could result if such an office takes over the Department of Justice's witness protection program, now managed by the United States Marshals Service. And a separate new organization might improve the management of law enforcement informants, now handled by the F.B.I. and the Drug Enforcement Administration.
If such changes prove too costly, Congress can revamp the Special Immigrant program to let the greater intelligence community and Defense Department utilize it. That would require coordination among agencies, and the S.I.V. request process would have to change to facilitate the safe entry of foreign nationals involved in intelligence work.
Above all, Congress should expand the special immigrant program to address the worst-case scenarios of hasty withdrawal from war zones abroad.
Congress must act now. If it doesn't, an abandonment of agents that might soon occur would be a stain on America's reputation in the world -- one difficult to justify to our children.

Texto completo: In Hollywood, it's easy to be a male feminist until people find out how you actually spend your free time.
James Franco, who proudly sported an anti-sexual assault Time’s Up pin at the Golden Globes last year, has just been accused of sexual misconduct. For years, the actor has made a point of branding himself as a feminist despite starring in oversexualized films, so the allegations are really unsurprising.
In the lawsuit filed on Thursday, two women say Franco and other leaders at his acting program “engaged in widespread inappropriate and sexually charged behavior towards female students by sexualizing their power as a teacher and an employer by dangling the opportunity for roles in their projects.”
The women, Sarah Tither-Kaplan and Toni Gaal, joined his acting school looking for advancement in their careers. Instead, they say, leaders took advantage of them.
“You have faith in these people, in their credibility and you trust that won’t be taken advantage of,” Gaal told the New York Times. “It’s alarming that you definitely can get manipulated because you’re vulnerable.”
Some of the acting classes offered in Franco’s program included training for sex scenes, which the women say didn’t follow typical industry standards. Per the New York Times:
“The women said the school also offered additional master classes, which could cost as much as $2,000 each, including a $750 master class for sex scenes. According to the lawsuit, prospective students for the sex scenes class had to audition on videotape — so that Franco could later review the material, they were told — and sign away their rights to these recordings. … Their lawsuit says the class preyed upon ‘often young and inexperienced females’ who ‘were routinely pressured to engage in simulated sex acts that went far beyond the standards in the industry.’”
This is all saddening but unsurprising, especially considering that Franco was caught trying to solicit a 17-year-old in 2014 (when he was a 36-year-old). The story made just a blip in the media at the time, and seven months later, women’s website Bustle ran a glowing profile on Franco, not once mentioning the creepy story.
“And throughout his noble attempt at total world domination,” the website gushed, “Franco's latest projects have all helped propel the works of other aspiring creatives — mainly, women.” As we have seen, it’s true indeed that he loves working with women on his projects, but probably not for the reason he’d like us to think.
“Yeah” he’s a feminist, he said. “For a lot of reasons. One thing I'll say right now is that over the past few years I've worked with a bunch of female filmmakers, and I've come to enjoy the experience. I look for women to work with on every project, and if there's not enough women I insist on hiring them.”
That’s so sweet of him! Why is he so concerned about gender equality?
“I find that I work with women really well,” he continued. “These have been such great experiences. I wouldn't say only because they're women they're great filmmakers and directors, but there is something about the energy that I really love and want more of.”
This pandering makes Franco’s alleged sexual escapades all the more repugnant, and last year, Tither-Kaplan called him out for it. When he appeared at the Golden Globes wearing a Time’s Up pin, she tweeted about his apparent hypocrisy.
“Hey James Franco, nice #timesup pin at the #GoldenGlobes,” she said. “Remember a few weeks ago when you told me the full nudity you had me do in two of your movies for $100/day wasn't exploitative because I signed a contract to do it? Times up on that!”
Tither-Kaplan and Gaal’s lawsuit is seeking class-action status, so others who claim to have been wronged by Franco and Co. can join. Franco's lawyer has denied the claims, and time will tell if other alleged victims speak out.
For now, remember that next time you see a Hollywood male "feminist" wearing a Time's Up pin or tweeting about the #MeToo movement, look at his record before believing his empty words.

For the Love of Wooden Boats….and a longstanding wish that was finally granted this summer

This column was on my “to do” list over a month ago. Then a couple of other topics came to the fore, as is often the case.
Interestingly enough, this topic was planted in my consciousness again last Fall at about this time…in late September. I was back in my Minnesota homeland primarily to attend my 50th Reunion of the Class of 1968 at Concordia College on the Red River border between Minnesota and North Dakota.
Of course, there are other touchstones that needed touching whenever I am back in my homeland. Cherished, aging relatives living in recent decades in suburban Minneapolis, as well as their sons and their families….and of course where I grew up, in Douglas County, halfway in a northwesterly direction, on the 250-mile interstate highway between Minneapolis and Moorhead.
Douglas County has abundant farmland on the edge of the western prairies….and it also had many beautiful lakes adding their numbers to Minnesota’s legendary “Land of 10,000 Lakes”. The area is one of Minnesota’s favorite destinations (after the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness in the far north) for vacationers, fishermen (and ladies), campers and anything else one does in, and/or near, beautiful lakes.
Alexandria is the largest town, and county seat, in Douglas County. It had about 7,000 year-round residents when I graduated from high school there (Class of ’64). Today the population is over 13,000. It is a thriving community with a tourism-based economy much like Rangeley. Yet, there are significant differences.
One of the most striking differences is the nature of its fishing culture and history. Here, as beautifully displayed at the Outdoor Heritage Museum in Oquossoc is the long history of the art and science of the pursuit of the legendary Brook Trout (“Brookies”) of the Rangeley Region. In Alexandria, it is not so much the art, but mainly the science and utility of pursuing Minnesota’s favorite trophy (and tasty) Walleyed Pike (“Walleyes”).
Amid my moseying around Alexandria, the small town where I grew up…Carlos (curiously named because when I grew up there were no residents of hispanic descent to my knowledge of the entire county) and my grandparents’ farm, (and source of many fond memories), and their simple “cottage” on nearby Lake Miltona (source of many, many more fond memories.
I would row their old wooden rowboat around the lake, fishing with my Zebco spinning reel for anything that would bite on those freshly-dug earthworms, but especially developing my love of nature, especially lake-based natural environments.. That old wooden rowboat was made locally many years earlier at the Alexandria Boat Works. It was their signature model, the “Lady of the Lakes”. Great name, eh?
While in the area, I was urged to stop in at Alexandria’s relatively new museum (next to the longstanding Runestone Museum, extolling the region’s Scandinavian heritage), the Legacy of the Lakes Museum. I stopped in, and was very glad that I did. Go to legacyofthelakes.org for a look at this fine, (click on the 3-minute YouTube video) and expansive museum. What you will notice first is the architecture of the proud facility…and inside you will get a very complete feel for the boating and fishing cultural differences as compared to Maine and Rangeley.
What thrilled me the most, was the presence of my uncle, Albin Wicken’s, Lady of the Lakes wooden fishing boat, complete with a dark green paint job, and all of his fishing gear. He was a renowned walleye-fishing guide in the area back in the ‘30s, ‘40s and beyond. The fishing boats could be rowed, as I did as a kid, but were mainly a square-stern 12’-14’ craft built for a Johnson or Evenrude motor mounted on that stern.
<img class=" wp-image-10338551" src="https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2019/10/IMG_1745.jpg" alt="" width="431" height="575" />
And….what you will also see is an expansive collection of antique wooden power boats built by ChrisCraft, Garwood, Century and HackerCraft boats of beauty and powerful utility. I knew them collectively as ChrisCraft boats….the dominant manufacturer back in the day. And I always wanted to take a ride in one. Alas, I had never had that opportunity….that is, until this past August at the marina on Rangeley Lake in Oquossoc!
It was a beautiful midweek morning and I was sitting on the picnic table on the first set of floating boat slips, ….sipping a cup of O.C.-brewed coffee and reading the New York Times with “All the News that’s Fit to Print”, of course. I had just finished an always enjoyable hour and a half of doubles tennis on one of the three private courts surrounding Rangeley Lake (in addition to the two courts in Rangeley’s Town Park) that are generously reserved at 9 a.m. weekdays for our 40+ participants in the local summer tennis schedule (a shout-out is due to Amy Brenner, who does a very fine job scheduling the doubles matches each week).
That dock is also the one whereby the gas pump for boats is located (on the land, of course). Soon, a beautiful 1939 ChrisCraft power boat (see photo) pulls up to the dock for a fill of fuel. The nice owner, a summer camp owner on Rangeley Lake from New Hampshire, asks me if I was in charge of the gas pump that morning. My quick answer with a smile was “No, I’m just sitting here waiting for an antique ChrisCraft owner to give me a ride in his fine boat”. His answer was immediate. “As soon as I fill the tank, hop in and we will ride full throttle to near Doctor’s Island and back !”
<img class="size-large wp-image-10338863" src="https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2019/10/IMG_4343-1024x723.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="723" />
I almost passed out. It was a great ride with this very kind boat owner (see photo). I filled him in, over the roar of that large inboard diesel engine, that I had been waiting for most of my 73 years for my first ride in a beautiful antique Chris Craft. After thanking him profusely again as he roared off to give his grandkids a ride later that morning….I was left with a feeling that my life is now closer to being almost complete.
Among my composite (fibreglass and the like) canoes and kayaks…is a beautiful, fully restored, antique Old Town wood and canvas canoe (1929). I also had a 1935 Old Town wood and canvas “rowing canoe”. A couple of years ago, Peter Christensen helped me to restore it to its original condition. I then took it to Colorado to give to our two sons, one of whom has a cabin on beautiful Grand Lake (see photo) in the mountains….in hopes that the love of rowing and paddling a beautiful wooden boat is passed on to our Colorado grandkids as well. I am confident that it will.
We need to write, otherwise nobody will know who we are.

I’ll be ridin’ shotgun, underneath the hot sun, feelin’ like a someone….

Texto completo: Fireworks exploded first thing Tuesday morning and it was amazing: Twitter was crackling with Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg blasting Democratic presidential hopeful Elizabeth Warren, and Warren doubled down on a pledge to break up the social media behemoth to protect us all from the monopolistic company’s darker side.
The smackdown began with leaked audio of a Zuckerberg meeting with Facebook employees in which the CEO said it would “suck” if Warren were elected. Zuck vowed to aim the full force of his company against her as president: “If someone’s going to try to threaten something that existential, you go to the mat and you fight.”
Warren slammed back: “What would really ‘suck,’” she tweeted, “is if we don’t fix a corrupt system that lets giant companies like Facebook engage in illegal anticompetitive practices, stomp on consumer privacy rights, and repeatedly fumble their responsibility to protect our democracy.”
Meanwhile, all I could think about was the kids.
Our kids. Your kids. Everyone’s kids. The high school kid who took his life last month in Tennessee due to cyberbullying.
Kids are walking around with smartphones and apps that have become a bully’s best friend. Grenades, you might even say. And all we parents are doing, it seems, is watching, helplessly, as Big Tech keeps getting bigger and bigger while our kids get sucked deeper and deeper into the diabolical depths of their profit-making devices and apps.
Parents try to monitor their kids’ social media use. But this can’t be all we do. Not with kids like Channing Smith becoming casualties.
Just hours before Zuck vs. Warren, the story of the Tennessee high schooler’s death was making the rounds nationally. He took his own life after being humiliated by cyberbullies, his family says. Channing was distraught after a screenshot of him kissing another boy was disseminated, unbeknownst to him.
The youngster’s story was on my mind from the night before when, over a cup of morning coffee, the Twitter face-off unfolded between Zuckerberg and Warren. It felt timely.
Companies like Facebook, which also owns Instagram, control so much of our online lives, our privacy, our personal time, and with little accountability or mechanisms to halt increasingly toxic behavior.
From the way it handles user data to its effectively allowing its platform to be used for meddling in U.S. elections, there are many major concerns about this company. Just as there are concerns about Google and so many other digital companies that have poked into our lives in ways large and small.
But as a parent, one concern rises above all others: What is all of this doing to our kids? And when, if ever, do we say the harm is becoming too great to ignore, whether it’s digital addiction or bullying or being victimized in some other way by the tech universe?
The digital world, in just a matter of a few years, has ballooned into a virtually lawless place. And our children are in the line of fire, whether through the exponential spread of child pornography, as a New York Times investigation recently documented, or through soul-crushing cyberbullying, which also appears to be on the rise.
Pew Research Center recently found that a majority of U.S. teens have experienced at least one of the following: “Online cyberbullying, including name-calling, being subject to false rumors, receiving explicit images they didn’t ask for, having explicit images of themselves shared without their consent, physical threats, or being constantly asked about their location and activities in a stalker-ish fashion by someone who is not their parents.”
“The technology today and what’s out there with all the different apps and how they can hide their identity and spoof different numbers, it’s crazy,” said Deputy Chief Ted Caiola, whose Upper Gwynedd Twp. police department is one of several feeding the North Penn School District in Montgomery County. He said kids come to realize, “’Hey, look, I can do this and not get caught.’”
In Tredyffrin Twp., the veteran cop in charge of police in agreed that officers are summoned to many more bullying calls than before the advent of social media. Michael Beaty would know; he’s been a law enforcement officer for 32 years.
As tech companies worry about their hegemony, parents should step up our own worrying game. Pew found that less bullying happens if kids spend less time online. That’s a good start.

After Plea Deal, Epstein Made $200 Million

Texto completo: Jeffrey Epstein's biggest client had deserted him, his money management firm had lost more than $ 150 million during the financial crisis, and he was a registered sex offender. But after he started a new company with a wildly speculative business plan in 2012, Mr. Epstein had no problem pulling in cash.
His start-up, Southern Trust, reported more than $ 200 million in revenues over the next five years, according to a review of previously unreported financial statements filed in the Virgin Islands.
Despite a name that calls to mind a financial services firm, the fledgling company with a handful of employees said it was developing a DNA data-mining service. Southern Trust was trying to gauge customers' predisposition to cancer by "basically organizing mathematical algorithms," Mr. Epstein told Virgin Islands officials as he sought a lucrative tax break in 2012.
Mr. Epstein's business revival is documented in financial statements and other filings obtained by The New York Times. The documents -- from Southern Trust and his earlier firm, Financial Trust -- offer a glimpse of Mr. Epstein's mysterious finances. They show that Financial Trust peaked at the end of 2004, when it reported $ 563 million in assets and net income of $ 108 million. And they demonstrate how Mr. Epstein rebuilt his business in his later years, with Southern Trust reporting $ 175 million in retained earnings -- leftover profits that can be reinvested -- in 2017, the last year for which statements were available.
But the documents do not say who was paying vast sums of money to Mr. Epstein's new venture just a few years after his 2008 guilty plea to soliciting a minor for prostitution. Nor do they offer an explanation for why customers would hand over money to a man who had apparently switched from financial services to DNA research.
They do, however, offer a reason for that sudden change in focus. In 2012, Mr. Epstein asked the Virgin Islands Economic Development Authority to note that Financial Trust no longer managed money, so it would not have to register with federal securities regulators as required under the Dodd-Frank Act. Later that year, Financial Trust was replaced by Southern Trust, which Mr. Epstein told territorial officials would still maintain a "financial arm."
The single-page unaudited financial statements for both companies -- obtained through a public-records lawsuit against the territory's Division of Corporations and Trademarks -- are littered with curious line items.
At Financial Trust, a company with fewer than a dozen employees, investment expenses varied widely, from $ 1.3 million in 2000 to $ 16 million in 2004 to $ 42 million in 2005. In 2006 -- the year Mr. Epstein was charged in Florida -- Financial Trust pushed $ 117 million into an unnamed subsidiary whose purpose was undisclosed. The subsidiary was apparently transferred to Southern Trust in 2013, and by the end of 2017 the subsidiary accounted for more than half of the company's $ 391 million in assets. The filings also disclose that Southern Trust received a $ 30.5 million loan that same year, but don't say who provided it.
One thing the financial statements make clear: Mr. Epstein paid himself handsomely. He pocketed $ 400 million in dividends and other payments from the companies starting in 1999 -- the first full year after he moved his operations to the Virgin Islands from New York.
The opacity of Mr. Epstein's financial dealings has been a perplexing issue since he was arrested in July on federal charges of sex trafficking with underage girls. Although the criminal case against him closed after he committed suicide in federal custody in August, Mr. Epstein's finances remain an important matter for women who are suing his estate claiming they were among his victims.
Two days before he killed himself, Mr. Epstein signed a will that placed his estate -- estimated in court records at more than $ 500 million -- into a trust, potentially an attempt to shield it from public scrutiny. The will lists Darren K. Indyke and Richard D. Kahn, two longtime associates, as executors.
The financial statements and accompanying documents reviewed by The Times were signed at various times by Mr. Indyke, a lawyer who incorporated dozens of Mr. Epstein's companies, and Mr. Kahn, a New York accountant. Mr. Indyke served as president of Financial Trust for two years, which included the period that Mr. Epstein was serving a prison sentence in Florida after his 2008 guilty plea.
Neither Mr. Indyke nor Mr. Kahn responded to repeated requests for comments. Lawyers for the men also did not respond to messages.
For many years, Mr. Epstein's businesses in the Virgin Islands operated out of an office suite at a marina complex on St. Thomas. After Mr. Epstein's death, a man at the office told a visitor through an intercom that no one at Southern Trust was available to talk.
Documents obtained from the Virgin Islands Economic Development Authority show how officials rarely pressed Mr. Epstein on his dealings, even as they granted lucrative exemptions that allowed him to pay as little as 10 percent of the effective tax rate in corporate income tax. The tax breaks are granted to companies that agree to minimum hiring requirements and commit to investing at least $ 100,000 in an industry that advances the territory's "economic well-being." Currently 71 companies, including Southern Trust, receive the incentive.
The development authority did not respond to messages seeking comment.
Government watchdogs and others have long criticized the territory's history of light regulatory oversight. "Rich people have tried to make it their residence and do business there," said Jack Blum, a Washington lawyer who has led corruption investigations for several Senate committees. "The idea was to keep it all out of the hands of the I.R.S."
Mr. Epstein set up shop in the Virgin Islands in 1998, calling himself a "financial doctor" who had decided to settle there after "vacationing up and down the world," according to a transcript of a hearing the next year as he sought tax incentives that were ultimately granted. During his extensive remarks -- an official interrupted Mr. Epstein's soliloquy at one point to remind him he had only 15 minutes to make a presentation -- he discussed working at Bear Stearns and opined about that "electronic mail" was rendering the fax machine obsolete.
He also boasted about managing money for Leslie H. Wexner, the longtime chief executive of the company that runs Victoria's Secret, who recently said Mr. Epstein had misappropriated large sums of money from him.
The end of their association is evident in the income statements of Financial Trust. The company reported fee income -- money charged to clients for services, rather than gains from investments -- of $ 66 million in 2006. In 2007, the year that Mr. Wexner said he had cut ties with Mr. Epstein, Financial Trust's fee income was just shy of $ 4 million. In 2008, it was $ 100,000.
Financial Trust reported fee income of $ 100,000 for the next three years, then none in 2012 -- the year Southern Trust was founded.
In 2013, its first full year in existence, Southern Trust reported fee income of $ 51 million.

Texto completo: My wanting to share every waking thought became eclipsed by a desire for an increasingly rare commodity -- a private life.
"What's happening?"
I stare blankly at the little box as I try to think of something clever for my first tweet. I settle on what's at the top of my mind: "My only #fear is being a nobody." How could I know this exchange would begin a dialogue that would continue nearly every day for the next nine years of my life?
I began using Twitter in 2010 as a newly minted high school freshman. Though it began as a hub for my quirky adolescent thoughts, over the years it became an archive of my emotional and intellectual voice -- a kind of virtual display for the evolution of my politics and artistic identity. But after nine years, it was time to close the archive. My wanting to share my every waking thought became eclipsed by a desire for an increasingly rare commodity -- a private life.
Though I thought disappearing from social media would be as simple as logging off, my refusal to post anything caused a bit of a stir among my small but loyal following. I began to receive emails from strangers asking me where I had gone and when I would return. One message read: "Not to be over familiar, but you have to come back eventually. You're a writer after all. How will we read your writing?" Another follower inquired, "Where will you go?"
The truth is I have not gone anywhere. I am, in fact, more present than ever.
Over time, I have begun to sense these messages reveal more than a lack of respect for privacy. I realize that to many millennials, a life without a social media presence is not simply a private life; it is no life at all: We possess a widespread, genuine fear of obscurity.
When I consider the near-decade I have spent on social media, this worry makes sense. As with many in my generation, Twitter was my entry into conversations happening on a global scale; long before my byline graced any publication, tweeting was how I felt a part of the world. Twitter functions much like an echo chamber dependent on likes and retweets, and gaining notoriety is as easy as finding someone to agree with you. For years I poured my opinions, musings and outrage onto my timeline, believing I held an indispensable place in a vital sociopolitical experiment.
But these passionate, public observations were born of more than just a desire to speak my mind -- I was measuring my individual worth in constant visibility. Implicit in my follower's question "Where will you go?" is the resounding question "How will we know where you've gone?" Privacy is considered a small exchange for the security of being well known and well liked.
After all, a private life boasts no location markers or story updates. The idea that the happenings of our lives would be constrained to our immediate families, friends and real-life communities is akin to social death in a world measured by followers, views, likes and shares.
I grow weary when I think of this as the new normal for what is considered to be a fruitful personal life. Social media is no longer a mere public extension of our private socialization; it has become a replacement for it. What happens to our humanity when we relegate our real lives to props for the performance of our virtual ones?
For one, a predominantly online existence can lull us into a dubious sense of having enacted concrete change, simply because of a tweet or Instagram post. As "hashtag activism" has obscured longstanding traditions of assembly and protest, there's concern that a failure to transition from the keyboard to in-person organization will effectively stall or kill the momentum of political movements. (See: Occupy Wall Street.)
The sanctity of our most intimate experiences is also diminished. My grandfather Charles Shaw -- a notable trumpeter whose wisdoms and jazz scene tales I often shared on Twitter -- died last year. Rather than take adequate time to privately mourn the loss of his giant influence in my life alongside those who loved him most, I quickly posted a lengthy tribute to him to my followers. At the time I thought, "How will they remember him if I don't acknowledge his passing?"
Perhaps at the root of this anxiety over being forgotten is an urgent question of how one ought to form a legacy; with the rise of automation, a widening wealth gap and an unstable political climate, it is easy to feel unimportant. It is almost as if the world is too big and we are much too small to excel in it in any meaningful way. We feel we need as many people as possible to witness our lives, so as not to be left out of a story that is being written too fast by people much more significant than ourselves.
"The secret of a full life is to live and relate to others as if they might not be there tomorrow, as if you might not be there tomorrow," the writer Anaïs Nin said. "This feeling has become a rarity, and rarer every day now that we have reached a hastier and more superficial rhythm, now that we believe we are in touch with a greater amount of people. This is the illusion which might cheat us of being in touch deeply with the one breathing next to us."
I think of those words and at once any fear of obscurity is eclipsed by much deeper ones -- the fear of forgoing the sacred moments of life, of never learning to be completely alone, of not bearing witness to the incredible lives of those who surround me.
I observe the world around me. It is big and moving fast. "What's happening?" I think to myself.
I'm just beginning to find out.

Ukraine: A political rerun

Texto completo: Back when reruns were a staple of summer programming, television networks aired repeats of their programs, giving viewers another opportunity to see what they had already seen. Democratic politicians are now conducting their own version of reruns.
The same bunch who brought us the failed Russian “collusion” story, the sliming of Justice Brett Kavanaugh and charges that President Trump is a racist (which also failed, given the spectacular increase in minority employment) are now rerunning the same show with different characters.
According to a still anonymous “whistleblower,” who wrote a multi-page “complaint” about a phone call between President Trump and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky that he or she heard about secondhand from another unnamed person, President Trump held back military aide to Ukraine until “dirt” on Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, could be provided.
Hunter Biden served on the board of Burisma, a Ukrainian gas company, which paid him $3.1 million over a 16-month period. This when his father was vice president of the United States and, according to Bloomberg, pursing “... an anti-corruption policy in Ukraine ... that included a call for the resignation of the country’s top prosecutor, who had previously investigated Burisma.”
Ukraine’s prosecutor general has since come out and said that there is no evidence of wrongdoing by U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden or his son. But something doesn’t pass the smell test.
The New York Times reports the whistleblower is a CIA agent who was on loan to the White House. I have known several CIA agents and two directors of the CIA – George H.W. Bush and Porter Goss – and none were known for the kind of prose contained in the complaint. The document appears to have been written by a team of lawyers with a political objective, namely impeachment of the president.
This is a view shared by Fred Fleitz, president of the Center for Security Policy, a conservative, Washington, D.C.-based think tank. Fleitz is also a former deputy assistant to President Trump and to the chief of staff of the National Security Council (NSC).
Writing in The New York Post, Fleitz says: “I am very familiar with transcripts of presidential phone calls, since I edited and processed dozens of them when I worked for the NSC. I also know a lot about intelligence whistleblowers from my time with the CIA.
“My suspicions grew ... when I saw the declassified whistleblower complaint. It appears to be written by a law professor, and includes legal references and detailed footnotes. It also has an unusual legalistic reference on how this complaint should be classified. From my experience, such an extremely polished whistleblowing complaint is unheard of. This document looks as if this leaker had outside help, possibly from congressional members or staff.”
When it comes to an impeachable offense, there is no there, there.
Like other attempts to undo the results of the 2016 election, this one should also fail if Republicans stick together, as Democrats did during the impeachment of Bill Clinton. Rep. Al Green, D-Texas, revealed his party’s true motives when he said that if Trump isn’t impeached, he will be re-elected.
There are deeper issues for 2020. They include capitalism vs. socialism; higher unemployment vs. lower; judges who revere and obey the Constitution vs. judges who wish they had written it and know what the Founders intended better than the Founders; government health care vs. reforms in the current system to make it better; greater dependence on government vs. an expansion of individual liberty; rewarding initiative and success vs. penalizing the successful with higher taxes and more regulations.
Don’t expect President Trump to start quoting this line from the Ukraine national anthem, but it could prove prophetic if Democrats fail in their latest cynical attempt to impeach him: “Like the dew before the sun enemies will fade. We will further rule and prosper in our promised land.”

Netflix star Samin Nosrat mulls going part-time vegan

Texto completo: Samin Nosrat's laugh is delightful and infectious. It's the kind of warm uninhibited chorus that makes you feel not only like you've known the New York Times best-selling author for years, but also that she couldn't be more happy to talk with you today.
This charming, approachable persona is an undeniable part of the reason why Nostrat's Netflix series "Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat" — inspired by her James Beard Award-winning book of the same name — has been hailed for changing the food show landscape forever.
In the four-part series, viewers see Nosrat lose herself in the pleasure of a piece of aged Parmesan cheese, giggle as her eyes water while chopping onions and do an adorable happy dance with a friend as they devour a dish while standing around the kitchen counter.
Why getting a show was a 'whiplash moment' Q: It sounds like you maybe have been thinking about using your platform to be an activist? Or raise awareness, maybe?
A: I wouldn't use the word "activist." I still do have a relationship with the New York Times so I have not fully jumped into activism. But I do think education and awareness is really important and it's my job.
I found out that Netflix was interested in the show two days after the 2016 election and it was a really hard time for me. I really felt that that election said to me, personally, that people who look like you are not wanted here. So I was sort of sitting with the grief of that and then found out this thing two days later.
It was a really whiplash moment for me and I took it really seriously and thought really carefully about whether I wanted to put myself in the public eye when the public had made it clear that people who look like me or are from the part of the world that my family is from are not necessarily considered American or welcome here.
I did in the end decide that I did want to do it and I was like, OK if I am going to do this then I'm going to use it to promote the kind of message that's really important to me, which is one of unity and sharing with people my ultimate belief that we are more similar than different across the world.
So I don't know that I would use the word "activist" necessarily, but I do think that there are so many things in our daily lives that feel really overwhelming. Changing a habit is really hard. I get how hard it is. I have my own really conflicted decisions about changing the way I eat and yet my brain understands that it's what we all have to do. Or it's what I have to do at least.
What being 'daytime vegan' means Q: But vegan? I don't know if I could give up cheese...
A: Well, the thing is it's daytime vegan (laughs)
Q: So, only when the sun is up?
A: Totally. Basically, statistically, if you give up animal products for two of your meals, you end up using less carbon than if you're a full-time vegetarian. I think if I fully had to give up cheese and dairy and butter it would just be like, I couldn't. I would die.
One of the books I've been reading is by my friend Jonathan Safran Foer. He has a new climate change book coming out, and he proposes this and his whole book is about his own personal difficulty with it and also the understanding that if you don't do it, you're just a person who didn't do something when the moment required it.
How her new book will be different from 'Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat' But as far as the book, one of things I've seen is that people feel kind of stuck about deciding what to make.
Even really good home cooks create a menu for a dinner or a party page for page, word for word out of a magazine spread of recipes. Or because they saw such-and-such-thing on TV or Instagram. I started to think about how there's so much I can share with those people about how to make their lives easier by understanding what decisions to make about what they should be cooking.
I did my best with "Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat" to teach people how to translate how professional cooks think about how to cook. What I've realized is I haven't really that similar translation about how professional cooks decide what to cook.
So that's what I'm going to do with the book that I have not started writing yet. (laughs)

WHAT TO MAKE OF TRUMP’S SOFTER TONE ON CLIMATE: President Trump and his White House are subtly shifting how they talk about climate change and environmental issues, even as they push ahead with boosting fossil fuel production and easing regulations.
Trump allies are noting the changes, which they say comes from pressure from his re-election campaign, which has noticed polls showing increasing concern about climate change and environmental protection, including among younger and suburban Republicans.
“The campaign is having some influence on the rhetoric coming out of the White House,” Myron Ebell of the Competitive Enterprise Institute, who led Trump’s EPA transition team, told Josh. “It’s in the direction of softening the rhetoric on some issues, including climate. However, I have seen no sign that any policies are being changed because of campaign considerations.”
The U.S. pledged Wednesday to work with Finland to help address challenges caused by the melting of sea ice in the Arctic, after a White House meeting between Trump and Finnish President Sauli Niinistö.
“The Arctic provides new economic opportunities, but environmental changes such as the diminishing of sea ice raise environmental concerns,” the statement said. “The United States and Finland share a commitment to clean air and water and environmental protection.”
The U.S. also pledged to help combat black carbon emitted from coal plants, which has contributed to warming of the Arctic.
Trump has shown a shift in tone in other recent circumstances, delivering a speech in July defending his environmental record, and referencing climate change when he toured flooding in Houston last month.
“There is a thread of thought in the campaign that the environment in general and climate as a subset of that needs to be addressed with more moderation,” Mike McKenna, a lobbyist who led Trump’s Energy Department transition team, told Josh, while noting there is an “internal bright line” that Trump won’t cross to moderate the substance of his policy.

MAJOR EMITTER PENNSYLVANIA TO JOIN REGIONAL CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM: Pennsylvania, America's third largest carbon emitter, is joining the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a cap-and-trade program covering the power sector in nine East Coast states.
Gov. Tom Wolf, a Democrat, announced Thursday his move to start the process of entering RGGI with an executive order.
Pennsylvania, a major producer of shale gas, will become the highest emitting state to enter RGGI. Roughly 30% of the state’s emissions come from the power sector.
Wolf previously signed an executive order aiming for Pennsylvania to reduce net greenhouse gas emissions 80% by 2050 from 2005 levels.
States participating in RGGI have collectively reduced power sector carbon emissions by more than 45% since 2005, prompting other states to join.
New Jersey under Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy is set to join in January.
US OIL GIANT CHEVRON ANNOUNCES NEW EMISSIONS GOALS: U.S. oil and gas major Chevron announced Thursday that it intends to reduce the intensity of its emissions — the emission rate of greenhouse gas per unit of energy produced — by up to 10% for oil production and by up to 5% for methane emissions from natural gas production over the next four years, measured from 2016 levels.
EPA ESCALATES FEUD WITH CALIFORNIA OVER POLLUTION: The Environmental Protection Agency continued its battle with California on Wednesday, accusing San Francisco of violating the Clean Water Act.
EPA says it identified violations of National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permits, citing discharges from San Francisco’s combined wastewater and sewer system based on inspections and field visits in 2015 and 2016 and subsequent data monitoring.
“The failure to properly operate and maintain the City’s sewage collection and treatment facilities creates public health risks,” the EPA said in a notice to the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission.
EPA claims San Francisco’s failure to properly operate and maintain its sewage collection and treatment facilities has led to “substantial volumes of raw and partially-treated sewage to flow across beaches and into the San Francisco Bay and the Pacific Ocean.”
San Francisco strikes back: Harlan L. Kelly, Jr., the commission's general manager, rebutted EPA’s allegations, saying San Francisco has complied with the Clean Air Act, and has spent billions of dollars to improve its wastewater and sewer system.
“The combined sewer system ensures the capture of motor oil, pesticides, metals, trash and other street litter that would otherwise flow directly into San Francisco Bay and the Pacific Ocean during storms,” Kelly said, according to the Washington Post.
EPA’s feud with San Franciscio comes after the agency last month said it wants Caifornia to withdraw more than 100 backlogged state plans to comply with federal air quality requirements and commit to redoing them. If California doesn’t, the EPA is threatening to withhold highway funds and permit approvals.
DEMOCRATIC STATES CELEBRATE COURT RULING KNOCKING EPA FOR WEAK ENFORCEMENT OF SMOG POLLUTION: Democratic states on Wednesday celebrated a federal court ruling finding the EPA has not done enough to force some Midwestern and Southern states to control smog pollution that blows into New York and other Northeast states.
The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals determined this week that EPA had erred by not imposing further "good neighbor" requirements on “upwind” states, forcing them to control their ozone pollution from traveling across state lines.
“Over two-thirds of New Yorkers regularly breathe unhealthy air due to smog pollution,” said New York attorney general Letitia James, who led the lawsuit and was joined by Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Massachusetts, and New Jersey. “We will continue our battle to compel the Trump Administration to follow the law in our effort to fight this public health hazard and to uphold New Yorkers’ legal right to clean, healthy air.”
The court gave EPA until Oct. 28 to seek a rehearing of the case.
AMERICAN PETROLEUM INSTITUTE BEEFS UP STAFF: API has added Shannon DiBari, Rhonda Bentz, and Bianca Domally to its senior staff, the oil and gas trade group announced Wednesday. DiBari is API’s new senior adviser to president and CEO Mike Sommers, after she previously worked as executive vice president and chief operating office of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.
Bentz has joined API as director of strategic initiatives and paid media, and Domally was hired to be the group’s financial controller.

HERE COMES TRUMP’S HEALTHCARE ANNOUNCEMENT: On Thursday President Trump will announce an executive order aimed at batting back criticism about his administration's efforts to undo Obamacare and at contrasting himself with liberal Democrats who want enroll everyone in the U.S. into government healthcare through "Medicare for all."
The president will make his speech in The Villages, a Florida retirement community, in a speech that top administration say will focus on broadening his healthcare message beyond Obamacare. The focus will be on Medicare, the program that covers seniors and people with disabilities, but also on private health insurance, as changes to Medicare tend to ripple across the healthcare system.
"This president has been focusing on health issues that other administrations have been ignoring for decades," Joe Grogan, head of the White House's Domestic Policy Council, said on a phone call with reporters Thursday morning.
The executive order, called "Protecting and Improving Medicare For Our Nation’s Seniors," will allow for private plans that operate in Medicare, known as Medicare Advantage, to add more wellness benefits and to offer more plans, including allowing them to set up savings accounts to pay for care and letting plans cover adult day care. The administration will also change regulations that discourage telehealth so that patients can use computers and smartphones to get in touch with their doctors.
Another key part of the order will look at taking down regulations that force nurse practitioners and physician assistants to practice under a doctor's supervision. This move would help to fight the doctor shortage, particularly in rural areas, officials said.
"This is the most comprehensive vision for healthcare I can recall any president putting forth," said Alex Azar, Health and Human Services Secretary.
Officials promised savings in traditional Medicare. But from the information provided to reporters on the call, it doesn’t look like they’ll come in the form of cuts. Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services Administrator Seema Verma said that Medicare savings in the traditional government program would go up because the administration would reduce regulations. She noted that premiums were going down in Medicare Part D, which pays for prescription drugs, affecting how much the program overall is spending.
Some of the plans to be announced reinforce agenda items the administration already has set in motion, including giving people other benefits in Medicare Advantage that allow their plans to pay for nutrition or transportation to a doctor's office. The administration also put work into improving the website on Medicare that lets people compare health plans. Read more.
Tune into Trump’s speech.

OCR RAPS DENTIST FOR POSTING PATIENT INFO: The Office for Civil Rights at the Department of Health and Human Services has fined Elite Dental Associates in Texas $10,000 under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act Privacy Rule. According to OCR, the dental provider responded to social media reviews by disclosing patients names and details of their health conditions.
SANDERS CAN PROBABLY EXPECT TO BE BACK ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL IN AS SOON AS A WEEK: Patients who undergo procedures to unclog their arteries, as Bernie Sanders did, can expect to get back to their normal routines in as early as a week to several weeks, according to cardiologists. The Sanders campaign announced Wednesday that surgeons inserted two stents into one of Sanders' arteries after discovering a blockage there. Stents help reduce the risk of a heart attack, and patients typically are put on aspirin and blood thinners afterward.
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION TO BEGIN DNA TESTING THOUSANDS OF MIGRANTS IN DETENTION: The Trump administration will conduct DNA testing on the migrants detained at the southern border each year, and send the results to the FBI’s national DNA database, as reported in the New York Times. The FBI normally uses testing to track criminals who have been charged with major crimes, including murder, but the latest Trump administration move will allow for at least 40,000 new entries — the number of immigrants currently in detention. Immigration and Customs Enforcement used DNA testing on a smaller scale over the summer along the southwestern border to detect “fraudulent family units.” Unlike the summer pilot program, the new DNA testing program would send results to a national database available to law enforcement agencies.
HARRIS TAKES A SWIPE AT WARREN ON CAMPAIGN PROMISES: Presidential contender Kamala Harris jabbed fellow candidate Elizabeth Warren at a Wednesday gun town hall, saying: "By the way, another part of my intention, I'm not going to say plan, everyone has a plan for something, right?" Harris’ swipe at Warren was in response to the Massachusetts senator’s new unofficial slogan of having “a plan for that.” Harris said she fully intends — not plans — to “put a nurse, put a nurse and a social worker in every school” because “often the first time a child will have an interaction with someone who is not a relative of that child, which means the first time someone who has fresh eyes on that child, will be when they start school."
TRUMP ATTACKS PELOSI ON TWITTER, PROBABLY NOT FOR THE LAST TIME: Trump attacked House Speaker Nancy Pelosi Wednesday for using promises to lower drug prices as “camouflage for trying to win an election through impeachment.” Pelosi said in a news conference earlier Wednesday that she hoped to work with the White House to lower drug prices. Lowering drug prices and impeachment “have nothing to do with each other,” Pelosi said. “We have the responsibility to the oath of office to support and defend the Constitution of the United States," she said. "We also have a responsibility to get the job done for the American people.”
ARKANSAS ‘REQUIREMENT TO WORK’ FOR SNAP LEAVES PEOPLE WITH MORE CONFUSION THAN ASSISTANCE: Arkansas residents say they don’t understand the state’s work requirements for receiving food stamps, and lack training opportunities to get steady, long-term employment, according to an Urban Institute analysis. Without comprehensive job training, Arkansas residents say they don’t have the necessary tools to get the jobs they need to qualify for government assistance, and later be able to support themselves, which work requirements aim to do in the first place.
JUDGE SAYS PHILADELPHIA SUPERVISED DRUG INJECTION SITE CAN MOVE FORWARD: District Judge Gerald McHugh wrote Wednesday that a planned injection site in Philadelphia, at which drug users will be supervised by medical professionals who can act in the event of an overdose, does not violate federal law. McHugh wrote: “No credible argument can be made that facilities such as safe injection sites were within the contemplation of Congress” when lawmakers adopted the Controlled Substances Act in 1986. In the amended 2003 law, Congress included a provision, the Crackhouse Statute, that would aim to shut down any place where drugs are used or distributed. Law enforcement and Congress have repeatedly said the Philadelphia safehouse would allow and even encourage drug use, technically making it a crackhouse. McHugh’s decision is unprecedented, and may aid in opening similar sites in other states, including Denver, Seattle, San Francisco, and New York.

From Bill Maher to the Joker director, entertainers say wokeness killed comedy

Texto completo: Comedians are in agreement: It’s hard to do comedy in 2019.
Dave Chappelle and Bill Burr both addressed the issue head-on in their recent stand-up routines. “F---in’ U.S.,” Burr bemoaned on his latest Netflix special. “Everything’s so goddamn heavy. Every joke you tell!”
Joker director Todd Phillips seems to agree. Joker, which chronicles the Batman villain’s descent into madness and murder, is far from a comedy. But Phillips admitted that he made the gritty film because he struggles to create humorous content anymore. Vanity Fair explains, “Phillips had found it increasingly difficult, he says, to make comedies in the new ‘woke’ Hollywood, and his brand of irreverent bro humor has lost favor.”
“Go try to be funny nowadays with this woke culture,” Phillips said. “There were articles written about why comedies don’t work anymore — I’ll tell you why, because all the f---ing funny guys are like, ‘F--- this shit, because I don’t want to offend you.’”
“It’s hard to argue with 30 million people on Twitter,” he continued. “You just can’t do it, right? So you just go, ‘I’m out.’ I’m out, and you know what? With all my comedies — I think that what comedies in general all have in common — is they’re irreverent. So I go, ‘How do I do something irreverent, but f--- comedy? Oh I know, let’s take the comic book movie universe and turn it on its head with this.’ And so that’s really where that came from.”
Comedian and talk show host Bill Maher recently said pretty much the same thing.
“The most important thing that the Democrats can do to win the next election is to broom this element out of their party and stand up to the Twitter mob and the ultrawoke,” he told the New York Times. “And I don’t like the term 'woke,' because it implies I am asleep. I was woke before some of these people were born. I grew up in a household with two liberal parents who were ahead of their time. My father and mother told me about civil rights. I knew what the right thing was. The difference is that liberals protect people, and P.C. people protect feelings.”
Maher, an outspoken liberal, has long distanced himself from the politically correct wing of the movement because, as he says, it’s not about actually protecting people anymore; it’s about protecting their feelings. As for the “P.C. people,” Maher continues:
They don’t do anything. They’re pointing at other people who are somehow falling short of their standards, which could have changed three weeks ago. They’re constantly moving the goalposts so they can go, 'Gotcha!' For example, when I was growing up, the most liberal thing you could do is not see color. Well, that’s wrong now. You see color, always, so you can register your white privilege. But I grew up in the Martin Luther King era: Judge by the content of their character, not the color of their skin. I still think that’s the best way to do it. Not see it.
Twitter has changed the way we react to comedians, from Kevin Hart to ex-SNL hire Shane Gillis. Instead of letting entertainers explain themselves or apologize for some off-color jokes, some spectators aren't concerned with redemption. These days, Maher says, they only want to signal that they're on the right side.
“We live in an era where I don’t think people’s main focus is the truth and/or sussing out something valuable or teachable,” he said. “We live in a time in which people are more concerned with scalps and clicks.”

Defensores proinmigrantes rechazan presuntas declaraciones de Trump sobre disparar a inmigrantes

Texto completo: En los últimos días surgió la noticia de que el presidente Donald Trump habría sugerido disparar a las piernas de los inmigrantes para tratar de frenar su llegada a Estados Unidos. Las presuntas declaraciones se habrían hecho en marzo pasado.
Aunque el presidente niega haber dicho tal aseveración , independientemente de si son ciertas o falsas, distintas organizaciones proinmigrantes han manifestado su rechazo a esas palabras, ya que consideran que esto solamente eleva un odio que podría generar más violencia.
Por medio de un comunicado, la Red Fronteriza de Derechos Humanos ( BNHR , por sus siglas en inglés) dice no estar de acuerdo con la supuesta declaración, la cual fue publicada en un informe de The New York Times basado en entrevistas con fuentes no identificadas.
“Sugerir que alguien que está tratando de cruzar la frontera debe recibir un disparo en las piernas es una declaración tan espantosa y desagradable en sí misma, pero que lo haga el hombre que se sienta en la oficina más alta de este país es alucinante y nos muestra cuán lejos de lo normal nos hemos desviado”, comentó el director ejecutivo de BNHR, Fernando García.
García agregó que las personas que vienen a Estados Unidos solamente buscan proporcionar alimento a sus familias y huir de la violencia vivida en sus países de origen, por lo que en caso de ser cierta la declaración, sería un “castigo horrible” y citó la masacre ocurrida recientemente en El Paso.
“Hace solo unas semanas, un supremacista blanco que defiende la retórica de Trump abrió fuego y mató a 22 personas en un Walmart local. El presidente incita a la violencia entre sus seguidores y no tiene en cuenta la vida humana. Este es el tipo de lenguaje que trafica. Oramos para que los inmigrantes y todos los que viven a lo largo de la frontera se mantengan a salvo de los vigilantes rebeldes provocados por las palabras de Trump ”, acotó García.
Al respecto, el director de America’s Voice, Mario Carrillo , consideró que una declaración como esa solo promociona la violencia y normaliza la “peligrosa cosmovisión” de la supremacía blanca. Además de calificar como “destructivos” dichos comentarios.
“Hace dos meses, un supremacista blanco viajó a través de Texas a mi ciudad natal de El Paso y mató a 22 personas e hirió a dos docenas más en un Wal-Mart local. No fue una coincidencia que un tirador preocupado por una “invasión hispana” eligiera aterrorizar a esta ciudad de mayoría latina ni que la violencia tuviera lugar mientras Trump se concentraba en los refugiados y solicitantes de asilo en la frontera”, dijo Carrillo mientras también recordaba el ataque de Pittsburgh.
“Hace casi un año, un supremacista blanco obsesionado con la ‘teoría del reemplazo’ mató a 11 personas en la sinagoga Tree of Life en Pittsburgh después de que el presidente Trump hizo de la ‘caravana de migrantes’ su enfoque obsesivo en las últimas semanas de las elecciones de mitad de período. Por supuesto, el lenguaje de Trump de castigar a las personas y violentar a los inmigrantes no es solo una retórica peligrosa que incita: son ideas fundamentales para las políticas de la administración diseñadas para mantener alejados y expulsar a los inmigrantes y las personas de color y sus persistentes intentos de avivar las brechas a lo largo de líneas raciales y étnicas”, agregó Carrillo.
Por su parte, el presidente Trump utilizó su cuenta de Twitter para negar que sugirió disparar a las piernas de los inmigrantes, además de rechazar que quería construir el muro en la frontera con picos y corriente eléctrica.
“Ahora la prensa está tratando de vender el hecho de que quería una fosa rellena de caimanes y serpientes, con una cerca electrificada y puntas afiladas en la parte superior, en nuestra frontera sur. Puedo ser duro con la seguridad fronteriza, pero no tan duro. La prensa se ha vuelto loca. ¡Noticias falsas! ”, escribió el mandatario.
Now the press is trying to sell the fact that I wanted a Moat stuffed with alligators and snakes, with an electrified fence and sharp spikes on top, at our Southern Border. I may be tough on Border Security, but not that tough. The press has gone Crazy. Fake News!

Texto completo: BEIJING - Garlic was dead, and there was nothing Huang Yu could do. So on a cold winter day, he buried his cat’s body in a park close to his home.
Hours later, still heartbroken, the 22-year-old businessman recalled an article he had read on dog cloning in China. What if someday he could bring Garlic back to life?
“In my heart, Garlic is irreplaceable,” said Huang, who dug up his British shorthair and put the cat in his refrigerator in preparation for cloning him. “Garlic didn’t leave anything for future generations, so I could only choose to clone.”
That thought led him to Sinogene, a commercial pet-cloning company based in Beijing. Roughly $35,000 and seven months later, Sinogene produced what China’s official news media declared to be the country’s first cloned cat - and another sign of the country’s emergence as a power in cloning and genetics.
It also suggests that China could turn pet cloning into a viable business. Duplicating dogs and cats has not really taken off in the United States and elsewhere, experts say. Pet-obsessed China might be different. The size of China’s domestic pet market is expected to reach $28.2 billion this year, up nearly one-fifth from 2018, according to Gouminwang, a pet consultancy in Beijing. The country already has 55 million pet dogs and 44 million pet cats, and demand for cats is accelerating.
Pet cloning is not confined to China - Barbra Streisand famously declared last year that two of her dogs are clones - and people have been cloning cats for years. But Garlic is the first cat cloned by China, solidifying its position among major cloning nations, which include the United States, Britain and South Korea.
Demand for the service
Mi Jidong, Sinogene’s chief executive, said the company decided to start cloning pets in 2015 after conducting a survey of roughly 1,000 people that showed there was demand. The company has cloned more than 40 dogs, including Schnauzers, Pomeranians and Malteses, at a cost of about $53,000 each, some as pets and others for medical research.
It charges more for dogs than cats because the window for harvesting a dog’s eggs is very small, according to Mi. He said more than 100 people had stored DNA samples of their pets in anticipation of creating clones.
Sinogene’s yearlong effort to clone a cat was motivated by market research that showed that cats are becoming increasingly popular in China, said Mi, who has never owned a pet. (“Cats and dogs require too much care,” he said.)
China’s genetics know-how is growing rapidly. Ever since Chinese scientists cloned a female goat in 2000, they have succeeded in producing the world’s first primate clones, editing the embryos of monkeys to insert genes associated with autism and mental illness, and creating superstrong dogs by tinkering with their genes. Last year, the country stunned the world after a Chinese scientist announced that he had created the world’s first genetically edited babies.
Pet cloning is largely unregulated and controversial where it is done, but in China the barriers are especially low. Many Chinese people do not think that using animals for medical research or cosmetics testing is cruel, or that pet cloning is potentially problematic. There are also no laws against animal cruelty.
“It satisfies the owner’s spiritual needs and increases happiness,” said Wang Chuduan, a professor at China Agricultural University in Beijing. “There is a market demand. So what’s the problem?”
The bigger picture
Sinogene has bigger ambitions than cats and dogs. It is cloning a horse, and Mi said his next big goal was to clone endangered animals, including pandas and the South China tiger.
“I believe it will be quite difficult and we will need some more time,” Mi said in a conference room surrounded by framed pictures of his company’s cloning successes, like China’s first cloned police dog.
Critics contend that pet cloning is inefficient and inhumane. It is not clear what will happen to the resulting animals, or the effect when they mix with the broader gene pool. The money could be better spent on caring for existing animals, the critics say.
To clone Garlic, scientists implanted skin cells from Huang’s original cat into eggs harvested from other cats. After an electric or chemical shock, 40 cloned embryos were implanted into four surrogate mother cats. That produced three pregnancies, two of which were miscarriages, said Chen Benchi, head of Sinogene’s medical experiments team.
“The harm is very small,” said Mi, Sinogene’s chief executive.
Scientists outside China have not yet inspected Garlic, who was born July 21. But the company’s chief scientist, Lai Liangxue, was an assistant professor at the University of Missouri, and his cloning research has been published in the respected journals Nature and Science.
A visit to Sinogene’s laboratory on the outskirts of Beijing offered scenes out of something like a feline version of “The Handmaid’s Tale.” Garlic’s clone, a gray-and-white kitten, snoozed with his surrogate mother, a different breed from Garlic. He later played with a fur ball while three pregnant surrogate cats watched from cages. The new Garlic is scheduled to stay at Sinogene’s laboratory for another month for observation before he is sent to Huang.
Elsewhere, two lab workers in blue coats were focused on testing the paternity of horses. Tanks of liquid nitrogen held the cells of pets.
Cost not a barrier
Huang was initially put off by the roughly $35,000 price. But in a telephone interview from the eastern city of Wenzhou, he said getting Garlic back was worth more than that, even though his parents disapproved. The original Garlic died in January from a urinary tract infection at age 2.
On the day Garlic died and was buried, Huang exhumed Garlic’s corpse, wrapped it carefully and placed it in his refrigerator. He then waited for a Sinogene employee to arrive from Beijing to extract skin cells from Garlic and bank them. Huang decided about a month after Garlic’s death to go through with the cloning.
In his first meeting with the new Garlic in August, Huang found that cloning had not produced an exact copy of his former pet. The clone is missing a patch of black fur that graced Garlic’s chin. Sinogene said that clones might show slight differences in fur or eye color and that an outside firm had proved the DNA matched.
“If I tell you I wasn’t disappointed, then I would be lying to you,” Huang said. “But I’m also willing to accept that there are certain situations in which there are limitations to the technology.”
At a news conference in August to unveil the cloned Garlic, Mi was quoted as saying that he was considering using artificial intelligence to transplant the memories of the original pet to the cloned one.
When asked about that statement, Mi said it was not something that his company would embark on but added that it was a possibility that the technology could provide.
“It’s a way to imagine the future,” he said.

Red Jewel of Texas
Linda Pace, a philanthropist and heir to the Pace Picante salsa fortune, dreamed (literally) about a building to show selections from her 900-work collection of contemporary art. Twelve years after her death in 2007, that vision is finally being realized in San Antonio. Ruby City, a 14,000-square-foot arts center designed by the British architect David Adjaye, opens Oct. 13 with an exhibition of works by Do Ho Suh, Teresita Fernández, Isaac Julien and Cornelia Parker, among others.
As the name suggests, Ruby City's most distinctive feature is its jewel tone; the upper part of the exterior is made of a red-colored precast concrete embedded with multihued crushed glass.
Mr. Adjaye, most famous for designing the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of African-American History and Culture, described Ruby City as a "monolithic treasure box." A newcomer to working in Texas, he added that it was influenced by local architectural traditions that adapt to hot weather. "Like in an old pueblo house, you don't have a lot of big apertures," he said.
The architect got to know Ms. Pace and her art before she died, enabling him to customize the building for the collection, including a high-ceiling gallery for the tallest works. The crimson theme came to Ms. Pace in a dream, and Mr. Adjaye used the ensuing drawing she made as a jumping-off point.
"I wanted to acknowledge her sketch, but it wasn't a literal instruction," he said. "It represented hope." Information: rubycity.org TED LOOS
Skateboarding in Style
Columbus, Ind., is known as a mecca of postwar modern architecture, with churches, libraries, and post offices designed by Eliel and Eero Saarinen, I.M. Pei, Harry Weese and a host of other big names. The city's latest destination is somewhat smaller: a skatepark, albeit one with an international design pedigree. Jolie Crider Memorial Skatepark 2.0, designed by Janne Saario, a Finnish landscape architect and former professional skater, opened in early September. The skatepark bridges the past and future of Columbus, with Mitchell Giurgola Architects' 1972 Columbus East High School right across the street.
The podcast "99 Percent Invisible" got Mr. Saario the job: Jonathan Nesci, a designer who lives in Columbus and is the father of a skater, cold-emailed the architect after listening to "The Pool and the Stream," a 2017 episode about the connection between curvaceous swimming pools and skatepark design featuring Mr. Saario. Mr. Nesci eventually gave Mr. Saario one of his mirror-polished side tables in return for a conceptual design. Hunger Skateparks, in Bloomington, Ind., signed on to build the $ 400,000, 14,000-square-foot project, with support from the city, the county's Heritage Fund, the Columbus Park Foundation and local donors. The new concrete skatepark is far more durable than its predecessor, as well as more seamlessly integrated into the landscape, reflecting the same investment in advanced design as those public works of the 1950s and 1960s.

Great on Paper
A mere 193 years after his death in 1826, the visionary French architect Jean-Jacques Lequeu is having his first solo show in the United States. An exhibition of 50 of his drawings of architectural fantasies -- from funerary urns for fictitious people to finely drawn Gothic temples -- opens Oct. 4 at the Menil Drawing Institute in Houston.
The work has not received its due. Less than a year before he died in poverty at the age of 68, Lequeu, who had settled into a career as a surveyor and cartographer, gave all his architectural drawings to the Bibliothèque Nationale de France, where they languished for years (including the erotic ones).
Edouard Kopp, the chief curator at the Menil Drawing Institute, described Lequeu as a "man of encyclopedic knowledge" and his visual fancies as pre-postmodern. "Imagining architecture on paper you can give your imagination free rein; there's no worry about clients' needs or building constraints," he said.
"Jean-Jacques Lequeu: Visionary Architect, Drawings from the Bibliothèque Nationale de France" runs through Jan. 5, then travels to the Morgan Library & Museum in New York City, where it will be on view from Jan. 31 to May 10, 2020. Information: www.menil.org ARLENE HIRST
Flame Keeper in the Windy City
Amid this year's centennial celebrations of the founding of the Bauhaus comes a documentary about the person who probably did the most to spread the multidisciplinary message of Germany's radical school of modernism to America: the Hungarian-born artist Laszlo Moholy-Nagy.
An instructor at the Bauhaus who fled Europe when the Nazis came to power, Moholy-Nagy eventually settled in Chicago and in 1937 opened The New Bauhaus, which is also the name of the film. The school lasted only a year, but Moholy-Nagy resurrected it as the Chicago School of Design (now the Institute of Design, part of the Illinois Institute of Technology), emphasizing experiential learning. Students mastered the use of table saws, shaped wood into forms that felt good to the touch and went on to create such enduring designs as the curvaceous Dove soap bar and the squeezable plastic honey container in the shape of a bear.
Today, when newcomers to America are often regarded as suspect, Petter Ringbom and Marquise Stillwell of Opendox, the film's production company, seek to highlight Moholy-Nagy's contributions as an immigrant. He never gained the recognition of Bauhaus leaders like Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, but Moholy-Nagy kept alive "the idea of unifying different disciplines," said Mr. Ringbom, also the film's cinematographer.
Directed by Alysa Nahmias and featuring archival footage and interviews with Moholy-Nagy descendants, "The New Bauhaus" premieres Oct. 16 at the Architecture & Design Film Festivaln New York. Information: adfilmfest.com JANE MARGOLIES

In Las Vegas, A Unified Call By Democrats For Gun Laws

Texto completo: A forum organized by Giffords and March for Our Lives, two years after a mass shooting in Las Vegas, aimed to bring gun policy to the forefront of the Democratic primary.
LAS VEGAS -- The 2020 Democratic presidential candidates on Wednesday expressed their collective support for sweeping new gun control measures, appearing at a forum in a city still grieving after a gunman massacred 58 concertgoers two years and one day ago.
The forum, sponsored by two gun control organizations and MSNBC, was intended as a platform for a policy discussion -- but it quickly became an outlet for rising anxiety among Democrats who fear the country has grown numb to mass shootings, like the ones that took place during a single August weekend in El Paso and in Dayton, Ohio.
"It's not an intellectual issue," said Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey, speaking to an audience that included the families of some shooting victims. "This is living with a sense of urgency. We cannot wait. This is no time for an impotence of empathy. We cannot wait until this hell is upon your community for you to be activated in this fight."
For six hours, the event was punctuated by emotional and sometimes graphic descriptions of the horror that fell upon Las Vegas on Oct. 1, 2017.
Sandra Jauregui, a Nevada assemblywoman who survived the shooting and was co-sponsor of a gun control package passed by the state Legislature this year, said it had taken her months to stop hearing the "ta-ta-ta" of the gunshots. An audience member said she had used her finger to plug a bullet hole in a victim's head and sat with another victim's body for five hours, at one point answering his phone to tell his mother he was dead.
Nine candidates participated in the forum, and the party's increasingly unified support for strict gun control measures, which once splintered Democrats along regional and ideological lines, was on full display.
In a particularly revealing moment, former Representative Beto O'Rourke of Texas accused Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., of being "afraid of doing the right thing" because Mr. Buttigieg -- like several other candidates, including the former housing secretary Julián Castro -- supports a voluntary buyback program for assault weapons, not a mandatory one. Just a few years ago, support for even a voluntary buyback would have been bold.
Mr. Castro defended his stance, saying that after enacting an assault weapons ban, it would be sufficient to require anyone who kept an assault weapon to register it with the government. And Mr. Buttigieg cast mandatory buybacks -- which Mr. O'Rourke, Mr. Booker and Senator Kamala Harris of California support -- as a "shiny object" whose pursuit might sabotage a rare opportunity to pass new gun laws.
Many policies that would have been politically impossible before now have majority support, Mr. Buttigieg said. "We can get background checks done now," he said. "We can get red flag laws done now. We can get something done about the new sale of assault weapons now. We cannot wait for these other debates to play out, even if they're healthy debates."
Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. devoted much of his time to promoting the gun plan he released Wednesday morning; he had, until now, been one of the few candidates without one.
In addition to two policies supported by every Democrat in the race -- universal background checks and an assault weapons ban -- Mr. Biden called for a voluntary buyback program and a ban on online gun sales. That is an unusual proposal; for the most part, other candidates have called only for restrictions on online sales, not a wholesale prohibition.
Mr. Biden also called for financial incentives to encourage states to enact gun licensing programs, but stopped short of endorsing a national licensing requirement, in contrast to most of his opponents. That could be a big dividing line: Mr. Booker, who was the first candidate to propose a federal licensing requirement, said unprompted on Wednesday that anyone who did not support such a requirement "should not be a nominee from our party."
The entrepreneur Andrew Yang offered his own twist on a licensing requirement: a "tiered" system in which different licenses would be required for different weapons, much as a truck driver needs to meet more stringent licensing requirements than a regular passenger-car driver.
Several candidates, particularly Ms. Harris and Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, emphasized the steps they intended to take through executive action, especially if Republicans keep their Senate majority.
"A president herself," Ms. Klobuchar said, can close loopholes in the background check system and direct the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to research the causes of, and most effective solutions to, gun violence. "You can do all this without Congress."
Ms. Harris was even more forceful.
"I'm so done with this subject," she said. "We just need action, and if the Congress is not going to act, then a president must."
When the moderator, Craig Melvin, asked if she was concerned that a future Republican president could undo executive actions, Ms. Harris responded sharply.
"Craig," she said, "I will deal with that in eight years."
In comparison to the other candidates, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts chose to focus not on the details of her plan, but on reviving her call to investigate the National Rifle Association and on hammering the overarching idea of her campaign: The country's many problems can all be traced to a common corrupting source.
"This is not ultimately about guns. It's about money, and it's about who makes money off the system as it is," Ms. Warren said. "This is a fundamental question about who Washington works for."
On average, she and others noted, 100 people die from gun violence every day in the United States. "If 100 people were dying from a mysterious virus, we would be all over this," Ms. Warren said, "but because it is guns -- because it is so twisted into the political corruption -- people don't want to ask that question. We need to treat gun violence like the public health emergency it is and respond with the kind of strength it demands."
Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont had been expected to attend the forum, but had to cancel after being hospitalized for a heart procedure.
The candidates spent part of their time onstage defending the constitutionality of their proposals and denouncing the idea that restrictions on gun ownership are an inherent violation of the Second Amendment.
"The president of the United States has to stand up to the N.R.A. and say, 'Enough is enough,"' Ms. Harris said. "'I'm not going to any longer accept your false choice that you're either in favor of the Second Amendment or you want to take everybody's guns away."'
Americans have long since decided "that within the boundaries of the Second Amendment, that there's a line," Mr. Buttigieg said in calling for an assault weapons ban. "Anyone can have a water balloon. Nobody can have a Predator drone."
While the event -- sponsored by March for Our Lives and Giffords, the gun control group of which former Representative Gabrielle Giffords of Arizona is a co-founder -- included plenty of discussion of policy details and differences, the underlying theme seemed to be something more: a unanimous vow, among the Democratic candidates, to treat the issue with far more urgency than President Trump has.
"We must never stop fighting -- fight, fight, fight!" said Ms. Giffords, who nearly died after being shot in the head during a constituent meet-and-greet in 2011.
Taking the stage once more, briefly, at the end of the event, she gave the candidates and the audience a directive: "Get 'er done."

Whistleblower sought guidance from Schiff's panel before filing complaint

Texto completo: The intelligence officer whose allegations of presidential wrongdoing have sparked a full-blown impeachment inquiry sought guidance from a Democratic-led congressional committee days before filing his complaint with an inspector general, according to panel aides.
The whistleblower's interaction with an aide for Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), who chairs the House Intelligence Committee, reflects the officer's sense of urgency in surfacing the allegations that President Trump had pressed the president of Ukraine to intervene in the 2020 election in a way that would harm a potential political rival. It is also fairly routine for the committee to receive an informal inquiry from a whistleblower before a formal complaint is made, according to current and former committee staffers.
The revelation, first reported Wednesday by the New York Times, prompted an immediate jab by the president, who suggested without evidence that Schiff may have helped compose the whistleblower complaint.
"He knew long before, and he helped write it, too," Trump said at a news conference alongside Finnish President Sauli Niinisto. "The whole thing is a scam."
An attorney for the whistleblower, whose identity has not been made public, rebutted Trump's claim.
"Absolutely not," attorney Mark Zaid said.
Andrew Clark, a Trump reelection campaign spokesman, questioned whether the whistleblower's legal team coordinated with Schiff or his staff. Zaid said there was no contact between the whistleblower's lawyers and Congress until weeks after the complaint was filed with the intelligence community's inspector general.
A spokesman for the House Intelligence Committee, Patrick Boland, said, "Like other whistleblowers have done before and since under Republican- and Democratic-controlled committees, the whistleblower contacted the committee for guidance on how to report possible wrongdoing within the jurisdiction of the intelligence community."
At no point, Boland said, "did the committee review or receive the complaint in advance."
The committee staffer who interacted with the intelligence officer was given only "the very bare contours" of the allegations, said a committee aide, speaking on the condition of anonymity because the aide was not authorized to speak for the record. As is common when such calls are received at the committee, the staffer advised the individual to seek legal counsel and file a complaint with the inspector general - either at the officer's home agency or with the intelligence community inspector general.
The officer - whose identity, aides said, is not known to Schiff - did just that, lodging a formal complaint with Intelligence Community Inspector General Michael Atkinson on Aug. 12.
Within two weeks, Atkinson determined the complaint was credible and met the whistleblower law's definition of an "urgent concern," triggering a seven-day deadline by which the director of national intelligence was required by law to transmit the complaint to the House and Senate intelligence committees.
However, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, after consulting the White House and the Justice Department, declined to promptly submit the complaint to Congress. Instead, acting director Joseph Maguire told lawmakers last week that the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) had concluded the complaint was not an "urgent concern," saying the OLC determined that the activities at issue did not constitute an "intelligence activity within the responsibility and authority" of the ODNI.
The complaint described a July 25 call in which Trump pressed Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate the activities of former vice president Joe Biden and his son and efforts to restrict access to records of the call. It also alleged that Trump asked Zelensky to look into unproven allegations that Russia's interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election originated in Ukraine.
By consulting Congress before filing a formal complaint, a whistleblower could be considered in violation of the law and might expose himself or herself to reprisal by his or her home agency, experts said. But, whistleblower attorney Bradley Moss said, retaliation for a security infraction of this sort - seeking informal guidance from Congress - is unlikely.
"It would look ridiculously petty," said Moss, who is a partner in Zaid's law firm, though he is not personally representing the whistleblower.
The intelligence committee aide said the panel receives two to three whistleblower inquiries a month, or 20 to 30 a year, but only a small fraction end up meeting the "urgent concern" definition.
The complaint against the president is, however, unprecedented in potential impact. "There has never been anything close to this complaint when it comes to the political implications and constitutional implications that we have here," Moss said.
Most whistleblower complaints are about budgetary concerns or intelligence-gathering issues involving mid-level management, he said. "This one strikes at the heart of concerns about presidential abuse of authority."

Texto completo: China is not America’s friend. It is not America's "partner." The 70th anniversary of China’s communist revolution is certainly nothing for any American to celebrate.
Someone ought to tell that to the president of the United States.
“Congratulations to President Xi and the Chinese people on the 70th Anniversary of the People’s Republic of China!” President Trump tweeted Tuesday. TweetMaybe the spittle-flecked pundits in the cheap seats are correct. Maybe Trump has lost his mind.
There is no good reason for the commander in chief of “the land of the free” to extend a congratulatory note commemorating the communist takeover of China. China's communists did not abolish the nation's backwardness or imperial rule. They did not even fight the Japanese in World War II. They just seized control afterward and then spent most of their newly formed nation's history mismanaging its economy and murdering their countrymen for holding improper opinions. After Chairman Mao Zedong’s death, they at least dropped the socialism part and opened up their markets to global trade so that China could pull itself out of poverty.
Trump's tweet is not unlike an American president congratulating, say, the supreme leader of Iran.
Trump and his flunkies cannot play this off as an act of “diplomacy.” This is not diplomacy. This is sycophancy. What the president said Tuesday is every bit as foul as the New York Times' cloying 1976 obituary for Mao, after whom Chinese President Xi Jinping styles himself. Speaking of which, Trump's tweet is every bit as foul as when former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg wrongly (and knowingly) insisted that Xi is not a dictator. Trump's tweet is as foul as all the other bureaucratic American lickspittles who have tripped over themselves in the past congratulating China on the birth of its current despotic regime. It is all the same. It is an apologia for tyranny and a grave disservice to the literally tens of millions of people who have been killed by Chinese communism.
To praise the People's Republic is to ignore things like Mao’s disastrously conceived "Great Leap Forward," which killed an estimated 45 million human beings through sheer incompetence. It is to ignore communist China’s history of political purges, its labor camps, its mass exterminations, and its execution quotas. It is to ignore the estimated 10,000 freedom fighters murdered in 1989 in Tiananmen Square by Chinese government forces. To commemorate the 70th anniversary is also to spit on the Hong Kong protesters today, who regularly cite American principles and iconography in their David-versus-Goliath battle to remain free from Chinese oppression.
Trump is the president of a free country whose principles of liberty are enshrined in its founding documents. He should try acting like it.

Texto completo: El representante demócrata Adam Schiff, jefe del Comité de Inteligencia de la Cámara Baja y ahora responsable del impeachment a Donald Trump, supo de la llamada del presidente a su homólogo ucraniano días antes de que el escándalo se hiciera público.
La persona que dio a conocer el asunto que ha echado a andar la maquinaria del juicio político al mandatario estadounidense se puso primero en contacto con un asistente de Schiff , que le pasó la información al demócrata.
Según The New York Times, un portavoz y funcionarios y exfuncionarios estadounidenses aseguraron que el denunciante habló con este miembro del equipo de Schiff para trasladarle cómo se habían manejado sus acusaciones cuando un compañero se las hizo llegar al principal abogado de la CIA. El asesor de Schiff le sugirió al denunciante que rellenara una queja formal , de acuerdo al diario neoyorquino.
En un comunicado, Patrick Boland, portavoz del Comité de Inteligencia y del propio Schiff, dijo que el denunciante contactó con ellos para obtener información sobre cómo informar posibles irregularidades dentro de su jurisdicción . “El comité aconsejó convenientemente al denunciante que contactara con un Inspector General y que buscara asesoría legal”, explicó Boland. Según aseguró, el comité no recibió ni revisó la queda de antemano.
El portavoz del equipo de Schiff, que dejó las puertas abiertas para todos las personas que quieran recibir asesoría sobre actos de dudosa moralidad, “espera completa protección para (el informante), a pesar de las amenazas del presidente “. “Solo gracias a su coraje -continuaba el comunicado- estos actos de abuso de poder del presidente salieron a la luz”.

Texto completo: Remember, impeachment is a political process, not a legal one. There is no obligation to prosecute. Congress is supposed to do what is in the best interest of the country. And this process could be very bad for America:
This will probably achieve nothing. To remove Trump from office, at least 20 Republican senators would have to vote to convict him. If you think that will happen because of this incident, you haven’t been paying attention to the Senate Republicans over the past 2 1/2 years.
Usually when a leader takes a big risk, it’s because there’s a big upside. But Nancy Pelosi is taking a giant risk and there is little upside. At the end of this process, Trump will probably be acquitted by the Senate. He will declare himself vindicated and victorious in his battle against The Swamp. An ugly backlash could ensue — in both parties.
This is completely elitist. We’re in the middle of an election campaign. If Democrats proceed with the impeachment process, it will happen amid candidate debates, primaries and caucuses. Elections give millions and millions of Americans a voice in selecting the president. This process gives 100 mostly millionaire senators a voice in selecting the president.
As these two processes unfold simultaneously, the contrast will be obvious. People will conclude that Democrats are going ahead with impeachment in an election year because they don’t trust the democratic process to yield the right outcome.
This is not what the country wants to talk about. Pelosi said she would not proceed with impeachment unless there was a bipartisan groundswell of support. According to a recent Quinnipiac University poll, only 37% of Americans support impeachment.
The presidential candidates all report the same phenomenon. Voters are asking them about health care and jobs and climate change, not impeachment. Last week, while all this was unfolding, I was in Waco, Nantucket and Kansas City. I had conversations or encounters with hundreds of people. Only one even mentioned impeachment, a fellow journalist.
There is a big difference between the conversation Twitter wants to have and the conversation the broader populace wants to have.
Democrats are playing Trump’s game. Trump has no policy agenda. He’s incompetent at improving the lives of American citizens, even his own voters. But he’s good at one thing: waging reality TV personality wars against coastal elites. So now over the next few months he gets to have a personality war against Nancy Pelosi and Jerrold Nadler.
The Democrats are having a pretty exciting and substantive presidential primary season. This is what democracy is supposed to look like. Why they would want to distract from that is beyond reason. Trump vs. Nadler is exactly the contrast Trump wants to elevate.
This process will increase public cynicism. Impeachment would be an uplifting exercise if we had sober leaders who could put party affiliation aside and impartially weigh the evidence. It would be workable if Congress enjoyed broad public affection and legitimacy. We don’t live in that world.
This could embed Trumpism within the GOP. If Trump suffers a withering loss in a straight-up election campaign, then his populist tendency might shrink and mainstream Republicans might regain primacy. An election defeat would mean the people don’t like Trumpism. But the impeachment process reinforces the core Trumpist deep-state message: The liberal elites screw people like us. If Trump’s most visible opponents are D.C. lawyers, Trumpism becomes permanent.
This could distort the Democratic primary process. It’s already obvious that impeachment upstages the Democratic primaries. In the months ahead, the Democratic candidates are going to have a harder time getting attention.
Impeachment will doubtless roil the Democratic primary race in unpredictable ways. The most bellicose candidates might profit as the impeachment wars grow more vitriolic. The moderates might be further marginalized.
Democrats are running against a man whose approval rating never gets above 45%. They just have to be normal to win. Instead, they’re rolling the dice in a risky way.
An election can save the country. An inside-the-Beltway political brawl will not.

Glamping?

Texto completo: If you'd like a change from the daily grind, the constant sound of your cell phone and a unique experience, consider glamping. Emily Henning of Madison, owner of Upcountry Camp, supplies everything needed for glamping – short for glamorous camping -- and does all of the work. Upcountry Camp sets up Sibley bell tents – they look like vintage campaign tents -- and adds furnishings to them, so that they can turn girlfriend parties, neighborhood gatherings, milestone birthday parties, prom, graduation parties and almost any soiree into Instagram worthy occasions.
Depending upon the package selected, a tent can be furnished with a king- or queen-size bed or twin beds for sleeping or as a lounge area with a couch, two armchairs, coffee table, side tables, poufs, a chandelier, rugs, lanterns, fans, twinkle lights and multiple pillows.
Upcountry Camp also has 16 indoor teepees used mainly for children's birthday sleepovers and even for adult parties. Each tent comes with a memory foam mattress, soft sheets, pillow, lantern and twinkle lights, and party favors can be included as part of the deal.
Costs for Upcountry Camp experiences ranges from $210 for a three-person teepee party to $350-$800 for a glamping tent. For details, go to upcountrycamp.com
Glamping revenues are expected to grow in the next five years and reach an estimated $1 billion by 2024, according to The New York Times. The founding of the American Glamping Association is said to indicate the industry's journey to the mainstream.
Henning established her business in March 2017 with a single glamping tent, inspired by the glamping she and her family did from 2012-2016 when they lived in Nairobi, Kenya. Henning's husband, Ed, is a federal agent, and they moved to Africa because of his work.
"My husband and I loved camping, but it was so much work," she said. "Our experiences in Kenya changed our minds. When you go on an African safari, you sleep in a nice bed with nice sheets in a nice tent. Everything is done for you."
When Henning and her husband, daughter Josie and son Marcus returned to the United States, they lived in Atlanta, where she bought her first glamping tent, placed it in their backyard, took photos and put them on Instagram and Facebook. "Pretty soon we started booking gigs," she said.
In January 2017, the Hennings moved to Madison after deciding to relocate to a small, southern city similar to Roanoke, Virginia where they had once lived. Emily Henning grew up in a military family that lived in many places and earned a sociology/anthropology degree from the University of Mary Washington in Fredericksburg, Virginia, and Ed Henning grew up in Roanoke, Virginia and earned a degree from Virginia Military Institute.
The move to Madison brought a quieter, easier lifestyle than what they had in Atlanta, Henning said, and has turned out to be good.
"My business has taken off in a way it never could have in Atlanta," she said. "It's easier to get to know people here than in Atlanta. We are super blessed with how well my business has been received here. It's been a fabulous thing to meet people and make friends."
Henning was treated for Stage I breast cancer in 2016 and that provided her another reason to pursue entrepreneurship. "It made me dig in deeper and think about how I want to live my life," she said.
She worked in nonprofit fundraising in Atlanta and used her knowledge from that to get the word out about her business. She has donated glamping packages or tent setups to events hosted by St. Andrew's Episcopal School, the Junior League of Jackson, Christ Covenant School, the Mississippi Museum of Art and the Mississippi Symphony League.
"It gives me a reason to go and set up a tent," she said. "People like to see the tents set up."
Henning has also set up a tent at Livingston Farmers Market and one at Fondren After Five in Jackson.
"The Beacon in Fondren has also been supportive with its Makers Market," she said. "What I have found is the entrepreneurial community is strong here."
On many weekends, Henning sets up for four or five glamping experiences. "That's busier than I ever expected to be," she said.
Lindsey and Blake Sloan of Brandon recently arranged for an Upcountry Camp teepee sleepover with a boho feel for their daughter, Addison, to celebrate her ninth birthday.
"The only thing she wanted for her birthday was to have a glamping party," Lindsey Sloan said. "She it on Instagram and was completely set on it. Emily (Henning) came in and set up everything up and took everything down. I ordered pizza and a birthday cake."
Lindsey Sloan said she is considering a party for herself. "I'm going to turn 35 in March, and I'm going to do a girl party with a big tent," she said.
Sonja and Ben Kerr of Ridgeland worked with Upcountry Camp on a sleepover party for their son, Jonah, who recently celebrated his ninth birthday.
"Emily set up the tent in our backyard," she said. "The tent itself is an attraction. She even had a trunk in the middle of the tent that had fans inside in case they needed them."
Sonja Kerr said she has worked with Upcountry Camp for three events, and Henning makes it easy.
"Emily's work ethic and rapport make you want to use her again," she said. "I feel like I've made a friend."
Henning believes glamping will continue to grow in popularity because people like ditching technology to spend time outdoors with family and friends.
"People are looking for unique experiences that they're going to remember that let them spend time with their friends and family," she said. "It's about experiences over things."
A campaign-style outdoor tent, set up by Upcountry Camp, provides a setting for a birthday party in Ridgeland.

Texto completo: Back when reruns were a staple of summer programming, television networks aired repeats of their programs, giving viewers another opportunity to see what they had already seen.
Democratic politicians are now conducting their own version of reruns.
The same bunch who brought us the failed Russian "collusion" story, the sliming of Justice Brett Kavanaugh and charges that President Trump is a racist (which also failed, given the spectacular increase in minority employment), are now rerunning the same show with different characters.
According to a still anonymous "whistleblower," who wrote a multipage "complaint" about a phone call between President Trump and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy that he or she heard about secondhand from another unnamed person, President Trump held back military aide to Ukraine until "dirt" on Joe Biden and his son Hunter could be provided.
Hunter Biden served on the board of Burisma, a Ukrainian gas company, which paid him $3.1 million over a 16-month period.
This when his father was vice president of the United States and, according to Bloomberg, pursing "an anti-corruption policy in Ukraine ... that included a call for the resignation of the country's top prosecutor who had previously investigated Burisma."
Ukraine's prosecutor general has since come out and said that there is no evidence of wrongdoing by U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden or his son, but something doesn't pass the smell test.
The New York Times reports the whistleblower is a CIA agent who was on loan to the White House. I have known several CIA agents and two directors of the CIA - George H.W. Bush and Porter Goss - and none were known for the kind of prose contained in the complaint.
The document appears to have been written by a team of lawyers with a political objective, namely impeachment of the president.
This is a view shared by Fred Fleitz, president of the Center for Security Policy, a conservative, Washington, D.C.-based think tank.
Fleitz is also a former deputy assistant to President Trump and to the chief of staff of the National Security Council.
Writing in The New York Post, Fleitz says: "I am very familiar with transcripts of presidential phone calls since I edited and processed dozens of them when I worked for the NSC. I also know a lot about intelligence whistleblowers from my time with the CIA.
"My suspicions grew ... when I saw the declassified whistleblower complaint. It appears to be written by a law professor and includes legal references and detailed footnotes. It also has an unusual legalistic reference on how this complaint should be classified.
From my experience, such an extremely polished whistleblowing complaint is unheard of. This document looks as if this leaker had outside help, possibly from congressional members or staff."
When it comes to an impeachable offense, there is no there, there.
Like other attempts to undo the results of the 2016 election, this one should also fail if Republicans stick together, as Democrats did during the impeachment of Bill Clinton. Rep. Al Green (D-Texas) revealed his party's true motives when he said that if Trump isn't impeached he will be reelected.
There are deeper issues for 2020. They include capitalism vs. socialism; higher unemployment vs. lower; judges who revere and obey the Constitution vs. judges who wish they had written it and know what the Founders intended better than the Founders; government health care vs. reforms in the current system to make it better; greater dependence on government vs. an expansion of individual liberty; rewarding initiative and success vs. penalizing the successful with higher taxes and more regulations.
Don't expect President Trump to start quoting this line from the Ukraine national anthem, but it could prove prophetic if Democrats fail in their latest cynical attempt to impeach him: "Like the dew before the sun enemies will fade. We will further rule and prosper in our promised land."

NJ Transit's finances to be probed

Texto completo: Whispers of NJ Transit fare hikes are, in part, the reason the state Senate is launching an investigation into the struggling agency, the future investigating committee's chair said Tuesday.
"We charge more for a commuter system than any other area around here and now we're talking about charging more and it isn't working right — that's not a formula for success," said Senate President Stephen Sweeney, who said the investigation would likely begin after the elections in late November or early December. "The time of talking about things is long past and it's really time to figure it out, come up with solutions and move forward."
Sweeney will be joined on the committee by three Democratic colleagues in the senate — Sandra Cunningham, Patrick Diegnan and Majority Leader Loretta Weinberg — and several Republicans who will be named at a later date to join the group.
Public hearings The committee will hold public hearings, round-table discussions, conduct site visits and, if needed, Sweeney said, a subpoena for information or testimony.
"We're just going to keep a focus on this, a very high-profile focus on this until we have a solution," Sweeney said. "It's time to stop talking about how good we are ... because the commuters I've been talking to don't feel that way."
NJ Transit spokeswoman Nancy Snyder said in an email the agency looks forward to working with the Legislature, and highlighted recent changes at the agency including accelerating work on a federally-mandated braking system, hiring engineers and drivers, and advancing stalled capital projects.
"While there is still much to be done, NJ Transit has made notable progress investing in recruiting, infrastructure and new vehicles, while enhancing safety for riders," Snyder said. "We look forward to discussing these issues with the Legislature in the months ahead as we continue improving the quality of public transportation throughout the state.
Riders had mixed reactions to the news.
"This is great news. Let's just hope this NJ Senate committee has teeth," Bobby Amirshahi, a rider on the Morris & Essex line, said in a Facebook comment.
Fellow rider, David Danto, threw in his suggestion to get results.
"Pass a state law that has the NJ Transit executives and management earn a basic salary, with incentives tied to train reliability and on-time performance," Danto said. "With skin in the game there would finally be improvements."
Murphy's law Fixing the embattled agency has been a central talking point of Gov. Phil Murphy since he was elected in 2017.
The governor issued an audit of the agency, which released its report about a year ago, signed a reform bill in December requiring changes at NJ Transit, and has held several press conferences this year touting the agency's improvements.
"Make no mistake: this administration is doing the long, difficult work of putting NJ Transit on the path to recovery, and Governor Murphy will not stop until New Jersey commuters have the world-class transportation agency they deserve," Murphy spokesman Dan Bryan said in a statement.
"We welcome the Legislature's scrutiny and look forward to the discussion of their budgets that were negotiated with Governor Christie and sent to his desk, which reduced state funding to the agency by as much as 90 percent."
Years of underfunded budgets that required the agency to raid its capital monies and unreliable funding from different sources has been at the heart of NJ Transit's problems, an issue highlighted frequently by politicians, agency officials and advocates for commuters.
This year the state Legislature approved a $50 million net increase for NJ Transit during budget negotiations in May, up from the $25 million originally proposed by Murphy.
Sweeney said a "dedicated source of funding is crucial," but admitted nothing concrete is in the works to make that happen yet.
Weinberg said earlier this month that this issue should be addressed once the agency's new board members are appointed to their positions. Murphy gave his list of board nominations to the Senate in March, but they have yet to be confirmed.
The announcement of the investigation comes four days after The New York Times published an article calling NJ Transit "the worst commuter train in America."
NJ Transit trains are four times as likely to be cancelled as Long Island Railroad and Metro North trains, and NJ Transit's accident and breakdown rate is worse than other major railroads, according to The New York Times analysis.

Jessye Norman, 74, an inspired and inspiring opera soprano

Texto completo: From her early performances, critics hailed Jessye Norman as a majestic American soprano who brought a sumptuous, shimmering voice to a broad range of roles wherever she performed — from the Metropolitan Opera in New York City to Tanglewood and other venues around the world.
Ms. Norman, one of the most decorated of American singers, was 74 when she died Monday in New York. The cause was septic shock and multiple organ failure following complications of a spinal cord injury she suffered in 2015, according to a statement by her family.
She won five Grammy Awards, four for her recordings and one for lifetime achievement. She also received the prestigious Kennedy Center Honor in 1997 and the National Medal of Arts in 2009.
Finding acclaim as a recitalist and on the concert stage from the outset, Ms. Norman began her career in the late 1960s and went on to sing the title role in Verdi's “Aida," Wagner's heroines, characters in Janacek, Poulenc, Bartok, and Strauss operas, and Cassandre in “Les Troyens" by Berlioz, in which she made her Met debut in 1983.
She appeared in more than 80 performances at the Met, whose general manager, Peter Gelb, told The New York Times on Monday that she was “one of the greatest artists to ever sing on our stage."
Ms. Norman first appeared at Tanglewood in 1972, early in her career.
“If Jessye Norman were as famous as she is good, there would have been a mob at Tanglewood for the Friday night Boston Symphony concert," Globe critic Michael Steinberg wrote that August, lamenting the comparatively small audience of 5,000.
To Wagner's opera “Tristan und Isolde," he added, Ms. Norman brought “musical taste of a high order, intensity, and that kind of personal projection which instantly says 'star.' "
She was a month shy of turning 27 that night, and in a Globe interview a quarter-century later Ms. Norman recalled how she came to be in Tanglewood that evening.
Ms. Norman had been a member of the Deutsche Oper in Berlin when conductor Colin Davis chose her for a 1971 recording of Mozart's “Le Nozze di Figaro." Davis, a Boston Symphony guest conductor, “invited me to come along with him to Tanglewood the next summer, and so I did. . . . It was a first for me, because I had never visited Tanglewood before, even as a guest. Immediately I was struck at how very beautiful everything was."
Charmed by a venue where “people may rehearse in their shirt-sleeves, but they are serious about the music," she recalled that “you can perform Wagner, and thousands of people will come and sit on the grass and bring their children and their grandma and their cousins. That is a wonderful thing."
A keen interpreter as well as a magnificent singer, Ms. Norman had a distinctly opulent tone that sounded effortless, never pushed. It was especially suited to Wagner and Strauss.
In a review of a 1992 recital, Edward Rothstein of The New York Times likened her voice to a “grand mansion of sound."
“It defines an extraordinary space," he wrote. “It has enormous dimensions, reaching backward and upward. It opens onto unexpected vistas. It contains sunlit rooms, narrow passageways, cavernous halls. Ms. Norman is the regal mistress of this domain, with a physical presence suited to her vocal expanse."
As an African-American, she credited other great black singers with paving the way for her, naming Marian Anderson, Dorothy Maynor, and Leontyne Price, among others, in a 1983 interview with the Times.
“They have made it possible for me to say, 'I will sing French opera,' " she said “or, 'I will sing German opera,' instead of being told, 'You will sing “Porgy and Bess." ' Look, it's unrealistic to pretend that racial prejudice doesn't exist. It does! It's one thing to have a set of laws, and quite another to change the hearts and minds of men. That takes longer. I do not consider my blackness a problem. I think it looks rather nice."
In her memoir, “Stand Up Straight and Sing!" (2014), she recounted meeting instances of racism. “Racial barriers in our world are not gone, so why can we imagine that racial barriers in classical music and the opera world are gone?" she told the Times in 2014.
Ms. Norman was born into a musical family on Sept. 15, 1945, in Augusta, Ga., where she grew up in a segregated but close-knit world. Her mother, Janie King Norman, was an amateur pianist; her father, Silas Norman Sr., was an insurance broker. Jessye especially enjoyed visiting her maternal grandparents, fascinated by one particular piece of furniture.
“My grandparents were the only people I ever knew who had one — a grand pedal organ, or more accurately, a harmonium — right there in their house," she wrote in her memoir. “It lived over in the corner of the front room, and I remember thinking that it was the most exotic thing I had ever encountered in my entire life. As far as I can recall, we were never stopped from playing it, nor admonished for disturbing the adults."
She began listening to opera on the radio as a child.
“I remember thinking that opera stories were not very different from other stories: a boy meets a girl, they fall in love, they cannot be together for some reason, and most of the time it does not end happily ever after," she wrote. “For me, opera stories were grown-up versions of stories that were familiar to me already."
She earned a bachelor's degree in music from Howard University and studied at the University of Michigan and Peabody Institute. Her career received its first big boost when she won a first-place prize at the Munich International Music Competition in 1968. The next year, she made her debut on an opera stage at the Deutsche Oper Berlin in Wagner's “Tannhäuser," as Elisabeth.
In 1983, she made her Met debut, opening the company's centennial season singing the role of Cassandre in a starry revival of Berlioz's “Les Troyens."
She rose early the next day to appear on NBC's “Today" show. “The only person in my family who couldn't come on Monday was my mother, who is ill and at home in Georgia," she said at the time. “I wanted to give her a look at me."
Her imposing stage presence and large, voluptuous voice made her ideal for certain parts.
When she sang the title character of Richard Strauss' “Ariadne auf Naxos," one of her defining roles, John Rockwell described her in the Times as “one of our most musicianly singers" and added: “She has just the right voice for this role: a smoothly knit-together soprano that reaches up from plummy contralto notes to a powerful fullness on top."
In a sign of her international stature, Ms. Norman was tapped to sing “La Marseillaise" in Paris on the 200th anniversary of Bastille Day — which she did, in dramatic fashion, at the obelisk on the Place de la Concorde before an array of world leaders, wearing a grand tricolor gown designed by Azzedine Alaïa. She also sang at the second inaugurations of Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton.
She became a major recording artist at the dawn of the compact disc era, leaving a rich catalog of opera, lieder, spirituals, and recitals.
In person she cut an imposing figure, dressing dramatically and speaking with a diva's perfect diction. And even after she left the opera stage she remained a restless, probing artist, collaborating with the dancer, choreographer, and director Bill T. Jones in 1999 on a piece called “How! Do! We! Do!"
In 2003, Ms. Norman and the Rachel Longstreet Foundation created the Jessye Norman School of the Arts, a free after-school arts program in her native Augusta for underserved students.
Among her final projects was “Sissieretta Jones: Call Her By Her Name!" — a tribute to Jones, who in 1893 became the first African-American woman to headline a concert on the main stage of Carnegie Hall, and who had bristled at her stage name, “the Black Patti," which compared her to the white diva Adelina Patti.
In her memoir, Ms. Norman recalled one of her own earliest stabs at singing opera in front of an audience. She was in junior high school when, at a teacher's urging, she performed the aria “My Heart at Thy Sweet Voice" from Saint-Saëns's “Samson and Delilah." She had been singing it in English at church functions and supermarket openings, but for the school performance her teacher had her learn it in its original French.
“I do think that if you can stand up and sing in French in front of an assembly full of middle-schoolers," Ms. Norman wrote, “then you can do just about anything."

Texto completo: President Trump congratulated China on the 70th anniversary of communist rule there in a tweet that belies America's foreign policy position and ignores decades of human rights abuses.
"Congratulations to President Xi and the Chinese people on the 70th Anniversary of the People's Republic of China!" Trump tweeted on Tuesday.
Shortly thereafter, House Republican Conference chairwoman Liz Cheney of Wyoming released a statement contradicting the president and pointing to Beijing's oppressive governing tactics.
"This is not a day for celebration," Cheney said in a joint statement with Representative Mike Gallagher, Republican of Wisconsin. The United States will use the occasion to "rededicate ourselves to ensuring that the Chinese Communist Party is left on the ash heap of history," they added.
Trump's cheerful commemoration of China came as prodemocracy protests in Hong Kong against Chinese rule turned violent and one teenage protester was shot by police.
Republican Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska also released a statement that deeply contrasted with the Republican president.
"Today Chinese tyrants celebrated 70 years of communist oppression with their typically brutal symbolism: by sending a police officer to shoot a prodemocracy protester at point-blank range," Sasse said. "The freedom-seekers in Hong Kong mourn this anniversary, and the American people stand with them against those who deny their God-given dignity."
And Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas said, "From the Great Leap Forward to the Cultural Revolution to the camps in Xinjiang today, it has been a ghoulish 70 years of Chinese Communist Party control."
Even congressional allies of Trump, like Republican Representative Chip Roy of Texas, took issue with Trump's tweet. "I will pass," Roy tweeted about offering his congratulations.

Bernie Sanders raises $25.3 million in third-quarter haul
Senator Bernie Sanders raised $25.3 million in the past three months, his campaign said Tuesday, a total that continues to demonstrate his strength with small donors as he fights to maintain support in key early-voting states.
The financial haul, among the first that a candidate has announced for the third quarter, will place Sanders in the top of the field for fund-raising.
It is also a much-needed boost for his campaign, as it looks to move past a summer slump that coincided with staff shakeups in New Hampshire and Iowa and a slip in some polls in early-voting states.
Sanders announced his total for the quarter just minutes after Mayor Peter Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., said he had raised $19.1 million in the same period. Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey raised more than $6 million in the past three months, his campaign said on Tuesday, his best fund-raising quarter yet.
Meanwhile, President Trump's reelection campaign and the Republican National Committee raised a combined $125 million in the last three months, Republican Party officials said, setting a presidential fund-raising record.
Trump's fund-raising effort included e-mails, tweets, and text messages urging supporters to donate to help after House Democrats announced an impeachment inquiry into the president's dealings with Ukraine. New York Times

Texto completo: Sturgill Simpson was characteristically plainspoken Sunday night when he told his audience at the Troubadour why it had been nearly a year since he'd played his last full concert: He and his wife recently welcomed the third of three young sons, explained this disruptive roots-music star, which inspired him to quit the road to stay home and "chop firewood" in southeast Tennessee.
"I figured they should know what the ... their dad looks like," he said.
The rationale suited a songwriter whose 2016 album, "A Sailor's Guide to Earth," pondered the joy and the pain of fatherhood on its way to winning a Grammy Award for country album. What the explanation left out, though, was that Simpson, 41, also seemed to need an escape from his own success -- from its encouragement of a simplistic view of his music and from the expectations it created for whatever he chose to do next.

But maybe he didn't mention that because he knew his songs would make his feelings clear.
Simpson's new album, "Sound & Fury," which came out Friday, is a bracing indictment of the phoniness and stupidity he evidently encountered in the wake of the Grammys, where he began his acceptance speech by noting that just a few years earlier he'd been working on a railroad in Utah. Over thick, churning Southern rock far noisier than the homey country sounds on his previous records -- think ZZ Top in the mid-'80s rather than Waylon Jennings in the mid-'70s -- Simpson sneers in his strangled drawl at the "journalists and sycophants" who invade his tour bus and describes the pleasure he takes from "saying no to all the yes-men just to see the look on their face." (The latter lyric comes from a tune called "Make Art Not Friends.")
Ironically, the result is a proudly rebellious record about refusing the record industry's attempts to make Simpson the new face of so-called outlaw country.
"If you're wearing a cowboy hat and you heard the record and you came anyway, thank you very much," the singer said at the Troubadour, where he and his durable live band -- bassist Chuck Bartels, drummer Miles Miller and keyboardist Bobby Emmett -- played "Sound & Fury" from front to back. The show was the first date in a brief U.S. tour benefiting the Special Forces Foundation, which provides assistance to veterans of the armed services and their families. (Before the railroad in Utah, Simpson served in the Navy.)
It was also part of a fairly elaborate rollout for the new album, which comes accompanied by a Netflix film that sets Simpson's songs to anime sequences overseen by some of Japan's most respected directors. Since he finished recording "Sound & Fury," the singer has gotten deeper into movies, acting in Jim Jarmusch's recent "The Dead Don't Die" and in the upcoming "Queen & Slim" opposite Daniel Kaluuya.
You can look at these pursuits as the spoils of the very showbiz glad-handing that Simpson rails against in "Mercury in Retrograde," which rhymes "traveling trophies and awards-show stands" with "all the haters wishing they was in my band."
But consider the roles Simpson has been attracted to -- a zombie in Jarmusch's movie and a hotheaded white police officer who pulls over a black couple in "Queen & Slim" -- or the various struggles against authority depicted in the Netflix film, which he told the New York Times is about "hegemonic structures, politics, corruption, greed." Clearly this isn't a guy merely searching for glory onscreen than he can't get onstage.
On Sunday he seemed to acknowledge that "Sound & Fury," with its cranked tempos and harsh electronic textures, might not be what some fans want from him. After telling the crowd he planned to play a handful of older tunes to finish the night, he offered this warning: "Don't be surprised if the old" stuff "sounds like the new" stuff.
The way he sees it, an artist's responsibility is to reflect the world he or she lives in -- and right now, he added with an unprintable flourish, the world is messed up.
That meant extra jolts of guitar fuzz for the once-gentle "Turtles All the Way Down" and "Welcome to Earth (Pollywog)" and an anxious-funky reggae groove for "Breakers Roar," perhaps the loveliest cut on "Sailor's Guide." And for the songs from "Sound & Fury," he and his band further bulked up riffs and beats that are plenty muscular on the record. His goal, he said, was music that "sounds like the noise in my head when I watch the news."
Yet even in his rage he was unpredictable. At one point in the show Simpson lowered the volume to sing a pair of vintage ballads -- "I'd Have to Be Crazy," popularized by Willie Nelson, and William Bell's "You Don't Miss Your Water" -- that he's been doing for years, since long before the yes-men began haunting him.
Both were completely gorgeous; both made happiness sound like a rare but attainable resource. Perhaps Simpson was thinking of getting back home again.

Texto completo: There's an approach that avoids both a "civil war" and Trump's guaranteed re-election.
I'm going to discuss impeachment today, but first I want to talk about the National Symphony Orchestra's opening concert and gala last Saturday night. It was very revealing.
At mid-concert, the chairman of the Kennedy Center, David M. Rubinstein, came out to greet the audience and the V.I.P.s. He welcomed the different ambassadors, then he went through the cabinet members present and then the Supreme Court justices. He introduced Justice Samuel Alito, who got a smattering of applause. Then he introduced Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, seated in the balcony. First many women in the audience stood up to applaud. And then everyone stood up. And then everyone applauded. And then everyone applauded more. And then some people cheered. And then some whistled. And it went on and on and on.
It was extraordinary. I've been to a lot of Kennedy Center concerts, and a few when the president, sitting in his official box, was introduced. But I've never witnessed anything like the reception for Justice Ginsburg. And this was not a totally liberal audience. There were many older G.O.P. donors and corporate types there. This was a spontaneous, bipartisan expression of respect for, and longing for, a national leader of integrity and humility -- after three years of a president utterly without shame, for whom no ethical red line has been too red to cross.
There is still a civic pulse in this country. Some Americans still support President Trump, but far, far more are exhausted and disgusted by him. And that is why his latest outrage is so dangerous to him. He knows that we know that many Republicans know that he committed an impeachable offense. And it's all out there now: a whistle-blower complaint filed by a C.I.A. officer detailing how Trump dangled military assistance in front of the president of Ukraine if he would do Trump a "favor" and investigate bogus corruption charges against Joe Biden.
I believe that this not only could warrant Trump's impeachment but that it could be done without plunging the country into "civil war" or guaranteeing Trump's re-election -- provided Democrats keep stressing four things.
First, this charge against Trump began with an independent whistle-blower -- an intelligence officer, aided by other insiders. Sure, it could turn out that he was a Hillary Clinton fan, which Trump would use to rile up his base, claiming that Democrats were trying to steal his election mandate. But if this turns out to be what it appears -- a nonpolitical C.I.A. analyst and other civil servants motivated by their oath to uphold the Constitution in the face of a president who was violating his oath -- then Trump and the Republicans will have a problem.
Democrats in Congress need to make sure they say and do nothing that gets in the middle of this framing of the story, which, for now, appears to be accurate: nonpolitical civil servants inside the government acting on conscience against a law-breaking president acting on political greed and excess.
That so many G.O.P. senators have kept quiet up to now -- save for uber-sycophants like Lindsey Graham -- suggests that they fear that this framing is accurate and it stinks to them.
Second, there almost surely will be another nonpolitical, high-integrity civil servant who will testify about Trump and his lawyer Rudy Giuliani. That's Masha Yovanovitch, the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, who was abruptly yanked home in May, months before her assignment was up. My State Department friends who know Yovanovitch say she was a widely respected, professional diplomat. She was apparently removed because she was somehow resisting Giuliani's efforts to enlist the Ukraine government in Trump's sordid effort to take down Biden.
Again, how eager will Republicans be to defend Giuliani and Trump by trashing a U.S. ambassador -- with a stellar record -- who was trying to prevent foreign interference in our elections?
Unlike Robert Mueller, who never spoke until it was too late and had his work "interpreted" by Trump's attorney general, Bill Barr, the whistle-blower and his allies and the former ambassador are -- and will be -- speaking for themselves.
Third, unlike the Mueller investigation, this case is very easy for people to understand: Trump called the new Ukrainian president, who was desperate for U.S. military aid to use against Russian aggression, and made him an offer he couldn't refuse: guns for Biden.
Finally, I have no doubt that Trump's base will stick by him. But they are not the important constituency today, because Trump needs more than his base to get re-elected. He needs the moderate Republicans, independents and suburban women who came his way in 2016 -- but then abandoned him in 2018, enabling the Democrats to retake the House. What will they do in 2020?
I believe that more than a few will be thinking about a question that will hang over all the impeachment testimony about Trump's actions in Ukraine: If this is how he behaved while constrained by re-election concerns, how will Trump behave if he gets re-elected -- despite this wretched behavior -- and no longer needs to worry about re-election? America will become a banana republic.
It's for all these reasons that Democrats have to be so disciplined in how they prosecute this case. They need to have a single spokesman, Representative Adam Schiff, and everyone else needs to keep quiet. They need to have professional prosecutors, not uninformed legislators, question witnesses; they need to keep the focus on the nonpolitical witnesses; and they need to have their presidential candidates stay out of this impeachment story and concentrate on their ideas for reviving and reuniting America.
Impeaching Trump right now on the eve of the next presidential election is very inconvenient. But doing the right thing is often inconvenient and unpopular -- and doing it precisely when it's inconvenient often indicates that it's the right thing to do. But you have to do the right thing for the right reasons the right way.
Democrats should pursue impeachment in the House as if there were no election in 2020. And they should pursue the 2020 election as if there were no impeachment.
And they should do it by letting the nonpolitical whistle-blower and the other civil servants take the lead. These humble patriots started this, and it will go only as far as their credibility sustains it. And it's their credibility that will influence the swing voters that brought Democrats the House in 2018 -- those independents, moderate Republicans and suburban women -- a few of whom, I suspect, were at the Kennedy Center last Saturday night, giving a standing ovation to Justice Ginsburg.

Texto completo: International opera star Jessye Norman, a four-time Grammy-winner and National Medal of Arts recipient, died Monday, according to a family spokesman. She was 74.
Norman (photo inset) died at St. Luke's Hospital from septic shock and multiorgan failure secondary to complications of a spinal cord injury she had suffered in 2015, The Associated Press reported.
"We are so proud of Jessye's musical achievements and the inspiration that she provided to audiences around the world that will continue to be a source of joy. We are equally proud of her humanitarian endeavors addressing matters such as hunger, homelessness, youth development, and arts and culture education," a family statement read.
A dramatic soprano, Norman was notable for following her own muse and pursuing opera roles that interested her regardless of whether they matched her singing style.
"As for my voice, it cannot be categorized - and I like it that way, because I sing things that would be considered in the dramatic, mezzo or spinto range," she told The New York Times in 1983.
"I like so many different kinds of music that I've never allowed myself the limitations of one particular range."
"The rest is honesty - honesty of feeling, honesty of involvement. If a performer is truly committed, then the audience will be the first to know and will respond accordingly."

Moroccan journalist jailed in abortion case

Texto completo: RABAT, Morocco - A Moroccan judge Monday found a journalist and her fiance guilty of having premarital sex and obtaining an abortion, and imposed prison sentences on them and a doctor convicted of performing the abortion, in a case that critics have denounced as a thinly veiled bid to suppress critical coverage of the government.
The journalist, Hajar Raissouni, 28, who works for the independent daily newspaper Akhbar Al Yaoum, and her fiance, Rifaat al-Amin, were arrested Aug. 31 as they were leaving a gynecologist's office in the Moroccan capital, Rabat.
The defendants denied that an abortion had taken place and said that Raissouni had sought treatment after suffering a blood clot.
"This judgment comes as a shock," said Cherki Lahrech, a journalist who was present for the verdict. "The defense proved her innocence. I don't understand what happened. It all poses many questions."
The judge sentenced Raissouni and al-Amin to one year in prison, and Dr. Jamal Belkeziz to two years. A second doctor and an office assistant were also found guilty of taking part in the procedure, but the judge gave them suspended sentences.
Raissouni, wearing a black traditional robe known as a djellaba and a head scarf, showed no outward reaction to the verdict, which drew cries and gasps from others in the courtroom.
Several of her friends huddled nearby afterward, crying and consoling each other, then waved goodbye as she was put into a police vehicle and driven away from the courthouse.
The trial was perhaps the most prominent example yet in a pattern of arrests and prosecutions of journalists who are critical of the state, on charges seemingly unrelated to their reporting.
Last year, Taoufik Bouachrine, the founder and publisher of Akhbar Al Yaoum, was sentenced to 12 years in prison on sexual assault charges, in a prosecution that the U.N. Working Group on Arbitrary Detention concluded was unfair.
Akhbar Al Yaoum is one of the few independent news outlets in Morocco. Raissouni has written about human rights and politics, and she has covered demonstrations in the Rifregion in the north of the country that resulted in hundreds of arrests.
Her case has sparked protests and a torrent of commentary and criticism online - a rare outburst of public dissent in Morocco, an Arab kingdom on the northwestern coast of Africa. Many called for greater press freedom and for an overhaul of the country's conservative penal code.
A few days ago, thousands of Moroccans signed a manifesto demanding the legalization of abortion and sex outside of marriage, just as parliament is set to consider amendments to allow abortion in cases of rape and incest. Currently, the procedure is legal only if a woman's life is at risk.
A change in the rules governing the news media in 2016 abolished prison sentences for journalists based on their work, but critics say the government has continued its campaign against independent reporting through other charges.

Texto completo: Sen. Lindsey Graham says an effort is underway to "shut down" Attorney General William Barr's inquiry into the origins of the Russia investigation.
A report about President Trump urging the Australian prime minister to help Barr "discredit" special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation is just the beginning, the South Carolina Republican said Monday.
"Here's what bothers me tonight. This New York Times article about Barr talking to Australia is the beginning of an effort to shut down Barr's investigation to find out how this whole thing started," Graham told Fox News host Sean Hannity.
Republicans have alleged that foreign intelligence agencies, such as those in Western Europe, may have played a role in eavesdropping on or otherwise monitoring Trump campaign associates in 2016.
"Barr should be talking to Australia. He should be talking to Italy. He should be talking to the U.K. to find out if their intelligence services worked with our intelligence services improperly to open up a counterintelligence investigation of Trump's campaign. If he's not doing that, he's not doing his job," Graham said.
Graham, who is the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said he plans to write a letter to all three countries to encourage them to cooperate with Barr.

Barr began his inquiry into the FBI's and DOJ's behavior during the 2016 election earlier this year around the same time Mueller completed his investigation. The attorney general has tasked U.S. Attorney John Durham with leading the effort, and Trump granted Barr "full and complete authority" to declassify information related to the review.
News of Trump's phone call to Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison comes amid scrutiny over another phone call that Trump had on July 25 with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. That phone call ended up being a central tenet of an August whistleblower complaint which raised concerns about a possible effort to pressure Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, a political rival in the 2020 election contest, by leveraging millions of dollars of security aid. Although Trump claims there was no quid pro quo, his admission that he did discuss Biden with Zelensky prompted House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to announce an impeachment inquiry last week.
Graham compared Trump's call to Zelensky to a letter Democratic senators sent in 2018 to the top Ukrainian prosecutor urging him to cooperate with Mueller's investigation. He claimed they implied that U.S. assistance to Ukraine was at risk, although multiple fact-checkers have determined this to be untrue.
"Democrats wanted the Ukraine to work with Mueller, and if they didn't, they would cut off their aid. It's clear to me that liberals are starting an attack against Barr to shut him down from going to Italy, Australia, and the U.K. to find out if there was something wrong regarding opening up the investigation into the Trump campaign to begin with," Graham said. "If that's not a double standard, I don't know what would be."
Graham also openly wondered whether the intelligence official who filed the whistleblower complaint and his or her sources may be a focus of Barr's work.
"What about whether or not the whistleblower or people around the whistleblower were tied to the folks that opened up the investigation against Trump to begin with? We'll see," he said.

Texto completo: Senate Finance Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley issued a statement defending the whistleblower who filed a complaint about President Trump's phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in July.
The conversation garnered national interest after it was revealed that Trump urged Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden, over the younger Biden's work in Ukraine. Following the release of the transcript, the president has maintained that nothing in the call is worthy of impeachment, which is now under consideration, and he has publicly attacked the whistleblower.
"We should always work to respect whistleblowers' requests for confidentiality. Any further media reports on the whistleblower's identity don't serve the public interest—even if the conflict sells more papers or attracts clicks," Grassley's Tuesday statement begins, which references a New York Times report that outed the whistleblower as a CIA officer.
The beginning of the statement also addresses the president's repeated demands for the whistleblower's identity to be made known. Trump tweeted Tuesday morning that the "so-called 'Whistleblower' has all second hand information" and that "almost everything he has said about my 'perfect' call with the Ukrainian President is wrong." Trump went on to question why the public isn't "entitled" to interview the whistleblower.
Tweet
Grassley continued, “When it comes to whether someone qualifies as a whistleblower, the distinctions being drawn between first- and second-hand knowledge aren’t legal ones. It’s just not part of whistleblower protection law or any agency policy. Complaints based on second-hand information should not be rejected out of hand, but they do require additional leg work to get at the facts and evaluate the claim’s credibility."
As he referenced, the whistleblower did not have direct knowledge of the details of the call.
Grassley also reiterated his stance that "rampant speculation" by the media or members of Congress is inappropriate.

'Where's My Roy Cohn?' documentary turns the famous Trump mentor and political insider inside out

Texto completo: As a filmmaker, Matt Tyrnauer gets around. His documentary subjects include a fashion designer (“Valentino: The Last Emperor," 2008), urban activist (“Citizen Jane: Battle for the City," 2016), high-end male hustler (“Scotty and the Secret Life of Hollywood," 2017) , and higher-end disco (“Studio 54," 2018). His latest, “Where's My Roy Cohn?," further shuffles the documentary deck — adding a joker who was definitely wild.
There's never been anyone quite like Roy Cohn (1927-86), and thank goodness for that. The work of literature he's associated with is Tony Kushner's“Angels in America," in which he figures as a particularly repellent character. “The Lord of the Rings" may be more pertinent. Cohn was a legal-eagle version of Gollum: endlessly compelling in his no-less endless awfulness. True, a ring of power didn't obsess Cohn. Why bother with jewelry when there was the thing itself: impure and unsimple. That obsession led to his connecting one of the more bizarre collections of dots in 20th-century US history: the Rosenbergs, Joe McCarthy, the Mafia, Ronald Reagan, Barbara Walters, the archdiocese of New York, and (inevitably) young Donald Trump.
Louche and lizardy, Cohn was one of those post-imperial only-in-New-York characters. Planted at the intersection of influence and celebrity, he'd be at Studio 54 one night and in court the next morning (either as litigant or defendant). Cohn was also gay, not so much closeted as hiding in plain, catch-me-if-you-can sight. His default mode was defiance: of convention, of law, of truth. He looked like Caligula (those hooded eyes!) and acted like a brat. Put another way, he was tabloid catnip. All of which makes Tyrnauer's documentary very lively.
The only child of an heiress and judge, Cohn was an outer-borough princeling, that borough being the Bronx. No one ever doubted his brains. At 20, he graduated from Columbia Law School. At 24, he was a prosecutor in the espionage trial of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg. This quickly led to his becoming McCarthy's chief aide, which in turn led to the Army-McCarthy hearings, which in turn — there were a lot of turns to Cohn's career — made him internationally famous, or infamous.
Returning to New York, Cohn entered private practice and reveled in his sordid reputation. It was good for business, after all, though his eventual disbarment wasn't. As one of the documentary's talking heads puts it, “He's the only person I've met who actually enjoyed being indicted."
Tyrnauer and his researchers have done a terrific job of gathering archival photographs and footage. A joint talk-show appearance by Cohn and Gore Vidal is part hallucination, part cage match. The roster of interviewees is extensive and varied. There are former associates (including an admiring Roger Stone), Brandeis historian Thomas Doherty, Cohn cousins (who have some of the most damning things to say), and such journalists as author Ken Auletta, Vanity Fair's Marie Brenner, and The New York Times's Sam Roberts.
Interspersed throughout the film are snippets from an interview Auletta did with Cohn toward the end of his life. It's fascinating to hear Cohn speak in an unbuttoned fashion. Yet whenever there's a clip Tyrnauer cuts to tape reels turning on a large recorder. It's emblematic of how heavy-handed, even overblown, the filmmaking can get. Intercut with a discussion of Cohn's homosexuality, for example, is footage from soft-core gay porn. The treatment generally of Cohn's sexuality falls somewhere between the salacious and prurient. That contributes to the general liveliness, but not in a good way. The same is true of the overbearing score.
The biggest problem with “Where's My Roy Cohn?" is the documentary's attitude toward its subject: not that it's critical (an uncritical approach to Cohn would be about as interesting as a daytime visit to Studio 54), but that it so thoroughly accepts his view of himself. Cohn wasn't so much an ideologue or power broker (especially not that) as he was a brand specialist, and the brand he specialized in was Roy Cohn. He marketed an image of himself as ultimate insider and attack-dog attorney (accurate enough, except that canine ferocity works far better in kennels than courtrooms). The truth-in-advertising description of what Cohn sold was something quite different: smoke and mirrors. “He never gave up on his own myth," the late gossip columnist Liz Smith says in the documentary. No one promoted that myth as effectively as he did. Until now, maybe: “Where's My Roy Cohn?" repurposes his self-mythologizing for its own, only in reverse. The problem is that dark smoke and cracked mirrors are still smoke, still mirrors.

'Parents that can't let go': When Mom comes to your job interview

Texto completo: In 2001, a graphic designer in New Jersey refused to sign a non-compete agreement required by her employer.
The woman's father, an attorney, had advised her not to sign, and the decision cost her the job. Years of litigation followed, with the state Supreme Court ultimately ruling that the company had justly fired her.
The incident is a worst-case scenario of what can happen when parents meddle in their adult children's careers, said John Sarno, president of the nonprofit Employers Association of New Jersey.
Almost 20 years later, parents are asserting themselves to an even greater degree by sitting in on job interviews, filling in job applications, badgering employers to give their children raises and promotions and — in at least one case — bringing a cake to a child's potential employer, according to a survey by a subsidiary of Robert Half, a global human resource consulting firm.
"Sadly, it's not a new phenomenon," said Dora Onyschak, the New Jersey metro market manager for Robert Half. "Bulldozer parents and helicopter parents are kind of similar in that really they just want what's best for their kid, so they want to try and help them to be as successful as possible. But that can sometimes blind them to the fact that maybe they're being too involved or their involvement can be inappropriate or certainly unprofessional when looking for a job."
"Helicopter parenting" became part of the American lexicon in the early 2000s to describe the practice of hovering over children and monitoring their every move. The behavior has since evolved into that of bulldozer, snowplow or lawnmower parenting — when parents remove obstacles in their children's lives so they never have to face adversity or failure.
Sarno prefers to call them "advocate parents" and traces their rise to increased diagnoses among children of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, as well as intensified competition to gain admittance to good colleges. Both converge to create anxiety-riddled parents who feel obligated to overly protect their children, he said.
"It's really about a parent who has had this identity, this role as the advocate through the public school, often through college, and they can't give up the role when the young adult starts their career," Sarno said. "I really think it's about parents that can't let go."
Part of that reluctance stems from the 2008 financial crisis and changing social attitudes that have delayed typical markers of adulthood, such as marriage and homeownership, said Jacob Goldsmith, director of the emerging adulthood program at Northwestern University's Family Institute. Studies show that unlike more prosperous previous generations, half of children born since 1980 will not out-earn their parents.
"It really scares parents," Goldsmith said. "I think there are a lot of parents looking around and realizing that their kids are not going to make the same money that they did, that their kids are not reaching the milestones they did at the same time, and they don't know what to make of that and they really want to be helpful, so they jump in."
Fourteen percent of U.S. adults surveyed this year by Morning Consult for The New York Times said they had pulled strings in their professional networks to secure a job for their 18- to 28-year-old child. About 11% of respondents said they would contact their adult child's employer if the child had an issue at work. Another 16% said they had written all or part of a job or internship application.
Both Goldsmith and Sarno said parental interference in work matters is rare and not unique to millennials, who have been unfairly maligned by some as lazy or entitled.
Most of the parents with whom Goldsmith works as a therapist exert more subtle control. They will not sit in on job interviews, but they will edit job applications for their children or perform other tasks on their behalf, he said. Instead of teaching, they take action.
"Part of why we as therapists get worried about bulldozer parents is we worry that these kids don't learn the skills they need to do this stuff themselves," Goldsmith said. "I see a lot of emerging adults who struggle to know how to have difficult emotional conversations with their bosses. That's hard; there's no class for that. We often learn that by talking to our parents. But if the parents step in and do it for you, you never learn it."
Children of bulldozer parents often resemble children who have been neglected, he said. Both hit adulthood without a tool kit for dealing with adversity and feel as if they have not accomplished anything on their own.
"What I see, and this is a direct result of helicopter parenting, is kids who hit 25 and they've never hit a major roadblock in their life and they are terrified of failure, paralyzed because they feel like life is only successful if you make no mistakes," Goldsmith said. "Kids that were helicopter-parented in many ways look like the kids who never had opportunities ... because they're never really doing it themselves."
Most hiring managers are put off by candidates with meddling parents, Onyschak said.
"As an employer, do I then become concerned about the candidate's ability to think independently? Do I worry then that they perhaps are not good decision makers?" she said. "It questions their level of independence and maturity, and you don't want that to be the reason the person does or does not get the job."
Still, employers like Google, Amazon and LinkedIn have embraced the close relationship between new hires and their parents, launching "Take Your Parents to Work" days to give parents a glimpse of their children's work lives.
Onyschak said she supports parents who provide more hands-off guidance: helping their children practice job interviews, helping them weigh the pros and cons of multiple job offers, looking over cover letters and résumés. But the oversight should stop there, she said.
"We're not hiring the parent, we're hiring the individual, so we want candidates who can think for themselves, who are assertive, who can ask their own questions," Onyschak said.
For parents feeling the urge to become more heavily involved, Goldsmith recommends taking a step back and asking themselves if they are facilitating — or enabling.
"When you've got a parent who's really tuned in and providing good support and facilitating growth, that kid's going to fly to the moon," he said. "But when you have a parent who responds to anxiety by stepping in and trying to run the kid's life — even if it's not as egregious as showing up at a job interview — you still end up with a kid who doesn't really trust the tools they have to be in the world."

Texto completo: AP National Writer
DOHA, Qatar — Alysia Montano walked off the track with a pair of bronze medals that were placed around her neck several years too late.
Were those tears of joy still drying on her face? Sadness? Frustration? Yes, all of that.
“I mean, I got two medals in the span of 3 minutes,” Montano said Monday evening, after ceremonies held in front of a few hundred fans before action began at the sparsely attended world championships in Qatar. “There’s a lot of emptiness and void in that space. I feel relief that the dopers have been eliminated. I don’t know what else to say.”
The U.S. 800-meter runner who has stood up on behalf of every athlete cheated out of medal by a doper finally got the third-place prizes she was robbed of at two straight worlds, back in 2011 and 2013.
She came to Qatar for the “reallocation” ceremony in part to set an example for her young kids, “to show them strength and perseverance and resilience” any way I could, she said.
She came to right a wrong — a chance she knows full well that hundreds of other cheated athletes will never get to enjoy.
But to say she came to close this chapter — the chapter about the way cheating pervades worldwide sports and corrupts from the bottom to the top — well, that’s far from the truth.
“If you want to know the truth, I think the IAAF is just as corrupt as they’ve always been,” Montano said of track’s governing body. “They just get to throw things under a rug. And there are many other athletes who, unfortunately, aren’t going to get this victory. The IAAF is making it look pretty.”
Her summation of track and field, even after a series of reforms designed to rid this sport of cheaters and the leaders who enabled them: “Real athletes, fake events.”
One of her issues is that the powers that be still bring home the lion’s share of the money from events like these — French investigators are looking into possible corruption in the process the IAAF used to bring these games to the non-track-loving country of Qatar — while athletes fight for scraps. There is no better way to illustrate that than the fact that Montano had to reach into her own pocket to pay for her husband, two kids and her parents to make the trip to receive this honor.
“They were going to pay for one to two nights here, for me to fly all the way to Doha and come celebrate all by myself,” said Montano, who is pregnant with her third child. “What kind of invitation was that, to come and celebrate by myself?”
Montano said USA Track and Field came up with $3,000 to help cover some of the expenses and she’s planning on fighting to get the rest from the IAAF. Her losses, though, are far more than that. She was denied prize money for winning the bronze medals, plus any endorsement deals that might have come from them. She was denied the celebration at the end of the race, and instead was faced with the heartbreak of finishing fourth both times.
“They say four is the loneliest number in track and field,” Montano said. “But I made them fight for stealing from me.”
It’s a fight that never seems to end.
It was Montano who, earlier this year, started the movement on behalf of female track and field athletes by posting an op-ed video in the New York Times that outlined Nike’s longstanding policies of discontinuing payments to athletes it sponsors who become pregnant. Nike ended up changing that policy, and it wasn’t lost on Montano that new moms Allyson Felix and Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce were the gold-medal headliners Sunday night.
Monday, before the action got going, was Montano’s moment — her first chance to step on the podium at a world championships.
She received medals that had previously gone to others because she was beaten by Russian Mariya Savinova, who was later found to have been using performance enhancers. Montano pretty much knew it at the time, but it took a whistleblower, former Russian runner Yulia Stepanova, combined with years of investigations into Russian doping, for this day to come.
Was it everything she and her husband had imagined it would be?
“I was a little bummed,” Louis Montano said. “The moment for us was kind of robbed. I remember being there in 2011 in Daegu and the place was packed, and the people were crazy and South Korea was an amazing place.”
Montano remembers not being able to hear himself think at that one. At this one, he could hear the fizzle from the small set of fireworks that were set off during the ceremony.
But despite the awkwardness, the cost and the mixed-feelings, Alysia is glad she came here. She no longer feels like her career was a “farce” — the word she used in 2016 after getting tripped up in the home stretch at Olympic trials and having her dreams of competing in an allegedly clean(er) games come to an end.
“I’m happy with my path and everything it brought me, even with the disappointments,” Alysia Montano said. “I was going to be the one who was going to fight for us. I’m super grateful, because I know that now I’m making an impact.”

Texto completo: A multiple Grammy Award winner, she was a towering figure on operatic, concert and recital stages.
Jessye Norman, the majestic American soprano who brought a sumptuous, shimmering voice to a broad range of roles at the Metropolitan Opera and houses around the world, died on Monday in New York. She was 74.
The cause was septic shock and multiple organ failure following complications of a spinal cord injury she suffered in 2015, according to a statement by her family.
Ms. Norman, who also found acclaim as a recitalist and on the concert stage, was one of the most decorated of American singers. She won five Grammy Awards, four for her recordings and one for lifetime achievement. She received the prestigious Kennedy Center Honor in 1997 and the National Medal of Arts in 2009.
In a career that began in the late 1960s, Ms. Norman sang the title role in Verdi's "Aida," Wagner's heroines, characters in Janacek, Poulenc, Bartok and Strauss operas, and Cassandre in "Les Troyens" by Berlioz, in which she made her Met debut in 1983. She went on to sing more than 80 performances at the Met. Its general manager, Peter Gelb, on Monday called her "one of the greatest artists to ever sing on our stage."
A keen interpreter as well as a magnificent singer, Ms. Norman had a distinctly opulent tone that sounded effortless, never pushed. It was especially suited to Wagner and Strauss.
In a review of a 1992 recital, Edward Rothstein of The New York Times likened her voice to a "grand mansion of sound."
"It defines an extraordinary space," he wrote. "It has enormous dimensions, reaching backward and upward. It opens onto unexpected vistas. It contains sunlit rooms, narrow passageways, cavernous halls. Ms. Norman is the regal mistress of this domain, with a physical presence suited to her vocal expanse."
As an African-American, she credited other great black singers with paving the way for her, naming Marian Anderson, Dorothy Maynor and Leontyne Price, among others, in a 1983 interview with The Times.
"They have made it possible for me to say, 'I will sing French opera,"' she said "or, 'I will sing German opera,' instead of being told, 'You will sing "Porgy and Bess." ' Look, it's unrealistic to pretend that racial prejudice doesn't exist. It does! It's one thing to have a set of laws, and quite another to change the hearts and minds of men. That takes longer. I do not consider my blackness a problem. I think it looks rather nice."
A new production of "Porgy and Bess" is now playing at the Met; the house said it was dedicating Monday night's performance to Ms. Norman.
In her memoir, "Stand Up Straight and Sing!" (2014), she recounted meeting instances of racism. "Racial barriers in our world are not gone, so why can we imagine that racial barriers in classical music and the opera world are gone?" she told The Times in 2014.
Ms. Norman was born into a musical family on Sept. 15, 1945, in Augusta, Ga., growing up there in a segregated but close-knit world. Her mother, Janie King Norman, was an amateur pianist; her father, Silas Norman Sr., was an insurance broker. Jessye especially enjoyed visiting her maternal grandparents, fascinated by one particular piece of furniture.
"My grandparents were the only people I ever knew who had one -- a grand pedal organ, or more accurately, a harmonium -- right there in their house," she wrote in her memoir. "It lived over in the corner of the front room, and I remember thinking that it was the most exotic thing I had ever encountered in my entire life. As far as I can recall, we were never stopped from playing it, nor admonished for disturbing the adults."
She began listening to opera on the radio as a child.
"I remember thinking that opera stories were not very different from other stories: a boy meets a girl, they fall in love, they cannot be together for some reason, and most of the time it does not end happily ever after," she wrote. "For me, opera stories were grown-up versions of stories that were familiar to me already."
She earned a bachelor's degree in music from Howard University and studied at the University of Michigan and Peabody Institute. Her career received its first big boost when she won a first-place prize at the Munich International Music Competition in 1968. The next year, she made her debut on an opera stage at the Deutsche Oper Berlin in Wagner's "Tannhäuser," as Elisabeth.
Appearances at the Teatro alla Scala in Milan, the Royal Opera House in London, and other major opera houses followed, and she quickly became one of the busiest opera divas on the scene, a fixture of galas and benefits. An accomplished recitalist, she made records of vocal works by Mahler, Debussy and Strauss.
She also ranged backward in time to the Baroque, displaying a remarkable command of a broad range of styles. She was famous for saying "pigeonholes are for pigeons."
It was not until 1983 that she made a belated Met debut, opening the company's centennial season singing the role of Cassandre in a starry revival of Berlioz's "Les Troyens." By all accounts she stole the show, winning over "Monday night's audience and Tuesday morning's critics," as The Times reported in its account of her "triumph."
She rose early the next day to appear on NBC's "Today" show. "The only person in my family who couldn't come on Monday was my mother, who is ill and at home in Georgia," she said at the time. "'I wanted to give her a look at me."
Her imposing stage presence and large, voluptuous voice made her ideal for certain parts. When she sang the title character of Richard Strauss's "Ariadne auf Naxos," one of her defining roles, John Rockwell described her in The Times as "one of our most musicianly singers" and added: "She has just the right voice for this role: a smoothly knit-together soprano that reaches up from plummy contralto notes to a powerful fullness on top."
In a sign of her international stature, Ms. Norman was tapped to sing "La Marseillaise" in Paris on the 200th anniversary of Bastille Day -- which she did, in dramatic fashion, at the obelisk on the Place de la Concorde before an array of world leaders, wearing a grand tricolor gown designed by Azzedine Alaïa. She also sang at the second inaugurations of Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton.
She became a major recording artist at the dawn of the compact disc era, leaving a rich catalog of opera, lieder, spirituals and recitals. One of her most acclaimed recordings was a classic account of Strauss's "Four Last Songs," backed by Kurt Masur and the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra. "Her generous heart, dignified manner and noble voice seem ideally suited to Strauss's valedictory utterances," Gramophone wrote in its review.
In person she cut an imposing figure, dressing dramatically and speaking with a diva's perfect diction. When she entered a room, heads turned. And even after she left the opera stage she remained a restless, probing artist -- collaborating with the dancer, choreographer and director Bill T. Jones in 1999 on a piece called "How! Do! We! Do!" and later singing anarchic music by John Cage.
More recently she was working on a project called "Sissieretta Jones: Call Her By Her Name!" that paid tribute to Jones, who in 1893 became the first African-American woman to headline a concert on the main stage of Carnegie Hall -- and who had bristled at her stage name, "the Black Patti," which compared her to the white diva Adelina Patti.
"Thirty years out of slavery for African-Americans in this country, here she was on the stage of Carnegie Hall," Ms. Norman said in an interview last year.
In her memoir, Ms. Norman recalled one of her own earliest stabs at singing opera in front of an audience. She was in junior high school when, at a teacher's urging, she performed the aria "My Heart at Thy Sweet Voice" from Saint-Saëns's "Samson and Delilah." She had been singing it in English at church functions and supermarket openings, but for the school performance her teacher had her learn it in its original French.
"I do think that if you can stand up and sing in French in front of an assembly full of middle-schoolers," Ms. Norman wrote, "then you can do just about anything."

Why Trump Tweeted About Civil War

Texto completo: What began as trollish shorthand for political polarization has gone mainstream.
As outlandish and extreme as it is, warning of a looming civil war is a familiar talking point across the pro-Trump media. It's part of a growing tradition of right-wing fearmongering -- what Vox's Dylan Matthews referred to last year as "apocalypse punditry" -- that moves easily from the online fever swamps to the Oval Office and back again.
So it wasn't surprising -- though it was deeply troubling -- to see President Trump tweet a warning from a pastor on Sunday night of "a Civil War like fracture in this Nation" should he be removed from office.
Invoking civil war -- even indirectly -- was once a third rail of modern American presidential rhetoric. Though Mr. Trump in the past has openly toyed with illiberal notions (ignoring term limits, not accepting election results should he lose), his casual suggestion that his ouster might lead to bloodshed felt like uncharted territory.
It doesn't matter that we're not on the brink of a civil war; the threat as outlined by right-wing media is intended to inspire fear in liberals and conservatives alike. For conservatives, it's the notion that Democrats will stop at nothing to get rid of Mr. Trump and will marshal the forces of the "deep state" to right the wrongs of the 2016 election. For liberals, it is a warning: Don't push churchgoing, gun-loving conservatives too far, or there'll be dangerous consequences.
The right's civil war fantasy has roots in a long-held fear that liberal policies will lead to tyranny. It's the logic behind AM radio rants about gun grabs, black helicopters and F.E.M.A. death camps.
Civil war rhetoric increased sharply during the Obama administration, led, in part, by anti-government radicals like Cliven Bundy. In 2014, the conservative radio host Michael Savage released a book, "How to Stop the Coming Civil War," which argued that "Obama's election to the presidency in 2008 might represent the final nail in the coffin of freedom."
But what began as trollish shorthand for increasing political polarization has gone mainstream, thanks to a cottage industry that makes money by deepening partisan divisions.
In the fall of 2017, alt-right YouTubers and websites began circulating a conspiracy theory that anti-fascist protesters were, as one site phrased it, "planning to kill every single Trump voter, conservative and gun owner" at various protests across the country. The baseless rumor was first promoted by obscure YouTube accounts that summer and then spread across Facebook groups with breathless posts and memes. It was amplified by conspiracy sites like Alex Jones's Infowars that September (Infowars has a rich history of predicting imminent civil wars).
By late October 2017, pro-Trump blogs joined in. The Gateway Pundit (a blog frequently linked to by the Drudge Report) posted a story with a headline suggesting "Millions of Antifa Supersoldiers Will Behead All White Parents." The piece was based on a satirical tweet from an account unaffiliated with the anti-fascist movement.
No war broke out. But the pro-Trump media continued to warn that it was around the corner. For the last two years, the right-wing pundit John Cardillo has fired off tweets referencing an impending "Civil War 2.0" supposedly declared by the left.
Rarely is the order of battle for a civil war actually spelled out. Where will the opposing armies gather to train -- Twitter? How will they pick opposing uniform colors (MAGA and knit pussyhats are terrible camouflage)? Which side gets the nuclear arsenal (I assume we will draw biodegradable paper straws)? Kurt Schlichter, a Town Hall writer and occasional Fox News guest, tackled the topic in a column titled, "Why Democrats Would Lose the Second Civil War, Too." The article reads like fan fiction, including instructions for how "hunters in Wisconsin" might take down military tanks: "They ambush the fuel and ammo trucks. Oh, and they wait until the gunner pops the hatch to take a leak and put a .30-06 round in his back from 300 meters. Then they disappear."
Mr. Schlichter has also argued we're already in a "cold civil war with America's alleged elite," but he is one of many on the right pushing the fantasy. The Gateway Pundit publishes articles with headlines like ""GET READY AND PRAY TO GOD -- The Time Is Now -- The Impostors Are Preparing the Final Act in Their Coup D'état." A Breitbart contributor argued in 2018 that "the 'Coming Civil War"' is "already here." That summer, Mr. Jones declared that Democrats planned to "launch civil war on July 4th." Days earlier, in a tweet, Representative Steve King of Iowa argued that the country was on the brink: "America is heading in the direction of another Harpers Ferry. After that comes Ft. Sumter."
While Mr. King's tweet was roundly condemned and Mr. Jones's warning was mocked with the viral hashtag #secondcivilwarletters, apocalypse punditry has crept into mainstream news with increasing frequency in 2019. Joseph diGenova, a frequent commentator on Fox News, argued in favor of buying guns in February, noting, "It's going to be total war." A day later, an MSNBC host expressed her fears of looming civil unrest.
Less than a month later, Mr. King again posted about civil war -- this time it was a Facebook meme warning that red states have "8 trillion bullets." By March, The Washington Post had enough fodder for a trend piece with the headline, "In America, Talk Turns to Something Not Spoken of for 150 Years: Civil War."

The threat of a civil war often comes up in discussions of an assault weapons ban. A proposed gun buyback program? "What you are calling for is civil war," Tucker Carlson said on Fox News. The conservative writer Erick Erickson tweeted, "It is not a stretch to say there'd be violence if the gov't tried to confiscate" AR-15s. Meghan McCain warned on ABC's "The View," "If you're talking about taking people's guns from them, there's going to be a lot of violence."
The threat of civil war is so divisive that it was also used by Russian trolls during 2016, according to a federal criminal complaint against a Kremlin operative made public during the Mueller investigation.
Given the long history of the civil war-mongering, it's unsurprising that the rhetoric made its way to the president's Twitter account.
That's because the Trump-media conspiracy flow chart is circular. Outlandish theories burble up from the depths and are laundered up through increasingly mainstream channels until they reach the president. Once amplified by Mr. Trump, the idea is lent more credence and is cited more frequently in right-wing media, which ultimately leads Mr. Trump to amplify it more aggressively.
We're no closer to a (frankly ridiculous) civil war than we were two days or two weeks or two years ago. But it feels to some like we could be, and that matters. The cycle feeds itself. Fear wins. We all lose.
