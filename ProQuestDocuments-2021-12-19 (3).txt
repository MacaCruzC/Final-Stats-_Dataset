Suspect in real estate scheme arraigned in federal court
A Connecticut man accused of a scheme that led an elderly Kennebunk man to invest in an alleged real estate venture was arraigned in federal court Thursday.
Peter DiRosa of Manchester, Conn., has been charged with one count of wire fraud. He pleaded not guilty to the charge in U.S. District Court.
DiRosa is accused of persuading the victim to invest $600,000 in retirement funds into an alleged Hungarian resort called the Castle at Polgardi. The man was told in May 2008 his money would be returned after six months, along with interest and $400,000 in profit, but he only received $60,000, according to the indictment.
DiRosa wired $600,000 from a Kennebunk bank account to an account in Hungary, according to the document. The indictment also alleges that DiRosa misappropriated project funds.
DiRosa and another man, Thomas Renison of Glastonbury, Conn., had been arrested earlier this year on charges of conspiracy to commit wire fraud. The case against Renison has since been dismissed.
Martin's Point Health Care holds event to celebrate designation
Martin's Point Health Care, the Portland-based health care network, held an event on the city's waterfront Thursday to celebrate its 5-star ratings on two Generations Advantage Medicare Advantage plans.
The rating from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services means the plans offer the highest level of value and quality of care. Martin's Point is the only Medicare Advantage plan in Maine to receive the 5-star designation and one of only nine organizations nationwide.
About 130 community partners, doctors and providers, employees and others attended the celebration at the Ocean Gateway terminal. Martin's Point is a nonprofit that provides primary care services, health plans, and wellness services in northern New England.
Downeaster will be pilot program for new Amtrak ticketing system
The Downeaster will serve as the pilot program for Amtrak's eTicketing system, which is due to launch nationwide next year.
Amtrak's eTicket eliminates the need for traditional paper tickets. Instead, a receipt is emailed to passengers, who can print it themselves at their convenience. Passengers also will be able to make changes to reservations online before they begin their travel.
Traditional tickets remain available at ticket offices and Amtrak kiosks. And traditional tickets are required for group tickets, multi-ride tickets and travel beyond the Downeaster route.
The Downeaster travels between Portland and Boston. Existing stops are Old Orchard Beach, Saco and Wells in Maine; Dover, Durham and Exeter in New Hampshire; and Haverhill and Woburn in Massachusetts.

Employer of men who died on job will pay $16,800 in federal fines
The employer of two men who were killed by sewer gases on a job site in Kennebunkport in September has agreed to pay $16,800 in federal safety fines.
Tim Stevens, owner of Stevens Electric & Pump Service in Monmouth, met Wednesday with officials at the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration's office in Augusta. He agreed to pay the fines and OSHA agreed to add language to its safety citations acknowledging that the employer had provided safety equipment that the employees did not use, said William Coffin, area director for OSHA's Augusta area office.
Winfield Studley, 58, of Windsor and Richard Kemp, 70, of Monmouth died from inhalation of hydrogen sulfide, a sewer gas, while working on a pump inside a sewer tank at the Lodge at Turbats Creek, a motel in Kennebunkport.
OSHA cited the employer for four safety violations, including failure to ventilate the area where the men were working and failing to test the air quality before and during the work. OSHA also said the workers were not using harnesses designed to help them escape the tank in such an emergency.
Stevens had said he planned to challenge the citations because the company had provided all the needed safety training and equipment for monitoring the air quality and protecting the workers. He said he did not know why the workers, his friends, decided not to use the equipment. Stevens could not be reached Thursday.
Maine's city, town governments show revenues down by 6 percent
A survey of city and town governments across Maine shows their operating revenues are slipping.
The Maine Municipal Association says local governments in the state received a 6 percent reduction in operating revenue from all sources last year. That's caused municipalities to cut back on services including general administration, code enforcement, libraries, parks and human services.
The association's annual survey is conducted in cooperation with the U.S. Census Bureau. More than 220 municipalities, accounting for 45 percent of all towns and cities in Maine, participated in this year's survey.
It found that in 2010, all of the municipalities statewide, including those not surveyed, collected an estimated $3.5 billion in federal, state and local revenues. That means revenues were down by 6 percent from the previous year.
Author will discuss health care during events in Maine next week
T.R. Reid, author of "The Healing of America," will speak at a series of public events in Maine next week about health care and health reform.
Reid will discuss his book and observations about health care in the United States and around the world. He also will speak about improving the quality of health care, a topic that will be featured in his new TV special scheduled to air nationally this winter on the Public Broadcasting System.
Book clubs around the state have been reading and discussing Reid's book in advance of the visit. Organizers expect more than 1,000 Mainers to hear one of Reid's presentations in Portland and other cities.
Reid is being brought to Maine by the Maine Health Management Coalition Foundation and the Daniel Hanley Center for Health Care Leadership. The Maine Health Access Foundation and other health care organizations have helped to underwrite the visit.
Reid's visit will include public talks at the University of Maine at Augusta at 7 p.m. Monday in Jewett Hall and at Portland Library's Rines Auditorium at 5:30 p.m. Tuesday. The Portland presentation will be broadcast live to a number of libraries around the state. For a list of participating locations, visit www.getbettermaine.org/bookclub.
Maine inmate who took hostages dies while in New Jersey prison
A Maine man who held two people hostage while in Maine State Prison has died in a New Jersey prison.
Michael Chasse was found unresponsive in his cell Thursday. He was serving a 12-year sentence for robbery, aggravated assault and a number of other crimes. He also had been convicted of two counts of kidnapping for the June 30, 2008, hostage standoff in which he used a homemade knife to hold another prisoner and the prison librarian hostage. He was sentenced in December to 40 years for that conviction.
Chasse, originally from Lewiston, was transferred to the New Jersey State Prison Jan. 3 shortly after his sentencing because of the hostage situation in Maine.
A statement from the Maine Department of Corrections gave no indication of the cause of death. The department statement said New Jersey authorities will conduct any investigation into the death.

Walmart's plans to expand store win approval from Planning Board
Walmart's plans to expand its store on Route 1 won final approval Tuesday from the Planning Board.
The retailer will increase the store's size from 92,000 to 124,000 square feet, adding a grocery section, garden center and pharmacy.
Before construction starts sometime next year, the 10-screen Regal Cinemas next door will be demolished.

Maine woman wins competition for screenplay at R.I. film festival
A Maine woman has won the Rhode Island International Film Festival screenplay competition with a story about a childless older couple and their adopted Newfoundland dog.
The screenplay "Raising Rufus: A Maine Love Story" by Carla Maria Verdino-Sullwold of Brunswick was selected as the winner in the main competition category. The Flickers film festival calls it a tender, tragic story about a couple in a troubled marriage of 40 years who adopt a dog named Rufus and set out on a series of adventures that help them heal.
Winners were also chosen from among the 364 entries in several other categories, including New England Focus, Horror, and Gay and Lesbian. Officials said the number of screenplays entered was the largest in the competition's history.

JAY - Gov. Paul LePage said today he will propose legislation in January to require random drug testing for welfare recipients.

File photo/The Portland Press Herald
I'm going to ask the Legislature to allow us to do what every truck driver in the United States of America has to do, take a random test," he said. "I think if we're going to take our own limited resources, we ought to be able to test 'em on occasion."
The comments came at a chamber breakfast in Jay, where LePage gave an overview of accomplishments from the last legislative session and previewed some of his goals for the new year.
With regard to drug testing, the Legislature added new provisions in the budget this year that allow the state to test those who receive Temporary Assistance for Needy Families funds if they have a prior felony drug conviction. LePage said he wants to take it a step further and explained that he believes people go "benefit shopping" when deciding where to live.
As proof, he talked about an email he received recently when a woman asked him if Maine provides benefits that are better than New Hampshire.
"I found that very insulting," he said. "I responded by saying 'ask not what the state of Maine can do for you, but what you can do for the state of Maine. Have a nice life.'"
Robyn Merrill of Maine Equal Justice, which provides legal services for the poor, said random drug testing programs in other states have been found unconstitutional. She said that's why a bill that would have required random drug testing did not make it out of the Health and Human Services Committee earlier this year.
Random drug testing is very questionable legally with respect to constitutional issues," she said. "If the government has the right to drug test people based on receipt of aid from public assistance programs, what is to stop the government from requiring drug testing for anyone who receives a student loan or any other government benefit. This law would create a very slippery slope with respect to infringement on peoples' right to privacy."

WATERVILLE - Gov. Paul LePage said Thursday he doesn't think Maine can support five gambling facilities, just days before voters are set to decide the fate of two gambling-related referendum questions.

RELATED STORY: Charges fly over racino claims
"I don't see how the state of Maine can afford five casinos," he said during a speech at Colby College. "I'm also very, very comfortable in saying five casinos will never be built in Maine. The population can't support it. One or two, maybe three, at the outside."
LePage made his comments when asked his position on the gambling measures. Ever since he was a candidate for governor, LePage has consistently said he would support the will of the people when it came to gambling.
On Tuesday, voters will decide on Question 2, which would allow a new race track with slot machines in Biddeford and one in Washington County. Question 3 would allow a casino in Lewiston. If approved, those facilities would join Hollywood Slots in Bangor and a casino currently under construction in Oxford.
LePage said that if both questions passed, he thinks the developers would have to collaborate.
"If they all pass, then what you're gonna see is the five businesses that are interested will sit down and really fine-tune the numbers," he said.
Lewiston Mayor Larry Gilbert, who is campaigning for Question 3, said he was "very disappointed" with LePage's comments. He said they run counter to the governor's strong faith in the free-enterprise system and his desire to improve the state's business climate and create jobs.
"I think he put up a sign that said, 'Open for business.' Well, this is a business. This will bring economic development and jobs. Let the free market determine how many casinos suffice. Let the free-enterprise system work, and see what happens," Gilbert said.
He said he suspected that lobbyists from Black Bear Entertainment, which is building a casino in Oxford, are influencing the governor.
"I smell a rat," he said.
LePage spokeswoman Adrienne Bennett said after the event that the governor is raising questions about whether a state with 1.3 million people can support five gambling facilities.
"It is a fair question," she said. "Do we have enough people to sustain those jobs if we have five casinos in the state?"
She said in New England, five gambling facilities "would be unprecedented."
Dennis Bailey of CasinosNo! said the governor is taking a "pragmatic business view" that the market can only support so much gambling in Maine.
"The governor is right," he said. "There is no way we can have five destination resorts at the scale they are proposing. It's not in the cards, as they say."
Bailey said he was surprised by the governor's comments, because in the past LePage has been reluctant to state a position on gambling proposals other than to say the people should decide.
Also at the Colby event, LePage explained why he opposes Question 1, which would overturn the law eliminating Election Day voter registration. He said he doesn't believe those who say requiring registrations to take place no later than the Thursday before an election would disenfranchise college students, minorities or the poor.
LePage noted that soldiers overseas must plan 45-60 days before an election to ensure their absentee ballots make it back in time.
"If those people can take 60 days while they are ducking bullets ... I think the rest of us at home who are free because of those people could give up that one day on Election Day," he said.
More than 200 people, many of them college students, packed the Goldfarb Center lecture hall at Colby for the event. LePage staffers, including energy czar Ken Fletcher, a former Republican state lawmaker from Winslow, passed out sheets of paper before the event to allow the audience to submit written questions.
Government professor Sandy Maisel selected and read the questions, which included inquiries about how the governor plans to address an anticipated shortfall in federal funds used to pay for heating oil for the poor.
"I am going to ask the Legislature to take some money out of Efficiency Maine to help with this," he said.
Efficiency Maine, which is funded through a surcharge on electricity bills, regional greenhouse gas funds and federal money, is a program that offers incentives for businesses and homeowners to reduce energy use. LePage said there are long-term projects that have been funded, but the money for the home heating program is an immediate need.
Also, college students wanted to know what LePage planned to do to keep them in Maine after they graduate. He encouraged them to see what jobs are available, and concentrate their studies in those areas.
He said parents play a role, too.
"What we need to do is keep more of the parents here," he said. "If you're really stable in an area, you will get your kids to come back. And when they come back, you can't get rid of them."

UMAINE HOCKEY

WHO: Maine at Boston College

SATURDAY
WHO: Maine at New Hampshire
WHEN: 7 p.m.
RADIO: WLOB (1310 AM)
ORONO - They skated casually onto the Alfond Arena ice Thursday afternoon, easy-going tunes playing over the loudspeaker. The University of Maine hockey team eventually worked on some plays, but the Black Bears were not going to go all-out in practice.
Tonight, the Black Bears will be anything but casual as they play top-ranked Boston College at the Conte Forum in Chestnut Hill, Mass.
The weekend's action will conclude Saturday night against another rival, New Hampshire, at the Whittemore Center in Durham, N.H.
UNH (2-4-1, 1-3 in Hockey East) is off to a slow start, but picked up its first league win last weekend. While the Wildcats are usually tough at home, there is no question which game presents the greater obstacle.
BC is 7-1 overall and 5-0 in Hockey East. The Eagles are ranked No. 1 in both the USA Today and USCHO polls. Their only loss is to No. 8 Denver.
Maine (3-2-1, 3-1) is ranked 20th by USCHO and is among those receiving votes in the USA Today poll.
Tonight, the visiting Black Bears will be the ones booed by the BC students. But it will be the Eagles with a target on their back.
"Beating the No. 1 team is definitely something that we want to do," said senior defenseman Ryan Hegarty.
BC is again loaded with several players already picked in the NHL draft, including junior defenseman Brian Dumoulin of Biddeford. Dumoulin, a second-round pick by Carolina, has two goals and six assists.
In Hockey East, the Eagles are first or second in scoring (4.5 goals per game), scoring defense (2.38), power-play percentage (22.9) and penalty killing (90.5).
"We know what we're up against," said junior defense-man and alternate captain Mike Cornell. "We obviously have a lot of respect for them. But at the same time, we want to go down and surprise them."
Maine coach Tim Whitehead said BC "looks very good, very strong at all positions. No weak links."
But Whitehead is pleased how his team is coming along, especially after the Black Bears swept Providence last weekend, including an overtime win Friday.
"I like our toughness, mentally and physically," Whitehead said. "This past weekend, we fought through two very challenging games and found ways to win."
Senior Brian Flynn leads Maine with three goals and six assists. Dan Sullivan (2.28 goals-against average) and Martin Ouellette (2.98) have each played three games in net.
Maine is in third place in Hockey East, behind BC and Merrimack. The Black Bears rank sixth in the league in scoring (3.17) and third in defense (2.67).
UNH, tied for seven place in the league standings, was winless in its first five games, four of them on the road. Since then, UNH has beaten Union 2-1 and Northeastern 5-2 - both at home.
"This will be a very good test to see where we're at," Whitehead said. "We learned a lot on our last road trip, to North Dakota (a loss and a tie). We played quite well in a tough environment. We're looking at this in a similar way. Win, lose or draw, we're going to be a better team."

RELATED STORY
Five gaming facilities are not feasible, LePage says
Proponents of the Biddeford Downs racino are denouncing what they describe as a deceptive flier distributed by opponents of Question 2, which asks voters to allow harness race tracks with slot machines in Biddeford and Washington County.
And a prominent casino critic is challenging the truthfulness of a new TV ad that supports Question 2.
At issue in both cases is how much revenue generated by the two casinos would be spent on education.
The flier, paid for by the Friends of Oxford Casino and mailed to registered voters over the past two weeks, claims that approval of Question 2 -- and Question 3, a separate ballot measure that would allow a casino in Lewiston -- would "put at risk" $25 million in funding for K-12 education in Maine. The flier urges voters to "protect Maine schools" and reject both ballot questions. Question 2 critics say adding two new racinos in Maine would cut into Oxford revenues, a portion of which would go to K-12 education.
Appearing at a news conference Thursday at the Yes on 2 campaign headquarters in Biddeford, the developers that would build Biddeford Downs said the flier is wrong.
Mark Walsh, vice president of Ocean Properties, which is also bankrolling the Yes on 2 campaign, said its opponents are deliberately confusing voters. He said operators of the Oxford casino and Hollywood Slots want to make sure that Biddeford Downs is never built so they can maintain a monopoly on gambling in Maine. Black Bear Entertainment is developing the Oxford casino and Penn National operates the Hollywood Slots in Bangor.
Sen. Roger Katz, R-Augusta, who serves on the Legislature's Appropriations Committee, said a Biddeford racino would "not cut a nickel" from K-12 education. It would provide $3 million annually for college scholarships and a projected $32 million for the General Fund, he said.
"I know referendum campaigns can be misleading at times, but there is no excuse to be misleading," he said at the news conference.
Meanwhile, an anti-casino advocate is challenging the truthfulness of a new TV ad in support of Question 2. The ad features a teacher from Pittsfield who says Question 2 is "great for education" and would provide $30 million for "things like Maine schools."
Dennis Bailey of Casinos No! said none of the racino money would be earmarked for K-12 education. Bailey called the ad "completely false."
The controversy highlights the different revenue distribution formulas for the Oxford casino and the Biddeford racino.
By law, K-12 funding would get the largest amount of funding from the portion of Oxford casino revenues distributed to the state, an estimated $25 million a year.
Taxes from the racino in Biddeford would go primarily to the harness racing industry, a prescription drug program for the elderly, college scholarships and the state's General Fund.
Question 2 proponents say all or part of the projected $32 million earmarked for the General Fund could be spend on K-12 education.
But Bailey said nothing in the law would require that the money be spent that way.
"It might go to education. It might go to building golf courses," he said. "No one knows where the money will go."
Mark Ferguson, a Poland convenience store manager who is director of Friends of Oxford Casino, said the plan to distribute the largest share of Biddeford Downs revenue to harness racing rather than K-12 education proves the project's developers are "out of touch" with Maine voters.
"It's kind of silly," he said. "They want larger flower bouquets for the winning horses versus more money for our kids."
Friends of Oxford Casino has received $281,457 to date from just two contributors: $200,250 from Black Bear Funding, a political action committee funded by the original investors of the Oxford casino, and $81,207 from Penobscot County for Table Games and Jobs, a political action committee funded by Penn National, which operates Hollywood Slots in Bangor.

A father and son team who deal in "cool kitsch" antiques from a warehouse in Rockland are the focus of a new cable TV series: "Born Dealers."

The Pasternaks, Jerry, right, and his son Jeremiah, stand in their antiques warehouse in Rockland. A new Planet Green cable TV show features the pair's search for unusual antiques that they warehouse in Rockland and sell online. "Our show is not just about the thrill of the hunt, it's also about the art of the deal," says Jeremiah.

The show follows Jerry and Jeremiah Pasternak - who live in Florida during the winter and Maine during the summer - as they buy and sell everything from vintage jukeboxes and barber chairs to classic cars and airplane propellers.
The hourlong "Born Dealers" will premiere at 10 p.m. Saturday and run for six episodes, also at 10 p.m. Saturdays. Locally, it can be seen on Time Warner Cable channel 107.
The Pasternaks run their business mostly on the Internet, they say, with their Rockland warehouse open by appointment only in the summer. But the show follows them as they travel the country to both buy and sell all manner of stuff.
"On other antiques shows you see someone buy something, and you see how much it's worth, but our show is not just about the thrill of the hunt, it's also about the art of the deal," said Jeremiah Pasternak, 28. "We want to show people that what we're doing is something that basically anyone could do."
The episodes will show the father and son dealing with various conflicts. In one episode, Jeremiah Pasternak opens a temporary store in Florida, against his father's advice. In another, Jerry Pasternak's patience is tested when his son wants to chase down the history of a car that may or may not be the inspiration for the original Batmobile. Some episodes were filmed in Rockland, others followed the Pasternaks on the road from Florida to Maine.
Jeremiah Pasternak said he pitched the idea of a show about his family business to a TV production company a few years ago, and it eventually got picked up. He thought the family dynamic would be interesting, as well as the fact that he and his father don't go after your standard antiques.
"It's not 18th-century furniture we deal with - it's jukeboxes, neon signs or barber chairs," said Jerry Pasternak, 57.
On one episode of the show, viewers will see the Pasternaks buying a 20-foot stained glass image that had hung in a Chicago restaurant, and dates to 1912.
"We like unusual antiques," Jerry Pasternak said.

PORTLAND - An Occupy Wall Street protest in Oakland, Calif., that turned violent and led to arrests Thursday can only harm peaceful movements like the one that has become entrenched in Portland's Lincoln Park, members of the Occupy Maine movement said.

Shane Blodgett, 21, an Occupy Maine member from Augusta who vows to stay in Portland's Lincoln Park "regardless of how cold it gets" this winter, says violence in the Occupy Wall Street movement is counterproductive.

"Violence is the furthest thing from our minds right now. There are no plans to be violent. Hopefully, that is the way it will stay," said Alan Porter, a 45-year-old Portland man who has been an active participant in the Occupy Maine protest since it began several weeks ago. "We are all dedicated to a common cause: a change to the system."
Shane Blodgett, 21, of Augusta said the violence in California can only hurt Occupy Wall Street's cause. The worldwide movement, including the one in Maine, challenges the world's economic systems and unequal distribution of wealth.
"It's very upsetting to see that the people we are fighting for are fighting against us," Blodgett said, referring to the Oakland protesters, who allegedly threw lighted roman candles and chunks of concrete and metal pipes at police.
Blodgett said he doubts there will be violence in Portland. And he expects the camp will remain into the winter despite the snow and cold.
"I'm going to stay here, regardless of how cold it gets. I would have to be frozen to the ground before they can move me," Blodgett said.
Over the past month or so, Occupy Maine's Portland encampment at Lincoln Park has grown to about 35 tents. The original protest began in Monument Square but moved to the park, which is in front of the Cumberland County courthouse, after the city asked protesters to relocate.
Dozens of supporters and protesters come and go throughout the day, and 50 or so actually spend the night.
The camp has changed significantly since it first moved to Lincoln Park.
In addition to getting bigger, there is now a spirituality room -- a geodesic dome where people can go to reflect or meditate -- as well as a kitchen stocked with all kinds of supplies, and a shelter marked "library" where protesters can go to read books or play board games.
After last weekend's unseasonal snow storm, organizers decided to bring in a wilderness emergency medical technician to help them prepare for cold weather.
Members of Occupy Maine gathered Thursday night in the park to discuss preparations they will need to undertake to make it safely through a Maine winter.
Jake Lowry of Portland, who moderated the discussion, said there seems to be consensus building toward spending the winter in Lincoln Park.
"A lot of us are feeling we could be more effective by ending our physical occupation (of the park)," Lowry said. "But there seems to be a drive to organize and winterize and keep the occupation going."
Lowry said he doubts Occupy Maine protesters would ever get into a conflict with Portland police, who he says have been pretty tolerant of the encampment off Congress Street.
Lowry said there has been some talk of civil disobedience among members but "nothing really crazy."
He said a small faction of Occupy protesters who wanted to "treat Portland like New York City" have left Maine. Police have arrested Occupy demonstrators in New York.
Heather Curtis of Portland doesn't sleep in the park because she has children at home to care for. She views the encampment as a place where she can go to express her views and find companionship among like-minded people.
She reacted negatively to the violence in Oakland.
"Whoever is being violent is not committed to the Occupy movement. Being nonviolent is one of our central tenets," said Curtis, who is self-employed.
John Schreiber, a baker from Portland who is involved with the Occupy Maine movement, said, "I hope it (violence) doesn't happen here. So far things have been relatively peaceful.
"Part of our message is people can work together," he said. "We don't need to be violent to get our message across."
As darkness began to descend on the camp, Nickie Sekera of Fryeburg sipped on a cup of coffee as she kept a watchful eye on the tents and shelters that will provide warmth on a cold night.
Sekera is an wilderness EMT who works for Solo Wilderness Medicine in Conway, N.H.
She has been training Occupy Maine members on how to spot and treat frostbite or hypothermia.
Though she is sympathetic to their cause, Sekera said, "Medicine is not political. It's about keeping these people safe."

Blueberry State?

Texto completo: HAWTHORNE, Fla. When you think of Florida fruit, oranges, grapefruit and strawberries come to mind. But blueberries?
Hundreds of small blueberry farms have opened in the Sunshine State in the past three decades, and blueberry production has increased more than tenfold in the past decade. Farmers hope to capitalize on their climate by providing fresh blueberries when their competitors in the North can't. Florida produces only a fraction of the blueberries that industry leader Michigan does, but from mid-March to mid-April, its farmers dominate the market.
It's just unbelievable how this thing has changed, said Ken Patterson, who owns the Island Grove Farm, one of Florida's oldest blueberry farms. Twenty years ago, when we held a Florida Blueberry Growers Association meeting we'd have 40 to 50 people at a good meeting. In November, we expect 400 people there.
Patterson, who was once a funeral director, has more than 150 acres filled with 6-foot-tall blueberry bushes in Hawthorne and nearly 200 acres of blueberries some 200 miles south in Arcadia. There are so many blueberry farms in the area just east of Gainesville that Patterson and other growers opened a 27,000-square-foot packing and distribution plant last year.
Their bushes will begin to bloom in January, and the fruit will be harvested by hand a couple of months later. Their harvest, from mid-March to mid-April, comes in a short, yet important, window for grocery stores, which strive to keep fresh blueberries on their shelves year-round. Russ Benblatt, executive marketing coordinator for Whole Foods, wrote in an email that the arrangement benefits farmers, grocers and consumers.
Florida's strawberry and tomato growers have used a similar growing season to briefly dominate the market by shipping fresh produce nationwide when most U.S. farms are dormant. Blueberries remain a much smaller crop for Florida farmers worth $47 million last year compared to the $362 million produced in strawberries, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture but it's growing.
Farmers such as Patterson say demand for blueberries has grown along with attention to its health benefits.
Wild blueberries grew in Florida before Native Americans settled there, and the first commercial blueberry plantations in the U.S. were likely established in there in the late 1800s, said Paul Lyrene, a horticulture professor at the University of Florida. The industry declined in the 1920s when customers in northern states stopped buying the blueberries that they considered low in quality.
Florida blueberries soon earned the reputation of being small, gritty-fleshed and lacking in flavor, Lyrene wrote in a scientific journal. Sales continued to drop during the Depression in the 1930s.
Fifty years later, University of Florida researchers began developing Florida-friendly varieties of highbush berries, the term generally used for cultivated blueberries. Wild berries, such as those common in Maine, are called lowbush.
The new varieties were sweeter, tastier and more consistent in size than the berries produced earlier in Florida, Lyrene said. They were hardier which meant easier shipping, and most importantly, they could withstand warm weather.
By 2000, Florida farmers saw a way to diversify and take advantage of consumer demand although they don't ever expect to rival the big growers in Michigan, Maine and New Jersey.
Blueberries are expensive to grow, costing about $20,000 an acre to plant. And, Florida varieties produce only 4 to 5 pounds of berries per bush, while Northern bushes can yield up to 20 pounds of fruit.
Still, the season gives Florida farmers an advantage by limiting their competition, and they sell all their fruit fresh which commands a higher price than berries sold to be frozen or processed into juice or other foods. Dole Food Co., the world's largest producer and marketer of fresh fruit, saw enough of an opportunity there that it announced last month it was buying Florida-based Sunny Ridge Farm, one of the nation's largest fresh blueberry companies.

The herd of deer and other wildlife that you may have noticed on the grounds of the Portland jetport pose no hazard to aviation.

"Glimpse" sculptor Wendy Klemperer is well known in Maine for working with welded steel. She is currently showing at the College of the Atlantic in Bar Harbor.
They may distract a few automobile drivers, though.
At 3 p.m. Friday, the city and the Portland International Jetport will dedicate a new piece of public art called "Glimpse." The art - a half-dozen deer, a wolf and a porcupine - is the gift of Yarmouth residents William D. and Mary Louise N. Hamill and their family. In addition to donating the cost of the art by New Hampshire sculptor Wendy Klemperer, the Hamills also covered all expenses associated with its installation.
William Hamill declined to say what he paid for the artwork, which was vetted by the Portland Public Art Committee and accepted as a gift by the city.
"Flying isn't as easy as it used to be," said Hamill, a longtime trustee of the Portland Museum of Art and past board president. "I hope this has a little bit of influence on the good side. I hope it relaxes people a little bit, if that's possible. It's nice to have something interesting on the approach to the airport or when you are leaving the airport. It's a different subject than what goes on at that facility."
The installation and dedication coincide with the recent jetport terminal expansion.
The collection of sculptures is sited on the main airport approach road off Congress Street, known as International Parkway. It is a winding road, landscaped with trees and low bushes. The sculptures sit on grassy knolls on two spots along the parkway. They are tucked back, not out of view but in subtle locations that are designed to surprise travelers along the road.
"I believe that sculpture helps you more appreciate your environment and see things more closely," said June LaCombe, a Pownal art dealer who represents Klemperer and brokered the gift from Hamill to the city. "Having this glimpse of sculpture, it activates our senses and makes us more aware of everything around us."
Klemperer, who studied at the Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture and was a guest instructor at Maine College of Art in Portland, is well known in Maine. She has shown at Maine Audubon in Falmouth, Coastal Maine Botanical Gardens in Boothbay and currently is showing at College of the Atlantic in Bar Harbor.
She works with welded steel, assembling her pieces from salvaged industrial waste, including rebar, wire and steel rod. Her see-through figures are lifelike and large-scale.
The deer figures at the jetport strike various poses. One is grazing. Another is scratching itself. A third is trotting. The wolf is howling, its head tilted to the sky.
Airport director Paul Bradbury echoed Hamill's sentiment that the installation might help soothe traveler anxieties. With its winding design and existing green space, International Parkway is meant to calm people as they enter the complex and slow them down.
"There is substantial landscaping along the road that speaks to Maine and the sense of place we want to establish for our visitors and users," Bradbury wrote in a letter supporting the acceptance of the Hamill family gift. "These sculptures, in my opinion, will help enhance and reinforce both these themes at the jetport. I also believe art displayed within an airport complex is a wonderful means to cure the modern-day stresses of air travel."

Texto completo: LePage challenges MEA on teacher training
By Susan M. Cover scover@mainetoday.com
State House Bureau
AUGUSTA - Gov. Paul LePage issued a challenge Wednesday to the Maine Education Association, saying he's ready to spend more money on teacher training if the union spends money too.
"For every dollar the MEA puts up for professional development for their teachers, we'll match it," he said, drawing applause from those gathered at the Maine Tax Forum held at the Augusta Civic Center. "I believe they collect dues, and right now those dues go to Washington at the end of the year for political campaigns. I think the dues should be invested back in to the educators in the state of Maine."
He also said many teachers leave the profession after only a few years because they don't get enough support.
"The problem is union bosses that come out of Washington and come to Maine and cause a whole lot of confusion and not put their money where their mouth is," he said. "They like to extract money, but they don't like to leave it here and develop their teachers to become more effective. We're going to challenge them to do that."
The comments were part of a speech in which LePage talked about his three biggest goals for the upcoming legislative session: energy, education and the economy. Hundreds of tax professionals, accountants and others took a break from learning about federal and state tax changes to listen to LePage's keynote address.
MEA President Chris Galgay said the union does provide classes for beginning teachers and mentoring to help teachers become nationally certified.
As for the governor's challenge to match funds, Galgay wouldn't say how much money the union collects in dues, how much is spent on training and how much goes to the national union.
But he'd like to hear more from LePage about his idea, Galgay said. "If he had a plan and asked us if we wanted to be part of the plan, I'd sit down and talk with him about it," he said.
When it comes to union bosses, Galgay said the MEA gets support - not direction - from its national union.
"The NEA president has little control of what the states are doing," he said. "The national association is more about me reaching out to them for support or them saying what can we do for your members in Maine." He said most of the dues that Maine teachers pay to the national union come back to the state, but he declined to be specific about how that worked.
The Maine branch of the union has an annual budget of about $8 million. The union represents 20,000 teachers and others who work in schools, along with community college faculty.
At the tax forum, LePage continued to tout his idea that the income tax on retiree pensions should be eliminated. He said he'll release a proposal in January to eliminate the tax on military, private and public-sector pensions. That would cost $93 million annually.
LePage did not say how he plans to cover the revenue loss. His spokeswoman, Adrienne Bennett, said the full plan will be released in January.
"There are a number of things we can do to achieve those savings," she said. "There's a number of programs in state government that haven't been looked at in years. Are they doing what they are supposed to be doing?"

Army Lt. Thomas Plourde and the Japanese-American forces he led during World War II are awarded the highest civilian recognition given by Congress.
WASHINGTON - It was the early dawn on July 11, 1944, near Pastena, Italy, when Lt. Thomas Plourde of Maine and his storied unit of Japanese-American soldiers came under heavy German artillery fire.

Jan Barrett of Lewiston shares photos of her late father, Lt. Thomas Plourde, with U.S. Rep. Michael Michaud, a Maine Democrat, in his office before a ceremony Wednesday to award the Congressional Gold Medal to Plourde and veterans from the Japanese-American military regiment he helped command during World War II.

As the shells poured in on their position, Plourde and his men moved to better cover, but Plourde "risked his own life" by returning to make sure everyone made it out, according to an account of the battle a few weeks later, when Plourde's commanding officer recommended the Lewiston native be awarded a Bronze Star Medal for "heroic and meritorious" action.
The men Plourde led were Japanese-Americans who had to fight their own nation's prejudice even as they sustained heavy losses in some of the bloodiest battles against the Germans.
To his daughter, Jan Barrett of Lewiston, Plourde was a gentle giant of a man who made clear his disdain for prejudice and discrimination. But he never talked about his exploits during World War II, when he was a Caucasian officer who helped lead a company in the famous 100th Infantry Battalion/442nd Regimental Combat Team.
Plourde died in 1992 at age 71, but his daughter was present Wednesday at a Capitol Hill ceremony where dozens of surviving veterans of those Japanese-American units - including U.S. Sen. Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii - were presented with the Congressional Gold Medal, the highest civilian award given by Congress.
Barrett, 64, was among the hundreds of veterans and family members who attended the ceremony in Emancipation Hall in the Capitol Visitor Center. She sat next to U.S. Rep. Mike Michaud, D-2nd District, who earlier Wednesday officially entered her father's accomplishments into the Congressional Record.
Plourde retired from the Army in the 1960s as a lieutenant colonel and went on to a career as a hospital industry executive in Georgia, where he helped pay for the college educations of several needy children from the region.
"Sitting in the middle of all of the veterans who were surviving veterans, it was so moving," Barrett said after the ceremony. "It just brought me to tears a couple of times wishing my Dad could have been there. It's heartbreaking to me that he couldn't be here to receive this himself, but I was so proud to be here representing him."
Barrett owns the Ware Street Inn in Lewiston and has served as a staffer to former Democratic Sens. Edmund Muskie and George Mitchell of Maine. She called Michaud her "hero" for the Congressional Record tribute and for helping her get a prime seat for the medal ceremony.
It was her father who "definitely was the hero," Michaud told Barrett as she showed him photos of Plourde in uniform.
Thousands of Japanese-Americans - second-generation citizens known as nisei - were eager to fight for the United States even as many of their parents and other family members lived in internment camps, their loyalties questioned after the 1941 invasion of Pearl Harbor.
It took awhile for U.S. military officials to approve the segregated units of Japanese-American soldiers, but after the war, President Harry Truman reviewed the 442nd on the South Lawn of the White House and noted their thousands of medals, heavy casualties and other evidence of the valor displayed by the soldiers.
"You fought the enemy abroad and prejudice at home, and you won," Truman told the soldiers.
Among their assignments were the rescue of a trapped Texas battalion in France and the breaking of the "Gothic Line" in Italy that had succeeded in holding off Allied forces for five months, according to a history compiled by the National Veterans Network, a coalition of Japanese-American veteran and civic organizations.
Plourde, the 23-year-old "French-Canadian kid" from Lewiston, as his daughter called him, won more plaudits in 1945 from a company commander for what he and his men accomplished during mountain fighting that preceded the sweep of battalion forces into the Po Valley in Italy.
At one point, during a battle raging at Fort Bastione, "despite the heavy enemy fire, (Plourde) maintained that all-important post day and night to direct accurate counterfire upon the enemy gun positions," his commander wrote.
"All throughout this period, his alertness and ability repeatedly paved the way for the battalion's advance and the complete defeat of the enemy forces in this area," wrote Maj. Mitsuyoshi Fukuda, a commanding infantry officer, in his statement from Sept. 7, 1945. "In these actions he (Plourde) proved his ability as a leader, demonstrating always personal concern for his men. For these qualities he received in return, the fullest cooperation from those who served under him."
Barrett said that she was amazed when she looked through her father's military records and realized what her father had done during the war and the historic combat unit he helped lead.
"They were an amazing battalion, and I am proud that my Dad was one of their officers," Barrett said. "It just validates the feelings I always had about him."

A Maine man who held two people hostage while in Maine State Prison has died in a New Jersey prison.
Michael Chasse was found unresponsive in his cell today. He was serving a 12-year sentence for robbery, aggravated assault and a number of other crimes. He also had been convicted of two counts of kidnapping for the June 30, 2008, hostage standoff in which he used a homemade knife to hold another prisoner and the prison librarian hostage. He was sentenced in December to 40 years for that conviction.
Chasse, originally from Lewiston, was transferred to the New Jersey State Prison Jan. 3 shortly after his sentencing because of the hostage situation in Maine.
A statement from the Maine Department of Corrections gave no indication of the cause of death. The department statement said New Jersey authorities will conduct any investigation into the death.

Staff Writer
Andrew O'Brien spent several months this year looking for a job before he landed a data entry position through a temp agency. His experience, he said, taught him how demoralizing it can be looking for a job right now.
[image removed] Caption:
Gov. Paul LePage leads a discussion in October at a Job Creation Workshop for businesses and public officials at Southern Maine Community College. An angry Democratic lawmaker sent him an open letter in response to his recent comments.
Staff file photo
That's why he got so angry last week when Gov. Paul LePage said he's hearing from businesses that their biggest competition for workers is the state's unemployment insurance program.
"We have got to convince those who can work that we need to get them back to work," LePage said at a forum in Bangor, according to the Bangor Daily News. "Quite frankly, I think that might be a sign that we're paying them a bit too much when they're at home not working."
O'Brien, a 32-year-old Democrat from Lincolnville, represents several rural towns in midcoast Maine in the House of Representatives. He's normally a low-profile lawmaker, but he was so enraged by LePage's comments that he has spent the past week trying to meet with him. But he couldn't get a meeting with the governor or any of his staff, he said.
On Wednesday, frustrated with the lack of response, O'Brien sent an open letter inviting LePage to spend time at career centers to learn more about the experiences of the unemployed. He said LePage should listen to "job seekers," and not just the "job creators" that he so often talks about.
After releasing the letter, O'Brien finally got his response: A phone call from a member of the governor's economic development team.
O'Brien noted in his letter that 60 percent of the 52,000 Mainers who were unemployed in September did not qualify for unemployment insurance benefits. Moreover, the average unemployment benefit is $6.97 an hour, which is lower than minimum wage.
"I don't know anyone preferring to collect what amounts to a pittance over a hard-earned paycheck," wrote O'Brien, who holds a master's degree in education, but has been mostly doing seasonal work such as raking blueberries while serving as a legislator.
According to the Maine Department of Labor, the average benefit is $271 a week and the maximum benefit is $366. Maine's benefit is the lowest in New England, and in the bottom third of states nationally. In 2010, 34 states had a higher weekly benefit rate than Maine.
The average person in Maine receiving unemployment benefits year received 16.1 weeks of benefits this year, up from the average 14.3 weeks in 2007.
At the same Bangor forum, LePage was quoted as saying he wanted to see if there are enough incentives to get people off unemployment and back to work, as well as whether the funds paid to unemployed people should be reduced.
LePage spokesperson Adrienne Bennett said on Wednesday that the administration does not plan to submit legislation to lower the unemployment insurance benefit.
"The governor realizes that in this terrible economy there are people that want to work and he is sympathetic to the struggles that many Mainers are facing," she said. "We are, however, fooling ourselves if we don't think there are some people taking advantage of the system who would rather collect unemployment than get a job."
Maine's unemployment benefits program is not a big topic of discussion among Republican lawmakers, said Rep. Andre Cushing, R-Hampden, the assistant House majority leader.
He said, however, that he has heard from some businesses complaining that some people are applying for jobs simply to meet unemployment insurance program requirements that they look for work.
He said LePage wants to create a culture in which people are encouraged to get off public assistance whenever possible.
But lawmakers need to be cautious when discussing programs that affect a vulnerable segment of the population and avoid making sweeping statements, Cushing said.
"We need to tread carefully in the legislative process and not send a hostile message to them," he said.
If Republicans do try to lower unemployment benefits, they would face a "heck of a fight" from Democrats, said Sen. John Patrick, D-Rumford.
He said he was "appalled by the governor's comments because he seemed to be blaming the unemployed for their plight.
"To me, it's inconceivable to think that someone is going to just stay home," he said. "Mainers want to work. I don't see an overabundance of jobs, and I don't see that the governor has gotten jobs in his tenure so far."

Texto completo: Dunlap enters race to unseat GOP's Snowe
State Rep. Jon Hinck also looks poised to challenge the senator, setting up a Democratic primary.
WASHINGTON - Former Maine Secretary of State Matthew Dunlap, a Democrat, is officially running for the seat held by Republican U.S. Sen. Olympia Snowe.

And Democratic state Rep. Jon Hinck of Portland made it clear Wednesday that he also will be entering the race, setting up a Democratic primary.
Dunlap has filed a statement of organization with the Federal Election Commission, forming a "Dunlap for Senate" committee. Hinck has formed an exploratory committee and appears poised to make a formal announcement. Both have been weighing a Senate bid for months.
Snowe, meanwhile, faces a GOP primary challenge from two tea party-affiliated candidates, Scott D'Amboise of Lisbon Falls and Andrew Ian Dodge of Harpswell.
Snowe, considered a moderate Republican, won re-election in 2006 with 74 percent of the vote. She is the favorite so far to win a fourth term, said Jennifer Duffy, a senior editor of the nonpartisan, Washington-based Cook Political Report, which currently lists the Snowe race as "likely Republican."
Dunlap was secretary of state from 2005 to 2010 and is a former state representative from Old Town. He also served as the interim executive director of the Sportsman's Alliance of Maine, leaving that post earlier this year.
"This will be a tremendous challenge," Dunlap said Wednesday about entering the race. "But I look forward to the discussions I will be having with the voters of Maine over the coming months as we look to chart a new course to prosperity."
Hinck's exploratory committee released a statement Wednesday saying it looked forward to a potential Democratic primary.
"Primaries are great for the democratic process and help to energize the electorate. Moreover, it's time for an incumbent who has spent 33 years in Washington to go. Olympia Snowe has lost touch with Mainers," the Hinck statement said.
Snowe won election to the U.S. House in 1978 before she was elected to the Senate in 1994.
Her campaign manager, Justin Brasell, said in an email that Snowe has been "an effective and independent voice for Maine, and she is focused on doing her job to look out for Maine's interests in Washington."
Snowe "looks forward to the opportunity in the campaign next year to showcase her many accomplishments on behalf of Maine workers," he wrote.
Mary Erin Casale, executive director of the Maine Democratic Party, said she is pleased about a contested primary.
"I am glad Matt made it official and I am looking forward to Jon's filing as well. A primary is great for us," Casale said. "Either candidate is going to mount a strong challenge against Sen. Snowe. She's going to have a big race in front of her. She has been tacking to the right recently, and the people of Maine are ready for a change."
A poll released earlier this week found that Snowe is well ahead of her primary challengers.
In a survey of 250 "usual" Maine GOP primary voters conducted Oct. 28-31 with a 6.2 percent margin of error, 62 percent of those surveyed preferred Snowe, compared with 10 percent for D'Amboise and 7 percent for Dodge, according to Public Policy Polling. PPP says it is a Democratic polling company, but notes that "polling expert Nate Silver of The New York Times found that its surveys in 2010 actually exhibited a slight bias toward Republican candidates."
Snowe had more than $3.2 million in her campaign coffers as of Sept. 30. D'Amboise had about $182,000 and Dodge had not raised enough money to file a campaign report with the FEC.
Dunlap and Hinck "have potential to be credible, but they have a lot to prove against Snowe in terms of fundraising, building name recognition and defining a contrast with Snowe," said Duffy with the Cook Political Report. "I suspect that they hope that Snowe loses the Republican primary or emerges very damaged, thus creating an opening. Today that appears to be wishful thinking, but I am going to keep watching."

Texto completo: National report card puts Maine on par with nation
But low reading levels have education officials calling for improvements in the literacy rate.
By Susan McMillan smcmillan@mainetoday.com
Staff Writer
AUGUSTA - Maine compares well to other states on the nation's report card, but Education Commissioner Stephen Bowen is calling for improvements in literacy.
Results released Tuesday from the biennial National Assessment of Educational Progress show that Maine's eighth-graders improved in mathematics. Maine students did not make significant progress, however, in fourth-grade mathematics or in reading for fourth or eighth grade.
The National Assessment of Educational Progress is known as the nation's report card because a sampling of students from each state take the same test.
"It's the one test we can actually use to compare to other states," said David Connerty-Marin, spokesman for the Maine Department of Education.
In both reading and mathematics, for both grades four and eight, Maine students scored higher than the national average.
Maine is one of 13 states where eighth-graders improved in mathematics from 2009. Maine's average score rose from 286 to 289, and the percentage of students scoring at or above proficient rose from 35 to 39.
Results for fourth-grade mathematics were unchanged from 2009. Maine's eighth-graders made slight gains in reading.
Fourth-graders scored lower on average in reading, and the percentage rating proficient or higher declined from 35 to 32, but the federal report does not count the decline as significant.
On a national scale, the average mathematics scores rose by one point for each grade level, reaching their highest marks to date.
The average reading score for eighth grade rose by one point, but the average fourth-grade score remained unchanged.
Connerty-Marin noted that reading scores have not risen significantly since testing began in 1992.
"So we're flat in reading. We've been flat for a long time," he said. "The whole country's relatively flat in reading. So we say OK, we're not unique. Everybody's having this problem, so how are we going to address it?"
The Maine Department of Education is already working on a statewide literacy plan, expected to be completed before the end of the year. The plan will focus on better coordination of various resources and systems in the state, such as instruction in K-12 schools, early childhood education, parent education and training for teachers.
"We want to make sure that all of it is working in concert toward a unified goal and with some alignment in how they approach things," Connerty-Marin said. "There's research out there that tells us how kids learn, but we're not necessarily applying it."
Several nonprofit organizations also promote literacy in the state, for both children and adults, including the Maine Family Literacy Initiative, Maine Humanities Council, Raising Readers and Maine Reads.
Maine Reads coordinates among the state's literacy agencies, distributes books to kindergarten students and teaches parents how to read with children so it's fun for everyone.
While the organization does not get involved in policy, Executive Director Sarah Cecil said she is glad for attention to the issue.
"It's a really important cause," Cecil said. "You're trying to ensure that people have a happy future, essentially."

Texto completo: Railroad's parent sues Maine trade publication
Pan Am Systems alleges libel on the part of Yarmouth-based Atlantic Northeast Rails & Ports and its editor.

The parent company that operates a regional freight railroad covering most of northern New England has sued a small, Yarmouth-based trade publication for libel.

Read the publication's motion to dismiss the complaint
Pan Am Systems Inc. of Dover, N.H., has filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Bangor against Atlantic Northeast Rails & Ports and its editor, Chalmers "Chop" Hardenbergh.
In its complaint, Pan Am claims Hardenbergh published untrue information on multiple occasions about the company and its former chief executive, David Andrew Fink. Both Fink and Springfield Terminal Railway Co. of North Billerica, Mass., also are named as plaintiffs.
In a reply brief filed last month, Hardenbergh and his Portland attorney, Sigmund Schutz, asked the court to dismiss the claims. They called the suit "a constitutionally impermissible attempt to silence a journalistic voice."
Pan Am Systems was founded in 1977 as Guilford Transportation Industries. It is privately owned by Timothy Mellon, an heir to the Mellon banking fortune, and shareholders include Fink and his son, David Armstrong Fink.
The company's Pan Am Railways division owns subsidiaries including Boston and Maine Corp., Maine Central Railroad Co., Portland Terminal Co., and Springfield Terminal Railway Co. It operates a network from Schenectady, N.Y., to Mattawamkeag, Maine, and has lines in New Hampshire, Vermont and Connecticut.
In its complaint, Pan Am cites what it calls factual allegations made in past issues of Atlantic Northeast Rails & Ports. It cites stories dealing with operating safety, service and Fink's departure from Pan Am management earlier this year.
"The substance of the lawsuit is plainly set forth in the complaint," Pan Am's lawyer, Thad Zmistowski of Bangor, said in a written statement. "My clients have alleged that they have been defamed in print by the defendants on numerous occasions and that their reputation has been wrongfully attacked. We look forward to our day in court."
The complaint says Hardenbergh published defamatory information, and the coverage caused economic damages and harmed the plaintiff's reputation. It seeks unspecified punitive damages.
In his response, Hardenbergh says the railroad and its chief executive are highly visible figures and that the plaintiff's claims of malice would fail, "because they do not allege any facts sufficient to raise a plausible inference of negligence."
Hardenbergh started his weekly newsletter, which covers freight railroads and ports in New England and eastern Canada, in 1994. It now includes a website and e-bulletins and has 350 paid subscribers.
Hardenbergh has extensively covered Pan Am and has long voiced critical opinions about its service and operations. In an interview Tuesday, he declined to characterize his relationship with Pan Am or speculate on what triggered the suit, citing his lawyer's advice.
In his latest newsletter, Hardenbergh said he is facing substantial legal fees, even if the case is dismissed. He is soliciting contributions to a legal defense fund at the Preti Flaherty law firm.

Texto completo: Truck, potato provisions important to Maine survive U.S. Senate vote
The two issues important to Maine still need to be OK'd in final congressional legislation.
WASHINGTON - Potatoes will still be part of the nation's school lunch program and trucks weighing up to 100,000 pounds would be allowed back on all Maine interstates under overall spending legislation approved 69-30 Tuesday by the Senate.

The potato battle began when proposed U.S. Department of Agriculture restrictions on servings of starchy vegetables threatened to drastically reduce the use of potatoes, a major Maine crop, in federal school lunches and breakfasts. There would have been no potatoes at breakfast and a limited amount at lunchtime.
Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, and allies including GOP Sen. Olympia Snowe of Maine and Democratic Sen. Mark Udall of Colorado, led the fight for a provision to keep potatoes on the menu without restrictions.
Maine was the sixth-largest potato-producing state in the nation in 2010, according to the Maine Potato Board, based in Presque Isle. Maine farmers grow about 55,000 acres of white potatoes, and sold $140 million worth in 2009.
Mainers also have been closely watching the truck weight issue.
Currently, trucks weighing more than 80,000 pounds can use only the Maine Turnpike and side roads elsewhere around the state. Collins and Democratic Sen. Pat Leahy of Vermont co-authored a provision in the overall spending bill giving exemptions to trucks weighing up to 100,000 pounds so they can use all interstates in Maine and Vermont.
The truck weight measure has been long-sought by the Maine congressional delegation, state officials and many local residents who don't want about big rigs banned from the highway rumbling through intersections and past homes, businesses and schools.
For a year, the heavier trucks were largely absent from side roads. But last December, a federal pilot program allowing access to all Maine interstates lapsed.
The truck weight provision is not in the House version of the spending bill, so proponents need to get the exemptions for Maine and Vermont included in the final House-Senate version.
The House spending bill does have a similar measure opposing the potato restrictions, but the House and Senate still will have to reconcile the two versions.
Collins, a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, will be part of the conference committee hashing out the final House-Senate spending measure, so she will have a seat at the table as the truck weight and potato provisions are considered.
Congressional leaders hope the Senate and House can reconcile the differing versions before Nov. 18, when a temporary 2012 spending measure expires.
Snowe also is a supporter of the truck weight proposal, and Reps. Chellie Pingree, D-1st District, and Mike Michaud, D-2nd District, back the truck weight and potato provisions as well.

State House Bureau
AUGUSTA - Gov. Paul LePage issued a challenge to the Maine Education Assocation today, saying he's ready to spend more money on teacher training if the union spends money too.
"For every dollar the MEA puts up for professional development for teachers, we'll match it," he said drawing applause from those gathered at the Maine Tax Forum held at the Augusta Civic Center.
He also said many teachers leave the profession after only a few years because they don't get the support they need.
"The problem is the union bosses that come out of Washington and come up to Maine and cause confusion," he said.
The comments were part of a speech where LePage talked about his three biggest goals for the upcoming legislative session -- energy, education and the economy.
Chris Galgay, president of the Maine Education Association, said the union does provide classes for beginning teachers and mentoring to help teachers become nationally certified. He said he wants to hear more from LePage about this idea.
"If he had a plan and asked us if we wanted to be part of the plan I'd sit down and talk with him about it," he said.
And, when it comes to union bosses, Galgay said they get support -- not direction -- from their national union.
"The NEA president has little control of what the states are doing," he said.

Columnist
What might Maine maple syrup soon have that the venerable Maine lobster doesn't?
Ironclad brand protection, that's what.
We begin with the syrup: This week, MaineToday Media Washington Bureau Chief Jonathan Riskind reported on a bill now in the congressional pipeline that would make it a federal felony to sell fake maple syrup as the real thing.
The so-called "Maple Act" was submitted by Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont and co-sponsored by, among others, Maine Sens. Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins.
The measure seeks to turn up the heat on counterfeit syrup - essentially brown, liquefied sugar labeled as "pure maple" - by elevating its sale from a mere misdemeanor punishable by a year in prison to a (gulp) felony punishable by up to five years in the federal slammer.
This despite the fact that such skullduggery, while attempted at least once recently by a scammer in Vermont, has yet to be reported anywhere in Maine.
"To my knowledge, I'm not aware of any cases presently," confirmed Eric Ellis, president of the Maine Maple Producers Association, in an interview Tuesday. "It's really a protective measure."
Still, according to our two esteemed senators, it's a much-needed safeguard nonetheless.
This week, Snowe called the felony upgrade "vital" and a "necessary deterrent" to maple-syrup fraud.
And Collins noted last month that it would protect both Maine's maple syrup industry (the nations's third largest) along with "consumers who have a right to know what they are purchasing."
Which brings us to the lobsters - and a sharp-eyed consumer by the name of Leslie Linfield.
Linfield, founder and executive director of the Institute for Financial Literacy in South Portland, was traveling with an associate in Virginia a few weeks back when friends took them out for dinner at an upscale restaurant, Morton's The Steakhouse.
Scanning the menu, Linfield noticed "Whole Baked Maine Lobster" listed among the entrees. But when the waiter rolled out the traditional food cart - the national chain likes to show off its main courses before cooking them - Linfield also noticed that the "monster" size crustacean has something printed on the rubber band around its claw.
"I actually had to put on my reading glasses," she recalled. "And there it was - 'Massachusetts' - printed right on the band."
Linfield politely informed the waiter that said lobster was not, in fact, from Maine.
Yes, it is, he replied without batting an eye.
She persisted with a more senior waiter who came by later to see if all was well.
"Where are your lobsters from?" asked Linfield.
"All of our lobsters come from Maine," he replied.
"That bad boy ... got pulled out by a boat in Massachusetts," countered Linfield, noting the telltale rubber band.
Linfield sat back and waited for the waiter's apology. Instead, she said, "he just dug his heels in."
Enter fellow diner Bryan Wyatt, Linfield's communications director. The next day, Wyatt fired up his iPad, logged onto Twitter and sent this message to Morton's: "I noticed one of your Maine lobsters had Massachusetts printed on its band. Are all your lobsters from away?"
Tweeted back Morton's: "@leslielinfield @bryanwyatt: Our lobsters are Main Lobsters-can be found on Atlantic coast of NAmerica chiefly from Labrador 2 New Jersey"
Main Lobsters? From the great state of ... Main?
"To accommodate the 140 character limit on Twitter, 'Maine' was shortened to 'Main,' " explained Sally Shorr, spokeswoman for Morton's, in an email Tuesday.
Right. Except by my count, the tweet had at least three characters to spare.
Asked if Morton's, as a matter of policy, actually buys all of its "Main lobsters" in Maine, Shorr said, well, not exactly.
"Maine lobsters are a species, not named after the location where they're are caught," she wrote.
Wrong again.
For starters, the species is called "homarus americanus," or "American lobster." And according to Dane Somers, executive director of the Maine Lobster Council, the "Maine" label should only apply to those landed on the Maine coast.
In fact, Somers said, Maine's lobster industry persuaded the Food and Drug Administration a few years back to remove "Maine lobster" from a list of terms considered synonymous with "American lobster" because the listing "went too far" in diluting the Maine brand.
But here's the rub: When the Maine Lobster Council tried long ago to trademark "Maine lobster," the federal Patent and Trademark Office said no.
"They said it was a general, geographic term - which they don't allow," said Somers.
Meaning there's currently nothing anyone can do to stop Morton's from selling "Maine lobsters" regardless of whether they were actually caught in Maine.
Still, maintains Linfield, "Maine has a brand. And it's a brand worth protecting."
Linfield, by the way, is an attorney. And she readily admits that when she read this week that Maine maple syrup counterfeiters could face up to five years in the big house, she did a double take.
"As an attorney, I would say yes, it's a little stiff," she said. "But to me it's the ethics of it ... If they can draw up legislation for maple syrup, then why aren't they passing legislation for Maine lobsters?"
"She's right - it is the ethics of the situation," agreed Patrice McCarron, executive director of the Maine Lobstermen's Association. "It's just wrong."
McCarron, upon reading about the maple syrup bill this week, fired off an email this week to Snowe's office asking, "Hey, what about us?"
She has yet to hear back.
But in an email late Tuesday from Collins' office, spokesman Kevin Kelley wrote that Collins agrees "the bottom line is about protecting the integrity of the product. It's actually another example of why legitimate producers deserve to be protected - whether it's 'pure maple syrup' or 'Maine lobster.'"
Including those caught in Main.

Staff Writer
Carl Smith was torn. He can't be in two places at once Saturday.
Should he make plans to drive two hours north to Orono for the college football game with conference championship repercussions? Twenty years ago he thrilled Maine fans when he took handoffs and found open spaces with regularity. He set the standard for the Maine running backs who eventually overtook some of his school rushing records.
Should he make plans to stay in Saco to watch the South Portland-Thornton Academy playoff game that will send the winner to the Western Class A final? His twin sons, Andrew and Dylan, are freshmen football players at Thornton. His wife, Lori, is the school's field hockey coach. Carl Smith has become a fixture on the sidelines, moving first-down chains during games. He's a frequent guest on the student-produced pregame show.
"I'm a Trojan now. I loved my time at Maine but this is where I want to be on Saturday."
Ouch. Maine's game with Towson is the biggest in years. The team that was picked to finish ninth in the preseason conference poll is on top of the standings with Towson. In a magical season of fourth-quarter comebacks on the road, the Black Bears have returned to home-field advantage. The more that hop on the bandwagon, the better.
Maine is 5-0 in the Colonial Athletic Association. Towson and New Hampshire are 4-1. Smith is well aware of Maine's run to the top. He admires Coach Jack Cosgrove and is proud of the program. But ...
"I love high school sports. It's the final time of a kid's innocence. They put it all out there. Everyone remembers their last game for their hometown school. I don't recall my last game at Maine. When you go to Maine or any Division I program, it's your job."
Smith was a star running back and sprinter on the track team at Riverhead High on Long Island in New York. His hometown newspaper listed him as one of Suffolk County's greatest athletes.
In 1989, his sophomore season at Maine, he led the country with 1,680 yards. He rushed for more than 100 yards in nine games. He scored 20 touchdowns.
The single game that means the most to him came against Rhode Island. He gained 245 yards that day and his father's parents were in the stands to see a grandson play college football for the first time.
By the end of his college career, he was entrenched in Maine record books.
The Philadelphia Eagles invited him to camp. The NFL team also picked up Herschel Walker. Smith didn't make the team.
He is one of Maine's fastest running backs and sprinters, and at age 43 can't catch his sons in a footrace. He has a plate and screws in each of his worn-out knees. "To go from being the fastest person to not being able to run, it just eats at me right now," Smith told the Suffolk Times in August.
Still, there's laughter in his voice.
He returned to Maine with his wife, a distance runner at the university. He was an assistant football coach at Old Orchard Beach for a while. A side street near the ocean is named Carl Smith Street and he'll let people think it's named for him if only for a moment or two.
He was inducted into the university's sports hall of fame in 1999. He can remember the first part of the Maine Stein Song, traditionally sung by the team after each victory. "I'm humming it in my mind right now. It's amazing how much is coming back to me."
He played for three head coaches during Maine's revolving-door years: Tim Murphy, Tom Lichtenberg and Kirk Ferentz. Cosgrove was an assistant coach. Smith was a teammate of Mike Buck, the strong-armed pocket quarterback with the gimpy knees who led Maine into the NCAA playoffs.
But 20 years have passed and Smith knows that's a long time. He grew up in an area where major college football was non-existent. He lives in a state where the culture of major college football isn't known. "I've seen the way towns in Maine empty out for the high school playoffs. It's amazing.
"(The Black Bears) have three tough games left. I'm definitely going to the New Hampshire game (in Durham, N.H.) and take my sons."
He didn't check his calendar. The high school state championships are played on the same afternoon. Carl Smith will have another decision to make.

PASSAGES
Each day the newsroom selects one obituary and seeks to learn more about the life of a person who has lived and worked in Maine. We look for a person who has made a mark on the community or the person's family and friends in lasting ways.
Family and friends cheered as a military band played patriotic music. The wives held their children close, crying and shouting their final goodbyes and I love you's to their husbands.
"All of those wives left standing on the pier would become family," said Joanne Swenson of Hebron, the younger of Mrs. Parady's two children.
"My mom welcomed them in our home. She was an inspiration to a lot of people. She was a Navy wife. Everything was for God and country," her daughter said.
Mrs. Parady, a former longtime Avon representative who had a passion for music and generously gave back to the community, died Monday. She was 79.
She was a loving wife to George A. Parady Jr. for 59 years. The couple met at a dance at the American Legion Hall in Gray. At the time, he was on leave from the Navy and she was a bookkeeper at Casco Bank in Portland. They were married in July 1952.
The couple returned to Maine after her husband's military service.
Swenson said her parents shared a passion for traveling and visited nations on several continents.
"They had a wonderful life," she said. "They were soul mates. Now, he is beside himself. He's so sad."
Mrs. Parady was remembered by her daughter Monday as a strong, resourceful and compassionate woman who had a zest for life.
She worked for Avon for more than 30 years and sold its products in the Gray area. She retired in the late 1990s.
"Everyone knew her," Swenson said. "I could never understand why all those people would buy Avon. She had this way about her. If it was on sale, she could talk you into buying three or four of them. She had a passion for whatever she did."
One of those things was music. She played the organ at weddings, funerals and other church services.
For most of her life, she also taught piano to children. She directed the children's choir at the First Congregational Church of Gray for about 15 years.
"She had this love for music," her daughter said. "She considered it a gift from God and she gave it back a hundred times over."
Mrs. Parady struggled with Alzheimer's disease for the past 12 years or so. She died early Monday, two weeks after suffering a seizure.
Her daughter said Halloween was one of her favorite holidays. She remembered when her mother used to dress up and hand out homemade popcorn balls and candied apples to trick-or-treaters.
"Of all days for her to pass," her daughter said. "There's snow on the ground and snowmen in the yard. Yesterday, the kids made snowmen and today they are trick-or-treating. She would have loved watching the kids from the window."

Texto completo: State panel weighs cap on addiction treatment
Doctors say limiting MaineCare coverage to save money would put patients in jeopardy.
By John Richardson jrichardson@mainetoday.com
State House Bureau
A state budget-cutting task force is considering a two-year MaineCare limit on some forms of drug addiction treatment.
Officials with MaineCare, the state's Medicaid program, proposed a cap on coverage of treatment with Suboxone, a replacement drug that helps opiate addicts resist cravings while getting counseling and therapy. Cutting off coverage after two years would save $787,313 in the 2013 budget, the agency says.
Members of the Streamline and Prioritize Core Government Services Task Force have not decided whether to add the idea to their final list of proposed cuts. But they suggested during a meeting Friday that the two-year limit might also be applied to methadone, another replacement drug used to treat addicts. It's not yet known how much money that limit could save MaineCare.
"When is enough enough? Or is this a lifetime treatment?" said Joseph Bruno, a former House Republican leader and member of the task force.
Physicians who treat addicts said Monday that the limit would lead to more addiction at a time when Maine is already dealing with historically high levels of overdoses and drug-related crime.
"There are people who are in constant crises in their lives who will relapse without being on stabilizing medication," said Dr. Mark Publicker, an addiction specialist at Mercy Recovery Center in Westbrook. "It would be as logical as putting people on Type 2 diabetes medication for two years. It's as much a medical disease."
The task force is compiling a list of $25 million in proposed cuts to give to the Legislature in December. The limit on drug addiction treatments is sure to be among the cuts that generate a backlash if lawmakers formally take them up early next year.
Suboxone and methadone are prescribed to about 15,000 Mainers fighting addiction to prescription painkillers or heroin, and most of them are covered by MaineCare. Two-thirds of the 4,000 Mainers admitted into treatment last year were covered by MaineCare, according to state figures.
Treatments cost about $300 per month for each patient.
Recovering addicts take small daily doses of Suboxone or methadone to limit cravings as they rebuild their lives and go through therapy. While many are weaned off the medications within two years, others rely on the drugs for many years to stay sober. It was not clear on Monday how many MaineCare members have gone beyond two years with the treatments.
Jane Hallett of Lubec said she has been taking daily doses of methadone for six years. "You cannot do it within two years. You just can't," she said.
The 50-year-old said she is gradually reducing the dose, but is sure she would relapse without the treatment.
"I have severe depression," Hallett said. "And when things aren't going right ... my answer is to go get a pill. And still, after six years (on methadone), the urge is still there once in a while."
The two-year cap is based on federal guidance and on established best practices, according to the Office of MaineCare Services. The agency also said it plans to allow members to exceed the two-year limit if it is medically necessary and the provider gets prior authorization for the treatment.
Bruno, the task force member, said the cost has become too great for the state and that some treatment providers are profiting from long-term use of the drugs. Some patients are profiting, too, by selling their medications to other users and addicts, he said.
"If people are productive and they're doing well on the stuff, it's a hard call. But there are some people who aren't productive and it's becoming a profit center for them," Bruno said. "It's a fine line, but how much are we willing to pay for?"
Publicker and other doctors say there is no standard time of treatment for a recovering addict. "It requires a combination of medication and lifestyle changes," he said.
Publicker said he is treating a young mother who has been on Suboxone for two years, has paralyzing depression and is on the verge of being homeless. Suboxone is the only thing keeping her from abusing painkillers again, he said.
"If I say, 'Oh, by the way, your two years are up,' I would have a dead patient," he said.
Dr. Joseph Py, corporate medical director for the Discovery House methadone clinics in Maine and several other states, said he knows of no states with time limits on the treatments.
"There's nothing in the addiction medicine literature that has been written that could justify a two-year limit," he said. "Continued open-ended treatment is the medical standard of care."
An arbitrary limit will push more people back into addiction, Py said, eventually costing the state much more in additional emergency room visits, crime and fatal overdoses.
"There's a 10 percent mortality rate per year for individuals who leave methadone replacement treatment before they're ready," he said.

AUGUSTA
State collects record amount of unused and expired drugs
Maine set a new record Saturday for the amount of unused and expired medications turned in for safe disposal.
Mainers dropped off 14,410 pounds of prescription and over-the-counter drugs at collection sites around the state, according to Michael Wardrop, a U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agent in Portland who coordinated the take-back event in Maine. The pills and other drugs were taken in two box trucks to an incinerator in Massachusetts, where they were destroyed Monday.
The previous collection produced 11,920 pounds in Maine, the most drugs per capita collected in any state.
"I'm pretty confident that again we will be number one per capita," Wardrop said. "If we saved one life, we did our due diligence."
The DEA sponsors the national drug take-back days to get unneeded opiate painkillers and other drugs out of medicine cabinets where they are available to teens and potential abusers. The collections also reduce the amount of drugs being flushed down toilets into waterways.
A recent series of articles published by MaineToday Media reported that prescription drug abuse, overdose deaths and drug-related crime are at historic high levels in Maine.
Same-day voting supporters outspending rivals by 3-to-1
Campaign finance reports show that forces seeking to repeal Maine's new voter registration law are outspending their opponents by a 3-to-1 margin.
The latest reports show supporters of Question 1 on the Nov. 8 ballot have spent more than $660,000. Their opponents had spent nearly $200,000 as of Monday.
The "yes" campaign's biggest political action committee is Protect Maine Votes, whose major contributors include financier Donald Sussman and labor unions. The Maine Republican Party, some county GOP organizations and the Maine Heritage Policy Center have donated to the opposing campaign.
A "yes" vote would repeal a new state law that requires voters to register at least two business days before an election. It would reinstate a law that allows registration up to and including Election Day.
Caylee Anthony case spurs missing-child bill in Maine
The case of Caylee Anthony, the 2-year-old girl whose 2008 disappearance in Florida drew national attention, has sparked legislation in Maine that will be considered next year.
Legislative leaders on Monday voted to admit a bill that would make failure to report a missing child within 24 hours a felony. The sponsor, Democratic Rep. Anna Blodgett, said she received at least 50 emails from her Augusta constituents asking her to introduce the bill.
The acquittal in July of Anthony's mother, Casey Anthony, shocked and enraged many people around the country. Casey Anthony did not report her daughter's disappearance for a month and was arrested after lying to police about the case.
The Legislative Council considered nearly 300 requests to submit bills on a range of issues, but fewer than half were allowed in.
BANGOR
Occupy Maine protesters pitch tents next to library
The number of around-the-clock Occupy demonstrations in Maine has grown to three, with tents popping up at a new site last weekend in Bangor.
Bangor police threatened to arrest demonstrators if they camped overnight in local parks, so protesters pitched tents next to the public library. The site is just yards from Peirce Memorial Park.
Media team coordinator Lawrence Reichard said there were 13 tents on Saturday night. On Monday, six tents remained, and he said the group is staying put.
Occupy Maine in Portland has been at Monument Square and Lincoln Park since Sept. 30, and Occupy Augusta has been encamped in Capitol Park since Oct. 15. The groups are aligned with Occupy Wall Street, which decries wealth inequality and corporate influence in government.
FREEPORT
Eleven vie for Town Council, School Board, sewer board
Town voters will go to the polls next Tuesday to fill three seats on the Town Council, two seats on the School Board and two seats on the sewer district board.
Katherine Arno and incumbent Eric Pandora are running for District 2 councilor. Kristina Jane Egan and incumbent Joseph Migliaccio are running for District 3 councilor. Incumbent Richard DeGrandpre and Marie Gunning are running for councilor-at-large.
Gurdarshan Gill and incumbents Nelson Larkins and Beth Parker are running for the School Board. Michael Ashby and Timothy Whitacre, both incumbents, are running for the sewer district board.
Voting will take place in the gymnasium at Freeport High School on Holbrook Street, which is off Main Street across from Town Hall.
SOUTH PORTLAND
State colleagues name Godin Superintendent of the Year
Superintendent Suzanne Godin has been named Maine's 2012 Superintendent of the Year for her focus on student achievement and her ability to generate community support for the city's schools.
Godin was selected by a committee of colleagues and received the award last week during the Maine School Superintendents Association's annual meeting in Augusta.
Godin, who lives in North Yarmouth, has been superintendent since 2007. Before that, she served as assistant superintendent and was a principal in MSAD 51, which includes Cumberland and North Yarmouth.
School Board member Karen Callaghan nominated Godin for the award, calling her an "absolute dynamo."
"I have never known anyone so knowledgeable about all aspects of education," Callaghan said.
She praised Godin for engaging board members, school employees and the community in school improvement, especially the 2010 campaign to get voter support for the planned renovation and expansion of South Portland High School.
The district will hold a reception honoring Godin at 6:30 p.m. Nov. 15 at the high school.
SKOWHEGAN
Examiner says man's death caused by multiple gunshots
The state Medical Examiner's Office has determined that a former Skowhegan man died of multiple gunshot wounds Oct. 20 in the York County town of Lebanon, police said Monday.
Aaron Jones, 38, was found dead at a home he shared with Joseph and Sarah Turner.
"There were only three people inside the home at the time of the shooting: Jones and the husband and wife who lived at the home. Those are the only three that were involved in this incident," said Steve McCausland, spokesman for the Department of Public Safety.
State police detectives said the shooting occurred about 11:30 p.m. at 213 Oak Hill Road.
No one has been charged in the case and the investigation is expected to last several weeks. Police have sent forensic evidence to the state criminal lab and are working with the Attorney General's Office, McCausland said.
Information on the firearm used or if the Turners were injured during the incident was not being released.
Jones, a 1991 graduate of Skowhegan Area High School, was a 260-pound bodybuilder and weightlifter.
Jones pleaded guilty and paid a $1,000 fine in 2001 for assaulting a police officer in Winslow that year, according to a Morning Sentinel story.
ELLSWORTH
High school custodian faces drug trafficking charges
A custodian at Ellsworth High School is facing drug trafficking charges for activity that authorities say involved students.
The Maine Drug Enforcement Agency said 53-year-old Frank Trundy was arrested at the school last week on two counts of felony aggravated drug trafficking. Police say he was dealing two kinds of prescription painkillers, some of which were prescribed to him and others he allegedly purchased from a student.
Trundy's bail was set at $5,000 cash and he has been told to stay away from school property. He is due in court in January.
Police say an undercover officer posing as a new custodian bought codeine tablets from Trundy.
Two students are also facing charges.
Superintendent Suzanne Lukas told the Bangor Daily News that the school has zero tolerance for drug activity.

Texto completo: SOUTH WINDSOR, Conn. When winter's white mixes with autumn's orange and gold, nature gets ugly.
The freak October nor'easter knocked out power to more than 3 million homes and businesses across the Northeast on Sunday in large part because leaves still on the trees caught more snow, overloading branches that snapped and wreaked havoc. About 2 feet of snow fell in some areas over the weekend, and it was particularly wet and heavy, making the storm even more damaging.
You just have absolute tree carnage with this heavy snow just straining the branches, said National Weather Service spokesman Chris Vaccaro.
From Maryland to Maine, officials said it would take days to restore electricity, even though the snow ended Sunday.
The storm smashed record snowfall totals for October and worsened as it moved north. Communities in western Massachusetts were among the hardest hit. Snowfall totals topped 27 inches in Plainfield, and nearby Windsor had gotten 26 inches by early Sunday.
It was blamed for at least six deaths, and states of emergency were declared in New Jersey, Connecticut, Massachusetts and parts of New York.
Roads, rails and airline flights were knocked out, and passengers on a JetBlue flight were stuck on a plane in Hartford, Conn., for more than seven hours. And while children across the region were thrilled to see snow so early, it also complicated many of their Halloween plans.
Sharon Martovich of Southbury, Conn., said she hoped the power will come back on in time for her husband's Halloween tradition of playing Young Frankenstein on a giant screen in front of their house. But no matter what, she said, they will make sure the eight or so children who live in the neighborhood don't miss out on trick-or-treating.
Either way we will get the giant flashlights and we will go, she said.
More than 800,000 power customers were without electricity in Connecticut alone shattering the record set just two months ago by Hurricane Irene. Massachusetts had more than 600,000 outages, and so did New Jersey including Gov. Chris Christie's house. Parts of Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, New York, Maine, Maryland and Vermont also were without power.
It's going to be a more difficult situation than we experienced in Irene, Connecticut Gov. Dannel P. Malloy said. We are expecting extensive and long-term power outages.
Thirty-two shelters were open around the state, and Malloy asked volunteer fire departments to allow people in for warmth and showers. At least four hospitals were relying on generators for power.
Around Newtown in western Connecticut, trees were so laden with snow on some back roads that the branches touched the street. Every few minutes, a snap filled the air as one broke and tumbled down. Roads that were plowed became impassible because the trees were falling so fast.
One of the few businesses open in the area was a Big Y grocery store that had a generator. Customers loaded up on supplies, heard news updates over the intercom, charged up their cellphones, and waited for a suddenly hard-to-get cup of coffee in a line that was 30 people deep and growing.
Many of the areas hit by the storm had also been hit by Irene. In New Jersey's Hamilton Township, Tom Jacobsen also recalled heavy spring flooding and a particularly heavy winter before that.
I'm starting to think we really ticked off Mother Nature somehow, because we've been getting spanked by her for about a year now, he said while grabbing some coffee at a convenience store.
It wasn't just the trees that weren't fully ready for a wintry wallop.
Kerry McNiven said she was totally unprepared for the storm that knocked out her water and power and sent tree limbs crashing into her Simsbury, Conn., home. She was buying disposable plates and cups in a darkened supermarket, a setting she said resembled one of those post-apocalyptic TV shows.
They didn't hype this one as much as Irene, she said. I didn't think it was going to be as bad.
In Concord, N.H., Dave Whitcher's company had yet to prep its sanding equipment before the storm dropped nearly 2 feet of snow. His crews were plowing and shoveling parking lots Sunday and would be back today to salt sidewalks and walkways.
It was a bit of a surprise, the amount and how heavy it was. We should've probably come out and got a little earlier start, but we did all right, Whitcher said. He held up his shovel and added, Me and this guy are going to get to know each other real well today.
Vaccaro, the weather service spokesman, said the snowstorm absolutely crushed previous records that in some cases dated back more than 100 years. Saturday was only the fourth snowy October day in New York's Central Park since record-keeping began 135 years ago.
There usually isn't enough cold air in the region to support a nor'easter this time of year, but an area of high pressure over southeastern Canada funneled cold air south into the U.S., Vaccaro said. That cold air combined with moisture coming from the North Carolina coast to produce the unseasonable weather.

Texto completo:   NISENBAUM, Louis "Lou" 63, of Lakeville, MA, passed away on October 25, 2011, at his home surrounded by his family, following a courageous battle with cancer. He was the husband of Emily (Murgo) Nisenbaum with whom he shared 18 years of marriage. Born in Dover-Foxcroft, Maine, a son of the late Robert and Meredith (Annis) Nisenbaum, he grew up in Easton, MA and had resided in Lakeville for the past 19 years. Lou was a 1966 graduate of Oliver Ames High School in Easton and later graduated from Marietta College in Ohio in 1970 with a degree in history. From Larry Tummino, Deputy Commissioner of the Department of Developmental Services, "Lou was a pioneer in the provision of services to people with developmental disabilities in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. For over 40 years, he helped lead the charge to have individuals be fully included in the lives of their communities. In both his professional and personal life, he represented deeply held values that called for society to see individuals with disabilities for the gifts they have and not their deficits." Lou began working with children with disabilities at the local and state level while at Marietta College and was given a Citizenship Award for this work during his time there. He worked as a house parent in Solomon House in Taunton, the very first group residence for individuals with intellectual disabilities in 1970. It was the beginning of moving people from Paul A.
Dever State School which finally closed 42 years later and it began the move away from institutional to community living. Lou went on to be a Unit Director at Dever prior to the many reforms that were later put in place and he witnessed firsthand the overcrowded and inhumane conditions that existed there. This experience had a major influence in his desire to create social justice for individuals with disabilities. He worked for a variety of organizations over the years including Beta Community Services in Attleboro, Independence Associates in Bridgewater and the Southeast Educational Collaborative in Fairhaven. In 1984, Lou became the founding Executive Director of The Nemasket Group in Fairhaven which has served hundreds of individuals and families through the provision of Family, Employment, School Transition and Residential Support. Lou and his wife also worked internationally bringing their advocacy experiences and knowledge to exchange with families in Scotland and England; in addition, Lou directed an international exchange program in Massachusetts. Lou helped develop Massachusetts Families Organizing for Change, a statewide group that advocates for families who support children and adults with disabilities and served on the board for 20 years. In addition, he was a founding member of The Coalition for Community Living, a self-advocacy group that supported individuals to speak for themselves in pursuit of improved services. Lou was an organic gardener, potter, woodworker, avid reader, engaging conversationalist and photographer who enjoyed cooking, camping and sports. In his youth, Lou was a talented baseball and football player. Lou's constant companion was his chocolate Lab, Java. Surviving in addition to his wife are his sons, Sasha Nisenbaum and his wife Lea of Amesbury, MA and Josh Recupero and his wife Tina of Tiverton, RI; his daughter, Amy C. Recupero of Fairhaven; his sisters, Rhonda Messier and her husband Hap of Plymouth, MA and Paula Carroll and her husband Bernie of Glendale, AZ; his brother, Michael Nisenbaum of Skowhegan, Maine; and many nieces and nephews. His funeral service will be held on Monday, November 7, 2011 at 11am in the Waring-Sullivan Home of Memorial Tribute at Fairlawn, 180 Washington St., FAIRHAVEN followed by burial in River-Side Cemetery, Fairhaven. A Celebration of His Life will immediately follow at The Nemasket Group, 56 Bridge St., Fairhaven. In lieu of flowers, donations would be greatly appreciated to The Nemasket Group, 56 Bridge St., Fairhaven, MA 02719. For online tributes and directions: www.waring-sullivan.com

HOW IT ADDED UP
THE INCH TOTALS of snow from Saturday's overnight storm varied widely in Maine:
North Acton: 20
Bridgton: 17.4
Cornish: 14.8
Gray: 12.9
Raymond: 11
Hollis: 9.8
Gorham: 7.9
Portland (North Deering): 6.5
Freeport: 5.6
Portland (Jetport): 5.2
Durham: 5
Saco: 4
Brunswick: 2
Source: National Weather Service
PORTLAND SETS TWO RECORDS
- The 5.2 inches measured at the Portland International Jetport set a record for the biggest single snowfall in October. The previous record of 3.6 inches was set on Oct. 27, 1962, and was tied on Oct. 22, 1969.
- The jetport's 5.2 inches also set a record for total snowfall in October. The previous record of 3.8 inches was set in 1969.
Source: National Weather Service
About 20,000 Mainers remained without power early this morning, after a record-setting pre-Halloween storm dropped as much as 20 inches of snow and downed power lines across the region.
Central Maine Power Co. reported that more than 207,000 customers lost power at some point during the nor'easter, mostly in York and Cumberland counties, with a peak of nearly 145,000 customers without power on Sunday morning.
Emergency power crews were out in force dealing with blown transformers, snapped lines and severed tree limbs. But most Mainers stayed off the roads, so there were only minor traffic accidents, despite widespread malfunctioning traffic lights.
The storm set records at the Portland International Jetport, where 5.2 inches made it the largest single snowfall on record in October, according to the National Weather Service in Gray. The previous record of 3.6 inches was set on Oct. 27, 1962, and repeated on Oct. 22, 1969.
The jetport's snowfall also set a new record for the month, outpacing the previous record of 3.8 inches in October 1969.
The storm, which began Saturday evening, socked interior locations and spared coastal areas, where relatively warm ocean waters kept much of the precipitation in the form of rain. Accumulations ranged from 20 inches in North Acton and 17.4 inches in Bridgton to 6 inches in Bangor and 2 inches in Brunswick.
"The variation was huge," said Butch Roberts, a technician at the weather service.
CMP crews worked through the night and all day Sunday, assisted by private contractors and crews called in from Canada, said company spokesman John Carroll. By 11 p.m. Sunday they had restored the backbone of the power system, including all hospitals and other critical facilities.
While some crews would be working overnight, customers whose service wasn't restored by 10 p.m. Sunday were expected to remain without power through the night, Carroll said.
"We expect to have most everyone back in service by Monday night, except for some communities in York County and the midcoast area where damage was severe," Carroll said.
Getting power back on for those people could take a few days.
Mainers woke up Sunday to a winter wonderland at least a month early. They were divided on whether Mother Nature had delivered them a trick or a treat on Halloween weekend.
"This is a trick, a foul, foul and horrible trick," said Philip Royer of Sanford.
Royer and his son, Malachi Royer, 12, and a friend, Josh Sirois, 11, were among dozens of people who nevertheless tried to make the most of the unexpected snowfall, descending on Sanford's Gowen Park to go sledding.
"This is a real treat, real fun for my son, Willy," said Kevin Burgoyne of Sanford.
In Acton, Drew Klein-Robbenhaar had to dig out a 4-foot-high bank of sodden snow left behind by plows in front of his Route 109 farm, where about a foot of snow fell Saturday night. He said the snow was the latest blow in a soggy fall that has left many fields too wet to work.
"This has been a bad year for a lot of things," he said.
But with the growing season over for the most part, farmers said the snow did no major damage. "It just slows down a business a little bit," said Carol Anne Jordan, who was operating the family's Jordan Farm Stand in Cape Elizabeth on Sunday.
The early storm interfered with some Halloween celebrations. York police rescheduled trick or treating from Sunday to today from 4 to 8 p.m. The Lebanon Rescue Department moved its Halloween open house from Sunday to today at 5 p.m. at the department's building on Carl Broggi Highway. Rescue Chief Samantha Cole said the party will continue past 7 p.m. if needed.
The snow wasn't expected to stick around long because the ground is warm and temperatures should moderate into more fall-like numbers as the week progresses, Roberts said.
Sunny skies are expected through Friday, with low temperatures at or just below freezing and highs in the 50s.

Federal legislation backed by Maine's senators would increase the penalties for fraudulent maple syrup.
WASHINGTON - Producers of fake maple syrup aren't common in Maine -- at least not now.

U.S. Sen. Susan Collins of Maine is co-sponsoring federal legislation that would make selling fake maple syrup a felony. Is this legislation a good idea?

Federal legislation that would dramatically stiffen the penalty for producing fraudulent syrup is meant to keep it that way in a state where the industry is prosperous and growing, say Maine's U.S. senators and maple syrup makers.
The bill co-authored by Democratic Sen. Pat Leahy of Vermont and Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine would turn a misdemeanor punishable by no more than a year in jail into a felony that could draw as much as five years.
The legislation is backed by GOP Sen. Olympia Snowe of Maine and senators from New York, another major maple syrup-producing state. Since Leahy is chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, the bill appears to have a good chance of advancing toward a Senate vote.
Leahy says he came up with the idea because of a pending federal case involving a Rhode Island man who allegedly sold cane sugar-based syrup as authentic maple syrup. Leahy asked Collins to co-author the bill because of the importance of the maple syrup industry to both of their states.
Maine is the third-largest producer of maple syrup in the country, after Vermont and New York. More than 360,000 gallons were produced this year in Maine, up from 315,000 gallons in 2010, bringing in nearly $11 million.
There are about 350 licensed maple syrup producers in Maine, with about 50 that tap enough sap to fill 40-gallon drums with syrup and market it at the wholesale level, according to the Maine Maple Producers Association.
"Fake labeling not only hurts this growing agricultural industry, but also defrauds consumers who have the right to know exactly what they are purchasing," Collins said when the legislation was introduced this month.
U.S. Attorney Thomas E. Delahanty from the District of Maine said through a spokesman that he is not aware of any federal cases in Maine involving fraudulent maple syrup and never heard of such a case during his tenure as a Maine Superior Court justice.
There isn't a problem now with fake syrup being produced or sold in Maine, said Eric Ellis, president of the Maine Maple Producers Association and manager of Maine Maple Products in Madison.
Maine Maple Products processes nearly 30,000 gallons of maple syrup annually, producing 20,000 gallons itself from its production area along the Canadian border and selling most of its product in Maine.
Producing maple syrup is labor-intensive. To get those 20,000 gallons, Maine Maple Products had to tap about 80,000 trees, Ellis said.
Ellis said that while phony Maine maple syrup is "almost non-existent," the Leahy-Collins bill is a good idea "to make sure it doesn't happen in the future."
Snowe said she sees the legislation as a deterrent, too.
"It is vital ... to provide the necessary deterrents to ensure Maine's maple syrup industry is not threatened by individuals who are trying to cheat the system," Snowe said via email.
Michael Bryant, the owner of Hilltop Boilers in Newfield, said there have been instances of fraudulent maple syrup outside of Maine.
Last year in Maine, he said, producers encountered a problem with syrup that didn't explicitly claim to be pure maple syrup but had labels and packaging that producers in Vermont and Maine believed falsely gave the appearance of the real thing.
"I think it's a great idea," Bryant said of the proposal to increase the penalty for producing fake maple syrup. "If people follow the law, they have nothing to worry about. It's big money at this point, and the penalties we had in place were not reflecting that. By making the punishment much stricter, that kind of deters people from trying to do things that are not nice and law-abiding."
The U.S. attorney in Vermont, Tristram Coffin, a former Senate Judiciary Committee aide to Leahy, said, "The maple syrup adulteration problem crops up from time to time" in Vermont.
In 2000, a Vermont man was found guilty of selling, across the country and abroad, 500,000 pounds of what was presented as pure maple sugar but was nothing more than regular cane sugar, according to the Vermont Department of Agriculture. While the man received a 46-month sentence, that was based mainly on charges such as mail and wire fraud.
The charges associated with the actual offense of producing fake maple sugar "were so low that it isn't something that is equivalent to the gravity of the problem," Coffin said.

Texto completo: State House Notebook: Democrats call GOP fundraiser into question
From staff reports
AUGUSTA - Democrats are raising questions about a recent House Republican caucus fundraising invitation where the state's three constitutional officers were listed as invited guests.
State law prohibits the attorney general, treasurer and secretary of state from soliciting funds while in office. Caucus organizer Assistant House Majority Leader Andre Cushing, R-Hampden, said he was careful to make sure they followed the letter of the law.
"They did not raise any money," he said. "They were invited as guests. They were not in any way involved in making solicitations for the event."
Yet Democrats argue that listing their names on a fundraising invitation gives the appearance that those who pay the money will get access to people who hold those offices.
"It would be one thing if they were legislators, but these are constitutional officers who are responsible for fairly allocating state money, interpreting our laws, and overseeing our elections and yet here they are, front and center on a high-dollar GOP fundraiser invite," Democratic Party Chairman Ben Grant said in a prepared statement. "This sends a terrible signal to the people of Maine who rely on their offices."
The fundraiser was held last month in Portland and included an overnight stay. A full weekend with hotel accommodations cost $3,000, while those on a more limited budget could spend $500 to attend a policy briefing with a meal. In addition to the policy briefings, there was an evening cruise on Portland Harbor, golf or shopping, an afternoon skeet shooting event and an evening lobster bake.
The shooting event was held at a gravel pit owned by Attorney General William Schneider, who served as the range master for the event, Cushing said. The invitation indicates that it cost $1,000 to be a shooting event sponsor.
Cushing said he does not yet have totals for how much was raised at the event, but is comfortable that Republicans will be ready to compete in 2012.
Both parties will continue with fundraisers over the coming months as they build war chests for next year's election. All 186 legislative seats will be on the ballot. Republicans currently control both the House and Senate. The legislative session that begins in January is expected to feature many partisan battles as both parties try to best position themselves in advance of the election.
COLLINS TO DROP BILL
Sen. Ron Collins, R-Wells, who upset labor unions in recent weeks by submitting a bill that would have outlawed automatic union dues deduction from paychecks, said Friday he's dropping the bill.
Collins said he put the bill in after some constituents who were unhappy with their union approached him over the summer. He said they thought they would have better leverage with the union if they had the power to write a dues check each month. That way, they could withhold payment if things weren't going well.
But once the AFL-CIO heard about the bill, they encouraged all their southern Maine members to contact Collins. Apparently some did.
"I've gotten quite a few emails and phone calls not in favor of it," he said. "I'm not going to pursue it."
No doubt legislative leaders will formally kill the bill today when they meet to say yea or nay to the nearly 300 bill requests before them.
MADORE TO HEAD PAUL CAMPAIGN
Paul Madore, a pro-family conservative who's led efforts to oppose gay rights in Maine for years, was recently named state chairman of the Ron Paul for president campaign.
In an email to Constitution Coalition supporters, Madore said he underwent a "short but vigorous vetting" while applying for the job.
"I am deeply humbled and very grateful for this tremendous opportunity to be part of this most liberating and revolutionary effort to help restore liberty and freedom to our nation," he wrote.
A few weeks ago, MaineToday Media reported that former Christian Civic League of Maine Executive Director Michael Heath was heading up the Paul campaign in Iowa.
LEPAGE ON HOME RULE
Gov. Paul LePage, who cut his political teeth as mayor of Waterville, wants to find a way to get cities and towns to work together to save taxpayer money. He's apparently not a big fan of the time-honored tradition of home rule or local regulations.
The idea has come up twice in recent weeks -- once at a business forum in Bangor and earlier during a speech to the Cumberland Club in Portland.
In Bangor last week, the governor told the Bangor Daily News that he plans to submit legislation to allow the state to hold back revenues from cities and towns if they have regulations that are more strict than those at the state level. In particular, he was talking about business regulations.
Earlier in the month in Portland, an audience member at the Cumberland Club asked the governor if there was a way to reduce the number of cities and towns, according to a recording of the event found on the Maine Public Broadcasting Network website.
LePage expressed frustration that as mayor of Waterville, he wasn't able to get neighboring Winslow to work with him more often. Although the cities share a fire chief, they bought separate fire equipment and couldn't come to an agreement on sharing a road grader, he said.
"This is the problem," he said. "Home rule is something we have in the state of Maine. It's very, very costly. Until the people of Maine decide we'd rather save tax dollars over home rule, it's going to be difficult."

Texto completo: Maine collects record amount of unused drugs
John Richardson
Maine set a new record Saturday for the amount of unused and expired medications turned in for safe disposal.
Mainers dropped off 14,410 pounds of prescription and over-the-counter drugs at collection sites around the state, according to Michael Wardrop, a U.S. Drug Enforcement Agent in Portland who coordinated the take-back event in Maine. The pills and other drugs were taken in two box trucks to a specially designated incinerator in Massachusetts, where they were destroyed earlier today.
The last collection produced 11,920 pounds in Maine, the most drugs per capita collected in any state.
"I'm pretty confident that again we will be number one per capita," Wardrop said. "If we saved one life, we did our due diligence."
The DEA sponsors the national drug take-back days to get opiate painkillers and other drugs out of medicine cabinets where they are available to teens and potential abusers. The take backs also reduce the amount of drugs being flushed down toilets and polluting waterways.
Some had expected the latest collection to generate fewer drugs because of the success of past efforts.
Wardrop attributed the new record amount to growing awareness about prescription drug abuse and about environmental damage, as well as an iincrease in the number of long-term nursing care facilities that participated.
"It is still alarming how much waste there is," Wardrop said. "It just goes to show it's not stopping. We are definitely not purging anything. It's an ongoing problem."

Gifford's "World's Best Chocolate" ice cream claimed the grand champion title for two years in a row at the World Dairy Expo, so perhaps it's no surprise that the Skowhegan-based company is now considering adding a recipe called "72 percent chocolate" to its repertoire.

2011 Press Herald file
The chocolatey frozen treat is one of the 20 or so flavors Gifford's will be inheriting from the "other" Gifford's it recently purchased -- Gifford's Ice Cream & Candy in Silver Spring, Md.
"It's a chocolate base, and it has a ton of chocolate chips and some other chocolate pieces in it," said Lindsay Gifford-Skilling, vice president of sales at the Maine Gifford's. "That's one we'll be evaluating."
The purchase of the Maryland company, founded in 1938, is an opportunity for the Maine-based Gifford's to expand into untapped territory, Gifford-Skillling said. The Maine company, which is family-owned but not related to the Maryland Gifford family, bought the Maryland company's trade name and assets so that it will be able to distribute its ice creams in the mid-Atlantic region, which includes Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, Delaware, West Virginia and the District of Columbia.
The Maryland Gifford's had offices in Silver Spring, but did not have any production facilities; the company contracted out the making of its ice cream to someone else.
The Maine Gifford's, founded in the early 1980s, has 30 full-time, year-round employees, and up to 100 in summer, when the company operates its five seasonal ice cream stands. It sells ice cream throughout New England, New York and New Jersey.
The Maryland Gifford's sold its products throughout the Maryand-D.C. area.
"Basically it's our next step as far as territory," Gifford-Skilling said. "Gifford's is looking to grow, and Maryland is the next logical state for us to go to, so it opens a huge market with millions of people to offer an award-winning premium product to that customer base. That's just a huge opportunity for us, and one to cut back on that confusion of there being two Gifford's. It can be very confusing for customers."
The Maine company makes about 60 different flavors and adds about eight new flavors a year, she said.
The family of John Gifford, the founder of the Maryland company, has provided the Maine business with original, handwritten recipes for his ice cream. The Maine Giffords are in the process of evaluating those recipes and deciding which ones to keep and which ones to tweak and add to their menu.
"We have to look at the sales, obviously, just as we do for our flavors, to see what makes sense and what doesn't make sense, and where is there room for us to offer a new flavor?" Gifford-Skilling said.

Texto completo: STATE COLLEGE, Pa. An unusually early and powerful nor'easter along the East Coast began dumping several inches of wet, heavy snow Saturday that weighed down or toppled leafy trees and power lines and combined with high winds to knock out power to hundreds of thousands.
Communities inland in mid-Atlantic states were getting hit hardest, with eastern Pennsylvania serving as the bull's-eye for the storm, said National Weather Service spokesman Chris Vaccaro. Some places got more than half a foot of snow, and towns near the Maryland-Pennsylvania border saw 10 inches fall.
More than 580,000 customers lost power from Maryland north through Connecticut, and utilities were bringing in crews from other states to help restore it. Officials had warned that the early storm would bring sticky snow on the heels of the week's warmer weather and could create dangerous conditions.
And the storm was expected to worsen as it swept north. The heaviest snowfall was forecast for later in the day into Sunday in the Massachusetts Berkshires, the Litchfield Hills in northwestern Connecticut, southwestern New Hampshire and the southern Green Mountains. Wind gusts of up to 50 mph were predicted especially along coastal areas.
This is more like a February-type situation, Vaccaro said.
The snow was difficult for business, too, said Gary Warn, an owner of the Hen House restaurant in Frostburg, Md.
Lunchtime was dead empty, he said, and he wasn't optimistic about dinner reservations.
As I'm looking out the window right now, the damage is already done. I don't know, he said Saturday afternoon.
The storm disrupted travel along the Eastern Seaboard. Several airports had hours-long delays Saturday, including Philadelphia's and two that serve New York City, Newark Liberty and Kennedy. The smaller airport in Teterboro, N.J., was briefly closed. Amtrak suspended service between Philadelphia and Harrisburg, Pa., and commuter trains in Connecticut and New York were delayed or suspended because of downed trees and signal problems.
Residents were urged to avoid travel altogether. Speed limits were reduced on bridges between New Jersey and Pennsylvania. A few roads closed because of accidents and downed trees and power lines, and more were expected, said Sean Brown, a spokesman for the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation.
Some said that even though they knew a storm was coming, the severity caught them by surprise.
This is absolutely a lot more snow than I expected to see today. I can't believe it's not even Halloween and it's snowing already, Carole Shepherd of Washington Township, N.J. said after shoveling her driveway.
The storm came on a busy weekend for many, with trick-or-treaters going door-to-door in search of Halloween booty, hunting season opening in some states and a full slate of college and pro football scheduled.
In eastern Pennsylvania, snow caused widespread problems. It toppled trees and a few power lines and led to minor traffic accidents, according to dispatchers. Allentown, expected to get 4 to 8 inches, is likely to break the city's October record of 2.2 inches on Halloween in 1925.
Philadelphia was seeing mostly rain, but what snow fell coated downtown roofs in white. The city was expected to get 1 to 3 inches, its first measurable October snow since 1979, with a bit more in some suburbs, meteorologist Mitchell Gaines said.
The last major widespread snowstorm to hit Pennsylvania this early was in 1972, said John LaCorte, a National Weather Service meteorologist in State College. It's going to be very dangerous, he said.
Southern New Jersey was soaked with heavy rains and winds that ranged from 20 to 35 mph, while northern communities awaited the arrival of 5 to 10 inches of snow. Scattered power outages were reported across the state, and Jersey Central Power & Light, which was heavily criticized for being too slow to restore power following Hurricane Irene, had hundreds of workers set to be deployed if needed.
Parts of New York saw a mix of snow, rain and slush that made for sheer misery at the Occupy Wall Street encampment in New York City, where drenched protesters hunkered down in tents and under tarps as the plaza filled with rainwater and melted snow.
Technically, tents are banned in the park, but protesters say authorities have been looking the other way, even despite a crackdown on generators that were keeping them warm.
I want to thank the New York Police Department, said 32-year-old protester Sam McBee, decked out in a yellow slicker and rain pants. We're not supposed to have tents. We're not supposed to have sleeping bags. You go to Atlanta, they don't have it. You go to Oakland, you don't have it. And we got it.
October snowfall is rare in New York, there had been just three October days with measurable snowfall in Central Park since record-keeping began 135 years ago, according to the National Weather Service. The fourth came Saturday, when about 1.3 inches had fallen by midafternoon, a record snowfall total for the month of October and the date itself.
Along the coast and in such cities as Boston, relatively warm water temperatures along the Atlantic seaboard could keep the snowfall totals much lower, meteorologist Bill Simpson said, with 1 to 3 inches of snowfall forecast along the I-95 corridor. Washington was expected to get just a dusting.
But October snowfall records could be broken in parts of southern New England, especially at higher elevations, National Weather Service meteorologist Bill Simpson said. The October record for southern New England is 7.5 inches in Worcester in 1979.
Rain and snow were due to begin falling on Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine during the day, with the heaviest snow falling overnight. Parts of southern Vermont could receive more than a foot.
The first measurable snow in New England usually falls in early December, and normal highs for late October are in the mid-50s.
But not everyone was lamenting the unofficial arrival of winter.
Two Vermont ski resorts, Killington and Mount Snow, started the ski season early by opening one trail each over the weekend, thanks to the recent snow and cold. Maine's Sunday River ski resort also opened for the weekend.

State House Bureau
Voting regulations, gambling and redistricting all will be before voters Nov. 8.

Here's a look at the ballot questions, the issues and the claims by supporters and opponents.
QUESTION 1
"Do you want to reject the section of Chapter 399 of the Public Laws of 2011 that requires new voters to register to vote at least two business days prior to an election?"
SUPPORTERS SAY
It's necessary to repeal the new state law because it's important to allow people to register to vote on Election Day. They say people who work more than one job will have difficulty finding time to register to vote. Maine has allowed same-day voter registration for 38 years and supporters say this has contributed to the state's traditionally high voter turnout.
OPPONENTS SAY
Maine is vulnerable to potential voter fraud because clerks don't have enough time to verify whether voters are legal residents. They point to inaccurate information in the state's voter registration system as proof that it is too easy in Maine for people to provide incomplete information to clerks. Examples of the inaccurate information include 178,000 registered voters shown to have registered on Jan. 1, 1850, and 1,452 active registrants listed as being 211 years old.
REALITY CHECK
The Maine Town & City Clerks Association is neither for nor against the ballot question. An investigation into potential voter fraud by Secretary of State Charlie Summers showed one instance of fraud among almost 500 names that he scrutinized. The investigation revealed that five college students voted in two states in the same year, but not in the same election.
Also, the ballot question may be a little confusing to some voters because it is a repeal of a state law. A "yes" vote means same-day voter registration will continue in Maine. A "no" vote means voters will be required to register at least two business days before an election.
QUESTION 2
"Do you want to allow a slot machine facility at a harness racing track in Biddeford or another community within 25 miles of Scarborough Downs, subject to local approval, and at a harness racing track in Washington County, with part of the profits from these facilities going to support specific state and local programs?"
SUPPORTERS SAY
Two companies with Maine ties, Ocean Properties and Scarborough Downs, want to build a "state-of-the-art harness racing and resort facility in Biddeford."
JOBS: The proposal will create more than 1,000 construction jobs and 500 permanent jobs in southern Maine. In Washington County, the Passamaquoddy Tribe wants to run a racino that tribal leaders say will bring needed jobs to the region.
COMMUNITY SUPPORT: Voters in Biddeford and Calais have already approved the projects, so people who live across the state should respect their decision.
FUNDING FOR MAINE: Proponents say the racino will generate funds for many important causes around the state.
OPPONENTS SAY
JOBS: Maine should not continue to expand gambling because the facilities will not bring the kind of high-quality jobs the state needs. Opponents do not question the number of jobs that could be generated, but say that they are not the kinds of jobs that will appeal to the young college graduates many hope to keep in Maine.
COMPETITION: Since voters have already approved a racino in Bangor and a casino in Oxford, opponents argue that the state could not support three additional gambling facilities, including a proposed casino in Lewiston on Question 3. Five gambling sites would be more than any other state in New England.
ADDICTION: They say gambling tears families apart and leads to addiction and alcoholism and that harness racing is inhumane.
REALITY CHECK
JOBS: Each site would be permitted to have up to 1,500 slot machines, although advertisements are focusing on jobs and horse racing. Nationally, jobs at casinos pay an average of $29,000 with a wide pay range depending on the job, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
FUNDS FOR MAINERS: The racinos will be required to give 39 percent of net income from slot machines to various causes, including harness racing purses, prescription drugs for the elderly, the state General Fund and Gambling Control Board, agricultural fairs, higher education scholarships, off-track betting operators, and host municipalities. Fiscal estimates prepared by the state for both facilities combined show the operators would have net income of $97 million, with the operator share of $59 million in the first year, and the state share at $38 million.
PAYOUTS: The state requires slot parlors to have a minimum payback percentage -- prizes paid out to players -- of 89 percent.
QUESTION 3
"Do you want to allow a casino with table games and slot machines in Lewiston, with part of the profits going to support specific state and local programs?"
SUPPORTERS SAY
DEVELOPMENT: Downtown Lewiston needs a casino as part of an overall effort to revitalize the city now that major industries have moved out. It's important to find a new use for Bates Mill No. 5, a massive vacant waterfront building.
JOBS: The project will bring construction jobs and permanent jobs to the area but they would not estimate how many.
OPPONENTS SAY
BUSINESS: A casino in downtown Lewiston may help the casino owners, but will not help surrounding businesses. People who visit casinos don't often visit other local businesses, but rather spend all their money at the casino. CasinosNo! points to Atlantic City, N.J.; Lawrenceburg, Ind., and Saratoga Springs, N.Y., as examples of places where new gambling facilities have not helped struggling areas.
JOBS: Opponents say that while the casino may bring new jobs to the area, existing businesses will suffer because people will spend all of their money at the casino.
REALITY CHECK
DEVELOPMENT: While the developers want to use the Bates Mill, they may put the casino elsewhere if they determine that it will be too expensive to rehabilitate the old building. They have also said they are looking for a temporary site somewhere in town so they can get up and running right away.
FUNDS FOR MAINERS: Casino owners would be required to give 1 percent of gross slot machine income to the state, plus 40 percent of net slot machine income would be distributed to various entities. Those include environmental causes, downtown revitalization, the host county and host municipality, transportation improvements, higher education, agricultural fairs, tourism, home-based care for the elderly, humane societies, harness racing purses, and meals on wheels. Estimates prepared by the state show the net slot income at $48 million, with the operator's share at $29 million and the state's share at $19 million.
PAYOUTS: The payback percentage for the slots at the facility would be required to be at least 89 percent, but the state does not set a payback minimum for table games.
QUESTION 4
"Do you favor amending the Constitution of Maine to change the years of redistricting the Maine Legislature, congressional districts and county commissioner districts after 2013 from 2023 and every 10th year thereafter to 2021 and every 10th year thereafter?"
SUPPORTERS SAY
It's important for Maine to have the same cycle for redistricting as other states.
OPPONENTS SAY
There are no known opponents.
REALITY CHECK
While the bill changes the redistricting cycle, it also requires support from two-thirds of lawmakers to approve new district lines. Democrats pointed out this change in September, when Republicans considered passing a new reapportionment plan by a simple majority. Ultimately, the two sides came to an 11th-hour agreement that produced nearly unanimous support.

While it's been 20 years since the Perfect Storm, Coast Guard crews are 'always waiting for the big one.'
By R.F. SHARP Special to the Maine Sunday Telegram
When the 1991 Halloween Nor'easter -- the "Perfect Storm" -- swept up the coast of New England 20 years ago, Ruben Colon was 13, living in San Juan, Puerto Rico, far away from Maine's unforgiving coastal waters.
[image removed] Caption:
A 25-foot response boat out of Coast Guard Station South Portland heads out to patrol Portland Harbor and Casco Bay on Oct. 22.
R.F. Sharp photos
Boatswain's Mates Second Class Ruben A. Colon, left, and Jon Gielarowski patrol Casco Bay on a 47-foot motor lifeboat out of South Portland on Oct. 22.
But now, as a boat coxswain for the Coast Guard, he knows that when the next big storm occurs, he and his crew will be on the front line, saving lives and property.
"We're a heavy-weather station," said Colon. "That's what we do."
Colon and his crew work out of Coast Guard Station South Portland, across the harbor from the bustle of the Portland waterfront. The station is part of Coast Guard Sector Northern New England, which is responsible for more than 5,000 miles of coastline.
The sector mounted dangerous rescue operations for the October 1991 storm that savaged the New England coast, sinking a fishing boat from Gloucester, Mass., with its crew on board. The storm was chronicled in a best-selling book and movie that cast a spotlight on Linda Greenlaw, the Maine swordfishing boat captain who rode out the storm.
The Coast Guard operates six rescue boat stations in Maine, one in New Hampshire and one on Lake Champlain. It launches an average of more than 600 search and rescue missions in the sector a year.
South Portland is home to vessels that include two 47-foot motor lifeboats, the workhorses of the Coast Guard's coastal rescue boat fleet. The almost unsinkable boats can weather hurricane-force winds and heavy seas. If the boat should capsize, it can right itself in less than 30 seconds with all equipment fully functional.
"They're built to withstand about as extreme conditions as people can withstand," said Lt. Nick Barrow, chief of the command center for Coast Guard Sector Northern New England.
The vessels are the ones that regularly respond to rescues in the rapidly changing conditions in Casco Bay.
"A mission might start out fairly easy," said Boatswain's Mate Second Class Jon Gielarowski, a former lobsterman from Brooklin. "But it can change quickly, and we have to adapt and overcome the new challenges."
Tides, weather and a host of other conditions can make any rescue difficult.
"Every case has its own challenges and personality," said Colon, recalling a rescue where rising tides called for quick decisions to keep a hunting party from being swept up and over a ledge to which they clung after their boat was smashed on the rocks.
Most rescues occur in the summer, when recreational boaters flock to the area. The numbers drop with the arrival of autumn.
"When winter comes, the number of search and rescue missions goes down," said Barrow, "but the consequences go up."
Should an unprotected person go in the water, he will rapidly succumb to hypothermia, and rough weather and chill waters can put the lives of both those in distress and their rescuers at risk.
Such concerns play a vital part in the complex judgment calls that are made by all involved in each search and rescue mission. In the back of everyone's mind is the knowledge that no one gets helped when the rescuers require help themselves.
"When it comes to putting boats in the water and launching aircraft, it's critically important that we manage risk," said Barrow.
An old motto of the U.S. Lifesaving Service -- a precursor to the modern Coast Guard -- was "you have to go out, but you don't have to come back."
Times have changed.
"You have to go out, and you have to come back, and you have to bring your boat and plane back with you because we're going to need them and you tomorrow," said Barrow.
Still, search and rescue crews will launch in situations that would leave most people shaking their heads and the Coast Guard's principle of on-scene initiative leaves many of these decisions in the hands of the rescue crews themselves, allowing them to judge the level of risk.
"We go out and take care of business," said Barrow. "We often accept high risk when there's high gain."
But it's not only real emergencies that challenge the crews.
One vexing situation for the search and rescue crews in Maine is the number of drifting kayaks and other small boats that get reported to the Coast Guard. Each drifting boat comes with the assumption that there is also a boater in the water, in need of help, until it can be proven otherwise.
That means that search and rescue crews are launched and sometimes aircraft are dispatched to aid in the search. The costs of such operations can reach many thousands of dollars. Too often it turns out that the boat was simply poorly secured and drifted off with a rising tide.
"So many times it's a false alarm," said Colon. "But when it's real, it's so satisfying."
Since the Coast Guard operates with limited resources, and boats and cutters might not be nearby in rescue situations, it will often work with the help of outside agencies, such as the Maine Marine Patrol, to get help on the scene as soon as possible.
Another tool in its arsenal is the Urgent Marine Information Broadcast, a radio call to all mariners in the area alerting them that there is a vessel in distress, where it might be located, and asking them to help, if possible.
Often professional fishing boats are first to arrive.
"It's a close community," said Colon. "Once we send out a call for help, some 50 percent of the time fishing boats get there first. It's pretty impressive when you see it."
For Colon and his crew, there is more to the day than waiting for a rescue call. Their missions also include port security, drug interdiction, enforcing fishing laws and responding to oil spills, to name just a few.
It means that a crew may go from an everyday safety inspection, to escorting a large cruise ship into Portland Harbor, to being called to respond to an overturned boat in Casco Bay.
"That's part of our multi-mission mandate," said Gielarowski. "We're jacks of all trades. One day you're doing fisheries inspections, the next you're escorting the first lady."
And while a newer version of the Perfect Storm hasn't hit yet, the crew of Coast Guard Station South Portland and its counterparts throughout New England are prepared for when -- not if -- the next major storm comes.
"You're always waiting for the big one," said Gielarowski.

CUMBERLAND - For the final time in a high school career filled with equal parts grace and success, Abbey Leonardi emerged -- alone, of course -- from the woods at Twin Brook Recreation Area and glided through a corridor of clapping cross country fans.

Abbey Leonardi of Kennebunk capped her awe-inspiring career by not just winning her fourth straight Class A title, but finishing more than a half-minute ahead of anyone else at Cumberland.
The Cheverus girls started as a pack up front and finished as a pack Saturday to win their third straight Class A state championship. The Stags finished with four runners in the top six.

GIRLS' STATE CHAMPIONS
INDIVIDUAL
CLASS A: Abbey Leonardi, Kennebunk
CLASS B: Brittany Bowman, Camden Hills
CLASS C: Carsyn Koch, Washburn
TEAM
CLASS A: Cheverus
CLASS B: Mt. Desert Island
CLASS C: Merriconeag
She wore long black sleeves, knee-high white socks and a look of quiet determination.
"When it did seem hard," she said later, "I just had to remember that it would work out well."
For an unprecedented fourth straight year, the Class A cross country state meet worked out well for Leonardi. She won by more than a half-minute Saturday under chilly, overcast skies to become the first Maine schoolgirl with four state titles to her name.
Only Maranacook's Scott Roberts, who won each Class B state title between 1982 and 1985, similarly ran the table.
"Even though I'm running and I'm winning the state title, there's a lot more than just me going into it," said Leonardi, who finished in 18 minutes, 27.19 seconds a week after setting the course record of 18:05.59. "My family, my coach, my friends, my teachers, my school, the community, everyone. I'm really thankful for how everyone has helped me along the way."
Lawrence junior Erzsebet Nagy was the Class A runner-up. She finished a fraction under 19 minutes, the only schoolgirl to do so besides Leonardi out of the 300 who competed in three classes Saturday.
Camden Hills sophomore Brittany Bowman, who hadn't won a race all season, came up big when it mattered most. She claimed the Class B title with a time of 19:12.19. Waterville junior Bethanie Brown was 17 seconds behind, followed by two-time Class B state champion Abby Mace, a Maranacook senior.
In Class C, Washburn sophomore Carsyn Koch defended her title with a 30-second victory over Lisbon senior Meagan Thomas.
Cheverus in Class A, Mt. Desert Island in Class B and Merriconeag in Class C each won the team titles to qualify for the New England championships Nov. 12 in Rhode Island. Joining them will be Massabesic, Mt. Ararat and Camden Hills, as well as any individual who finished with a time among the top 25 of the day.
The Class A title was the third straight for Cheverus, which placed four runners in the top six following a week of uncertainty after a closer-than-expected regional meet in which former New England champion Emily Durgin quit midrace, overcome by problems related to anemia.
On Saturday, Durgin wore a wristwatch and old spikes, forgot about trying to stay with Leonardi and simply made sure she finished.
"The whole thing with my anemia is if I go out fast, after a mile and a half I'm gassed," Durgin said. "So I figured, stay in the pack. I was just really relaxed and did it for the team because I really wanted us to win."
Durgin wound up third, four seconds behind Nagy, and was immediately followed by teammates Fiona Hendry, Kiera Murray and Shannon Conley, who staggered across the line and received medical attention after the race.
"She totally blanked out at the top of the hill (about 80 meters from the finish)," said Cheverus Coach Valerie Guillet. "Her mother was there and saw her eyes going sideways and going back. It's almost like she passed out at the top of the hill and just kept going. These kids are tough."
Mt. Ararat edged Massabesic for second place, 92-93.
In Class B, MDI rebounded from a one-point regional loss to Camden Hills with a 16-point win, packing five runners within 14 seconds, all among the top 16.
In Class C, Merriconeag didn't have anyone among the top 15 but still edged Washburn by eight points for its second straight title.

Texto completo: Black Bears slog past Villanova
Neither rain, nor sleet, nor snow can slow Maine's perfect conference season in a 41-25 road win.
By VINCE DiGREGORIO Special to the Telegram
VILLANOVA, Pa. - It turned out the University of Maine football team had to compete against multiple opponents besides Villanova on Saturday. There was rain, snow and sleet, and the Black Bears played through it all to take a 41-25 win.
[sidebar]
UP NEXT
WHO: Towson at Maine (7-1, 5-0 CAA)
WHEN: 12:30 p.m. Saturday
Quarterback Warren Smith passed for two touchdowns and ran for another to lead the Black Bears before several hundred hardy souls at Villanova Stadium.
The gametime temperature was 35 degrees with a mixture of rain and sleet and wind gusts reaching 24 mph. Despite attempts to clear the field prior to kickoff, the field was still covered with snow as the game began.
"Just real happy to come here and get a win, especially under the (weather) conditions," Maine Coach Jack Cosgrove said. "It was a real challenge. I commend the guys for going 60 minutes. It was an important win for us. It keeps us in first place."
Smith completed 17 of 22 passes for 251 yards and rushed for 74 yards on 10 carries to give Maine (7-1, 5-0 CAA) a 5-0 start in conference play for the first time since 1989.
"Our quarterback threw the ball very well today," Cosgrove said. "(He) continues to grow and impress and make plays for us. I thought he was very, very accurate for the most part and smart with his throws."
The Bears held a 13-6 lead to start the second half and seized control of the game after Villanova kicker Mark Hamilton missed his second short-distance field-goal attempt of the game, hitting the left upright from 26 yards.
Maine took over on its own 20, and on the first play Smith used a play-action fake and found receiver Arthur Williams wide open for an 80-yard touchdown pass that gave the Bears a 20-6 lead.
"We just had a good play-action fake," Smith said. "Arthur comes across the middle and there was a big opening. The linebackers really bit on the run. I didn't throw it as hard as I can, just made sure he caught it because he was wide open."
Smith then scored on a 29-yard run with 4:31 left in the third quarter to give Maine a commanding 28-6 lead after backup quarterback Chris Treister ran in a 2-point conversion.
Villanova (1-8, 0-6) tried to rally as QB Chris Polony hooked up with Dorian Wells on a 60-yard TD pass that cut the deficit to 28-12, but the Wildcats could get no closer as the teams alternated touchdowns in the fourth quarter.
The Bears had TD runs of 2 yards and 1 yard by Pushaun Brown and David Hood, respectively, while Polony threw two TD passes to Mikey Reynolds.
Maine's victory sets up a first-place showdown with Towson on Saturday afternoon at Alfond Stadium.
After Maine's opening drive stalled, the Black Bears defense capitalized on a Villanova turnover to set up the first score of the game.
Bears safety Trevor Coston intercepted a pass by Polony and returned it 25 yards to the Villa-nova 36. Two plays later, Smith hit a wide open Maurice McDonald with a 33-yard touchdown pass to give Maine a 7-0 lead with 9:24 left in the first quarter.
Villanova had a chance to get on the scoreboard on the next series, but Hamilton was wide left on a 22-yard chip shot. It was his first miss after making 14 straight field goals.
The Wildcats would eventually score with 4:08 left in the second quarter as Austin Medley ran it in from 5 yards out, but the point-after was blocked by Bears linebacker Troy Russell, preserving Maine's lead at 7-6.
Smith finished the first half 11 of 15 passing for 102 yards, while McDonald had seven receptions for 92 yards.
"(The footing) wasn't that bad for me," Smith said. "They shoveled the hashes, so I tried to stay near the hashes."

Texto completo: Maine turns to defense, earns win
The Providence goalie turns stout, but the Black Bears fend off the Friars to win, 3-1.
By Rachel Lenzi rlenzi@mainetoday.com
Staff Writer
ORONO - The University of Maine men's hockey team didn't cling with desperation to a one-goal lead. Instead, the Black Bears protected it through the better part of a 3-1 win over Providence.
Saturday at Alfond Arena, junior defenseman Matt Mangene gave the Black Bears a 2-1 lead 23 seconds into the second period but from that point on, the Black Bears couldn't find a way to beat Providence goalie Alex Beaudry.
Instead, the Black Bears had to defend their lead with poise and confidence.
"We played from the D-zone," Mangene said. "We played smart and hard and made sure we got pucks out, and we stuck to our team systems, which is a big thing. We made sure we did that for a full 60 minutes."
Mangene's goal was one of five shots the Black Bears put on Beaudry (25 saves) in the second period, and Beaudry kept Maine from widening its lead in the first six minutes of the third, making eight saves.
The Black Bears (3-2-1, 3-1 Hockey East) killed off a pair of penalties in a stretch of seven minutes -- an elbowing penalty against Will O'Neill at 7:34 and a tripping penalty against Adam Shemansky at 11:35.
Finally, the Black Bears withstood an offensive push by the Friars in the final three minutes of regulation, after Providence (2-3-1, 2-2) pulled Beaudry for a sixth skater.
An apparent goal by Andy Balysky with 54.1 seconds left was waved off, as officials ruled on the ice that the net had been dislodged, and Maine goalie Dan Sullivan (26 saves) made four saves in the final 1:16 before Klas Leidermark ensured the win with an empty-net goal with 1.2 seconds left in the game.
"He wasn't rattled," Maine Coach Tim Whitehead said of Sullivan. "He had a lot of confidence and I liked his presence in net.
"He was composed, strong and didn't get rattled, and was good in scrambled. And he helped us out."
Adam Shemansky gave Maine a 1-0 lead at 10:55 of the first. Less than two minutes later, Damian Cross caught Sullivan well out of position and shot from the left circle into an open net to tie the game on a power-play goal.
Mangene's first goal of the season gave Maine a 2-1 lead 23 seconds into the second, and Maine was able to maintain its lead despite being outshot 13-11 in the third period.
"It was one of those nights where we were fighting the puck a lot, but I thought our guys did a good job of battling through it," Providence Coach Nate Leaman said. "We had some chances in the third. "... It was a good sign for them to respond from a tough loss last night and come out like that."

Resumen: "The variation was huge," said Butch Roberts, a technician at the National Weather Service in Gray. 4:14 p.m.: 5.2 inches of snow sets Portland October record There are still about 103,801 homes and businesses, mostly in the state's southern counties, without power. The storm, which dumped up to 17 inches in interior York and Cumberland counties, dropped up to 2 feet in the Berkshires in Massachusetts and 22 inches in Concord, N.H. The snow is not expected to stick around long because the ground is warm and temperatures should warm up as the week progresses, said Roberts.

POWER OUT?
Central Maine Power outages may be reported by calling 1-800-696-1000
Central Maine Power Co. continues to make progress in restoring electricity to customers who lost service during Saturday night's record-breaking snowstorm.
About 41,000 customers remain without service, down from a peak of about 145,000 this morning, according to a news release. A total of 207,000 homes and businesses lost service at some point during the storm.
While some emergency power crews will be working overnight, customers who have not had service restored by 10 tonight will likely remain without power through the night, said CMP spokesman John Carroll.
CMP expects to restore service to nearly all of its customers by late Monday night. The only exceptions will be where damage was particularly widespread -- in many York County communities and scattered in parts of Sagadahoc and Lincoln Counties in Maine 's Midcoast.
These are the remaining customer outages by county: York 20,560; Lincoln 5,275; Cumberland 4,510; Sagadahoc 3,110; Androscoggin 2,867; Kennebec 1,693; Franklin 1,238; Knox 939; Oxford 508; Somerset 224; Waldo 82; Penobscot 24; Hancock 11.
7:20 p.m.: 76,000 remain without power after early nor'easter
About 76,000 Mainers remain without power this evening after a record-setting, pre-Halloween snowstorm downed power lines and trees across the region Saturday night.
Central Maine Power Co. reported that more than 207,000 customers lost power during the early nor'easter, mostly in York and Cumberland counties, with a peak of nearly 145,000 customers without power on Sunday morning.
CMP crews worked through the night and today dealing with blown transformers, snapped lines and downed tree limbs.
They were assisted by private contractors and crews called in from Canada, said company spokesman John Carroll. They have restored much of the backbone of the power system, including all hospitals and other critical facilities.
"But it is likely to be several more days before our crews reach many customers on secondary roads and in rural areas," Carroll said.
The storm set records in Portland, where 5.2 inches made it the largest single snowfall on record in October, according to the National Weather Service in Gray. The previous record of 3.6 inches was set on Oct. 27, 1962, and repeated on Oct. 22, 1969.
Portland's snowfall also set a new record for the month, outpacing the previous record of 3.8 inches in October 1969.
The storm socked interior locations and spared coastal areas, where relatively warm ocean waters kept much of the precipitation in the form of rain. Accumulations ranged from 20 inches in North Acton to 2 inches in Brunswick.
"The variation was huge," said Butch Roberts, a technician at the National Weather Service in Gray.

The early snowstorm caused widespread power outages and set weather records in at least Portland.
The 5.2 inches of snow recorded in Portland overnight made it the biggest single snowfall in October. The previous record of 3.6 inches was set on Oct. 27, 1962 and Oct. 22, 1969, said the National Weather Service in Gray.
The total snow fall for the month of October in Portland also set a record at 5.2 inches, outpacing the previous record of 3.8 inches in October 1969.
As of 2:30 today, there were still about 103,801 homes and businesses, mostly in the state's southern counties, without service. That's down from up a high of 145,000 earlier today.
Most of the outages are in Cumberland County (18,501) and York County (34,879).
The storm, which is now winding down, socked interior locations while coastal areas were spared.
"The variation was huge," said Butch Roberts, hydro meteorological technician at the National Weather Service in Gray.
The storm, which dumped up to 17 inches in interior York and Cumberland counties, dropped up to 2 feet in the Berkshires in Massachusetts and 22 inches in Concord, N.H.
The snow is not expected to stick around long because the ground is warm and temperatures should warm up as the week progresses, said Roberts. Skies should clear this afternoon with temperatures in the 40s. Sunny skies and high temperatures in the 50s are expected through Thursday.
Power outages had knocked out some street lights, such as Woodford's Street at Stevens Avenue in Portland but the storm has caused no major accidents so far, reported Portland Police and Maine State Police.
Much of Westbrook was without power this morning but no traffic accidents had been reported, said Westbrook Police. Several streets were closed down during the night due to fallen power lines and trees but by 10 a.m. this morning only Pierce Street remained closed.
About 80 streets were without power in Saco this morning but Camp Ellis on the coast, a frequent site of flooding, was unscathed by the storm, Saco Police said.
Ogunquit had widespread outages this morning and three minor traffic accidents during the storm.
York Police said there are scattered power outages throughout town. During the worst of the storm they received calls about eight blown power transformers. York Police said trick or treating has been moved from tonight to Monday from to 4 to 8 p.m.
Most of Kittery is without power as the town waits for Central Maine Power crews to show up, said Kittery Police who have received hundreds of calls from residents about trick or treating. It is still scheduled for tonight, police said.
Service on the Amtrak Downeaster trains 690 (6 a.m. from Portand) and 691 (8:50 a.m. from Boston) was canceled this morning. Other trains were to run as scheduled.
This morning Scarborough emergency workers were dealing with downed trees and power lines in the Route 1 area and northern part of town but no serious traffic accidents had been reported.
Lebanon Rescue Chief Samantha Cole said rescue workers are checking on the welfare of residents with known medical conditions who are without power. She also rescheduled her department's Halloween open house from tonight to 5 p.m. Monday at the town's rescue station on Carl Broggi Highway.

Texto completo:   WALL 54 TOMS RIVER SOUTH 35
WALLThere was always a goal Wall senior quarterback Steve Cluley had never reached in his high school career until Friday night.
"I've always wanted to break one long run in my career," Cluley said. "Tonight I got two."
Cluley rushed for 132 yards and three touchdowns including scoring runs of 67 and 35 yards as the Crimson Knights, No. 3 in the Asbury Park Press Top 10 roared to a 20-point lead in the first quarter en route to a 54-35 Shore Conference nondivisional victory over Toms River South.
The 6-foot-3, 206 pound Cluley also threw for 151 yards and two scores.
Wall (7-0) is off to its best start since it won 10 in a row to begin its 2002 NJSIAA Central Jersey Group III title run.
"That's awesome," said Cluley, who said he has scholarship offers from Monmouth and Albany and has drawn interest from James Madison, Maine, New Hampshire, Colgate, Syracuse and Connecticut.
"Until I got to high school I had never even been on a winning Pop Warner team," he said.
Toms River South (1-6) cut a 27-7 first-quarter deficit to 27-21 with with 1:10 remaining in the first half on a two-yard TD run by from sophomore Darius Hart.
It took Wall 43 seconds to answer, with Cluley blasting 35 yards through the middle for a 33-21 lead at halftime.
"It was a quarterback power," Cluley said. "We knew we had to punch it in before the half. We knew they had the ball after halftime. We scored pretty quick, quicker than I thought."
"It was ugly at first but we're learning," said Toms River South first-year coach Ron Signorino Jr.
His son, junior quarterback Trevor Signorino, rushed for 83 yards and threw for 177 yards and two touchdowns, including a 16-yard strike to senior Anthony Mannato with five seconds remaining.
"We're not there yet, we're in the right direction," Signorino Jr. said. "We eventually want to get where (Wall coach) Chris (Barnes) and his staff is at with their program. We need time. It's almost as if the games get in the way of our practices."

PORTLAND - MaineToday Media CEO Richard L. Connor announced his resignation from the company Friday and will step down on Dec. 31.

Richard Connor
Dale Duncan, MaineToday president since July, also resigned, effective Friday.
MaineToday, which owns The Portland Press Herald/Maine Sunday Telegram, The Kennebec Journal in Augusta, the Morning Sentinel in Waterville and the Coastal Journal, will be managed by an interim team during the search for Connor's successor.
In the media release, Connor said he "led a significant transformation of this company."
He noted that MaineToday recently reported the first increase in paid circulation in five years, and that the Maine Press Association named The Portland Press Herald the Best Daily Newspaper in Maine two weeks ago. In addition, Connor said, the company revamped its websites and online products and launched the MaineToday Digital division two months ago.
"Now the company needs to leverage the new foundation into the next phase," he said. "After four years of work with a schedule that has been around the clock ... it's time for change for me personally, my family, and for the company. I remain a significant individual investor in the company and I believe in its future."
Peter Brodsky, MaineToday Media board chair, said in the statement that the board will immediately begin seeking Connor's successor.
"We will be recruiting leadership for these properties with strong ties to emerging media technologies that continue to shape the future of this industry. Rich Connor's long experience in the newspaper industry provided a critical start to the reshaping of these newspapers," said Brodsky. "Future management will build on that foundation. MaineToday Media looks forward to continuing its role as the leading source of news and quality journalism in Maine."
Brodsky is a former employee at Dallas-based HM Capital Partners, a major MaineToday investor.
Connor said he will assist with the leadership transition in coming months.
Scott Wasser, executive editor of The Portland Press Herald/Maine Sunday Telegram, said he will miss Connor's leadership.
"I told the newsroom when I first got here, two-and-a-half years ago, that Rich was the best boss I ever had. That never changed," he said. "We will continue to do the great journalism that (Connor) brought here."
Portland Newspaper Guild president Tom Bell said in a letter to members that Connor improved the paper's quality and community relations, and stabilized circulation.
"But that is not enough. We must build on that success and deliver news and services on platforms other than newspapers, and we now need a digital-savvy leader who can take us to the next level," said Bell, adding that the union will soon finish negotiating a new contract.
"The union is committed to helping the company remain successful. At this time of transition and uncertainty, we must be flexible, but our strength and commitment is also a source of stability for our readers and advertisers, our company and our work force," he said.
An investment group led by Connor, a Bangor native, purchased the company in June 2009 from The Seattle Times Co.
Since then, the company centralized printing, moved to new offices and, weeks ago, announced a restructuring that included 38 layoffs and voluntary severance of 23 employees.
Former Maine Gov. John Baldacci praised Connor for keeping The Portland Press Herald "an independent Maine paper, not part of a national franchise."
"I think he stabilized (the company in) a very difficult economy and during a challenging time in the newspaper business," Baldacci said.
Alan Baker, owner and publisher of Bar Harbor's Mount Desert Islander and The Ellsworth American, called Connor a "breath of fresh air" for The Portland Press Herald.
"I thought he was good for the Maine newspaper industry because he turned the (Portland Press Herald) around. Most people I know think the paper is much more interesting under his leadership," Baker said.
"I don't know anyone in this industry that has worked as hard as he worked in the last three or four years," Baker added.
Chris Hall, senior vice president of the Portland Regional Chamber, said he was "surprised and saddened" by the departure of Connor, a "very generous supporter" of the chamber.
Connor also sits on the board of the affiliated Portland Community Chamber.
Hall recalled a speech Connor made about media challenges at a September 2009 event.
"He was taking up a challenge many people weren't sure he could meet," said Hall. "Much to people's happiness, we still have a paper, and I give him credit for stepping up and being a leader."
Connor will also step down from his positions as CEO of Impressions Media and editor and publisher of The Times Leader, the paper reported Friday.
Former President Duncan said he resigned because the "owners want new leadership."
Duncan, who is former publisher of The Indianapolis Star and joined MaineToday in 2010 as a contractor, said he enjoyed his time with the company, particularly overseeing the 2010 election coverage.
He also praised the professionals at the company, including Kennebec Journal and Morning Sentinel staff.
Duncan described the four months as president as a "challenge." In that time the company launched MaineToday Digital, hired a new chief financial officer and cut expenses during a difficult revenue environment.
"The organization responded well," Duncan said.
"And because of the steps we made in the last six months, the organization will be fine in the near term while it deals with a rapidly changing business model."

Brian Flynn's goal in overtime gives the Black Bears a 5-4 victory over Providence.

Staff Writer
ORONO - Positioned in front of the goal, Brian Flynn felt someone grab his stick as he reached for a pass. He didn't give up on the play. Instead, the senior center wheeled around, reached back to pick up the loose puck and flung a shot on net after his knees hit the ice.
[sidebar]
TODAY'S GAME
WHO: Maine (2-2-1, 2-1 Hockey East) vs. Providence (2-2-1, 2-1)
WHEN: 7 p.m.
WHERE: Alfond Arena, Orono
TELEVISION: WPME (Time Warner Channel 17)
It was the last shot Friday night at Alfond Arena. Flynn's goal with 2:10 left in overtime gave Maine a 5-4 Hockey East win over Providence.
"I think it deflected off one of their guys and Joey (Diamond) got it to me," Flynn said. "It got caught in my feet and a guy grabbed my stick, and I couldn't really make a play on it. Then I turned around, reached back and kind of ... well, I really don't know how that happened."
Flynn's goal ended a game that included two goals reviewed on video by referees and a stretch in which the teams nearly traded three goals in 46 seconds - a potential go-ahead goal by Maine was waved off with six minutes left in regulation.
Maine (2-2-1, 2-1 Hockey East) appeared to take a 5-4 lead when Spencer Abbott tucked in a loose puck at the crease. But officials congregated to review video and ruled that Maine's forwards had impeded Providence goalie Alex Beaudry (24 saves).
"Each time we scored, it seemed like they came right back and scored a goal," Flynn said. "On that one, I thought it was going to be a goal. We jumped back, stuck with it and worked hard, and it really paid off."
In the final 2:12 of regulation, the Black Bears couldn't convert a power-play opportunity. Then, after Providence took the first three shots in overtime against Black Bears goalie Martin Ouellette (24 saves), Flynn scored.
"We missed an empty net in overtime and they hit their empty net," Providence Coach Nate Leaman said. "That's kind of the way the game was going.
"It was a heck of a one-on-one battle that their player (Flynn) won."
Chris Rooney gave Providence (2-2-1, 2-1) a 1-0 lead 3:09 into the game on a shot from the right side of the crease.
With 3:10 left in the period and the teams skating four-on-four, Maine's Adam Shemansky won a faceoff and dropped the puck back to Mike Cornell, who beat Beaudry with a wrist shot from the top of the slot.
On a goal that stood after video review, Joey Diamond gave Maine a 2-1 lead at 8:07 of the second when he pushed a bouncing puck past Beaudry at the top of the crease. Rob Maloney then beat Ouellette to tie he game at 13:07, finishing a two-on-one rush.
Three minutes later, Diamond gave the Black Bears a 3-2. But Stefan Demopoulos tied the game at 10:06 of the third.
Maine's Kyle Beattie and Providence's Steven Shamanski traded goals shortly before Abbott's disallowed goal.
"The big part of the game for us is that we kept our cool," Maine Coach Tim Whitehead said. "We faced some adverse situations and we found a way to be one goal better."

Texto completo: Special education training to get boost
By SUSAN MCMILLAN Kennebec Journal
AUGUSTA - More than one in six Maine children require special education services, but only one in eight teachers working with them is fully certified.
Maine will use a five-year, $3.35 million federal grant, announced Friday, to try to fix that. The grant aims to improve training programs and increase the number of highly qualified special education teachers, said Jan Breton, federal program coordinator at the Maine Department of Education.
"There's a shortage of special educators across the country," Breton said. "So what happens is that a school system has to have a teacher, and they will find the best teacher that they can possibly find, but sometimes that person is not fully certified as a special education teacher.
"They may have a teaching degree and just need a course or two. Sometimes it's more than a few courses."
Maine had 34,425 special education students in 2007 - 17.7 percent of total enrollment.
Last year, there were 4,072 special education personnel, 12.5 percent of whom were not fully certified. Hancock County had the highest percentage of special educators needing additional certification, 38 percent.
The fact that Maine's teacher salaries are lower than those in nearby states may contribute to the shortage, Breton said.
The Maine Department of Education will work with the University of Maine System and other institutions in the state to develop a long-range plan for providing the training such teachers need.
The state also will have to partner with institutions in Massachusetts, because no one in Maine provides training in two specialties with particular shortages - teachers of visually impaired students and those who teach students with orientation and mobility needs.
The grant money will also go toward increasing the number of special education students in regular classrooms, helping teachers adapt their instruction to the new common core standards and training teachers to help students develop effective postsecondary plans. Finding instructors for students with autism is also a challenge.
"The numbers of kids that are diagnosed on the autism spectrum is just rising all across the country, and Maine hasn't been exempt from that," Benton said. "We're going to put some money into providing some support and training to teachers who are working with children on the spectrum."
Augusta schools Special Education Director Donna Madore said the number of special needs children in the district has declined with overall enrollment. But the needs of today's students are more significant.
When the district advertises for a special education teacher, Madore said they do not get as many experienced highly qualified applicants as she would like.
The turnover rate is also high.
"I think we have a shortage because it's hard work. It's intensive," Madore said. "And people may not stay in that field for any length of time."
Augusta provides mentors to new special education teachers, especially ones who come in with less experience.
Madore said she was happy to hear there will be more support at the state level.
Maine will contribute $27,000 of existing state and federal resources to supplement the State Personnel Development Grant from the U.S. Department of Education's Office of Special Education Programs.
It's not yet clear when the money will become available, Benton said.

Texto completo: Medical marijuana a 'problem' for police
Maine says medicinal use is legal, but federal law does not - putting jails and police in a quandary about possession that so far defies any solution.
By David Hench dhench@mainetoday.com
Staff Writer
Although Maine has legalized the medicinal use of marijuana, it is still viewed as contraband when it crosses the secure perimeter of the state's jails and prisons, and it remains illegal in the eyes of the federal government.
[image removed] Caption:
Sheriff Kevin Joyce
Dealing with medical marijuana when a prescribed patient is arrested for another offense poses a sticky legal issue for Maine law enforcement. Several sheriffs and jail administrators say they want no part of the problem and have left it in the hands of arresting officers.
"I've tried to insulate us. I'm not going to be the only one collecting medical marijuana," said Cumberland County Sheriff Kevin Joyce, who oversees the state's busiest jail.
Storing the marijuana in jail is a problem because jails lack secure evidence lockers. But jail officials are more concerned with how they would return the prescribed marijuana to a released inmate without technically running afoul of federal laws that prohibit dispensing marijuana even if the state allows it.
Joyce recently informed police chiefs in Cumberland County that the jail would not accept medical marijuana with inmates' property, which can include other medication that is transferred to the infirmary. "We're going to give it back to the officer and they have to destroy it."
Or not. Police agencies haven't yet decided. Acting Portland Police Chief Michael Sauschuck said his department's lawyer is studying the issue.
"It's certainly an interesting problem that puts us in the middle of state law and federal law, so we're currently looking at all our legal options before we make a final policy decision," Sauschuck said.
Col. Mark Westrum, administrator for the Two Bridges Regional Jail serving Lincoln and Sagadahoc counties and chairman of the state Board of Corrections, was the first jail administrator to encounter the problem about six weeks ago.
An inmate was brought in for violating probation and among his possessions was a jar of marijuana. The marijuana was taken to the jail's infirmary, where it could be stored securely. In a few days, the pungent aroma quickly spread through that area of the jail.
Westrum said he was faced with a dilemma: Violate federal law by returning the marijuana or violate state law by destroying it.
He opted for the latter. Neither the inmate nor anyone else has formally objected.
Even though the marijuana is used medicinally, state jails are not obliged to provide it and it is still illegal inside the jail because of exemptions in state law, according to a letter from Assistant Attorney General Diane Sleek.
Westrum concedes it may be unlikely that the U.S. attorney would prosecute law enforcement for giving medical marijuana back to someone who is entitled under state law to possess it -- in October, the Obama administration announced it would not prosecute medical marijuana users and caregivers, but that might not hold true in a different political climate.
"Administrations change. Rules change. I would like to think we would not be prosecuted for giving somebody's medical marijuana back to them, but who knows?" Westrum said. "I'd rather take my chances and see what the state of Maine is going to do."
In cases where a person is arrested at home, the marijuana can be left there. Police officials have suggested returning the marijuana to licensed dispensaries, though that would not work if a person's supplier is a registered caregiver.
Roy McKinney, director of the Maine Drug Enforcement Agency, said his agents have come across suspects who have permission to possess medical marijuana. In those cases, he said agents have seized the illegal drugs -- including as much as 10 pounds of marijuana -- while leaving behind two and a half ounces, the legal maximum for a registered medicinal user.
According to a state report, as of March 16, there were 1,100 patients who had been issued registry identification cards -- or had them pending -- which allow them to possess medical marijuana.
Like most sheriffs in the state, Joyce not only oversees a jail, he has deputies who enforce the law and must abide by the new policy.
"What I've advised patrol deputies is if someone who has medical marijuana can secure it at their residence, then do that. It makes it much simpler," he said. "Otherwise, we are going to have to take it for safekeeping, then try to figure out how we deal with giving it back or not."

TRAIL OPENING
A CEREMONY marking the opening of a new section of the Sebago to the Sea Trail starts at 10 a.m. today at Waste Management, 2000 Forest Ave., Portland, across from the Riverton Trolley Park. There will be a ribbon cutting and refreshments, followed by guided hour-long walks on the trail.
They're difficult for a passing motorist to detect, but that's beside the point. They're intended for slower moving traffic.
Today, the second of three sections of the Sebago to the Sea Trail officially opens.
About 80 trail signs guide pedestrians and bicyclists on the added 13-mile stretch along riverbanks, city roads and wooded walkways, from Route 202 in South Windham to the Maine Turnpike in Falmouth.
The first eight miles of the trail, starting at Sebago Lake in Standish, opened a year ago. The final six-mile stretch, from the turnpike to Portland's East End Beach, is scheduled to open next fall.
The work of clearing and connecting the trail is happening quickly, according to the people behind the project. But the process of scouting a route and finding the funding for their vision -- to connect Sebago Lake to Casco Bay -- began in 2007.
For those who have worked on the trail since its inception, the latest milestone is significant.
"We can see the end of the trail for the first time," said Will Plumley, chair of the Presumpscot River Watershed Coalition.
A ceremony scheduled for 10 a.m. today will mark the opening of the new section. After a ribbon-cutting at Waste Management on Forest Avenue in Portland, guides will lead hour-long walks along the trail.
About five miles of the trail along the Mountain Division Rail Line won't be open for a couple of weeks. That's when Maine Department of Transportation construction crews plan to clear their equipment away from the rail bed they've been reconstructing.
For now, the only way to follow the new route from Windham to Westbrook is by paddling down the Presumpscot.
Also within the next month, eight kiosks with trail maps and information will be built along the new stretch.
One will go up by the river walk in Westbrook, part of a loop around the city's downtown.
Tania Neuschafer, the Sebago to the Sea project coordinator, said the trail is different from most in Maine because it weaves in and out of urban streets and remote forests.
Much of the trail, including sidewalks along the road and many paths through the woods, didn't have to be cleared or constructed, said Nan Cumming, director of Portland Trails, a partner in the project.
Creating the Sebago to the Sea Trail mostly involved widening paths, laying gravel and building bridges over soggy ground, she said.
And, of course, there are the signs.
Neuschafer said she doesn't expect most people who use the trail will follow the signs for the entire 21 miles. Still, she said, knowing the trail connects six communities makes walking any part of it special.
"(You feel) you're part of this really unique regional network," she said.
Plumley said he, too, gets sentimental when he thinks about it -- that, for the first time, someone can set out from Sebago Lake without a map and follow a continuous footpath to Falmouth.
"There's just something cool about that," he said.

Texto completo: Man sentenced to 21 days for bottle redemption fraud
The prosecutor says the jail time sends a message about the consequences of such large-scale fraud.
By Leslie Bridgers lbridgers@pressherald.com
Staff Writer
ALFRED - A former Kittery redemption center owner was sentenced Friday to 21 days in jail for stealing more than $10,000 from beverage manufacturers and distributors by refunding cans and bottles from out of state, according to his attorney.
Thomas Woodard, who ran Green Bee Redemption, was convicted in August in the state's first criminal trial over bottle redemption fraud. His wife, Megan Woodard, was tried at the same time on the same charge in the same York County courtroom, but a separate jury found her not guilty.
Thomas Woodard is free on bail while he appeals the conviction to the Maine Supreme Judicial Court, said his attorney, Thomas Hallett.
In the Woodards' four day trial, Assistant Attorney General Leanne Robbin contended that the couple had helped set up satellite redemption centers at an indoor sports complex in Derry, N.H., and at their employee's home in Gloucester, Mass.
More than 100,000 beverage containers from both states, which have different bottle laws than Maine, were redeemed at Green Bee between 2008 and 2010, Robbin said.
She said that arrangement allowed the sports complex owner and the redemption center employee to collect refunds that they were not owed, because they had not been paid when the beverages were originally purchased.
The motive for the Woodards, she said, was to collect a handling fee from distributors that was 3 or 3.5 cents per container, depending on the brand of beverage.
Maine's bottle law requires customers to pay 5-cent deposits when they buy most canned and bottled drinks. Wine and liquor carry 15-cent deposits.
In Massachusetts, deposits are paid only on beer, malt and carbonated beverages, but not on water, juice or sports drinks. There are no deposits on containers purchased in New Hampshire.
At the time of the trial, Robbin said bottle redemption fraud is prevalent along the state's border, where it's easy for Maine and New Hampshire residents to purchase their beverages in New Hampshire and return them for refunds in Maine.
According to the Maine Beverage Association, about $8 million in bottle redemption fraud occurs annually in the state.
Robbin said during the trial that she hadn't pursued such a case before because she never felt there was enough evidence to convict for a significant crime.
The evidence against the Woodards, she said, was "the strongest ... we have in the most egregious case we know of at the time."
Although Robbin asked for Woodard to be sentenced to 90 days in jail, she said that "any jail time is significant" because of the message it sends about the consequences of large-scale bottle redemption fraud.
Robbin said she believes the high-profile trial has already had an effect on the fraudulent activity near the Maine border. She said she's heard from the state Department of Agriculture that redemption centers there have been returning fewer bottles in recent months.
Hallett, who did not represent Woodard during the trial, said he had hoped his client would not receive any jail time, but said he thought the sentence handed down by Justice Carl Bradford was reasonable.

Texto completo: New role but the same goal
Brian Flynn is happy to help strengthen the Black Bears by shifting from left wing to center.
By Rachel Lenzi rlenzi@mainetoday.com
Staff Writer
ORONO - When Brian Flynn was on the bench between shifts, he heard what his linemate, Tanner House had to say about his responsibilities at center. House remarked about how he needed to adjust his positioning, what tendencies the opposing center had after he took a faceoff or where his teammates should be on the ice in the context of a certain situation.

PROVIDENCE (2-1-1) AT MAINE (1-2-1)
WHEN: 7 p.m. today and Saturday
WHERE: Alfond Arena, Orono
TV/RADIO: WPME (Time Warner Channel 17) today and Saturday/WLOB-AM (1310)
PROVIDENCE: First-year coach Nate Leaman, who was a volunteer assistant at Maine during the 1998-1999 season, leads the upstart Friars, who opened the season with a 5-3 win Oct. 14 against Boston University, then skated to a 2-2 tie last weekend against defending national champion Minnesota-Duluth. Senior forward Matt Bergland is Providence's leading active scorer with 61 points, while Andy Balysky leads the Friars this season with a goal and three assists in four games.
MAINE: The Black Bears resume their schedule after two weeks off - Maine went 0-1-1 in two nonconference games Oct. 14-15 at North Dakota. Spencer Abbott and Brian Flynn each lead the Black Bears with seven points in four games, while sophomores Dan Sullivan and Martin Ouellette continue to rotate in goal. One area in which the Black Bears will need to improve is in faceoffs; against North Dakota, Maine won 53 of 123 draws. Maine also must continue its presence low in the offensive and defensive zones in order to create scoring chances and prevent them.
- Rachel Lenzi
The knowledge that House - who now plays in for Edmonton Oilers' American Hockey League team - offered wasn't in vain. Flynn, now a senior on the University of Maine men's hockey team, took it all in.
"I was able to learn from Houser in my first three years here," Flynn said. "The little, subtle things he would do. Every time our line would come off after a shift, he'd start talking about the things you usually didn't notice, but might give you an edge. Maybe listening to him point things out for a few years helped me a little bit."
Four games into the season, Flynn is adjusting to a new role and a new position with the Black Bears.
After spending three seasons at left wing, primarily on Maine's top line, Flynn now centers Maine's top line, joining left wing Spencer Abbott and right wing Joey Diamond as the Black Bears (1-2-1, 1-1 Hockey East) prepare to open a two-game series tonight against Providence.
"He hasn't been struggling, at all," Abbott said. "And it's a real tough transition. I played center in juniors and I know how tough the position is. There are times when you'll ask another center exactly what to do, but he's made that transition pretty quick. Quicker than most may have. Taking on the challenge of a new position in college is a pretty special thing."
With the graduation of House and Robby Dee - Maine's top two centers from the past two seasons - Maine Coach Tim Whitehead shifted Flynn and Kyle Beattie from their natural positions at wing to center, where there's an emphasis not only at making plays but on faceoff efficiency and on strong offensive and defensive play.
"Brian's such a complete player, and I was very confident he could handle that switch," Whitehead said. "He's a natural winger, but the way he plays center, he's a natural center, too. Most importantly, he wanted to help the team. I talked to him last spring about the void and he was very receptive to growing as a player and helping the team."
Less than a month into the season, Flynn admits he needs to improve on faceoffs. In two games at North Dakota, the senior finished 4 for 18 on draws. But Flynn's hot scoring start - he has two goals and five assists in Maine's first four games - isn't just a result change of position. It's also after a summer of bulking up to withstand more physical play and preparing to diversify his game.
"There's definitely a lot more defensive zone work," said Flynn, who spent half a season at center in his last year with the New Hampshire Junior Monarchs in 2007-2008. "Centers tend to be a little stronger, and are good down low in the d-zone. They're good skaters, too. At wing, you're used to catching more passes and getting in on the forecheck, but at center you need to be calmer up the middle, and be able to read the play."
Ultimately, Whitehead believes that diversifying his hockey portfolio will pay career dividends.
"I'm confident Brian's going to be playing a lot of pro hockey," Whitehead said. "This expands his game so he now can play center or wing. It expands his game tremendously. It gives him an opportunity to help our team this year, but it puts him in a stronger position for next season, when he's playing pro hockey. He's really grabbed the role and immersed himself in it. He's not thinking of it as a temporary thing."

Texto completo: Maine ready for dormant Villanova
The Wildcats won the national title two years ago but are winless in conference play.

Staff Writer
ORONO - Warren Smith was home in New Jersey for a long weekend during the summer, and the senior quarterback on the University of Maine football team visited the Jersey Shore.
No, not that "Jersey Shore." He didn't bump into any of MTV's spray-tanned, muscle-bound reality television personalities. But he crossed paths with three players from the Villanova football team - players who had won an FCS/Division I-AA national championship two years ago.
"They all had their rings on," Smith said. "These guys have been there. They've been to a place we haven't. They've been there, they've done that. And their record now doesn't show it, but they're a team that can show up every day and give you their A-game. We have to prepare for that."
And, Smith explained, while Villanova is winless in conference play this season, the Wildcats are capable of surprising their opponents.
The No. 8/12 Black Bears (6-1, 4-0 Colonial Athletic Association) face the Wildcats at 3:30 p.m. Saturday at Villanova Stadium in Villanova, Pa., and face a program that, in spite of its struggles this season, has established itself as a historical power in the Football Championship Subdivision and one of the top programs in the CAA. And the Wildcats (1-7, 0-5) could also be considered a sleeping giant.
"It was profound, the number of seniors they lost from last year," Maine Coach Jack Cosgrove said.
"And how good they were as players. They're very young now, this group they've got playing. They're very talented. It's just that they're inexperienced. But now, when does the inexperience turn to experience? Sometimes it takes longer than others, but there's also that question of 'when?' That's what we see."
The Wildcats lost 21 seniors from last year's team, and Villanova's only win this season came Sept. 24, a 30-21 nonconference win against Penn. The Wildcats are ranked last in the CAA in nine statistical categories, including total offense (14.1 points a game), rushing defense (allowing an average of 186.1 yards a game), total offensive yards (269.2 yards a game), sacks against (28 for a loss of 197 yards) and fourth-down conversions (three of 11).
But the Black Bears aren't focusing on Villanova's shortcomings.
"They also have some good players who have the ability to make some plays," Maine defensive lineman Raibonne Charles said. "With that, this is the type of game they're going to get up for. A game like this could really make their season. We definitely respect them. They've got guys that know how to play in big games and guys that know how to lead in big games."
A week after a 23-22 win at Richmond, in which the Black Bears scored 16 points in the fourth quarter to remain undefeated in the CAA, the Black Bears now have to carry the momentum into Saturday's game at Villanova.
"We had a great fourth quarter (at Richmond)," Smith said. "Now we have to carry that fourth quarter into the first quarter at Villanova. Even though their record doesn't impress, they have a good scheme and they have good players.
"But we have to understand what's got us here. Great effort, great toughness, great ball security. That's the reason we're in this spot right now."

A nurses union announces its solidarity and hands out supplies and first aid advice.

PORTLAND - Standing in a chill drizzle, Angelique Banks yelled through the flap of the blue medical tent that another of the Occupy Maine protesters camped out in Lincoln Park needed hand warmers.

Jason Cook of Occupy Maine talks with nurses Cokie Giles, left, and Cathy Jo Herlihy. A group of nurses donated blankets, long johns, hats and mittens to the protesters in Portland.
A man in charge of medical services rummaged through a case of donated disposable hand warmers and handed out a package, something he said he's been doing on a case-by-case basis, as needed.
The protesters expect the needs will grow as rain turns to snow, and mud to ice.
"We can see our breath and temperatures are going to drop to freezing," said Banks, who worries that some in the group may suffer from exposure as conditions worsen in the coming weeks. "I think it's going to be a hard winter, but I think there's some determined minds behind Occupy."
The Occupy Maine protest started about a month ago in Portland and now has protesters camping in Bangor and Augusta. They are spinoffs of the Occupy Wall Street demonstration, protesting a system they say favors the rich and corporations at the expense of everyone else.
On Thursday, the state's largest nurses union announced its solidarity with the Maine protesters and distributed plastic bags with blankets, long johns, hats and mittens, along with basic first aid advice for dealing with the elements.
Cokie Giles, president of the Maine State Nurses Association, said the union and the protesters advocate for similar goals: livable wages and universal health care and education.
Giles, a nurse at Eastern Maine Medical Center in Bangor, said she worries about how the demonstrators will handle the impending winter.
"It's very important for these people to stay safe.... We want people to get out of the elements," Giles said, suggesting that protesters alternate between staying outdoors and getting indoors to get warm and dry.
She urged them to seek immediate medical attention at the first signs of frostbite, which can have lifelong consequences.
Portland officials agreed to let protesters stay overnight in Lincoln Park to avoid any confrontation in Monument Square, which the protesters initially targeted. The level of protests in the busy central square has ebbed and flowed.
No protesters were on hand initially when the nurses held their news conference Thursday in the square, though a "zombie march" planned for tonight may get more participation.
It's unclear whether the protesters' arrangement with the city will continue indefinitely.
"We talked about letting them stay in Lincoln Park because we prohibit overnight stays in the city's open spaces but we respect their desire to exercise their First Amendment rights," said city spokeswoman Nicole Clegg.
The rapport between the city and the protesters has prevented the kind of confrontations that have occurred in other U.S. cities, including Oakland, Calif., where police in riot gear used tear gas to roust protesters this week.
In Portland, the first weeks of the protest were dogged by rain, but enthusiastic participants stuck it out.
Some observers said cynically that the group would abandon the cause when severe weather hit.
But protesters said Thursday that they are hunkering down and won't give in, even as the scale of the protest fluctuates. The number of tents in Lincoln Park has grown to more than 30, though only about 10 people were milling about the park in Thursday's cold rain.
The protesters got a portable toilet delivered this week and have made arrangements to have it emptied twice a week, said John Branson, the group's lawyer. The need for toilet facilities was acute - some protesters were using City Hall bathrooms when the building was open - and the city worked with protesters to secure a portable toilet from the city's vendor at the city's price.
The cold weather brings its own challenges.
"The first night I slept here was 31 degrees," said Jennifer Rose, who insisted that she was warmer in her tent, cuddling with her dog, than she is at home when she turns down the heat to save money.
Rose said protesters in Augusta have put tents on pallets insulated with bags of hay, and have permission to have bonfires.
Portland doesn't allow open flames in the park, for safety reasons, Clegg said.
The protesters' whiteboard, which lists upcoming activities, also lists needed items: socks, gloves, space heaters and coffee.
Ed Needham, who grew up in Maine and is now volunteering as a communications consultant with Occupy Wall Street, said the movement is akin to the civil rights movement. There is no single event that will meet the protesters' demands, but their presence has triggered conversations, among policy makers and around kitchen tables.
Even if the number of people camping dwindles with cold weather, Needham said, support for the cause is growing, especially as recent economic statistics show a lopsided concentration of wealth among the country's highest earners.
Needham said the protests will persist, despite Maine's legendary winters, even if people seek shelter in homes at night and return in the morning.
"We say in Maine there's no such thing as bad weather," Needham said, "just poor clothing choices."

Texto completo: MaineToday Media CEO and president resign
By J. Hemmerdinger jhemmerdinger@pressherald.com
Staff Writer
PORTLAND - MaineToday Media CEO Richard L. Connor announced his resignation from the company Friday and will step down on Dec. 31.
Dale Duncan, MaineToday president since July, also resigned, effective Friday.
MaineToday, which owns The Portland Press Herald/Maine Sunday Telegram, The Kennebec Journal in Augusta, the Morning Sentinel in Waterville and the Coastal Journal, will be managed by an interim team during the search for Connor's successor.
In the media release, Connor said he "led a significant transformation of this company."
He noted that MaineToday recently reported the first increase in paid circulation in five years, and that the Maine Press Association named The Portland Press Herald the Best Daily Newspaper in Maine two weeks ago. In addition, Connor said, the company revamped its websites and online products and launched the MaineToday Digital division two months ago.
"Now the company needs to leverage the new foundation into the next phase," he said. "After four years of work with a schedule that has been around the clock ... it's time for change for me personally, my family, and for the company. I remain a significant individual investor in the company and I believe in its future."
Peter Brodsky, MaineToday Media board chair, said in the statement that the board will immediately begin seeking Connor's successor.
"We will be recruiting leadership for these properties with strong ties to emerging media technologies that continue to shape the future of this industry. Rich Connor's long experience in the newspaper industry provided a critical start to the reshaping of these newspapers," said Brodsky. "Future management will build on that foundation. MaineToday Media looks forward to continuing its role as the leading source of news and quality journalism in Maine."
Brodsky is a former employee at Dallas-based HM Capital Partners, a major MaineToday investor.
Connor said he will assist with the leadership transition in coming months.
Scott Wasser, executive editor of The Portland Press Herald/Maine Sunday Telegram, said he will miss Connor's leadership.
"I told the newsroom when I first got here, two-and-a-half years ago, that Rich was the best boss I ever had. That never changed," he said. "We will continue to do the great journalism that (Connor) brought here."
Portland Newspaper Guild president Tom Bell said in a letter to members that Connor improved the paper's quality and community relations, and stabilized circulation.
"But that is not enough. We must build on that success and deliver news and services on platforms other than newspapers, and we now need a digital-savvy leader who can take us to the next level," said Bell, adding that the union will soon finish negotiating a new contract.
"The union is committed to helping the company remain successful. At this time of transition and uncertainty, we must be flexible, but our strength and commitment is also a source of stability for our readers and advertisers, our company and our workforce," he said.
An investment group led by Connor, a Bangor native, purchased the company in June 2009 from Seattle Times Co.
Since then, the company centralized printing, moved to new offices and, weeks ago, announced a restructuring that included 38 layoffs and voluntary severance of 23 employees.
Former Maine Gov. John Baldacci praised Connor for keeping The Portland Press Herald "an independent Maine paper, not part of a national franchise."
"I think he stabilized (the company in) a very difficult economy and during a challenging time in the newspaper business," Baldacci said.
Alan Baker, owner and publisher of Bar Harbor's Mount Desert Islander and The Ellsworth American, called Connor a "breath of fresh air" for The Portland Press Herald.
"I thought he was good for the Maine newspaper industry because he turned the (Portland Press Herald) around. Most people I know think the paper is much more interesting under his leadership," Baker said.
"I don't know anyone in this industry that has worked as hard as he worked in the last three or four years," Baker added.
Chris Hall, senior vice president of the Portland Regional Chamber, said he was "surprised and saddened" by the departure of Connor, a "very generous supporter" of the chamber.
Connor also sits on the board of the affiliated Portland Community Chamber.
Hall recalled a speech Connor made about media challenges at a September 2009 event.
"He was taking up a challenge many people weren't sure he could meet," said Hall. "Much to peoples' happiness, we still have a paper, and I give him credit for stepping up and being a leader."
Connor will also step down from his positions as CEO of Impressions Media and editor and publisher of The Times Leader, the paper reported Friday.
Former President Duncan said he resigned because the "owners want new leadership."
Duncan, who is former publisher of The Indianapolis Star and joined MaineToday in 2010 as a contractor, said he enjoyed his time with the company, particularly overseeing the 2010 election coverage.
He also praised the professionals at the company, including Kennebec Journal and Morning Sentinel staff.
Duncan described the four months as president as a "challenge." In that time the company launched MaineToday Digital, hired a new chief financial officer and cut expenses during a difficult revenue environment.
"The organization responded well," Duncan said.
"And because of the steps we made in the last six months, the organization will be fine in the near term while it deals with a rapidly changing business model."

Connor's departure comes just weeks after the company announced an internal restructuring that included 38 layoffs. An additional 23 staffers took voluntary severance.
Alan Baker, owner and publisher of Bar Harbor's Mount Desert Islander and 160-year-old The Ellsworth American, called Connor a "breath of fresh air" for the Portland Press Herald.
"I thought he was good for the Maine newspaper industry because he turned the (Portland Press Herald) around. Most people I know in the area think the paper is much more interesting under his leadership," Baker said.
"I don't know anyone in this industry that has worked as hard as he worked in the last three or four years," Baker added of Connor.

Connor's departure comes just weeks after the company announced an internal restructuring that included 38 layoffs. An additional 23 staffers took voluntary severance.
Alan Baker, owner and publisher of Bar Harbor's Mount Desert Islander and 160-year-old The Ellsworth American, called Connor a "breath of fresh air" for the Portland Press Herald.
"I thought he was good for the Maine newspaper industry because he turned the (Portland Press Herald) around. Most people I know in the area think the paper is much more interesting under his leadership," Baker said.
"I don't know anyone in this industry that has worked as hard as he worked in the last three or four years," Baker added of Connor.
Christopher Hall, senior vice president of the Portland Regional Chamber, said he was "surprised and saddened" by the departure of Connor, who he called a "very generous supporter" of the chamber.
Connor is on the board of the Portland Community Chamber, an affiliate of the Regional Chamber.
Hall mentioned a "memorial speech" Connor made about challenges in the newspaper industry at a chamber event in September 2009, shortly after Connor joined MaineToday Media.
"He was taking up a challenge many people weren't sure he could meet," said Hall. "Much to people's happiness, we still have a paper, and I give him credit for stepping up and being a leader. His departure is hard to hear."
Regional Chamber CEO Godfrey Wood said he wasn't surprised by Connor's departure, given "how hard he's been working." He said Connor had spoken of long hours and travel.
In the MaineToday media release, Connor said he "led a significant transformation of this company."
"We just reported the first increase in paid circulation in almost five years. The Portland Press Herald was recognized as the Best Daily Newspaper in Maine by the Maine Press Association two weeks ago. Our websites and online products have been totally revamped, and a digital division was started two months ago. Our website traffic is now the highest in the state," he said.
Connor said MaineToday has transformed into "literally a new media company with an emphasis on online."
"Now the company needs to leverage the new foundation into the next phase," he said. "After four years of work with a schedule that has been around the clock, seven days a week, it's time for change for me personally, my family, and for the company. I remain a significant individual investor in the company and I believe in its future."
11:23 a.m.
PORTLAND -- MaineToday Media CEO Richard L. Connor announced his resignation from the company today and will step down on Dec. 31, according to a media release.
The company, which owns The Portland Press Herald/Maine Sunday Telegram, The Kennebec Journal in Augusta and the Morning Sentinel in Waterville, will be run by an interim management team while a search is conducted for Connor's successor.
"My work on this project began late in December of 2007, and since then, I have led a significant transformation of this company," said Connor in the release. "We just reported the first increase in paid circulation in almost five years. The Portland Press Herald was recognized as the Best Daily Newspaper in Maine by the Maine Press Association two weeks ago. Our websites and online products have been totally revamped, and a digital division was started two months ago. Our website traffic is now the highest in the state."

ORONO - Brian Flynn scored with 2:10 left in overtime to give the University of Maine hockey team a 5-4 win over Providence tonight at Alfond Arena.
Flynn picked up a loose puck that banked off his skate in front of the Friar's goal and beat Alex Beaudry to end the game.
Joey Diamond scored two goals for the Black Bears, while Mike Cornell and Kyle Beattie also scored for Maine. Spencer Abbott's apparent goal with six minutes left in regulation, which would have given Maine a 5-4 lead, was waved off after video review by the officials.
Chris Rooney, Rob Maloney, Steven Shamanski and Stefan Demopoulos scored for the Friars.
Beaudry made 24 saves for the Friars (2-2-1, 2-1 Hockey East), while Martin Ouellette made 23 saves for the Black Bears (2-2-1, 2-1).
The series continues at 7 p.m. Saturday at Alfond Arena.

Texto completo: Rival groups hold events to sway voters on racinos
Opponents of two planned facilities say the negatives of gambling overshadow the create-jobs argument.
By Tom Bell tbell@mainetoday.com
Staff Writer
BIDDEFORD - Six disparate groups that oppose the expansion of legalized gambling in Maine came together Thursday for the first time to speak out against Question 2, a measure on the Nov. 8 ballot that would allow racinos in Biddeford and Calais.
The Hollywood Slots racino in Bangor and a casino that's under construction in Oxford have "desensitized" many voters to the threats posed by gambling, and it's time for the opposition to unite to speak louder, said Chris O'Neil from Mainers Against a Rotten Deal.
"We are getting off the sidelines and coming at it from many different angles," he said.
Despite the show of cooperation at a news conference in Biddeford, each group stuck to its own take on the issue.
- Carroll Conley of the Christian Civic League of Maine said it's "immoral" to set up a system in which communities benefit at the expense of families who suffer from the effects of gambling addiction.
- Robert Fisk of Maine Friends of Animals said the harness racing industry should not receive any gambling proceeds because the industry is cruel to horses.
- Mark Ferguson of Friends of the Oxford County Casino said the group has no qualms about gambling, but the proposed Biddeford Downs would compete with the casino in Oxford and therefore reduce gambling proceeds earmarked by that casino for public school programs.
- Dennis Bailey of CasinosNo!, which has been fighting gambling proposals in Maine longer than any other group, rattled off statistics and anecdotal evidence that gambling operations increase crime and do not bring money to communities.
- O'Neil said the racinos would not generate as much revenue for Maine as gambling operations proposed in other states, and that voters should reject all gambling proposals until the Legislature creates a better deal for taxpayers.
- The youngest member of the coalition, Matt Boucher, 24, of the Ellsworth-based No More Casinos in Maine, said jobs at the racinos wouldn't pay enough money to keep young people from moving out of state. He said the campaign literature and television commercials that tout the economic benefits of a racino in Biddeford rarely mention that it would be filled with slot machines.
"They keep talking about building facilities," he said. "You would think we were voting on building a bridge."
None of the groups has raised enough money to pay for television commercials in the state's two biggest markets, Portland and Bangor. But because the issue arises year after year, it's almost impossible to sway voters on the issue with ad campaigns, Bailey said. Instead, the groups are focused on getting opponents of gambling to the polls on Nov. 8.
Proponents of Question 2 have focused on the message that the racinos would generate jobs. They say Biddeford Downs would bring construction jobs, support jobs in the harness racing industry and lure visitors to Biddeford.
Proponents gathered Thursday at Reilly's Bakery on Main Street in Biddeford and hung a 13-foot banner containing the names of more than 500 businesses that support Question 2.
That message will resonate with voters, said Crystal Canney, spokeswoman for the Yes on 2 campaign.
"This campaign is about jobs, and I think that will motivate people to get out to the polls," she said.
Mike Reilly, who owns the 101-year-old bakery, said the city needs the economic boost that the $120 million project would bring.
"Many businesses like ours have been around for generations," he said. "We need a healthy economy so we can pass on the torch to our children and our grandchildren."

CLEAN OUT YOUR MEDICINE CABINETS
NATIONAL Prescription Drug Take Back Day is Saturday from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m.
IF YOU HAVE medications you no longer use or never needed or are expired, do not flush them down the toilet or throw them in the trash. And don't keep them around the house where they might get into the wrong hands.
MORE THAN 160 sites around Maine will accept unused and expired prescription or over-the-counter medications for disposal, no questions asked. To find a take-back site near you, call your local police station or go to www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/drug_disposal/takeback

PAINKILLERS IN MAINE: Stories, video interviews and links to resources.
The free and confidential program is part of a nationwide effort to prevent the misuse and abuse of prescription drugs that are in medicine cabinets in homes.
It also is considered the safest way to dispose of prescription drugs and over-the-counter medicines, which can accumulate in waterways when flushed down toilets, the traditional disposal method in many homes and nursing facilities.
"Every box (of drugs) that we collect is ... saving a life or saving the environment," said Michael Wardrop, a U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agent in Portland who is coordinating Maine's collection. The federal agency oversees the safe incineration of the drugs.
Proper disposal of unused prescription drugs is considered one of the simplest and most important steps people can take to fight abuse and addiction, he said.
The national take-back will run from 10 a.m. until 2 p.m. Nearly every police agency in Maine is sponsoring a collection site, either at the police station or another location.
There will be 167 collection sites statewide. To find the site nearest you, go to www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/drug_disposal/takeback or call your local police department.
Mainers turned in nearly 20,000 pounds of unused medications in the past two collection events, more pounds per capita than the residents of any other state, Wardrop said.
He said he's sure there are still a lot of pills and medications in people's homes.
"Anything (collected) is better than nothing," he said. "That means we've eliminated medications going into the wrong hands and going into our environment."

Texto completo: BIDDEFORD, Maine -- Opponents and supporters of expanding gambling in Maine held dueling press conferences here on Thursday, one side extolling the support of 500 businesses for two new racinos, the other decrying the social and economic woes they say gambling brings.
There are two statewide gambling referendum questions on the Nov. 8 ballot. Question 2 asks voters to approve slots facilities at horse racetracks, also called racinos, in Biddeford and in Washington County. Question 3 asks for approval of a casino in downtown Lewiston.
There is currently one racino in Maine, Hollywood Slots in Bangor. Penobscot County voters are considering whether to allow the racino to expand to include table games. One casino is under construction in Oxford County.
On Thursday, proponents of Question 2 held an event at Reilly's Bakery in downtown Biddeford, unrolling a 13-foot banner that had the names of more than 500 businesses statewide that support the proposal. Some of those names included Dysart's Service, General Appliance, Hartt Transportation, G.R. Dimillo's and the Fishermen's Grill.
"Businesses understand that when you have good projects in front of you, it can be a win for everyone," said Crystal Canney, spokesperson for the proposal. "A win for the towns where they'll be situated, a win for Maine residents."
The Biddeford project would involve the relocation of Scarborough Downs to Biddeford, where a hotel would be built by Ocean Properties. According to proponents, it would create 800 construction jobs and 500 full-time jobs, with average salaries and benefits of $35,000 a year.
Nearby, in a redeveloped mill building, a coalition of groups opposing Questions 2 and 3 held a press conference to demonstrate their united front.
"There's a real threat bearing down upon Maine," said Chris O'Neil, spokesman for Mainers Against a Rotten Deal, "and there's a very real and vigorous opposition to that threat."
Other groups represented include CasinosNO!, the Christian Civic League of Maine, No More Casinos Maine, the Maine Friends of Animals and the Friends of Oxford Casino.
Dennis Bailey, executive director of CasinosNO!, noted that the vote to approve the Oxford County casino last fall was close, 284,934 to 280,211.
Mainers had repeatedly voted down gambling expansions in the past, said Bailey, and he believed that sentiment still prevailed, despite the Oxford County vote.
"I don't think our votes have gone anywhere," he said, adding that he believed most Mainers were dubious about the economic benefit claims of casino proponents.
Bailey said new gambling establishments won't bring in new revenue to the state, but will cater to locals, and take their discretionary spending away from other businesses.
Matthew Boucher of Ellsworth, with the group No More Casinos Maine, said he believed the proponents were using support of the harness racing industry as a tool to gain votes, playing on the state's heritage of agriculture.
Robert Fiske of Friends of Maine Animals said the horses used in harness racing were often mistreated, and the industry should not be supported.
And Carroll Conley, executive director of the Christian Civic League of Maine, said if the questions pass, "there will be casualties."
"I'm tired of seeing the families that have been destroyed," he said.
Conley said there are families in the Bangor area who have gone through bankruptcies and divorces because of problem gambling.
Bailey pointed to several embezzling cases linked to gambling -- a problem he said would grow if there were more places to gamble.
Canney, however, disputed those arguments.
"What destroys families is poverty, and jobs help get people out of poverty," said Canney. "We're looking at saving 1,500 jobs in the harness racing industry, more in agriculture, and creating 800 temporary construction jobs, 500 full-time jobs in Biddeford, and hundreds more in Washington County."
Stavros Mendros, one of the proponents of the Lewiston plan, took issue with arguments that the casino proposals would hurt downtowns.
"I honestly wonder if these no people even know how to read," said Mendros. "They lump us all together – it's intellectual laziness."
The Lewiston proposal is specifically set downtown in the city, he noted. The Oxford casino project would hurt Lewiston's downtown, he suggested, drawing people out of the city to spend money elsewhere.
"We're just trying to compete and fight sprawl," he said. "None of this applies to us."
That plan proposes a $100 million development that would take the abandoned No. 5 building at the old Bates textile mill and renovate it into a casino, hotel and conference center. That operation, too, would employ 800 workers during construction and 500 on completion, supporters say.

Texto completo: Mercy adds outpatient intake hours in evenings
The recovery center in Westbrook strives to maximize access for those with jobs who seek treatment.
By John Richardson jrichardson@mainetoday.com
State House Bureau
Maine's largest substance abuse treatment center, the Mercy Recovery Center in Westbrook, has expanded its operating hours in response to the state's growing addiction problem.
[sidebar]

PAINKILLERS IN MAINE: Stories, video interviews and links to resources.
Starting this week, people who want help for alcoholism or drug addiction can get an initial assessment until 7 p.m. on weekdays.
While Mercy already offered evening sessions for treatment, people seeking initial assessments had to come in before 3 p.m. Now, someone can go to the Westbrook office after work, get an assessment and begin outpatient counseling that evening or the next day.
"For individuals in this very difficult economy who are trying to keep their jobs while also accessing outpatient treatment, we wanted to make sure that could happen," said Charles Morris, outpatient manager.
Morris said the expanded hours are a response to insecurity about the economy and Maine's growing addiction epidemic, which is driven largely by prescription drug abuse.
He said he hopes that recent media reports on the problem, including a series of articles about painkiller abuse in MaineToday Media last week, will lead more people to ask for help.
In many cases, he said, relatives who learn about addiction through media coverage encourage addicts to seek help. "I think families have a big role," he said.
Mercy's expanded hours reflect a long-running effort by addiction treatment providers statewide to reduce barriers and maximize access, said Eric Haram, president of the Maine Association of Substance Abuse Programs and director of the Addiction Resource Center at Mid Coast Hospital in Brunswick.
"Addiction is a window-of-opportunity illness. A person can change their mind about what they want to do about it every five minutes," he said. "When a person calls, the correct response is, 'Come in.' "
Maine received a federal grant in 2006 that allowed 16 treatment agencies around the state to get management training from engineers at the University of Wisconsin. Through regular reports and coaching, the programs gradually reduced waiting times and increased the numbers of patients receiving treatment, Haram said.
The Addiction Resource Center, for example, reduced waiting times from 11 days to two days, doubled the number of patients and reduced the cost of treatment 30 percent, he said.
Since then, he said, Maine's Office of Substance Abuse has built performance standards into annual contracts, penalizing programs that have longer waiting times, for example.
"There's been a level of collaboration or cooperation between the state and providers to pull absolutely as much out of this (treatment network) as we can," Haram said.
That has become increasingly important given the increasing demand for addiction treatment in Maine. Nearly 4,000 Mainers were admitted last year for treatment of painkiller addiction, and experts say thousands more have no access to treatment for a variety of reasons, including work and child care.
Both Haram and Morris said another reason to maximize access now is the fact that two residential treatment programs, Serenity House in Portland and the St. Francis Recovery Center in Auburn, are reducing their patient capacities in response to a loss of federal Medicaid funding.
The Mercy Recovery Center typically has 40 to 60 patients coming to the center for three hours, six days a week, for intensive outpatient treatment. The treatment typically lasts two to four weeks.
Patients can walk in or make an appointment for the initial assessment, which takes a little over an hour, Morris said.
Treatment is covered by MaineCare and private insurance, and some patients with no insurance may qualify for discounted fees.
Mercy also operates a residential detoxification program for patients who are going through withdrawal or need more care, as well as follow-up care and other services.

Texto completo: Governor's approval rating up, poll finds
The survey also indicates that unemployment is the state's biggest issue.
By Dennis Hoey dhoey@mainetoday.com
Staff Writer
A statewide survey released Wednesday suggests that Gov. Paul LePage's job approval rating has surged and that unemployment now is seen as the most important issue for Maine.
A majority of the registered voters interviewed also said they believe that the bad economy will last more than two years.
Their opinions are contained in the latest tracking survey by Critical Insights, a Portland-based research firm. Each spring and fall, Critical Insights does a comprehensive statewide public opinion survey of registered voters that covers various topics of interest to business, government and the public.
The fall survey, conducted Oct. 18-23, involved 600 telephone interviews with randomly selected registered voters. The sampling error is plus or minus 4 percentage points.
Critical Insights' survey suggests that nine months into his tenure, LePage has a job approval rating of 47 percent - 16 percentage points higher than it was in Critical Insights' spring survey. The new survey found that 40 percent of those interviewed disapprove of his performance.
The survey, in which voters were asked to identify their political parties, suggests that 71 percent of Republicans approve of the governor's job performance, while 62 percent of Democrats disapprove.
Men, less-educated Mainers and the youngest residents polled were more likely to approve of LePage's performance than women, college graduates and people 35 or older, the survey reported.
"I think the governor is seen by a lot of people as being a champion of economic development," said MaryEllen FitzGerald, president of Critical Insights. "That's where his traction is coming from."
The last time her firm did a survey, FitzGerald said, LePage's job rating was lower because the governor was dealing with controversies that included his decision to have a labor mural removed from the Department of Labor headquarters in Augusta.
Brent Littlefield, who is LePage's senior political adviser, said the new survey results don't surprise him. Polls not involving registered voters have indicated that LePage's approval rating is higher than 50 percent, he said.
"The Critical Insights numbers only confirm a trend of positive approval numbers for the governor," Littlefield said in a prepared statement.
FitzGerald said that while voters' concerns about the economy remain high, the survey uncovered an even deeper concern about unemployment.
Forty-four percent of the respondents said unemployment is the most important issue facing Maine. In the fall 2009 survey, only 11 percent identified unemployment as the most important issue. "That is a pretty significant uptick," FitzGerald said.
She said this is the first time that unemployment has surpassed the economy as the most pressing issue.
"What that says to me is that the unemployment situation has become quite personal," she said. "Everyone knows someone who is unemployed or are worried that a family member will lose their job."
In a related question, voters were asked to name the economic or financial situation that will most concern them over the next six months. Lost jobs and the price of gas and utilities tied, each receiving 32 percent.
Respondents were asked how much longer they think the downturn will last: six months, one year, two years or more than two years. Forty-four percent said more than two years, while only 6 percent said six months.
"People don't see any kind of relief in the near future," FitzGerald said.
Regarding a question on the statewide ballot, 51 percent of voters said they will vote "yes" Nov. 8 on Question 1, a people's veto initiative that would preserve same-day voter registration. Forty-three percent said they will vote "no," while 6 percent remain undecided.
Survey data on November's ballot questions proposing racinos in Biddeford and Calais and a casino in Lewiston is considered proprietary and will not be shared with the public.
FitzGerald said the rest of the survey data is available to the public. It is online at www.criticalinsights.com. The information is typically used by government agencies, retailers and trade associations.

PORTLAND - The state's largest nurses union voiced its support for the Occupy Maine protesters today and delivered a load of blankets and other supplies to the encampment in Portland's Lincoln Park.

Occupy Maine is linked to the Occupy Wall Street movement and is protesting a system they say benefits the wealthy and corporations at the expense of others.
Cokie Giles, president of the Maine State Nurses Association said the union advocates for similar goals as the protesters: livable wages and universal health care and education.
"We feel very close to the people who are here and in Augusta and in Bangor," said Giles, a nurse at Eastern Maine Medical Center in Bangor, referring to the three cities where Occupy Maine protests have sprung up.
A half-dozen nurses and supporters stood in a circle behind Giles in Monument Square holding signs reading "Heal America - Tax Wall Street."
There was initially no sign of protesters - a lose knit group of people whose numbers swell and shrink from day to day - when the nurses press conference was scheduled to start at noon. A handful of protesters did arrive a short while later.
Members of National Nurses United, a union representing 170,000 nurses across the country, has set up nursing stations in other Occupy protest sites, Giles said, including Chicago where she said volunteers were arrested.
The Maine group brought blankets, long-john underwear, hats and mittens to distribute to the protesters in Portland.
"It's very important for these people to stay safe...We want people to get out of the elements," Giles said, suggesting that protesters alternate between staying outside and getting inside where it is warm and dry. She also urged them to seek immediate medical attention at the first signs of frostbite, which can have lifelong consequences.

SOUTH PORTLAND - Jon Jennings was a fresh face with an old idea when he started knocking on doors some four years ago. He was pitching professional basketball for Portland and for every person who told him he could do it, others said he couldn't.

Dan Burke
1999 file photo/The Portland Press Herald
Daniel Burke and Charlie Eshbach lined up behind Jennings in their own quiet way. They had brought the Sea Dogs to Portland when some said minor league baseball wouldn't work in Maine. It had been tried in Old Orchard Beach and the Maine Guides failed. The past didn't deter the corporate man or the baseball man.
Or Jennings. His skeptics pointed to the two unsuccessful USBL franchises in Portland: the Mountain Cats and the Wave. They told Jennings not to waste their time by taking them down the same road.
Jennings shook his head at the memories. He learned of Dan Burke's passing Wednesday morning, the news coinciding with a so-called five-hour summit of Maine Red Claws corporate partners at the Marriott hotel. It wasn't lost on Jennings that the Sea Dogs' success helped the Red Claws break into a small, new market.
"They are the gold standard. I was the young buck who knew I could learn a lot from them. Charlie helped me immeasurably."
The Sea Dogs, Red Claws and Portland Pirates hockey team frequently see themselves more as kin than as rivals. Jennings worked more closely with Eshbach than with Burke but Wednesday there was a sense of loss. Burke was the only owner the Sea Dogs have known.
It seems hard to believe now, but after the Maine Mariners moved to Providence following the 1991-92 AHL season, Portland was without any team for a year until the owner Tom Ebright moved the Skipjacks from Baltimore and renamed his team the Pirates. In April of 1994, the Sea Dogs played their first Eastern League game at Hadlock Field.
The Red Claws open their third season in the NBA Development League next month. Home games at the Portland Expo have been a string of sellouts. The Thompson's Point project, which includes a new arena for the Red Claws, is moving ahead, although slowly.
Jennings can't rest and Wednesday's get-together was evidence of that. He asked NBA Development League Commissioner Dan Reed to speak to current and potential corporate sponsors. Reed didn't think twice. "Jon and his group are one of the showcase franchises in this league and even in the NBA," he said during a break. "Jon understands the model. Maine is in the top three of every category we measure."
Categories like season ticket sales and merchandising. That the Red Claws haven't yet reached the playoffs is not a concern to Reed even as the competitive side of Jennings bristles. He wants a winner.
He also believes that he's selling more than the game itself.
"It depends who's walking into the building. The kids want one thing (Where's Crusher?), the hard-core fan wants his basketball played well and the social fan wants to be entertained."
Guests from the NBA front office made presentations on marketing and social media. Representatives from the team's major corporate sponsors formed a panel to discuss where the bang from their dollar was coming from.
New coach Dave Leitao told a story of his playing days at Northeastern and going to Orono to play Maine in the Pit. The night before, he and some teammates were in a movie theater when Maine's
Rufus Harris was recognized. Everyone but the Huskies stood to give Harris a standing ovation.
"I was taken aback," said Leitao. "I have a little sense of the passion for basketball in this state.
Passion is important. We want to walk with, talk with and play with it. We want to make sure (players) understand what passion is all about."
Leitao stepped back and grinned. Men and women nodded and applauded. Call it a summit, in fact it was more pep rally for people plugged into their community and a team they could call their own.
Dan Burke would have understood.

FARMS AND FABLES
WHEN: 7 p.m. today and Friday, 2 and 7 p.m. Saturday, 2 p.m. Sunday
WHERE: Camp Ketcha, 336 Black Point Road, Scarborough
TICKETS: $15; brownpapertickets.com/event/203840
"Farms and Fables" will run through Sunday at Camp Ketcha in Scarborough.
Written with input from farmers and performed by a cast that includes actors and farmers, the two-act drama intends to foster dialogue about local agriculture, farming and the future of family farms in Maine.
It is the brainchild of Jennie Hahn, a Maine native who returned a few years ago after spending several years working in community-based theater in Los Angeles. Community-based theater aims to bring understanding between cultures through theater.
"We are seeing a lot of change in the state of Maine - demographic change, environmental change, land-use change," said Hahn, who directs the play for her theater company, Open Waters Theater Arts. "We are hearing a lot of conversations about food and agriculture, and I feel that sometimes perspectives can get generalized. This play focuses on the people and the lives of the people involved in agriculture. I want people who attend the play to see that, so they have greater appreciation of the agriculture in their community."
"Farms and Fables" has a cast of 11. Six of the cast members are actors. Five are farm workers.
Among them is Penny Jordan, whose family has operated a farm in Cape Elizabeth for several generations.
"I can never profess to be acting," Jordan said with a laugh. "Am I in the play? Yes. Can I act? No."
She got involved because she liked the idea of creating conversations among various elements of the community. She hopes that people who see the play will consider the role of local agriculture in their community, and the difficult decisions that farmers and farm families make when they choose to stay on their land.
"It really does take a lot of planning and passion," Jordan said. "If you aren't a family that is passionate about what your land has been and what you want it to be, then it isn't necessarily going to remain a farm and a productive farm. It is either going to be land sitting there as open space or it is going to be houses.
"I think you really have to value your heritage in order that a farm carries on generation after generation," she said. "If you value your legacy, you will ensure the legacy will carry on. It's not about the money. It's about the passion."
Hahn and writer Cory Tamler created the play after two years of conversations with farmers. The theater artists also dug in, working internships on local farms. In addition to offering hands-on experiences, the internships gave the actors, writer and director the opportunity for real-world research.
Tamler wrote the play based on the farm experience and friendships made while working on local farms.
In addition to Jordan's farm, the farms that participated were the Benson dairy farm in Gorham, and the Broadturn Farm in Scarborough, a farm that specializes in community-supported agriculture.
Tamler wrote a script, vetted it with the farmers involved and then rewrote it based on their feedback.
Eddie Benson, who runs the Gorham farm, appreciated the commitment of Hahn, Tamler and the actors.
"I'm not a very cultured person. I am just an old farm boy," he said. "I admit, at first I was apprehensive about this. But they came out and worked hard to do all the jobs. They wanted to fully experience what life on the farm really was. They showed up early and worked as hard as they could."
Does he think the play might make a difference? Will it help people who take farming for granted have a better, or different, appreciation for the work that farmers do and the role of farms in a community?
He isn't so sure.
"Who knows," he said. "There may be someone out there who sees the show and will in turn try to dig a little bit more into the agricultural aspects of southern Maine."

He was born in Albany, N.Y., on Feb. 4, 1929, son of Mary Barnett Burke and James Francis Burke.
He was the third in a family of four children. His father worked for New York Life Insurance and he grew up in small towns like Slingerlands, N.Y., and Dorset, Vt.
After graduating from the University of Vermont in 1950, he joined the Army and served eight months in Korea as a first lieutenant and mortar platoon leader, leaving the service in January of 1953 with commendations for meritorious service. That fall, he enrolled in Harvard Business School, from which he graduated in 1955, and with his MBA, accepted a brand management position with the General Foods Corp.
In 1961, he was recruited by Tom Murphy of Capital Cities Broadcasting to leave General Foods and run the company's television station in Albany. This risky career move began a relationship between Murphy and Mr. Burke that would last more than 30 years, a time in which Capital Cities grew from a small station manager (the name derived from its ownership of two television outlets - one in Albany, the other in Raleigh, N.C.) to one of the largest and most respected media companies in the world.
After serving as the station manager in Albany, Mr. Burke moved to Detroit, where he oversaw the operations of WJR, one of the most popular radio stations in the country. From there, he moved to Capital Cities' corporate headquarters in New York, where he served ultimately as the company's president and chief operating officer.
Mr. Burke helped manage the growing business through the acquisition of such properties as The Kansas City Star and the Fort Worth Star-Telegram newspapers, television and radio stations in Philadelphia, Fresno, Calif., New Haven, Conn., and Buffalo, as well as Fairchild Publications, publisher of several magazines, most notably Women's Wear Daily.
As the company grew, so did the reputation of the Tom Murphy/Dan Burke management team. Legendary investor and Capital Cities board member Warren Buffett said that having Murphy and Mr. Burke in the same company was "like having Ruth and Gehrig in the same lineup."
In 1985, Buffett's confidence in this team led him to provide much of the needed capital to finance what was then the largest non-oil company merger in corporate history: Capital Cities Communications' $3.5 billion purchase of ABC. After successfully integrating the two companies, Mr. Burke was elevated to CEO of Capital Cities/ABC, Inc. a position he held until his retirement - on his 65th birthday - in February of 1994.
Knowing that he would leave the company when he turned 65, Mr. Burke spent part of his free time in the years prior working to bring minor league baseball to his beloved state of Maine. From the time he was in graduate school, he had spent every summer in Kennebunk Beach, and as a lifelong baseball fan he hoped to create or move a franchise to Portland.
This work paid off when Major League Baseball added franchises in Florida and Colorado, and Mr. Burke, working with Portland officials, established the Marlins' AA affiliate Portland Sea Dogs, who had their first home game two months after Mr. Burke's retirement.
The Sea Dogs became a Boston Red Sox affiliate in 2003 and won their first Eastern League championship in 2006. Overseeing the team and watching stands filled with families enjoying baseball on beautiful summer nights became one of his life's greatest pleasures.
Mr. Burke served on several other corporate boards, including The Washington Post Co., Morgan Stanley, Consolidated Rail Corp., Rohm and Haas and Darden Restaurants.
A former co-chair of the Columbia-Presbyterian Hospital board, he was later named chairman emeritus at New York Presbyterian. Mr. Burke is a member of the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences Hall of Fame, the Broadcasting and Cable Hall of Fame, and the Maine Baseball Hall of Fame.
He also was a trustee and chairman of the board of the University of Vermont and actively - but often anonymously - supported many philanthropic efforts, including the Maine Family Literacy Initiative, Cities in Schools, The National Urban League and The Partnership for a Drug Free America.
A passionate advocate for the advancement of minorities in the media business, he helped establish the Foundation for Minority Interests in Media and in 1984 received the Ida B. Wells Award, presented to executives who have made a significant difference in the hiring, promotion and news coverage of underrepresented minorities.
In addition to his business career and passion for baseball, Mr. Burke enjoyed playing golf and tennis, and while he was rarely one of the better players in the foursome, he was a fierce competitor who was always quick with a joke or a jibe.
He is survived by Harriet "Bunny" Burke, his wife of 54 years; four children, Steve Burke of Philadelphia, Frank Burke of Chattanooga, Tenn., Sally McNamara of Wellesley, Mass., and Bill Burke of Cape Elizabeth; and 14 grandchildren.
In lieu of flowers, his family requests that donations be made to Maine Medical Center, The Partnership for a Drug Free America, and the Naomie Berrie Diabetes Center at Columbia University Medical Center.
Bill Burke is a son of Dan Burke.

Texto completo:   MARCHANT, Barbara Joan (Swallow) 79, of West Newfield, ME, died at the Mountain View Nursing Home in Ossipee, New Hampshire, on October 23, 2011. Barbara was born in Wakefield, Massachusetts on May 27, 1932 to Harold and Marie (Schwartz) Swallow and attended local schools, graduating from Wakefield High School in 1949. Following high school she attended the Melrose-Wakefield Hospital Nursing School, graduating in 1953. Barbara had a thirst for knowledge and continued taking classes for many years at Salem State College for her own enjoyment. After graduating from nursing school, Barbara devoted her life to her nursing career.
When she retired as a home health care nurse, she and her husband, Bunkey, moved to West Newfield, Maine to reside in their newly built dream home.
Barbara was an active woman during her life and this continued into her retirement.
She was involved with Habitat for Humanity, the Newfield Historical Society, Meals on Wheels, the Newfield Recycling Center, the Parsonsfield Extension and she attended and helped instruct exercise classes for seniors at the Newfield Methodist Church. She enjoyed camping with friends and family at Sunset Park, thoroughly enjoyed food of all kinds and loved to travel. Barbara was an avid knitter and liked to crochet; she took pride in her flower gardens and enjoyed feeding the local birds and wildlife that would graze under her apple trees. Not long after the loss of her husband Bunkey in 2003, Barbara was diagnosed with non-tremors Parkinsonism and was later admitted to the Mountain View Nursing Home in Ossipee, New Hampshire where she spent the last five years before passing into her journey of eternal life. Barbara will be remembered for her laughter, kindness, selflessness, strength and sense of humor. Barbara was predeceased by her parents, her brother, John Swallow of New York City, the love of her life, her husband Evard (Bunkey) William Marchant. She is survived by her brother Phillip Swallow of Lebanon, her sons Peter E. Marchant and his wife, Maria of West Newfield, Paul Marchant and his wife, Cheryl of Melrose, MA, and Douglas J.

Texto completo: Saddleback looks to visa program to attract foreign investment
The region receives a federal designation that has created thousands of jobs in Vermont.
By Susan M. Cover scover@mainetoday.com
State House Bureau
AUGUSTA - Franklin County and Livermore Falls have been granted a federal designation that will help them attract foreign investors, Maine's Economic and Community Development Commissioner George Gervais announced Tuesday.
The designation gives foreign nationals a path to green cards and residency in the United States if they invest in businesses in a regional center comprising Franklin County and Livermore Falls, in Androscoggin County. The minimum investment is $500,000 and the investment must create at least 10 jobs directly or indirectly.
The jobs would be filled by people who live in the area, Gervais said.
The investments must be targeted to ski lodges and resorts, testing laboratories, wood products manufacturing, restaurants, those who lease nonresidential buildings, museums and construction, said Christopher Farmer, general manager of Saddleback Mountain and the driving force behind the initiative.
"Growing up in Franklin County, I watched hundreds of good quality manufacturing jobs disappear from the area, leaving the state for foreign lands," Farmer said at a State House news conference. "This is a unique opportunity to bring investment dollars back from those areas to Franklin County and create good-paying, long-term jobs."
Even before Tuesday's announcement, Farmer said, he was contacted by potential investors. The ski area hopes to expand as part of a 10-year plan.
Farmer first heard about the federal program in 2008, when a marketing strategist mentioned that the Jay Peak Resort in Vermont and the state of Vermont had achieved success with it. The visa program has attracted more than $200 million in foreign investment and created thousands of jobs in Vermont in recent years.
In 2009, the Greater Franklin Development Corp. in Maine approved a grant to help pay the legal costs involved in applying to form a regional center.
USA Lifestyles Inc. is the name of the regional center, which is a venture involving the development corporation, Saddleback Mountain and Otis Ventures.
Farmer said U.S. Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, helped the group get through federal red tape.
The regional center is the first in Maine to get the federal designation, which has been granted to more than 100 centers in 32 states.
Earlier this year, state lawmakers asked the state to apply for the designation as part of a law aimed at improving Maine's business climate. The idea came from Rep. Linda Valentino, D-Saco, who heard about the program from parents of foreign students at Thornton Academy.
For foreign families with money to invest, the program provides a way to move to the United States to take advantage of the educational system, Gervais said. The state is not a part of the new regional center, but will monitor its success to determine whether a similar program can be started in other parts of the state or statewide, he said.

"This tidal wave has started to crash upon the shores of retirement," Laurie Lachance told about 160 people at the Aging Advocacy Summit at the Augusta Civic Center.
With the oldest median age in the country - 42.7 - Maine will be hit hard by the wave of new retirees. Their needs for transportation, health care and housing will put a particular strain on state and federal resources. And at a time when budget cuts to many programs are almost certain in Augusta and Washington, advocates for Maine's senior citizens are getting ready for major battles.
"The threats to the senior safety net in Maine are bigger than they've ever been," said Jessica Maurer, executive director of the Maine Association of Area Agencies on Aging.
That's why the association changed the focus of its annual fall meeting this year to teach members how to lobby state and federal lawmakers. AARP was particularly visible at the State House earlier this year, busing in red-shirted seniors to lobby against proposed budget cuts.
AARP, the Alzheimer's Association, Home Care for Maine and other groups on Tuesday geared up for the next legislative session and learned more about what's going on with the "supercommittee" formed by Congress to cut $1.2 trillion in federal spending over 10 years. The committee has until Nov. 23 to make a recommendation.
Robert Greenstein, president of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities in Washington, told attendees via Skype that the supercommittee is considering cuts to Medicaid, which provides health insurance for people with low incomes, and Medicare, health insurance for people 65 and older.
Some of the proposals would shift more of the funding responsibility to the states, while others call for moving more Medicaid-eligible citizens into private health care plans. Another idea is to raise the age of eligibility for Medicare from 65 to 67. Yet another would shift more of the cost to people in the program.
"What my concern is ... I do not believe policymakers in either party understand Medicare seniors can't afford to pay more," he said.
Lachance painted a sobering picture of the state's demographics. By 2030, more than one-quarter of all Mainers will be 65 or older. And while the poverty rate of that age group has dropped from 26 percent in 1970 to 9.5 percent today, more older Mainers are living in rural areas, where transportation and health care are more difficult to access. And Maine's roads and bridges are in tough shape.
"The combination of bad roads and older drivers is a terrifying combination," she said.
But she said senior citizens also contribute to a healthy society with volunteer work, public service and support of cultural assets like theaters.
"People are living longer," she said. "They are healthier. They have greater financial means. They are active and engaged in the community. Maine needs to engage seniors to survive and thrive."

SEARCH FOR SOLUTIONS
Here are the recommendations that came out of Tuesday's Prescription Drug Abuse Summit:
- Train doctors and other prescribers to treat pain and prevent addiction, expand access to addiction treatment and provide more insurance coverage for alternative pain treatments.
- Create a unified public education program, including the use of social media, to reduce pill abuse.
- Expand the use of Maine's prescription monitoring program, perhaps giving law enforcement or others more access to the data. Notify doctors and other prescribers if their patients have been arrested for trafficking pills.
- Develop a way to dispose of expired and unused medications in-state. Most pills and other drugs collected in Maine have to be disposed of out of state at higher cost because of hazardous waste rules.

PAINKILLERS IN MAINE: Stories, video interviews and links to resources.
Attorney General William Schneider announced the decision Tuesday at the end of a day-long summit focusing on the expanding problem of painkiller addiction in the state.
The first mission of the task force, Schneider said, will be to implement recommendations generated by about 150 government officials, physicians, drug enforcement agents and others at Tuesday's conference.
The steps include a new public education campaign to prevent pill abuse and a new system for sharing information between the law enforcement and medical communities.
"These will be pursued and they'll be followed and they'll be implemented," Schneider said.
Schneider's office planned the summit for months. The event followed a six-day series of articles published last week by MaineToday Media that Schneider and others praised Tuesday for laying out the issues and costs of prescription painkiller abuse in the state.
Nearly 1,400 Mainers have died from overdoses of pharmaceutical drugs in the past decade, for example, and more than 500 babies born in Maine last year faced potential opiate withdrawal and other effects of their mothers' prescription drug abuse.
Participants in Tuesday's summit said it was the first time such a broad variety of experts had come together in a statewide forum on the topic.
"If change is going to come, these are the people who are going to make it happen," said Robert Crowley, a retired Superior Court justice who helped facilitate the summit.
Gov. Paul LePage spoke to the participants Tuesday morning - before the task force was announced - and urged them to take strong action.
LePage said the problem is becoming more costly to all Mainers and is a significant threat to the security of Maine's communities. He specifically said the medical community has to limit the amount of painkillers prescribed.
"We need you all to participate," LePage said. "I'll be there, and whatever I need to do to help you, you let me know. ... We need to get these drugs out of the hands of the wrong people. Those who have addictions, we need to treat them."
Schneider said he and LePage will decide in the coming weeks what the task force will look like and who its members will be. The group is likely to propose legislative changes and other initiatives, he said.
Some recommendations, such as an education campaign, will require new funding at a time of strained state budgets. But, Schneider said, "I think we can find money."
Speakers at the conference urged the participants, and the state, to take strong action.
John Woodcock Jr., chief judge of U.S. District Court in Maine, said opiate medications clearly must be available to the patients who rely on them to cope with pain. But, he said, abuse of the drugs is fueling crime and filling courtrooms and jails.
"How do we manage a medication that is so remarkably beneficial to so many and so remarkably destructive to others?" Woodcock asked.
He said he recently sentenced defendants in northern Maine who were trading guns to Canadians for oxycodone pills. He often sees defendants who truly regret their abuse of drugs but have not been able to climb out of the hole, he said.
"There is reason to hope that we in Maine, which as a state has dug our own hole, can climb out," Woodcock said. "But it will be a hand-over-hand, daily and expensive struggle ... and it begins with the people in this room."
Col. Robert Williams, chief of the Maine State Police, said the drug abuse has driven up Maine's crime rate, shattered families and undermined residents' sense of safety in their own homes.
"As the human species often does, we took something that was positive and turned it into something that's absolutely devastating," he said.
Addicts have recently turned to stealing metal - even rain gutters from unoccupied camps - to get money to buy pills, Williams said. "If it isn't tied down, it's gone - all because of prescription drug abuse."
Williams noted that Mainers turn in more unused medications than residents of any other state. "Do you think maybe it's being overprescribed?" he said.
"We have to start attacking it. ... The problem will always be here, but we can manage it and we have not been managing it," he said.
Gil Kerlikowske, director of the White House Office of Drug Control Policy, told participants that they are dealing with a national problem.
More Americans now die from drug overdoses than car crashes, he said. "This is mostly driven by prescription drugs."
Kerlikowske said an estimated 400,000 pounds of expired and unused pills will be collected Saturday at collection events nationwide, including in Maine. At the same time, he said, the Obama administration is hitting congressional resistance to funding a new national education campaign to fight abuse.
Kerlikowske credited Maine for its responses to the problem, including Tuesday's summit.
"There really is an amazing group of people (here) and it's a very smart way of dealing with this particular problem," he said.

Texto completo: Bill Nemitz: 'Question 1' documentary holds lessons for next vote
By Bill Nemitz bnemitz@mainetoday.com
Columnist
"Question 1," the just-released documentary about the 2009 referendum that repealed same-sex marriage in Maine, contains a lot of surprises. Two stand out.
[image removed] Caption:
Frank Schubert of the California firm Schubert Flint Public Affairs claims victory for the Yes on 1 campaign to repeal same-sex marriage on Nov. 3, 2009, at the Eastland Park Hotel in Portland. At left, clapping, is Marc Mutty, the campaign chairman from Maine. "We've been accused all the way through that Frank Schubert was running this campaign. And he just proved it," Mutty says later that night in comments captured in the documentary "Question 1."
2009 Associated Press file
The first is that the New York City-based filmmakers Joe Fox and James Nubile were allowed in with their cameras by both sides - giving the documentarians, and now us, a strikingly unvarnished view of what went on behind the scenes during those oh-so-divisive days two years ago.
The second is what that view reveals about who actually ran the successful "Yes on 1" campaign - and just as significantly, who didn't.
Let's cut to Marc Mutty, who took a leave from his job as public affairs director for the Roman Catholic Diocese of Portland to serve as chairman for "Yes on 1":
"I feel like I've been thrown under the bus," Mutty says during one of his many introspective moments in the 93-minute film. "I have been the sacrificial lamb."
Mutty's role as the tortured soul was previewed in this column last spring when trailers for "Question 1" showed him repeatedly lamenting the toll his temporary job was taking on him.
In one clip, he uses a double profanity (for which he has since apologized) to describe the work. "I hate it. I hate it. I hate it," he adds.
In another, he insists that the central campaign theme for "Yes on 1" - that same-sex marriage, if not repealed, would be required teaching throughout Maine's public schools - was "hyperbole" and "not a completely accurate statement and we all know it isn't."
Mutty insisted last spring that those snippets don't tell the whole story. And it turns out he was right - the whole story is even more disturbing.
The film, scheduled to play in several locations around Maine in the next two weeks, lays bare the illusion that "Yes on 1" was a grass-roots effort by Maine's Roman Catholic and conservative Christian churches to overturn the same-sex marriage law that passed in the Legislature but never took effect.
Rather, the campaign was run by Schubert Flint Public Affairs, the California firm that used the same school-based fear tactics to choreograph California's constitutional ban on same-sex marriage in 2008.
And once again it is Mutty, of all people, who puts the spotlight directly on Frank Schubert and Jeff Flint - two guys from away whose interest in Maine began and ended with the paychecks they collected to come here and stir our political pot.
"Schubert Flint is high-powered," Mutty says during one of several sit-downs with Fox. "They like to be in charge. They want to be in charge. They insist on being in charge. They tend to take over - and we had said early on that we did not want that in this campaign."
But alas, that's exactly what "Yes on 1" got.
Mutty fought hard against the monotonic "our kids will be forced to learn about same-sex marriage in school" campaign. The ads made him "cringe," he says at one point, adding that the theme was "worn out" and that "I can't see us going much further with this without doing ourselves some damage with it."
Yet go much further they did. At one point, in a telephone call with "Yes on 1" Communications Director Scott Fish, Mutty complains that the school ads "are really pissing people off now."
"So why are we doing it?" asks Fish.
"Well, we're doing it because Schubert Flint thinks it's the way to go," a rueful Mutty replies.
Later, while sitting in his car, Mutty endures a tense conversation with Schubert. After hanging up, Mutty sighs, "So Frank wins the day again."
Then there's election night.
Schubert is here, there and everywhere at "Yes on 1" headquarters at the Eastland Park Hotel, granting interviews to a phalanx of television news crews. Mutty, meanwhile, sits away from the lights in the ballroom, taking it all in with his wife, Pam.
"They just interviewed him on (Channel) 8," Pam tells her husband. "He's standing up there saying,
'I'm chairman of the campaign.' I thought you were chairman of the campaign."
"Yeah, I am," Mutty replies. "Who cares ... who cares ... who cares? Right?"
"Right," replies his less-than-pleased wife.
But Mutty did care. And in an interview with the documentary crew later that night, he demonstrates just how much.
"Frank Schubert has certainly done a great job of stealing the limelight," Mutty says. "He's getting paid to do what he's doing. And we've been accused all the way through that Frank Schubert was running this campaign. And he just proved it.
"And then he gets up there and declares victory for us, without checking with me. And had he checked with me, he would have told me to go to hell, I'm sure. And that was all about Frank doing marketing and making sure he was setting himself up for the next campaign."
Some undoubtedly will dismiss Mutty's mutterings as nothing more than the typical infighting that goes on behind the curtains of any highly charged political campaign. Mutty himself is sticking to his decreasingly convincing claim that he was portrayed - over and over and over - out of context.
But as same-sex marriage supporters doggedly circulate their petitions to put the issue back on the ballot a year from now, Maine voters would do well to see this film. (On Sunday, "Question 1" was named the best documentary for 2011 by the REEL Independent Film Extravaganza in Washington, D.C.)
Documentarian Fox, who happens to be gay, said in an interview last week that his goal in producing "Question 1" was to act as "a mirror" to all of Maine as it grappled with same-sex marriage.
He accomplishes that admirably by framing the narrative around five central characters: Darlene Huntress, field operations director for "No on 1," Sarah Dowling, a "No on 1" volunteer, Pastor Bob Emrich, co-chairman of "Yes on 1," Linda Seavey, a "Yes on 1" volunteer and, last but by no means least, Mutty.
But Schubert, who three times refused to do an on-camera interview with Fox, in the end quietly steals the show - much as he used fabricated fears for Maine's school children to steal the election.
"The people of Maine need to see this," Fox said. "This was a campaign that split Maine apart. This was a campaign in which people voted in part because of messages that were given to them."
It's also a campaign whose sequel is just around the corner. Might "Question 1" help inform that debate?
"It absolutely should," Fox said. "People who go to the polls in the next round should know what went on during the first round."
So, fellow Mainers, enjoy the show.
And if that's asking too much, at least learn from it.

for that first impression
The annual National Suit Drive gives 'gently used' business suits to men looking for employment.

PORTLAND - The men at the Maine CareerCenter on Tuesday knew the importance of first impressions.

They came to be fitted for used business suits, which were donated to disadvantaged job seekers as part of the annual Southern Maine National Suit Drive.
Among them was Matt Young, 46, a Portland musician who is seeking full-time work at an environmental nonprofit.
"You never know when (a suit) may come in handy, whether you are looking for a job, playing a show or going out on a date with a young lady," said Young, who took home a tweed jacket, slacks and a tie.
"I take pride in my appearance. You never know who you are going to meet," said Clif Gray, 44, of Portland, who left the center with a suit that he plans to wear to job interviews.
"First impressions are very important," he said.
Tuesday's drive was part of the National Suit Drive, an effort by the Men's Wearhouse retail chain to donate business clothes to job seekers who might not otherwise be able to afford them.
Nationwide, Men's Wearhouse collected 100,000 items of "gently used professional clothing," which it is distributing to job seekers throughout the United States with help from nonprofit groups.
The event in Portland is a partnership between Men's Wearhouse, the career center, Creative Work Systems and Maine's Division of Vocational Rehabilitation.
Janet Dutson, marketing and communications manager for Creative Work Systems, said 63 suits were donated Tuesday to job seekers who were cleared by the groups that organized the event.
"This is like a blessing. When you are out of work, you don't have a lot of money," said John Corsa, 83, who learned about the suit drive through the Unemployed Professionals Networking Group, which he attends weekly.
Corsa has been looking for work since he lost his job at Sprague Energy in August.
Multiple job seekers said that losing work and being forced back into the job market creates emotional challenges. Some get angry, others get depressed.
"When you are unemployed, there are ups and downs," said Kevin Collier, 53, a laid-off information technology worker who was waiting to be fitted. "A new suit helps."
As luck would have it, Collier was offered a job Tuesday morning with Falmouth-based Tyler Technologies. He plans to wear his suit Monday, his first day on the job.
Dutson said a business suit can transform a job seeker's self-image. "The person wearing the suit gets an immediate boost of confidence," she said.
But she said the suit drive does more than help people land jobs.
"This is lifting people out of poverty. This is giving people a way out," she said.
The workers who showed up Tuesday were seeking work in a variety of industries and coming from varied backgrounds.
Clif Gray moved to Portland from Colorado and is seeking work in the hospitality industry, possibly in customer service at a hotel.
Mahad Ali came to the United States 10 years ago from Somalia and has been looking for an administrative-assistant position for five months. He left the career center Tuesday with a jacket, a tie and slacks, which he plans to wear to a job interview today.
Jeff Kinsley also showed up for a suit. The 45-year-old Denmark resident recently started his own company, New England Alternative Energy Inc., and needed clothes to wear on sales calls.
"I can't sell a $60,000 wind turbine in jeans and sneakers," Kinsley said.

State House Bureau
NORTHPORT - Maine's governor and attorney general plan to create a new task force to reduce prescription drug abuse in Maine.
[sidebar]
READ MORE
PAINKILLERS IN MAINE: Stories, video interviews and links to resources.
Attorney General William Schneider announced the decision today at the end of a day-long summit focusing on the expanding problem of painkiller abuse and addiction.
The first mission of the task force, he said, will be to implement recommendations generated by about 150 government officials, physicians, drug enforcement agents and others at the conference. The recommendations include a new education campaign to prevent pill abuse and a new system for information sharing between the law enforcement and medical communities.
12:42 p.m.
NORTHPORT - Gov. Paul LePage urged action today during a statewide summit on fighting drug abuse.
"Prescription drug abuse is a problem for all Mainers, all Maine families and particularly for those who are afflicted with addiction," LePage said, addressing about 150 government officials, medical professionals, addiction experts and others.
LePage said the problem is getting worse and called it a significant threat to the security of Maine's communities. He said the medical community has to help by limiting the amount of painkillers prescribed.
"We need to get these drugs out of the hands of the wrong people. Those who have addictions, we need to treat them."
9:40 a.m.
NORTHPORT - About 150 government officials, law enforcement leaders, physicians and others have begun a day-long summit about prescription drug abuse in Maine.
Attorney General William Schneider told participants he arranged the conference to identify short- and long-term actions that can help reduce a problem that has grown steadily worse over the past decade.
"It's cried out for something to address it," he said.
Schneider's office has been planning the summit for months. It follows a six-day series of articles published last week by MaineToday Media that Schneider and others cited as a resource that lays out the issues surrounding prescription painkiller abuse in the state.
"We have today in this room the people who are in position to make decisions,a" said Robert Crowley, a retired superior court justice who is facilitating the summit. "We need to take comprehensive action to begin to address the problem."

PORTLAND - Police are searching for a silver car that may have been driven by someone who threw a chemical explosive at the Occupy Maine encampment in Lincoln Park early Sunday.

But acting Portland Police Chief Michael Sauschuck said investigators do not believe Occupy Maine was the suspects' only target. Officers had responded to a disturbance behind City Hall at about 3 a.m. when they heard an explosion that sounded similar to the one that occurred in the park an hour later.
Federal investigators have been contacted, but as of Monday the incident did not appear to have violated any federal laws, police said.
Stephanie Wilburn of Portland, who was sitting near where the chemical mixture in a Gatorade bottle was tossed at 4 a.m. Sunday, said she was startled and briefly lost hearing in her left ear when the device exploded beneath a table about 10 feet away. Wilburn's hearing returned, and police said no injuries were reported.
Occupy Maine protesters say the attack has left them anxious but still determined to seek changes in an economic system that they say rewards corporate power at the expense of working people and the unemployed.
"We are more motivated to keep doing what we're doing," Wilburn said. "They have heard us and we're making a difference."
The bomb was thrown into an area near the camp's kitchen.
"There was no fire. ... We had a good 20 feet of thick smoke rolling out from under the table," Wilburn said. She and a friend who ran over to look at it breathed in fumes that smelled like ammonia, she said.
Sauschuck said the first blast appeared to come from southwest of City Hall, in the direction of Monument Square and possibly farther west, he said. Officers scoured the area but saw nothing suspicious.
Police interviewed four to six protesters who were awake at 4 a.m. when the device was lobbed over the wrought-iron fence separating Lincoln Park from Congress Street.
Police say they have leads, but Sauschuck would not say what evidence was collected.
People reported hearing a thud as something landed on the grass beneath a canopy covering signs and supplies. Minutes later, the device exploded as the chemicals inside built up enough pressure to rupture the plastic container, police said.
The city contacted federal authorities, including the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and the U.S. Attorney for Maine.
The ATF said such devices do not violate federal law because they are less dangerous than more powerful explosives, such as dynamite or black powder, and don't throw shrapnel as a pipe bomb would.
Police would have to determine the motive of the person who threw the device to decide whether civil rights or other federal charges are warranted. That would bring the U.S. Attorney's Office into the investigation.
"We hope to make contact with a suspect down the road to see what their mindset is," said Sauschuck. The state charge would most likely be criminal use of explosives.
Witnesses said a silver sedan, possibly a Toyota or Nissan, had been circling before the attack, its occupants shouting phrases such as "Get a job" and "You communist." Witnesses told police they believe someone from that car threw the device. Anyone with information is asked to call police at 874-8575.
Shane Blodgett of Augusta was sleeping in his tent when the explosion woke him.
"I heard a sound which I thought was a gunshot," he said. "I was in fear for my life. I thought someone was walking around with a gun. I didn't dare poke my head out," Blodgett said. He eventually went back to sleep.
The park is bounded by Pearl and Congress streets, Franklin Arterial and the Cumberland County courthouse. The tents and tables have been moved to the interior of the park since the incident, to be farther away from the surrounding streets.
Sauschuck said police will pay special attention to the area, but he noted that it already has more police traffic than most areas because officers coming or going from the police station garage often use Pearl Street.
The chemical bomb was one of the few clashes reported at the nationwide protests -- other than those involving protesters and police.
In Albany last week, a man grabbed a protester's sign and charged into the demonstrators. Police, who had been poised to move the protesters, instead apprehended the man and forced him to apologize, reports said.
By contrast, the relationship between Portland city officials, including police, and protesters has been civil, said John Branson, an attorney for Occupy Maine. He does not believe Sunday's incident will dissuade protesters.
"Certainly this is a very determined group of people," Branson said, noting they have maintained their occupation through poor weather. "This is obviously a lot more serious than rain and cold and certainly people are frightened, but I haven't heard anybody say this is going to cause them to pack up and leave or no longer be associated with the movement."

Resurgent Portland and Marshwood meet in the Class A final tonight in a regional field hockey triple-header.

Staff Writer
Minutes earlier, her Portland High field hockey team had beaten Westbrook 2-1 to advance to the Western Class A championship game for the first time. Yet Beth Arsenault's thoughts were with the Bulldogs' next opponent, Marshwood High.

WESTERN MAINE
at Thornton Academy, Saco
CLASS A: Portland (12-4-1) vs. Marshwood (13-3), 7:30 p.m.
CLASS B: Mountain Valley (11-4-2) vs. York (15-1), 5:30 p.m.
CLASS C: NYA (12-4) vs. Sacopee Valley (13-2-1), 3:30 p.m.
EASTERN MAINE

CLASS A: Messalonskee (13-2-1) vs. Skowhegan (16-0), 5:30 p.m.
CLASS B: Belfast (12-1-3) vs. Nokomis (14-0-1), 7:30 p.m.
CLASS C: Winthrop (12-2-2) vs. Dexter (15-1), 3:30 p.m.
The Maine Field Hockey Association has announced the four finalists for Miss Maine Field Hockey.
The are are Katie Bernatchez of Messalonskee, Nicole Sevey of Skowhegan, Marissa Shaw of Nokomis and Jessica Skillings of Skowhegan.
The winner will be announced at the MFHA awardsbanquet at the Augusta Civic Center on Sunday, Dec. 4.
- From staff reports
"I'm thrilled for them," she said. "We shared a lot of basement seasons where we fought to see who would not be in last. For the two of us to be where we are right now is pretty amazing."
In the Year of the Upsets in Western Class A field hockey, Portland and Marshwood are certainly the feel-good stories of the playoffs. After years of futility, they will meet in the regional final at 7:30 p.m. today at Saco's Thornton Academy, the last of a regional title game triple-header.
The Class C game between top-ranked Sacopee Valley (13-2-1) and second-ranked North Yarmouth Academy (12-4) will go first, at 3:30 p.m. The teams split in the regular season.
The Class B game between top-ranked York (15-1) and seventh-ranked Mountain Valley (11-4-2) will be next at 5:30 p.m. York has won the last three regional titles and six of seven.
And then there is the nightcap.
Both teams take long unbeaten streaks into the game. Marshwood (14-3) has won eight in a row; Portland (12-4-1) is unbeaten in 11 games (10-0-1). Coincidentally, the last loss for both teams came against Cheverus: Portland fell 5-0 Sept. 16 and Marshwood 1-0 Sept. 20.
But there are differences. The Bulldogs have 15 seniors. Marshwood has eight sophomores and two freshmen. In fact, all the Hawks' playoff scoring has been done by sophomores and freshmen.
Both coaches -- Arsenault and Marshwood's Lisa Truesdale -- substitute liberally. They both lack true stars, but both have, in Arsenault's opinion, "kids who love to play field hockey."
The teams played in the season's second game, with Marshwood winning 3-1 on Sept. 6. Portland's home field is turf. Marshwood played at Thornton Academy on Sept. 26.
For both coaches, it is a simple game.
"Marshwood is just solid from start to finish," said Arsenault. "They stay in their positions watching them is like a clinic. They don't wander or get bunched up in the field. We're happy to be on turf.
"But it's going to be a huge challenge. It's going to be about us playing within ourselves and playing smart field hockey."
Marshwood's Truesdale said much the same.
"We haven't altered or changed anything all year," she said. "All the girls are involved. We play as a team. We play with heart, passion and drive. We don't want this ride to stop."
IN CLASS B, York Coach Barb Marois said playing an unfamiliar opponent presents "a new challenge for us."
But York has faced plenty of challenges all season. The Wildcats lost several good players from last year's regional champs and stayed on top with a strong defense and clutch scoring, led by Cari Posternak.
IN CLASS C, Sacopee Valley will face NYA on turf again. NYA, which has played in the last three regional title games, beat the Hawks 4-1 on its home turf in the season's first game. Sacopee Valley beat NYA 4-3 later on grass.
"We've got to overcome that (turf) disadvantage and make it our advantage," said Terry Barnes, coach of the Hawks.

PORTLAND - Members of Occupy Maine reported a relatively peaceful evening, two days after someone heaved a chemical bomb into the midst of the Lincoln Park encampment, but there was one arrest.
Portland police arrested one man on a charge of disorderly conduct after one of the protesters, who was elected to head security, asked police for help.
The man appeared intoxicated and was being loud and disruptive, police said. He was warned once and when his behavior continued, he was charged with disorderly conduct, police said.
Police charged Nicholas Michael, 22, with disorderly conduct and he was taken to Cumberland County Jail. Occupy Maine protesters had asked him to move his tent away from their tents after he began yelling and swearing, police said.
Meanwhile, police continue to search for the people responsible for throwing the chemical device into the camp. Nobody was injured but the device created a loud noise and lots of smoke, protesters said.
Police have been searching for security video from area businesses that might show the older model silver compact car that witnesses believe was responsible for throwing the device. Police have not made an arrest yet.
Occupy Maine, which is protesting what participants see as favorable treatment for corporations at the expense of working people and the unemployed, was not the sole target of those responsible for the device, police said. Officers reported hearing a similar device explode about an hour before the incident in the park, somewhere southwest of the park.
Jason Lamy, a who was working security at 4 a.m. Sunday morning when the device was thrown, was at the opposite side of the park when it exploded.
Lamy said he had heard another explosion some time earlier. He thought the first noise came from the area of Oxford Street and later assumed the culprits had been practicing before tossing the Gatorade bottle filled with chemicals into the park.
Police were unable to locate the other device.

Texto completo: New plant would ship
wood pellets to Europe
Exporting from the facility in Baldwin via Portland would expand the market for Maine wood products.
By Tux Turkel tturkel@mainetoday.com
Staff Writer
A wood-products company in Baldwin plans to build an $80 million pellet manufacturing plant that would send most of its output 28 miles by rail to Portland, for export to Europe.

The venture would be the first in the Northeast to ship wood pellets overseas, opening a new market for Maine's young but growing pellet industry.
F.E. Wood & Sons hopes to start construction next year at a site off Route 113, next to a state-owned rail line that runs between Fryeburg and Portland.
The mill would have capacity to make 300,000 tons a year, about 70 percent of it produced for export. It would employ 17 workers, and could provide many more jobs in a 50-mile timber harvesting radius and in Portland Harbor, where the pellets would be loaded on ships.
"We knew we had the resources available here," Anthony Wood, the company's vice president, told The Portland Press Herald on Monday. "And we've been able to put all the right pieces together."
Wood hopes to have the mill operating in 2013, but some remaining pieces must come together for the vision to become a reality.
The project's investment bank, Fieldstone Private Capital Group Inc., must finalize the financing. The state must finish restoring the Mountain Division rail line between Windham and West Baldwin. And the company must confirm shipping partners and bulk storage in Portland, as well as clients in Europe.
Mainers are becoming familiar with wood pellets for space heat. In Europe, pellets are in growing demand for electricity production. Utilities blend them with coal to run power plants, striving to meet new standards set by the European Union to boost the use of renewable energy sources and cut air emissions associated with climate change.
The trend has helped the United States and Canada become major suppliers of wood pellets to Europe. They shipped 1.6 million tons last year, doubling the 2008 volume, according to North American Wood Fiber Review.
Most pellet shipments leave for Europe from ports in the Southeast such as Savannah, Ga. In the Northeast, only Maine ports are close enough to the wood supply and have adequate bulk-handling capabilities, according to Biomass Power and Thermal, an industry publication that learned of F.E. Wood's plans at a trade show in Pittsburgh last week.
Maine's three major ports -- Portland, Searsport and Eastport -- have storage for bulk products such as wood pellets, said John Henshaw, executive director of the Maine Port Authority. Eastport now ships wood pulp to Europe and is expanding to handle wood fuels.
"Wood pellets could be significant for Maine's ports," Henshaw said. "It depends on how business develops."
In Portland, F.E. Wood has been in contact with Sprague Energy Corp., which operates the Merrill Marine Terminal and has covered, bulk storage on the waterfront. Officials at Sprague declined comment Monday on the company's involvement.
But David Perlman, managing director for Fieldstone Private Capital Group, was quoted at the trade show as saying the project would include development of a storage facility. Perlman couldn't be reached for further comment Monday.
Beyond port storage and handling, the project needs rail service.
The Mountain Division line is being restored to handle freight again, with work winding down this fall between Westbrook and South Windham. It was funded with a $4 million bond approved by voters. With no state bonding this year, the state lacks money to extend the rail work farther west.
State officials say it will cost about $10 million to restore the entire line, including a parallel recreation trail. They're now looking to an upcoming federal transportation grant. The pellet mill could help justify the grant, using as many as 3,000 freight cars a year and putting enough traffic on the line to lease it to a private, short-line operator.
"If the project moves forward, that makes the math work," said Nate Moulton, who directs the state's rail program.
Delayed rail service isn't a deal breaker, according to Wood. Trucks could move the pellets, at least temporarily.
But rail service would give the project an important competitive advantage. Rail freight uses less energy than trucks and creates less pollution, which is a key metric for the European utilities that must cut greenhouse gas emissions.
"They put almost as high a value on that as on the price of the pellets," Wood said.

The Local Farms, Food and Jobs Act includes provisions that address a range of issues, such as building slaughterhouses to process food locally and developing crop insurance programs to enable organic farmers to better reach consumers.
The Democrat who represents Maine's 1st Congressional District, an organic farmer herself and a member of the House Agriculture Committee, unveiled the bill Monday at a press event at Jordan's Farm in Cape Elizabeth. Dozens of farmers and other supporters attended.
Pingree will return to Washington today to begin trying to sell her proposal to key lawmakers who will craft a new national farm policy bill. That bill is an already-complex piece of legislation that may get wrapped up in the work being done this fall by the congressional "super committee," which must carve $1.2 trillion in savings from the federal budget.
There is little chance that Pingree's legislation will pass as a standalone bill. Rather, she hopes to persuade the lawmakers who eventually craft the farm bill to include some of her provisions.
"We've seen explosive growth in sales of local food here in Maine and all across the country," Pingree said in a prepared statement. "This bill breaks down barriers the federal government has put up for local food producers and really just makes it easier for people to do what they've already been doing,"
Included in what Pingree proposes is federal aid to help farmers build more of what they need -- such as slaughterhouses -- to better process and sell their products locally. There's also a requirement for a new crop insurance program designed for organic farmers and "diversified" farmers who grow a wide variety of crops and lack easy access to traditional crop insurance.
There also is language to make it easier for schools to serve locally produced food in their cafeterias, and for food stamp recipients to use their electronic benefit cards at farmers markets.
Pingree's proposal would cost about $1.2 billion over 10 years. Proponents say that represents a good value for legislation that makes relatively small changes to national farm policy but produces a huge benefit for tens of thousands of local and regional farmers.
Russell Libby, executive director of the 6,500-member Maine Organic Farmers and Gardeners Association, said Pingree's "ideas are going to resonate across a pretty broad political spectrum. This is not an issue that is about liberal-conservative as much as about people that have a passion for supporting their local farmers wherever they may be."
Libby, who attended Pingree's event at Jordan's Farm, noted that a companion to the bill will soon be introduced in the Senate. That will lend more clout to attempts to negotiate its provisions into the overall farm bill.
Pingree plans to hold a news conference this week on Capitol Hill to discuss prospects for her legislation. On Nov. 2 and 3, as many as 40 farmers and consumer advocates from around the country, organized by the National Sustainable Agriculture Coalition, will be in Washington to lobby lawmakers on behalf of Pingree's proposals.

Johnson set several school records while playing four years of varsity sports at Georges Valley High School. His 105 goals are still the school record for the soccer team. He started every basketball game and played baseball as well. Skip Pound was a four-sport star at Rockport High before moving on to the University of Maine-Presque Isle, where he played soccer, basketball and baseball all four years. He went on to coach soccer, baseball and basketball at Lyndon State College in Vermont.
Townsend was a three-sport star at Georges Valley, where he played soccer, basketball and baseball. He went on to play soccer at the University of Maine-Farmington. He returned to Georges Valley to coach girls' soccer for the last 16 years, overseeing the 2009 state champion team and a team that won 65 straight regular-season contests.

From staff and wire reports
AUGUSTA - A visa program to stimulate business has been approved for western Maine.
State and federal officials today said the U.S. Department of Homeland Security authorized a regional center in Rangeley to coordinate foreign investment and new job creation as part of the EB-5 employment-based visa program.
Under the program, a potential immigrant can apply for a U.S. visa by agreeing to invest at least $500,000 in an American business that creates at least 10 new jobs directly or indirectly for U.S. workers.
Franklin County and Livermore Falls are included in the special designation, said George Gervais, commissioner of the state Department of Economic and Community Development.
Christopher Farmer, USA Lifestyles president and Saddleback general manager, said at a State House press conference that new investments will be allowed in ski lodges and resorts, testing laboratories, wood products manufacturing, restaurants, those who lease nonresidential buildings, museums and construction.
"Growing up in Franklin County, I watched hundreds of good quality manufacturing jobs disappear from the area, leaving the state for foreign lands," Farmer said. "This is a unique opportunity to bring investment dollars back from those areas to Franklin County and create good paying long-term jobs."

Organizers of the protest, which is linked to the Occupy Wall Street demonstrators, said the explosion lifted a large table about a foot off the ground. Nobody was injured.
Police are investigating and spent about two hours at the campsite, located alongside busy Congress Street corridor, collecting evidence to determine the compounds used in the chemical explosive, organizers said.
A statement from the group said many campers fear another attack.
The car, seen driving slowly past the encampment before someone inside threw the device, is described as an older model silver four-door sedan, possibly a Toyota or Nissan.
Anyone with information is asked to call the Portland Police Department at 874-8575.

CUMBERLAND - One squishy step into the rain-softened fields of Twin Brook Recreation Area was enough to realize Saturday's Western Maine cross country championship meet would be a soggy, mud-spattered affair, a test to endure rather than something to conquer.

Abbey Leonardi cruises to the finish line more than a minute ahead of the field, breaking the course record set by Georgia Griffith, who now runs for Stanford.
And yet, despite sidestepping the ooze and easing through slick corners, Kennebunk senior Abbey Leonardi managed to break a course record that had stood since the 2007 New Englands were held in Maine. She won the Western Class A girls' race by more than a minute over runner-up Fiona Hendry of Cheverus, in 18 minutes, 5.59 seconds.
The previous record was 18:06 set by Georgia Griffith, a New Hampshire native who now runs for Stanford.
"I guess that's kind of cool," said Leonardi, who mistakenly thought the record was 18:02 and, truth be told, still feels as if she's in training mode because college visits this fall and an eye on returning to the nationals limited her to three races before Saturday.
"So I wanted to go fast, but given the mud and everything, I wanted to be a little cautious," she said. "Hopefully it will be dry for next week."
The top 30 individuals from each of three class races as well as the top half of the teams in each field qualified for next Saturday's state meet, also at Twin Brook. Joining Leonardi as individual winners Saturday were Maranacook senior Abby Mace (19:41.49) in Class B and Lisbon senior Meagan Thomas (21:11.60) in Class C.
Leonardi, Hendry, Mace and Cheverus sophomore Shannon Conley were the only girls to break 20 minutes on the challenging 5-kilometer course. Cheverus won the Class A title despite the loss of senior Emily Durgin, the 2009 regional state and New England champion, who dropped out near the race's midpoint.
In the closest of the team races, Cheverus held off Massabesic, 45-51. In Class B, Greely rebounded from a third-place finish in the conference meet to edge Falmouth 79-98, with Western Maine Conference champion Cape Elizabeth losing out to York by a point for third place, 100-101.
Merriconeag ran away with Class C, packing five runners among the top 15 finishers to easily outdistance runner-up Waynflete, 41-90.
"I personally love messy conditions," said Hendry, who led a 2-3-4 finish for Cheverus that included Conley and sophomore Kiera Murray. "Maybe not during workouts or regular runs, but (in) races, I think it makes you feel tougher."
Durgin said she's suffering from anemia and has been taking iron supplements for more than a week. This marked the third race this fall she failed to finish.
"It's certain that she's not where she would have been if she didn't have this anemia issue, but she is still very strong," said Cheverus Coach Valerie Guillet. "With her, we can accomplish great things both at states and, later on, New Englands."
Seniors Maddie Woods (15th) and Lizzie Gwilym (21st) picked up the slack for Cheverus. Freshman Gabrielle Johnson led a 6-7-8 finish for Massabesic, along with Jocelyn Acheson and Mikayla Frazier.
In Class B, freshman Eva Bates, sophomore Kirstin Sandreuter and junior Allie Day went 6-8-12, with sophomore Jill Booth (24th) and senior Melissa Jacques (33rd) clinching Greely's title.
"We're a young team coming along well at the end," said Greely Coach David Dowling. "They're learning they can run with the top 20 (individuals) in the region."
Junior Zoe Chace-Donahue, who dropped out of last week's WMC race, led a 7-9-10 finish for Merriconeag in Class C, followed by freshman Sam Pierce and junior Teagan Wu. Freshman Jesse Saffeir (12th) and sophomore Carlin Tindall (15th) completed the scoring.
Only 15 seconds separated the middle three runners, all of whom led Chace-Donahue through the first mile.
"We were really focused on running as a pack," said Merriconeag cp-coach Morgan Lake-Adams. "They executed that incredibly well. They ran strong and supported each other. That's kind of how they've run all season."

PORTLAND - Occupy Maine protesters say Sunday morning's attack with a chemical explosive has left them with a mixture of anxiety and resolve.
Stephanie Wilburn, 19, stands in the kitchen/communal area of the Occupy Maine camp. She was standing in the same areaaround 3:30 a.m. Sunday when a chemical bomb exploded underneath a table nearby. The bomb allegedly was thrown from a passing car. Wilburn said she lost hearing in one of her ears for about a day, but no other injuries were reported.

Occupy Maine reorganizes its tents this afternoon in response to a chemical bomb that exploded on the Congress Street side of Lincoln Park early Sunday morning.

"We are more motivated to keep doing what we're doing," said Stephanie Wilburn, of Portland, who was sitting near where the chemical mixture in a Gatorade bottle was tossed at 4 a.m. Sunday. "They have heard us and we're making a difference."
Wilburn said she was startled and briefly lost hearing in her left ear when the device exploded beneath a table about 10 feet away. Wilburn's hearing returned and police said no injuries were reported.
Portland police Sgt. Glen McGary said the bomb was thrown into the camp's kitchen, a tarped area where food is cooked and served. Protest organizers said the explosion lifted a large table about a foot off the ground.
"There was no fire . . . We had a good 20 feet of thick smoke rolling out from under the table," Wilburn said. They could see the "G" on the 24-ounce bottle and its orange cap, as well as bits of silver metal, she said.
She and a friend who ran over to look at it breathed in fumes that smelled like ammonia, she said.
Witnesses said a silver car had been circling before the attack, its occupants shouting things like "Get a job" and "You communist." They believe someone from that car threw the device, according to a statement from Occupy Maine.
The demonstrators are protesting what they describe as unfairly favorable treatment given banks and other corporate interests at the expense of working people and those trying to find a job.
Shane Blodgett of Augusta was sleeping in his tent in the middle of the park when the explosion woke him up.
"I heard a sound which I thought was a gunshot," he said, gesturing at the collection of three dozen tents that cover the south side of the park at Congress and Pearl streets.
"I was in fear for my life. I thought someone was walking around with a gun. I didn't dare poke my head out," Blodgett said. He eventually went back to sleep.
Katty Heath, originally from New Hampshire, now of Portland, said she slept through the entire event and didn't realize anything untoward had happened until she woke that morning.
Sgt. Glen McGary said the homemade bomb, which consisted of chemicals poured into a plastic Gatorade container could have caused serious injury.
Police are investigating and spent about two hours at the campsite, located at the corner of the busy Congress Street and Franklin Street corridors, collecting evidence to determine the compounds used in the explosive, organizers said.
Acting Police Chief Michael Sauschuck said today that detectives don't necessarily believe Occupy Maine was the sole target because another device was set off elsewhere that night. He described the device as the type often associated with teenage pranks. But he said police are taking it seriously because someone could've been hurt.
A statement from the group said many campers fear another attack.
The car, seen driving slowly past the encampment before someone inside threw the device, is described as an older model silver four-door sedan, possibly a Toyota or Nissan.
Anyone with information is asked to call the Portland Police Department at 874-8575.

From staff and news services
CONCORD, N.H. - Corey Grigas made 12 saves and stopped two shots in penalty kicks to lead SMCC (13-2-1) past Paul Smiths College 1-0 in the Yankee Small College Conference men's soccer championship game Sunday.
Keith McClure scored the deciding penalty kick goal after four of the first five shooters scored for each team. Grigas stopped the final try for Paul Smiths to end it.
FIELD HOCKEY
ST. JOSEPH'S 4, COLBY-SAWYER 0: Peyton Dostie and Rachelle Messuri had a goal and an assist apiece to help the Monks (10-5, 8-1 NAC), down the Chargers (3-13, 1-8) at New London, N.H. Stephanie Lombardo and Sarah Bartell also scored for St. Joseph's, which outshot Colby-Sawyer 14-1.
WOMEN'S SOCCER
ST. JOSEPH'S 3, MOUNT IDA 0: The Monks (7-4-4, 6-3-4 GNAC) used goals from freshmen Doe Leckie, Elizabeth Calnan and Kim Jordan to beat the Mustangs (2-13, 1-11) in Newton, Mass., and claim the seventh seed in the conference tournament. Jacqueline Lorenzen made four saves for the shutout. St. Joseph's will play at No. 2 Johnson & Wales on Saturday.
NEW HAMPSHIRE 2, MAINE 0: Brooke Duchaney and Stephanie Gilkenson scored first-half goals to lead New Hampshire to a 2-0 win over Maine at Durham, N.H.
Alli Rozelle, Kelsi O'Neil and Chelsea Kuss had assists for the Wildcats (5-11-2, 3-4-1 America East). Erica Correa made two saves for the shutout. Meagan Price-Leibenzeder made five saves for Maine (4-9-1, 2-6).
FOOTBALL
BCS POLL: Oklahoma State moved up to third in the BCS standings, replacing rival Oklahoma as the team behind LSU and Alabama best positioned to reach the national title game.
Two championship contenders lost for the first time Saturday, when Oklahoma and Wisconsin went down. That cleared some of the traffic atop the standings and left Oklahoma State, fourth-place Boise State, fifth-place Clemson and sixth-place Stanford in a tight race.

"If I need deodorant, I don't go to the store, I come down here," Fontaine said.
The Augusta woman and her friend Jen Barrows of Manchester call themselves the Coupon Chicks of Maine. They got hooked on couponing after watching "Extreme Couponing" on the Learning Channel.
They said couponing is a way of life, and it saves money. Fontaine said her grocery bill went from $125 a week to $30 using coupons.
Stored in her garage is a freezer full of food she bought with coupons, and stacks and stacks of dry goods on a metal shelf, including boxes of cereal, crackers, paper towels, beverages, cake mixes and frosting.
"All my cupboards in the house are full. The linen closet is full of salad dressing and barbecue sauce. But this is where I keep the bulk of my food," she said, patting boxes of toothpaste piled on top of each other.
"This is my toothpaste stash," she said. "They're 80 percent free. I'll never need to pay for toothpaste again."
They decided to teach a class in how to search for the best deals and find "awesome" freebies. When 26 people showed up at their first class, they decided to hold a class monthly.
Barrows said 50 couponers signed up for Thursday night's class at the Manchester Fire Station. The next class is from 6 to 8 p.m. Nov. 29, at the station.
Their Facebook page offers links to other couponing sites and blogs.
On a recent Thursday, Fontaine showed off a binder stuffed with coupons clipped from newspapers and magazines and printed off the Internet.
"We use baseball card holders, and there's nine in each sheet," she said. "With all the sections it holds well over 1,000 easily."
Fontaine spends five hours each week clipping coupons and running from store to store.
Fontaine said they post the best deals at local stores on Facebook. To be successful, she said, people need to pick up a few more Sunday newspapers each week.
"A lot of people say the way to succeed is to buy two to four papers a week, you get two to four coupons (for one item) every week," she said. "That's how you get free coupons. Some are 'buy one, get one free' while others are 50 cents off."
One of their goals with the classes is to help others, which includes collecting donations for food banks and shelters.
"In this economy, I like helping my family and friends out," Barrows said. "We make donations to the animal shelter. I'll go in and get huge amounts of cat food and bring them to the shelter."
"It's a good way to give back," Fontaine said. "I save almost $100 a week on groceries, so to be able to give back a little from what I have is important."

The season began Saturday for the University of Maine men's and women's swimming teams in the Husky Invitational in Storrs, Conn.
But the preseason, in the Black Bears' minds, began in the second week of September with a night hike up Cadillac Mountain in Acadia National Park.
"I was really nervous that people wouldn't be happy about getting up so early, but everyone was really excited," women's captain Lauren Thornbrough said. "We got there and the freshmen said, 'this is the coolest thing we've ever done.' That's how I felt my freshman year when I did it. It helped us come together"
The Black Bears met at 1:30 a.m., broke into carpool groups coordinated by the captains and drove to the trailhead, then hiked to the summit in time for the sunrise.
"Freshman year I was told that if you're not from Maine, you hike up Cadillac Mountain to see the sun rise for good luck," said Thornbrough, a senior who swims the freestyle, butterfly and individual medley events.
There were some challenging moments on the hike up the 1,530-foot mountain.
"We got lost a couple of times, and it was very cold and windy," said the men's captain, Brian Landry, who specializes in the breast stroke and individual medley.
"But all those factors combined helped us get to know each other better and get closer."
After the Husky Invitational, which was a nonscoring meet, the men's team will compete today at Bryant.
"We want to continue our success that we had last year," said Landry, whose team was 5-3 in dual meets. "We moved up a spot in America East (at the championships), and in the preseason polls we're picked to finish fourth. We want to improve on that and finish third, and have another winning record in dual meets."
The women's team finished 5-6 last year and after the Husky Invitational, will compete today in the New England College Challenge at Harvard.
"This year our main focus is still having great sportsmanship and great team bonding," Thornbrough said.
"We have some phenomenal new freshmen. It's going to add greatly to our team as a whole. I'm pretty confident that we're going to beat some teams we came close to last year, but we didn't have that final push to get points."
HOLLY STEWART, a freshman on the Maine field hockey team, was named the America East rookie of the week for the second time this season.
Stewart, a forward from North Vancouver, British Columbia, had three goals and two assists in a pair of games for Maine -- a 6-1 victory Oct. 15 at Fairfield and a 5-4 win Oct. 16 at Hofstra.
Stewart has 11 goals and six assists in 16 games for the Black Bears.
Maine will close the regular season Oct. 29 at home against Vermont.
THE MEN'S BASKETBALL TEAM was selected to finish sixth in America East in the league's preseason poll released last week. Boston University was picked to win the nine-team league, ahead of Stony Brook and Vermont.
Maine, which finished 15-15 (9-7 America East) last season, will open Nov. 14 against Maine-Machias at Alfond Arena.
The women's basketball team was selected to finish ninth in America East in the league's preseason polls.
The Black Bears finished 4-25 (2-19 in America East) last season and will open Nov. 11 at Central Connecticut State.
UMBC was picked to win the nine-team conference ahead of Boston University and Hartford.

By FRED JETER Special to the Telegram
RICHMOND, Va. - A dramatic fourth-quarter comeback -- fueled by a little magic from the special teams -- leaves the University of Maine in a dead heat for the Colonial Athletic Association football lead.
[sidebar]
UP NEXT
WHO: Maine at Villanova
WHEN: 3:30 p.m. Saturday
Rallying from a 16-0 deficit, the Black Bears defeated Richmond 23-22 on Saturday in front of a sold-out homecoming crowd at Robins Stadium. Maine and Towson sit atop the CAA with 4-0 league and 6-1 overall records.
"Two teams you wouldn't have expected," said Maine Coach Jack Cosgrove. "There's a lot of parity in this league."
The Black Bears, in search of their first conference crown since 2002, play at Villanova on Saturday, then meet Towson Nov. 5 in Orono in a game that could have title implications.
Maine's win on Saturday was a jittery ride.
"We never gave up -- I know that," said Cosgrove. "I talked to the team at halftime about finishing the game, even if we couldn't win.
"We feel very fortunate."
Maine trailed 16-0 entering the fourth quarter before senior quarterback Warren Smith hit a 16-yard touchdown pass to Justin Perillo, and Brian Harvey's PAT made it 16-7 with 14:54 left.
The Spiders, now 3-4 after opening 3-0, countered with a 2-yard TD run by Garrett Turner to make it 22-7. But that's when the momentum unexpectedly switched in Maine's favor.
Wil Kamin's PAT was blocked by Michael Cole (Maine's second blocked PAT of the game) and picked up by Jerron McMillian, who sprinted 90 yards for the 2-point return, making it 22-9.
"That play energized us," said Cosgrove. "That's when our defense started getting stops."
Instead of Richmond getting one seemingly sure point, Maine got two, the hard way, and that was the difference in the end.
McMillian had six tackles and broke up a fourth-down pass by Southern Cal transfer Aaron Corp to seal the victory with 22 seconds left. On Richmond's final possession, Erwin Roach sacked Corp for an 11-yard loss, pushing the ball back from the Maine 33 to the 48.
Richmond might have been in a position to attempt a game-winning field goal if not for Roach's sack. Roach had two sacks for minus-17 yards.
Maine was relentless in the fourth period after being dominated the previous three quarters. Redshirt freshman David Hood scored from 5 yards out at 9:14 to cut the Richmond lead to 22-16.
Smith ran in from 1 yard out with 4:00 left and Harvey booted the decisive PAT.
A total of 96 passes were attempted in the 3-hour, 11-minute contest. Corp was 32 for 44 for 301 yards, but was sacked five times. He completed 15 straight passes during one stretch in the first half.
Richmond's Tre Gray had 12 catches for 128 yards, but 10 of those receptions came prior to intermission.
Smith completed 30 of 50 throws for 277 yards, a TD, and two interceptions.
"This is a special bunch of guys," Smith said. "I love this team."
Pushaun Brown, who was averaging 106 yards rushing, was held to 9 yards on just seven carries. Three of his carries came on Maine's final possession, when it was trying, unsuccessfully, to run out the clock.
Taking up the slack was Hood, who ran 13 times for 77 yards, including a 26-yarder in the first half.
Maine has won five in a row after losing at Pittsburgh, 35-29. The last three victories have been by a combined 8 points.
"Every now and then a team will come up with some chemistry," said Cosgrove. "I guess after 19 years, we deserve to be that team."

Maine 'skills gap' keeps jobs away from unemployed

Texto completo: Maine 'skills gap' keeps jobs away from unemployed
By J. Hemmerdinger jhemmerdinger@pressherald.com
Staff Writer
PORTLAND - Even though overall numbers show that Maine's job picture hasn't improved in the past year, many companies say they are hiring. But executives say a "skills gap" forces them to recruit and hire workers from out of state because they can't find qualified applicants locally.
[image removed] Caption:
"We have lots of workers on unemployment insurance who have nowhere to go. There is no way they will find employment unless they acquire new kinds of skills," said John Dorrer, program director at the nonprofit group Jobs for the Future and former director for the Maine Department of Labor's Center for Workforce Research and Information.
Dorrer said thousands of people collecting unemployment benefits formerly worked in industries such as manufacturing, production, carpentry and construction, jobs in sectors that have been declining for years or were battered by the recession.
In contrast, companies actually hiring in Maine include those in growth industries such as health care, technology and business and professional services.
"Employers are frustrated because they can't find (employees) with the right skills," Dorrer said.
The problem may worsen in upcoming years as organizations in growing industries try to hire an increasing number of skilled workers.
Hospitals and other health care sectors are expected to add more than 8,000 jobs by 2018. An additional 2,325 jobs are expected for registered nurses alone, according to the Maine Department of Labor's most recent estimates, which are based on 2008 data.
Job recruiters, who find qualified workers for employers, say they struggle to find people with the right skills.
David Ciullo said some of his clients have up to 25 positions they are struggling to fill.
"Skill and ability. There lies the underlying problem," said Ciullo, president of Portland-based consulting and placement firm Career Management Associates, "(Many) individuals don't have the skills or capacity to fill those positions."
Many high-demand jobs in Maine require specific post-secondary degrees, such as MRI technicians, dental technicians, nurses and health care practitioners, said Glenn Mills, director at the Center for Workforce Research and Information.
Mills said those types of jobs largely aren't options for workers who spent decades working in heavy industries.
"You and I can't go out and get a nursing degree tomorrow," he said.
It's a nationwide phenomenon that is particularly pronounced in Maine, Dorrer said.
"We are an aging state (with) slow population and labor force growth. As baby boomers begin in earnest to retire, we have to backfill jobs with qualified people," he said. "We can't turn a blind eye and expect to have a good economic recovery."
Dorrer said state officials and education leaders must improve education programs and communicate the scope of the problem to unemployed workers.
"It's for this purpose we have career centers and adult education programs and community colleges. We have to ask if our programs are performing to the level that they should," he said.

ELLSWORTH - A young eagle watches from a rock as Randy Heckman steers his skiff through the mooring field on the Union River. The city's harbormaster, Heckman is on the water a couple of hours after sunrise, checking boats and enjoying the hidden beauty of this wooded tidal waterway.

LANDMARKS: Ellsworth City Hall, First Congregational Church, Ellsworth Public Library
Just up the riverbank, traffic is rushing along the congested, mile-long retail strip leading to Bar Harbor, Acadia National Park and Down East. More than 30,000 vehicles pass through on a summer day.
For most travelers, including most Mainers, Ellsworth is a place to gas up, fill up, get through. They don't visit the waterfront, or even know it exists.
But some people are stopping and staying.
Ellsworth was Maine's fastest-growing community during the past decade, up nearly 20 percent, according to census figures. The city now is home to 7,741 residents.
Newcomers are finding plenty of room to stretch out. Ellsworth is Maine's largest community by size, covering 95 square miles.
Four lakes, the scenic river and an authentic, revitalized downtown offer a diversity of places to live and recreate.
As the peak tourist season winds down, the days here take on a slower, down-home rhythm. For visitors with a spare moment to turn off the highway, it's a prime time to discover the Ellsworth they don't know.
THE WATERFRONT
Pulsing in summer, the waterfront relaxes in mid-September. A mix of boats bob at their moorings. They draw the eye upriver to the city's downtown and the white steeple of the First Congregational Church. The quiet is broken when the harbor's sole lobsterman and his son fire up their boat, 22 Magnum, for a day on the bay.
Heckman points to the chart on the wall of his office, a log cabin overlooking the marina. He's three miles upriver from Union River Bay, nearly 35 miles from the prime cruising grounds off Mount Desert Island.
"You have to be coming here because we're not on the way to anything," he says.
Boaters who do find their way to Ellsworth, and take the short stroll to the historic downtown, return impressed.
"It's like, 'Wow, I didn't know this was here,' " Heckman says.
'TREASURES' AND CHALLENGES
Leslie Harlow is preparing for the lunch crowd. She and a partner bought the old Masonic Hall and turned it into a cafe, The Maine Grind. Local foods and crafts, and Wi-Fi connectivity, make it a popular gathering place.
Ellsworth's downtown feels comfortable and lively. Almost every storefront is occupied. The Grand theater, an art deco landmark, is restored and hosting performances.
Harlow has lived in the area 40 years. She recently bought a house downtown. She's a big Ellsworth booster -- she'll talk all day about the city's charms; the walking path along the river, the gardens and trails at the Woodlawn estate, the scenic railroad and its weekend excursions.
"We've got all these nice little treasures," she says.
But Harlow's also blunt about the city's challenges. She wants Ellsworth to be known as a destination, not a gateway to someplace else.
"We need to get more people out of their cars, and not on the strip," she says.
DOWNTOWN VISITORS
The downtown needs more visitors like Suzanne and Hawley Peterson.
The couple is from Maryland but has a house in Stonington. They're showing off Maine to relatives from England. Their visitors are enjoying Ellsworth's "quaint" downtown. After shopping at The Grasshopper Shop boutique, they sit in the sun and sip beverages at The Maine Grind.
Hawley Peterson remarks on the number of new stores on Main Street.
"Compared to 10 years ago, it's amazing how the downtown has changed," he says.
But commerce can't be summed up on a sunny September day. The seasonally unadjusted jobless rate in Ellsworth swung from 12 percent last February, well above the statewide average, to less than 7 percent in July.
And for all the population growth, a close look at the census figures gives some pause. The largest block of new residents is between 40 and 54 years old.
IN THE ORCHARD
The Johnston family has been growing apples on a ridge above Branch Lake since 1955.
Orchards are few Down East. Folks from Bangor and the far corners of Washington County drive here for the 14 varieties of pick-your-own, spread across 18 acres.
"Over the weekend, we had 50 to 60 cars all day," says Brett Johnston.
Rein and Ellen Duke are here from Gouldsboro, 40 minutes away. They've got their grandkids, and Rein Duke is pushing the boy in a plastic cart.
"We've been coming here for years," he says. "It's like a ritual."
ON THE LAKE
Stalking lake trout and landlocked salmon is a ritual on Green Lake, a six-mile waterway that straddles Ellsworth and Dedham. Branch Lake, the city's water supply, and Graham and Leonard lakes, created by damming the Union River, attract fishermen year round.
James Elliott and Rob Peck say Green Lake is one of the best places around for lake trout. They're here from Bangor.
The lake is quiet as Elliott backs his aluminum boat down the ramp. No other boats are out; many cottages are shut for the season. A loon paddles by. It dives as Elliott starts the outboard and heads for deeper water.
AND ON THE STRIP
It's not quiet on High Street. That's the local name for routes 1 and 3. It's the gateway -- or the gantlet -- that travelers must navigate on their way to and from Mount Desert Island and Washington County.
National retailers discovered this choke point in the 1980s. They created one of the ugliest commercial strips in Maine, a chaotic row of gas stations, motels and strip malls.
The city has softened the impact by adding sidewalks, landscaping and an urban park. Four traffic lanes help. But in late afternoon, at the junction of routes 1 and 3, traffic is stalled. A disabled tour bus makes matters worse.
EVENING IN BIG BOX LAND
In recent years, developers have climbed the Route 3 hill. They're creating their vision of a regional retail hub for more than 60,000 residents.
Acadia Crossing includes a half-million square feet of retail space, dominated by The Home Depot and a Walmart Supercenter.
Lowe's has risen across the road, not far from Marden's. Saplings and weeds cover the vacant expanses. Last week, Lowe's announced it is closing the stores here and in Biddeford, part of a national consolidation. The true test of this commercial district awaits better economic times.
It's a good thing for Hancock County residents like Henry and Laurie Erhard. They drove 35 minutes from Penobscot to find carpet padding. They looked first at Marden's -- they try to buy local -- but ended up at The Home Depot.
Standing by their 1972 Volkswagen camper in the near-empty parking lot, they muse about the inevitability of big-box retailing and Ellsworth's role.
"It beats the heck out of driving to Bangor," Henry Erhard says.
Then he loads the carpet pad, cranks the vintage van and drives into the twilight.

Texto completo: Charles Lawton: Who will teach our kids about their 10,000 hours?
By Charles Lawton
"Who'll be my role modelnow that my role model is gone?"
Paul Simon
"You Can Call Me Al"
When my children were growing up in the small town of Industry, Maine, back in the 1970s, the coolest parents were those with the biggest toys. The dads (and occasional big mamas) with dump trucks, backhoes and skidders were the ones all the kids looked up to, literally and figuratively.
They were the adults whose status as adults was clearest because their way of being adults was most obvious. Whether sailing down the hill, swerving into the curve at the foot of the lake with a load of gravel, sliding greasy armed out from under an enormous engine parked in the dooryard or coming home with the hottest vehicle from their used car lot, these skilled, confident and always busy providers were clear examples of how one got on successfully in the world after high school. They didn't claim to be role models; indeed, no one even spoke of role models. But they were forever present in the daily lives of the young children growing up underfoot and around them.
At about the same time on the other side of the country, Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak were piecing together simple electronic components for a display at the Homebrew Computer Club and poking curiously around Xerox Corporation's West Coast research facilities in what has become Silicon Valley. In their world, adult role models were inquisitive engineers, stubborn entrepreneurs who dreamed of better mousetraps and risk-taking millionaires willing to give those dreams a try.
Neither set of role models was "better" in any social or moral way. Both presented examples of persistence, imagination and "making do." The effective difference is that today in much of Maine, our traditional role models are gone, victims of the globalization process that replaced neighborhood skidders with building-sized "feller-bunchers" confined to remote logging camps staffed by immigrant workers. Not every place can be Silicon Valley, and Maine, like much of our country's pre-World War II industrial heartland, has not replaced its traditional role models. And our young people are suffering that loss in ways we barely understand.
For some, the loss of both role models and jobs has led to the dead-end path of substance abuse -- alcohol, heroin, painkillers and now bath salts. For others, it has led to departure along the unknown path of "I don't know what or where, but certainly not here." For still others, it has led to a listless, debt incurring and ultimately unsatisfying and unrewarding amble through the halls of higher education.
Our national and state capitols and the parks in front of them are filled with shouts of "jobs, jobs, jobs," but the shouting has all the authenticity of Orwellian party members participating in a ritualistic two-minute "hate" from "1984." Everyone feels the need to join in, but few know why or to what effect, and fewer still have confidence that the effort will have any lasting impact.
Our country and our state don't need jobs, we need realistic, adult role models. We don't need lottery winners, super models, super athletes and American Idol vote getters. They aren't role models, they're escape valves, diversions. We need concrete, step-by-step, there-every-day examples of how to turn interest into skill, vague curiosity into passion and desire into discipline. Malcolm Gladwell says it takes 10,000 hours to develop mastery. But he didn't say 10,000 rote hours or 10,000 hours of drudgery. He said 10,000 hours of motivated, self-directed work accompanied by regular, brutally honest feedback. The Beatles' 10,000 hours in the cellar clubs of Hamburg weren't about screaming teenie boppers and limousines.
Jobs are far too big, too formal, too bureaucratic a thing to solve our economic malaise. Jobs involve formal descriptions, resumes, searches, selections, human resource policies and departments, health insurance, payroll taxes. Jobs are big, mysterious and threatening both for the enterprises that want to "fill" them and the applicants who want to "get" them. We don't need jobs, we need hours -- hours of internships, hours of exposure, hours of mentoring, hours of practical experience, hours to test ideas, to pursue passions, to experience different worlds. The best way to get our economy moving again is not more jobs but more work. We must find ways to allow more people to work and let the jobs take care of themselves.

Maine's job growth remains flatlined and shows no signs of regaining health any time soon
By J. Hemmerdinger jhemmerdinger@pressherald.com
Staff Writer
PORTLAND - The 6,000 jobs that state economists projected would be added to Maine's economy this year never materialized. Instead, job growth has stalled as modest gains in the health care and education sectors have failed to make up for ongoing losses in construction and manufacturing, according to an analysis by The Portland Press Herald/Maine Sunday Telegram.

EDUCATION, SKILLS, BUT NO WORK
THE UNDEREMPLOYED
Evan McVeigh saw no job prospects in his areas of study -- anthropology and geology -- when he graduated from Earlham College in Indiana two years ago.
McVeigh, now 26, returned to Maine and lived with his parents for a while before getting a place of his own in Portland. He landed a job at a bakery, but was let go a few weeks later when the business decided it had to downsize. He spent a few months on general assistance.
While looking for work, McVeigh kept busy by volunteering for the Maine Green Independent Party and taking unpaid freelance photography jobs.
After applying for an estimated 130 positions, he was hired a couple of months ago to do food prep and dishwashing at a restaurant at the Maine Mall, McVeigh said during an interview in the Occupy Maine tent village in Portland's Lincoln Park.
He loves the infectious energy of the restaurant kitchen, the camaraderie among the staff and the feeling that they are a family inviting other families into their space. But he doesn't get benefits and it's still hard to cover his living expenses on his part-time wages. He's been looking for additional work.
McVeigh has been part of the Occupy Maine movement since its start. He thinks it is showing that the societal problems it's protesting are beyond partisan politics.
"This is the kind of environment I've been waiting for," he said.
THE JOB SEEKER
Ron Hoeflick traces the start of his employment troubles back to 2006.
The Windham resident had been a trucking owner-operator until that year, but had to give it up because of high fuel costs.
Then he went to work driving for a company. He got into an accident in July -- he said the low clearance on a highway underpass wasn't marked -- and lost his job as a result.
"Everything's been on a landslide and here I am on unemployment now," Hoeflick, 43, said outside the Labor Department's CareerCenter in Portland.
Hoeflick thought it would be a matter of weeks before he found a new position, but he found the job market to be tougher than he expected.
Now he's exploring other areas like heating and air conditioning, electrical work, diesel mechanics or anything else related to heavy equipment. He knows the career shift may mean some schooling.
"I know how to do a lot of things," he said, "but don't have the certification."
NO CLEAR CAREER PATH
Jesse Call of Bangor isn't used to not working.
At 25 years old, he's had experience in retail, as a factory laborer, as a call center employee and as a private voice instructor. He's already earned his undergraduate music degree and is now a full-time student in a University of Maine certificate program. The certificate in music was part of his plan to teach.
Since starting his program in September 2010, he's had trouble finding work. He was lucky that family in the area could provide him a place to live at very reduced rates. For a time, he had to rely on food stamps.
Call briefly held a retail job, but he would work only a few hours a month. He recently got a seasonal job at a retail call center.
"I actually had one shift that was four hours. I think next week I have six hours," he said, noting that he'd be able to work about 35 hours, even with his school schedule.
His employment frustrations have made him reconsider his career path. He's applying to go to law school in the fall of 2012.
In the meantime, he's been cutting back on expenses, entertaining himself at home and eating a lot of rice.
-- J. Hemmerdinger
It has left many residents frustrated in their attempts to find a job. Even those who find one have often spent months or more looking.
"Because of the economy and all the bad news, you think there's no hope. I had friends say, 'I don't know why you are even trying. It's such a bad economy,' " said Catherine Lajoie of Lyman, who spent a year searching before being hired last month as a pharmacist at Maine Medical Center.
State economists say Maine's job picture, flat four years after the start of the economic decline in late 2007, shows no signs of near-term recovery.
"There has been real flatness," said Glenn Mills, director of economic research for Maine's Center for Workforce Research and Information. "There was an expectation to come out of this (but) there has been not a lot of job growth."
Since the recession, Maine has lost 22,300 jobs, according to Maine Department of Labor figures. Just last week, Lowe's abruptly announced the closing of stores in Biddeford and Ellsworth, leaving almost 200 people unemployed. This summer, Borders shuttered three Maine stores, including one at the Maine Mall in South Portland.
"There are companies that want to hire and could hire, but won't. And you have companies that are laying off because they can't survive the economy. I don't see anything changing in the next 12 months," said David Ciullo, president of Career Management Associates, a job placement, recruiting and consulting firm in Portland.
In February, economists in Maine predicted the state would add roughly 6,000 jobs in the latter half of 2011. But Mills said the nonfarm job numbers have remained flat at about 597,900 since September 2010, and conditions aren't likely to improve soon.
"It's unusual (to have) such a deep (economic) downturn, and then to (reach) a bottom without a rise, both here and nationally," he said. "Expectations for the near-term future are continually getting lower."
Job creation is clearly a top priority for state and national leaders.
Gov. Paul LePage held the first of three job creation workshops last week, meeting with about 80 business executives to discuss ways to create a business-friendly environment and lure jobs to Maine. In Washington, President Obama's $447 billion jobs bill has dominated the airwaves. On Friday, Democrats in the Senate were trying to pass pieces of it after the package failed in the Senate last week.
"We cannot afford to lose any jobs," LePage told the business leaders gathered at the workshop last week in South Portland. "We need to create jobs, and better jobs. That's what we're here for today. You need to tell us where we need to focus. By the first of the year, I would like to see this economy a lot more vibrant, a lot more excited."
State employment data show some industries continue to hire, some at a rapid pace.
For instance, from the start of the recession in December 2007 to September 2011, the health care industry added roughly 5,100 jobs, a 3.6 percent increase. Educational services grew by 8.2 percent, adding 1,600 jobs, according to state data. Other industries such as leisure and hospitality, and professional and business services also added jobs.
Experts say jobs in highest demand in Maine include IT workers, such as coders and software engineers, and medical workers such as nurses and medical technicians.
In the Portland area, electronic gift card company CashStar hired 38 employees in the past 12 months and plans to add up to 40 more in the next year, said spokesperson Pauline Louie. In downtown Portland, a new Renys opened in the former L.L. Bean space and several new bank offices have opened.
But gains in growing industries aren't enough to offset heavy job losses in other sectors.
The manufacturing industry, for instance, lost 9,300 jobs in the past four years -- 15.6 percent -- and employment in the construction industry declined by 6,600 jobs, or 21.5 percent.
Wholesaling firms and transportation and utility companies also lost jobs since December 2007, as did the government sector.
And retail stores cut 3,200 jobs during the period, down 3.7 percent.
Economists predict that the current employment trends will become more pronounced in the next several years.
According to a state jobs forecast that looks ahead to 2018, industries such as health care, science and technology, professional services and food service are expected to add the most jobs in Maine. Jobs in retail, state and federal government, construction, real estate and transportation are also expected to increase.
But the production and manufacturing industries are expected to shed thousands of jobs in coming years. Other sectors expected to decline include publishing, telecommunications, local government and food manufacturing.
"I think most of those production jobs aren't coming back," Mills said. "Manufacturing has been in a long-term pattern of decline."
He added that workers who live in less-populated areas of the state may have the hardest time finding new employment.
"The strongest industries have been health care and professional services, and are concentrated in (larger) communities," said Mills. "The manufacturing and other industries that have been hit hardest tend to be concentrated in rural, outlying industries."

Rebates can cut a project's expense while photovoltaic panels cost half what they did three years ago.

ARUNDEL - On the lawn behind the Solar Market offices here, 144 solar-electric panels are mounted across a 100-foot-long run of wooden racks. No surprise, really, to see a photovoltaic system outside a company that sells the hardware.

But this set-up is way larger than needed to run lights and appliances. And therein lies the surprise: These solar panels generated enough power last winter to supply nearly 70 percent of the building's warmth -- with electric heat.
The falling price of photovoltaic panels, along with the advent of special heat pumps and super insulation, is creating an opportunity in Maine that energy experts could hardly imagine a few years ago. Now some of the state's leading solar installers, including Solar Market, have begun installing so-called PV panels on homes and businesses to harvest sunshine for baseboard heaters.
The new economics of PV panels also has some companies moving away from promoting solar-thermal collectors designed to heat water, a mainstay of the business in Maine for 30 years.
"We stopped selling solar hot water three years ago," said Naoto Inoue, who owns Solar Market and has hot-water panels on his house. "I would never do it again. I would put up all PV."
What's starting to happen in Maine reflects an era of dizzying change taking place in the global solar industry.
PV module prices are down 50 percent in the past three years; they've fallen by roughly one-third in the past 12 months. Manufacturing growth in China, among other factors, has led to overcapacity and financial losses. Trade publications predict that competition will continue to drive down prices next year, as the industry struggles to consolidate and match supply with demand.
Maine solar installers are taking advantage of this environment, as well as state and federal laws that encourage the use of renewable energy. A visit to Solar Market's 3,500-square-foot office shows one way to do it.
Out back, the oversized solar system has a capacity of 50 kilowatts. In the summer, it can produce up to 300 percent more power than the business needs. The system is tied into the power grid, and Maine's net-metering law requires utilities to buy renewable power and credit any surplus to the customer's account. That allows Solar Market to bank much of its surplus for winter, when days are short and the office needs heat.
Typical electric resistance heaters would eat up too much energy, however. In the basement, Inoue has a high-efficiency, air-source heat pump. This device uses a relatively small amount of electricity to extract the marginal heat in cold, outside air. The heat is transferred to water, which is stored in an insulated tank and circulated through baseboards.
This approach wouldn't work if the building was drafty and poorly insulated. Inoue gutted the walls of the old farmhouse and barn to create an 18-inch- thick cavity of foam block and cellulose. The walls now have an R-value of 40, twice that of a typical home. The roof is R-60. The building's tight enough now to be warmed with only 17 feet of baseboards, a radiant floor loop and a couple of infrared, electric space heaters.
Critical to this equation is a 30 percent federal tax credit that cuts the cost of the PV system to $105,000. That's still not cheap. But Inoue figures he's getting electricity at under 10 cents a kilowatt hour for the 25-year life of the system. That's already less than today's utility rates.
Homeowners thinking about this approach typically undertake new construction, but not always. In Sanford, Cliff Babkirk has been able to get 40 percent of the space heat at an existing house from PV panels. Babkirk heavily insulated and air-sealed the home, installed a heat pump and is careful with electric use. He also kept his oil boiler to heat water, using 100 gallons a year.
Babkirk's system costs $17,600 after tax credits and a state rebate. He's happy enough with the performance that he plans to add more panels and pull another 20 percent of his heat from the sun. Earlier this month, he hosted an open house that was part of a national tour of solar and energy-efficient homes.
"We wanted to let people see a regular house," he said.
The project was installed by ReVision Energy in Portland. The company has done more than a dozen PV-heat systems over the past year.
Most are in new construction, where heavy insulation can be installed from scratch. The company also favors newly developed air-source heat pumps that work well in Maine's cold climate, and cost roughly $4,000.
"It has opened the door to these opportunities, which seemed remote in 2008," said Fortunat Mueller, a partner.
Homeowners looking to heat with solar electricity need a frugal refrigerator, washing machine and lights. If they can cut their power demand to around 265 kilowatt hours a month, they can do a lot of the job with a 3.5 kilowatt PV system. That would cost roughly $14,000 after tax credits and rebates, Mueller estimated, plus the cost of one of two heat pumps.
"For that you are essentially prepaying your entire electric and fuel bill for the life of the home," he said. "It is pretty amazing."
Solar hot water, heated with thermal collectors, is a different story.
Hot water panels remain cheaper than solar electric. But in Maine, the panels produce more hot water in the summer than most homes need, and not enough in winter. Hot water can't be stored indefinitely, and there's no way to bank the energy in the form of utility credits.
These factors have tipped the balance away from solar hot water in Maine, in Inoue's view. Mueller, however, isn't ready to make that break.
"I don't think we're at a point yet where solar thermal stops making sense," he said.
But another variable for hot water has entered the picture in recent years: Hybrid water heaters. Available now at home improvement stores, they look like conventional water heaters, but use heat-pump technology to warm water for a fraction of the cost. That's making solar-electric panels an option for heating water, too, Mueller said.

When one of the few survivors of Dutch elm disease showed signs of infestation, the city quickly started a plan to save it.

WATERVILLE - There were once hundreds, perhaps thousands, of elm trees here. Hence the nickname "The Elm City."

KEEPING TREES HEALTHY
Tim Lindsay, an arborist for Bartlett Tree Experts in Maine, says the work his company is doing on the large elm in downtown Waterville is also a reminder for others.
Homeowners and business owners should keep an eye on trees on their property and take steps to keep them healthy.
For example, a tree's root flares should be left exposed and not covered with soil and mulch, he said.
"Everybody's doing the volcano mulching. It looks like the Acme tree company from 'The Road Runner' -- put the seed in the ground and the volcano appears and up pops the tree," Lindsay said. "That kills the tree, indirectly. It weakens it, interrupts the exchanges of gases. It creates soft bark. I do see that a lot."
The elms reached their pinnacle in Waterville during the 1930s, according to published reports, but their numbers were drastically cut by the 1960s and '70s. Today, city officials believe there are just a handful of large mature elms remaining.
The primary culprit has been Dutch elm disease, which -- combined with urban development and a lack of regular tree maintenance -- has wiped out scores of elms in Maine and elsewhere.
In Waterville, there's a mammoth survivor in the heart of downtown. Looming in Castonguay Square right outside City Hill, at about 75 feet tall and 125 years old, is one of the last of the city's large American elms.
City officials are taking steps to keep the elm around for another 125 years.
"I grew up in the city and I knew the 'Elm City' nickname," said City Manager Mike Roy. "Of course, it's a tragic thing what's happened to all our elms, and I think our nickname has faded in the background. This one, it may not be the last in the city, but I believe it's by far the biggest."
Roy said when he became Waterville's city manager seven years ago, he was struck by the beauty of the large elm in the public park. About two years ago, Roy said he noticed some of the elm's upper limbs were dying, with their leaves turning a harsh, unhealthy yellow, known as flagging.
"That really worried me and got me to thinking that it would be a shame to watch it being cut down," Roy said.
Enter Tim Lindsay, an arborist with Bartlett Tree Experts. On Oct. 14, Lindsay arrived with a small crew and spent the day pruning dead branches as the first step in a plan to keep the elm healthy.
Lindsay said the thinning of tree limbs prevents damage from rubbing and enables wind to pass through the tree more easily instead of pushing against it.
He chose to do the work during the fall because the summer is when elm bark beetles are most active and most likely to be attracted to the bleeding sap caused by pruning. Those beetles carry Dutch elm disease, a fungus that attacks the tree's vascular system and ultimately causes wilting and death.
"Once it gets into the tree, it gets into the vascular system pretty darn quick -- probably once you see the tree start flagging, within a year, two at the most, that tree is gone," Lindsay said. "It's much like our circulatory system. What happens is the fungus clogs up the vascular system, shuts down branches, and typically in July you'll see branches turn bright yellow."
He said when the flagging appears, "you drop everything and remove the flagged limbs."
Arborists have learned a lot since Dutch elm disease arrived in the United States 60 to 70 years ago, Lindsay said. For instance, the roots of a row of elms along a street will typically graft, and when the disease hits one of them "it just goes right down the line, and that's the biggest thing (people) didn't realize."
"Now, you have this one solitary tree. This is in good shape, because you don't see many elms around," he said. "What happens is the beetles get started in one tree, and if it's weak, it predisposes it to bring the insects in. Then, that's kind of a launching point for the disease to go from that tree to other ones."
Aside from branch pruning, the elm is also receiving a prescription soil treatment, supplying it with key nutrients.
"What we did is called prescription fertilizer: We take a soil sample, send it to the lab, they know it's an American elm, they check in the database and say, 'This is what you need,"' Lindsay said. "We show up and that's what we give the tree, rather than your typical 10-10-10 fertilizer. Everybody uses that, or maybe something similar. Well, it may not need as much phosphorus. It made need trace elements -- magnesium, zinc."
To deter the disease from taking hold of the elm in Castonguay Square, Lindsay's crew will return in the spring to inoculate the tree with a fungicide, a process known as a root flare injection. If the disease gets into the tree, the fungicide shuts the disease down, Lindsay said.
That injection lasts two to three years and must be done regularly thereafter in order to be effective.
The pruning, soil treatment and fungicide is costing the city about $1,700.
"It's an investment," Lindsay said. "You're going to hear public outcry if you lose this tree, so as a result you're kind of forced to take those precautionary actions to treat the tree. This tree's in really good shape."
Other massive elms have not been so lucky.
The day after the elm tree work in Waterville, Lindsay and his crew were in Scarborough to cut down a 200-year-old elm nicknamed Elsa along U.S. Route 1.
A 215-year-old, 110-foot elm known as Herbie was cut down in Yarmouth because of Dutch elm disease in January 2010.
Roy concedes the investment is no guarantee that the elm outside City Hall won't also one day suffer the same fate. But the steps that are being taken are important ones toward preservation, he said.
"It is our heritage," Roy said. "I think we have a responsibility to do everything we can."

SACO - A Maine man was honored this afternoon for racking up more than 1 million miles on his 1990 Honda Accord.
Joe LoCicero, 53, who lives in Norway, is the first person documented by the car manufacturer to have driven a Honda to the million-mile mark, according to a company spokeswoman.
Honda and Darling Auto Group sponsored a parade down Main Street and gave LoCicero a 2012 Honda Accord.
"I like it," LoCicero said, grinning as he sat in the new model of his Ohio-made car, which he nicknamed "True Blue."
Known as "Million Mile Joe" through a recent advertising and web campaign, LoCicero is a master auto technician who travels throughout Maine, New Hampshire and Vermont inspecting vehicles for warranty claims and lease terms.
The carmaker's ad agency chose downtown Saco to hold and film the celebration because of its classic New England appearance.
LoCicero bought his Honda in 1996, when it had 74,000 miles on it. He kept it running through diligent maintenance, he said.
LoCicero's Honda traveled about 48,000 miles per year. The average car travels 10,000 to 15,000 miles per year.
The electronic odometer in LoCicero's car turned over 1 million miles on Thursday. Now, it says he's driven 75 miles.
"I'm starting all over," LoCicero said.

Jonah DeWaters of Oak Point Associates works on a replica of West Quoddy Head Light during the Canstruction competition. The sculptures will remain on display through Friday's art walk. Canstruction is an international nonprofit with contests around the globe to create sculptures with canned goods.
A team from the Oak Point Associates architectural firm put the estimate at about 2,000 units.
The team, including Kim Roseberry, Jonah DeWaters, Nick DeFries, Kirsten Moorhead and Andie Boorman, stacked white cans of potatoes and red cans of olives in alternating rows to create the red and white stripes in imitation of the iconic lighthouse in Lubec.
They were one of five teams competing Saturday in Maine's first Canstruction competition. Canstruction is an international nonprofit organization with similar events taking place around the globe, bringing together architects, contractors, designers and engineers to create elaborate sculptures with canned goods.
The sculptures are displayed for a period of time and then the cans are distributed to local food pantries. Cans from Biddeford's competition will be donated to Friends of Community Action's food pantry, which has been struggling to stay open because of a decrease in donations during a down economy.
When members of the Oak Point Associates team agreed to participate in the competition, they wanted to make something representative of Maine, but DeWaters said a lobster was too hard.
"But a lighthouse is part of the architectural heritage of Maine," said teammate Moorhead.
Saturday's event was organized by local arts nonprofit organization Engine with help from the Maine chapter of the American Institute of Architects. It seemed like the perfect combination of art, community involvement and social responsibility to bring to Biddeford, said Tammy Ackerman, the organization's executive director.
"This project pairs art and design with social consciousness and is exactly the type of event we like to promote alongside more traditional art and design events in Biddeford," she said.
Each team had its own approach to the competition.
While the Oak Point Associates team sketched out its design, contemplated how to stack the cans and estimated how many cans it would need, another team in an empty storefront on Alfred Street had a different approach.
Wright-Pierce and Richardson & Associates, the two companies working on the city's RiverWalk project, joined forces on team RiverWalk. Members wore handmade T-shirts as they worked from a crude sketch to replicate the RiverWalk project in the window front.
"We called it a canscape," said team member Emma Kelly. "It's just such a cool opportunity ... to think of a creative strategy to bring activity downtown and build something for the town."
A team from Harriman was also working in the Alfred Street storefront. Teams from Caleb Johnson Architects and Port City Architecture were at a third location on upper Main Street.
The sculptures will remain on display through Friday's art walk and awards will be announced during a reception starting at 5:30 that evening at 265 Main St.
The organization is soliciting votes from the public: Email your favorite to Ackerman at director@feedtheengine.org or text message 229-3560. The People's Choice will be announced at the reception. Admission to the reception is at least one can of food.

BIDDEFORD - Teams of architects, contractors, designers and engineers have gathered at various storefronts this morning to construct sculptures out of cans.
Each team has until 8 p.m. tonight to finish their sculpture as part of the Canstruction competition. This is the first Maine event as part of the international charitable competition, which showcases the teams' talents through the sculptures.
Today's event has been organized by local arts nonprofit organization Engine, partnering with the Maine chapter of the American Institute of Architects. Shaw's Supermarkets is the lead sponsor of the event. Cans used in the sculptures will later be donated to Friends of Community Action's 30-year-old food pantry.
"This project pairs art and design with social consciousness, and is exactly the type of event we like to promote alongside more traditional art and design events in Biddeford," said Engine Executive Director Tammy Ackerman.
Five teams started their work at 8 a.m. this morning. Sculptures are being set up in North Dam Mill, 25 Alfred St. and 311 Main St. The finished products will be on display through next week, allowing the public to have the opportunity to view them and vote for "People's Choice." Winners will be announced during an awards ceremony starting at 5:30 p.m. Friday at 265 Main St., which can be attended for the donation of at least one nonperishable food item.
Winners of the local contest will go on to compete in the international competition.

HARVEST ON THE HARBOR
HARVEST ON THE HARBOR concludes today at Ocean Gateway in Portland with two sessions of "Savory Samplings at the Marketplace," featuring 160 food artisans, wineries, breweries, distilleries, Maine-made products and more. The first session will run from noon to 2:30 p.m., followed by a session from 4 to 6:30 p.m. Each session costs $45. For more information and to purchase tickets, visit harvestontheharbor.com.
The competition is a highlight of Harvest on the Harbor, a three-day food-and-wine festival at Ocean Gateway that began Thursday and ends today. Reagan won with his Slow Poached Lobster Tail Nipponese, a dish he said could easily be made at home.
The dish is a lobster tail slow-poached in a lemon butter sauce and perched atop a rice cake, served with orange miso coleslaw dressing.
"I think it looks like fireworks on the plate, and I hope it tastes like a celebration in your mouth," Reagan told the people in the audience, who got to taste each of the three finalists' dishes and vote on their favorite.
The other chefs who competed for the title of Maine Lobster Chef of the Year were Kristian Burrin of the Seasons of Stonington Restaurant, who prepared a trio of Maine lobster rolls, and Ryan Campbell of the Lake Parlin Lodge and Cabins, who made a Maine Lobster "Menage a Trois," or Maine Lobster Three Ways.
"The voting this year was incredibly tight," said Dane Somers, executive director of the Maine Lobster Promotion Council, just before he announced the winner.
Mary Stocher of Scarborough, who attended the contest with her mother, Cynthia Chase, cast her vote for Reagan.
"All three were excellent," Stocher said. "I liked the fact that I could sit down and have a whole meal of (Reagan's dish) and I wouldn't get tired of it. It was just amazing."
Her mother voted for Campbell's dish.
Reagan won the $1,000 grand prize; the other chefs took home $500 each.
"I'm so pleased," Reagan said after his name was announced. "Thank you all very much. I hope you liked my meal. Make it at home (and) email me if you need help."
Reagan, who is a Mason, was sponsored in the competition by Arundel Lodge No. 76, which counts among its members many lobstermen.
The chefs weren't the only ones who got checks. Barbara Whitten, president of the Greater Portland Convention & Visitors Bureau, handed out $500 scholarships to four culinary students from Southern Maine Community College who helped behind the scenes at the event.

Texto completo: Well testing grant rejected by state panel
The new review panel is a LePage administration initiative to help prioritize spending, a member says.
By Mechele Cooper mcooper@centralmaine.com
Staff Writer
A new state review panel rejected a $70,000 grant request that would have funded a public information campaign to promote testing of private wells.
Nearly half of all Mainers get their drinking water from private wells -- the highest proportion in the country.
The Department of Health and Human Services' Grant Application Review Team, established in March, is a LePage administration initiative to prioritize spending and "make sure every dollar is as effectively and efficiently spent as it can be," said Chris Pierce, deputy commissioner of finance for the DHHS and a member of the panel.
Pierce said LePage believes the cost of administering hundreds of millions of dollars in state contracts each year is too high, especially in the DHHS. That prompted changes in how the department applies for grants.
He said the review team has considered 52 grant requests since March. Only four have been turned down.
One was a request by Andy Smith, the state toxicologist, to apply for a $70,000 federal grant to enhance surveillance of unregulated drinking water.
With geological conditions that have shown high levels of some naturally occurring toxins -- including arsenic, radon and uranium -- Mainers are vulnerable to adverse health effects from drinking well water.
In September, a Kennebec Journal report citing U.S. Geological Survey data showed that a high proportion of Kennebec County's private wells had more arsenic than federal standards allow in public water supplies, with as many as 15,000 residents at risk for health problems.
Pierce said the review panel rejected Smith's request because it felt Maine had made progress in getting people to test their wells.
"We have been able to increase the number of households that examined their wells for arsenic from 23 percent to 50 percent and we thought that we were making significant, steady progress over the course of time," Pierce said.
"We understand how important this is, and this doesn't diminish the initiative at all. We are looking at all tax dollars. Do we really need another grant?" he said.
The decision chafed Steve Taylor, program director for the Environmental Health Strategy Center in Portland, who said it's a "no brainer" to use federal resources when possible in this era of limited public funding.
"Health effects linked to arsenic not only include damage to the digestive tract and heart, but scientific studies also link arsenic to skin, bladder and lung cancer," Taylor said Friday. "The health effect of drinking water with arsenic and other contaminants is very serious."
Pierce said that if the grant had been approved, the funding would have run out in two years. Then, he said, the state would have had to cover the cost.
"If you set up your infrastructure, you'll be stuck with doing the service," he said.
"It would be entrenched. ... That's a dangerous way to do business, and it does increase the cost of government," Pierce said.
But Taylor said an obvious course of action would be to accept federal support so Maine could expand its public information campaign, at least for a few years, without affecting the state budget.
Peter Garrett, vice president of Emery & Garrett Groundwater Inc. in Waterville and a consultant on ground water issues from Maine to Georgia, said information campaigns are essential, with so many "hot spots" in Maine.
"There's a hot spot in central Maine, and most people in that area will test. But I don't know about the rest (of the state)," he said.
John Peckenhan, assistant director of the George Mitchell Center for Environmental & Watershed Research, said Smith, the state toxicologist, is a source of expertise and the DHHS review team should have accepted his request.
"Anything he thinks is important to do, I would say we should do it," Peckenhan said.

U.S. News: Mill Towns Now Look to Saving Trees --- Some Residents Hope a Proposed National Park in Maine Will Replace Lost Jobs; Critics Fear Losing Industry Forever

Texto completo: EAST MILLINOCKET, Maine -- A millionaire's plan to donate 70,000 acres of Maine's storied North Woods for a national park will, depending on whom you ask, either save this struggling region or doom it.
After more than a century, East Millinocket's paper mill, the town's largest employer, closed in April. Nearly 60% of taxes collected by the town in 2010 came from the mill. Now, in a place whose motto is "the town that paper made," the library has gone from being open five full days a week to two half days; the dump is down to three days from six; and the elementary school is being moved into a wing of the high school.
"It's a one-horse town and it's time to diversify, perhaps," Shirley Tapley, the town administrator, said as she gazed out of her office window at the idle mill. "That's why, the national park, there's interest in it now."
Roxanne Quimby, who founded Burt's Bees cosmetics and sold off the company for more than $300 million between 2003 and 2007, wants to give 70,000 acres of forest she owns in northern Maine to the U.S. government for a national park.
Many residents say a park would bring visitors and spawn tourism jobs, helping to offset the loss of the area's mills, which have been hit by competition from China, declining demand for paper in the digital age and rising energy costs. The mill in neighboring Millinocket closed in 2008, and the owner of both mills has said it will dismantle them for scrap unless the state can find a buyer by July 31.
"If something don't happen down here, we're dead," said John Dicentes, 72 years old and a retired mill machinist. "Even if the mills do come back, they ain't going to be open for any long-term period."
But Eugene Conlogue, the town manager of Millinocket, is holding out for a future for milling.
"They are like sharks that see blood in the water," he said of Ms. Quimby and park proponents as he paced the back of the Millinocket high-school auditorium on Monday, where about 200 residents had come to hear Ms. Quimby's plan. "The mills are down temporarily and they think it's time to strike with the national park."
Mr. Conlogue and other critics fear any federally run park would eventually spread, gobbling up prime timber land in the wood basket of Maine. The area could run out of timber for any future mills, he said.
Many in northern Maine have long been wary of publicly owned land. Residents and local sportsmen have generally been given open access to the working forests -- mostly owned by paper companies and other private parties -- and they fear the federal government would impose more restrictions on use.
"We would not have the next Yosemite -- we would have a catastrophe," said Mr. Conlogue.
Ms. Quimby counters that her land is a small chunk of northern Maine's 10 million acres of forest and that Congress would have to approve any expansion of the proposed park. She has also offered to donate a similar-size portion of land to the state to be used for snowmobiling, hunting and other activities not generally allowed in most national parks.
Millinocket is one of several rural Maine towns being jolted by an identity crisis as manufacturing jobs disappear. The state has lost almost 9,000, or 13%, of its jobs in the sector since 2007, according to Manufacturers' News Inc., an industrial publisher in Evanston, Ill.
Paper mills were drawn to northern Maine for its abundance of spruce trees, fir trees and water. Millinocket sprang up in 1901 around Great Northern Paper, then the largest paper company in the world. It opened a second mill in East Millinocket in 1906. At their peak in the 1980s, the mills employed more than 4,400, but by the time Great Northern went into bankruptcy in 2003, the work force was only 1,100.
Toronto-based Brookfield Asset Management Inc., a private-equity firm, bought the mills in 2003, hired about 650 workers and sank in $200 million in new equipment, said Dan Whyte, vice president of Brookfield.
But the volatility of the price of oil, needed to generate steam for the mills, prompted the company to close the Millinocket facility, he said. Then, in 2009, as the economy turned down, demand for coated paper used in advertising dropped, leading to closure in East Millinocket.
Brookfield has offered to sell both mills for $1 if the state can find a buyer by the end of July. The office of Maine's Republican Governor Paul LePage has met with more than a dozen interested parties and is "cautiously optimistic," even after one letter-of-intent recently fell through, said John Butera, the governor's senior economic adviser.
Meanwhile, Ms. Quimby is pushing her dream. On 2016, the 100th anniversary of the national park system, she wants to donate her land between Mount Katahdin and the Penobscot River along the border of Baxter State Park.
The U.S. National Park Service hasn't taken a position on her plan, but likes the idea of another park in the populous Northeast, said David Barna, a spokesman for the agency. Still, Maine's congressional delegation has told Ms. Quimby she must first secure local support.
At Monday night's meeting, some locals handed out stickers saying "Keep Maine Free! No More Government Land."
But David Moore, who is 58 and was laid off from the mill in April after 40 years, wasn't convinced.
"If we want to stay here, something has got to happen," he said. "We need something that is going to pay our budgets and pave our roads."

Texto completo:   SOUTH PORTLAND, Maine -- Across the state, bummed bibliophiles are lamenting the pending closure of Borders bookstores.
"My husband and I love books -- we don't know where we're going to get them now," Maureen Best of Portland said Tuesday after shopping at the South Portland Borders next to the Maine Mall.
"There's such an experience about going into a place, picking out what you're going to get -- it's a totally different experience online."
Inside the store, Best said, employees were acknowledging that the business would be closing its doors -- some saying as soon as Friday.
"It's just sad," she added.
The Ann Arbor, Mich.-based Borders Group on Monday afternoon agreed to submit a previously announced liquidation plan to the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan on Thursday. The company operates 399 stores and employs approximately 10,700 workers.
Borders' attempt to stay alive unraveled last week after a $215 million bid by a private-equity firm dissolved under objections from creditors and lenders. They argued the chain would be worth more if it liquidated immediately.
Now the chain's remaining stores could be shuttered by September.
Borders has three stores in Maine: in South Portland, in Bangor by the Bangor Mall and in Brunswick. It also operates a Waldenbooks at the Auburn Mall.
On Tuesday, Heather and Chris Dinwiddie of Hampden said Tuesday they visit the Bangor store at least once every week to pick through the large selection of magazines.
"This was our routine every week, and now it's going to be empty," said Heather Dinwiddie, who, with her husband, signed up for the Borders loyalty rewards program just a few months ago.
"Now it doesn't look like we'll get any use out of what we paid to join," she said.
Sharon Thibault of Litchfield said she and her husband drop into Borders near the Maine Mall whenever they're in the Portland area.
"I think it's too bad, but it's kind of inevitable," Thibault said.
There has been a significant increase in the availability of books online, she said. People can buy paper books through a retailer such as Amazon or download an e-copy on any of the readers out there, among them Nooks and Kindles, she noted. Thibault said she does both often, and also shops at Borders or the Barnes & Noble in Augusta.
The online option is not only convenient, she said, but is also ideal for finding uncommon books, such as one she recently tracked down from her childhood, "The Digging-Est Dog" by Al Perkins.
The online option isn't for everyone, though.
"It's unfortunate that electronic media has really pushed print media to the side," said Mark Rustin of Newburgh, who was one of several shoppers at the Bangor store Tuesday trying to use up old gift cards that might soon lose their worth. "It's a sign of the times, and I don't think it's a good one."
The Bangor and South Portland stores were consistently among the top-performing branches for Borders, according to Charlie Longo, a Bangor city councilor who worked at Borders for two years. He left last week to start a job at a new store in town.
He said the Bangor store, which has about 30 employees, received awards and was recognized by the company as one of the top-50 Borders stores in the nation.
"Hopefully this will be a blessing in disguise," Longo said, explaining that he hopes another business will move into the Borders building after the bookstore closes. "I just wish everybody [his former co-workers] the best."
Adam Fisher, spokesman for the Maine Department of Labor, said the agency will be working with Borders to schedule Rapid Response sessions for the affected workers. Given what a Borders spokesman said about the average number of employees at Borders and Waldenbooks stores, there would be a range of employees in Maine from about 72 to 137.
That number fluctuates, said Fisher.
"As with most large retailers, they have seasonal swings in their employment levels -- most notably during the holiday shopping period of November and December," he said.
The Rapid Response workshops will provide participants with information on CareerCenter services to help them find jobs or access training, unemployment benefits, health care resources, and other services for laid-off workers, Fisher said.
Maine felt the effect of another national chain closing when Circuit City shuttered in 2009. According to Fisher, the company had about 35 employees in the store near the Bangor Mall. Stores in South Portland and Augusta also closed. The Bangor store remains mostly vacant, although it is used off and on; the former South Portland store is now home to a massive Goodwill store.
"Like Circuit City, it may be a while before the Borders stores actually close. Employees may be kept on while the remaining stock is sold off by a liquidation firm," said Fisher. "We will be paying close attention to the schedule as we work on a plan to serve those workers."

Texto completo: AUGUSTA, Maine -- Sen. David Trahan, who last week was picked to lead a powerful sportsmen's lobbying group, plans to meet this week with Maine Ethics Commission staff to see if he can keep his Senate seat.
Scott Fish, spokesman for the Maine Senate Republicans, said Trahan wants to complete his term so he can continue working on tax reform, an issue the Waldoboro legislator has long championed.
"I think he wants to finish the session, but he wants to see if that is possible," Fish said Monday, speaking for Trahan, who was unavailable for comment.
Trahan has agreed in principle to become the executive director of the Sportsman's Alliance of Maine, replacing interim director Matthew Dunlap. Longtime SAM Executive Director George Smith stepped down in late 2010 as head of the 14,000-member organization.
SAM's board of directors has approved the hiring of Trahan but the details of his contract have not been ironed out.
Trahan had indicated he planned to resign in September, but Fish said that may not be the case.
Jonathan Wayne, executive director of Maine Ethics Commission, said lawmakers often ask his opinion about potential conflicts of interest, but he would not comment on any meeting with Trahan.
Nothing in state law prohibits a legislator from acting as a lobbyist, but Wayne said the ethics commission generally frowns upon the practice. A memo authored in 1986 by then-Assistant Attorney General William Stokes concludes that doing both would constitute a conflict of interest.
Trahan technically could get around the conflict by not registering as a lobbyist, but traditionally, the executive director of SAM has been the chief lobbyist on all things outdoors. Fish said other lawmakers have held influential positions, including former House Majority Leader John Piotti, D-Unity, who lead the Maine Farmland Trust while he was in the Legislature.
Jodi Quinitero, spokesman for the House Democrats, said Piotti never lobbied on behalf of Maine Farmland Trust.
If Trahan keeps his Senate seat, he may turn over SAM's lobbying duties to someone else. If he is advised that doing both would be a conflict, Trahan would resign from the Senate, according to Fish, and the process would begin for a special election.
Among those considered for Trahan's Senate seat, according to Maine Republican Party Chairman Charlie Webster, are: Rep. Dana Dow, R-Waldoboro, who held the seat from 2004 to 2008; and Rep. Jonathan McKane, R-Newcastle, who is serving his fourth term in the House.
Lizzy Reinholt, spokeswoman for the Maine Democrats, said her party is as interested in Trahan's seat as they would be in any seat but she didn't offer any names.
Trahan, 48, spent eight years in the House and is in the middle of his second Senate term. Among his accomplishments are working to establish the Office of Program Evaluation and Government Accountability, a state watchdog office, and working last year to repeal a Democratic tax plan.
He also led an unsuccessful effort to present voters with a proposed constitutional amendment to earmark a portion of Maine's sales tax for the Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife and the Department of Marine Resources. Trahan and other supporters argued that the state has failed to live up to its funding obligations and many Maine residents -- as well as tourists -- benefit from the services provided by the departments' game wardens and biologists but do not purchase licenses that finance the department.
So far, there already have been three special elections during the 125th Legislature:
• Rep. Beth Turner, R-Burlington, was elected in March to fill the seat left vacant when Rep. Everett McLeod, R-Lee, died in December.
• Rep. Cynthia Dill, D-Cape Elizabeth, was elected in May to fill the seat of Sen. Larry Bliss, D-South Portland, who stepped down in March to take a job in California.
• Democrat Kimberly Monaghan-Derrig and Republican Nancy Thompson will face off in an Aug. 16 special election to fill Dill's vacant House seat.

Texto completo: A Republican lawmaker from the midcoast who has been a major player in debates over hunting, fishing and outdoor recreation plans to resign his Senate seat later this year to take over the top staff position at the Sportsman's Alliance of Maine.
Sen. David Trahan, R-Waldoboro, received the unanimous support of SAM's board of directors on Thursday to become the next executive director of the state's largest advocacy group for sportsmen. Trahan indicated he likely would vacate his Senate seat and begin with SAM in September, replacing former Secretary of State and SAM board member Matt Dunlap, who has been serving as interim executive director since January.
"It's something I'm very passionate about," Trahan said in an interview Thursday evening. "I got involved in politics as a sportsman."
A logger by trade who was elected to six terms in the Legislature, Trahan is well known among Maine's sporting community as well as inside Republican circles along the midcoast.
He is a longtime member of the Legislature's Inland Fisheries and Wildlife Committee and a former member of the Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife's Advisory Council.
During the legislative session that just ended, he helped shepherd through the process language changes that eventually could funnel more money from the Land for Maine's Future program to protect winter habitat for deer.
He also led an unsuccessful effort to present voters with a proposed constitutional amendment to earmark a portion of Maine's sales tax for the DIF&W and the Department of Marine Resources. Trahan and other supporters argued that the state has failed to live up to its funding obligations and many Maine residents -- as well as tourists -- benefit from the services provided by the departments' game wardens and biologists but do not purchase licenses that finance the department.
As SAM's executive director, Trahan said he would focus on encouraging investment in the state's fish hatcheries, restoring the deer herd and encouraging more young people to get involved in hunting, fishing and other outdoor activities.
Trahan can also be a dogged campaigner. He helped lead last year's controversial people's veto campaign that overturned a tax reform proposal passed by Democrats and signed by former Gov. John Baldacci. And this year as co-chairman of the Taxation Committee, he helped craft a tax cut package that was incorporated into the two-year, $6.1 billion budget that took effect this month.
Dunlap said SAM board members asked Trahan questions about his priorities as executive director and how he would work in Augusta.
"They all know him pretty well from his work in the Legislature and they loved his answers," Dunlap said. "There is no question they wanted him for the job."
Trahan will take over leadership of a 14,000-member organization that has struggled both financially and administratively in recent years. Former longtime executive director George Smith -- who was the public face of and fierce lobbyist for SAM -- stepped down in late 2010 after it became clear that the board and Smith had different ideas about the job.
Smith's successor lasted only a few months, however, and Dunlap was hired after the new, Republican-controlled Legislature selected Republican Charlie Summers Jr. to be secretary of state.
Dunlap said he agreed to take over at SAM in order to help put the organization on more stable financial and administrative footing. He notified the board that he did not desire to remain as the permanent executive director, however. A former Democratic state lawmaker, Dunlap is considering running in 2012 for the U.S. Senate seat now held by Republican Sen. Olympia Snowe.
Trahan will have to resign his Senate seat because a major part of the SAM executive director's job is lobbying the Legislature.
On Thursday, Trahan said he plans to consult with the Maine Ethics Commission about when and how he would resign his Senate seat. Because the GOP holds a sizable majority in the Senate, Trahan's departure will not affect the balance of power. A special election will be held to fill the position.
Trahan said, after 30 years in the physically demanding logging business, he felt it was time to seek other employment for health reasons.
But the Waldoboro Republican also expressed disappointment in the political climate in Maine. Without naming names, Trahan said he believed he had been "treated very poorly" by some within his own party and within the tea party movement over certain issues. Moderate Republicans were also the targets of unfair treatment, he said.
In the closing days of the legislative session, Trahan was blasted by some members of the tea party for his bill proposing a constitutional amendment to earmark part of the sales tax for the two natural resources agencies.
The aggressive campaign against the bill appeared to succeed in turning the tide against a measure that had strong support from sportsmen's groups, including SAM, as well as environmental organizations and some GOP legislative leaders.
While describing himself as thick-skinned, Trahan said vitriolic attacks were discouraging and were hard on his family.
"The tone ... of politics today is very harsh and it did play a role in my decision to do something different," he said.

Texto completo:   NORTH CAROLINA 'SLACK-PACKING'
HOT SPRINGS, N.C. Slack-packers -- it's a nickname that is not affectionately bestowed, but it's one an old friend and I now proudly wear after a long weekend hiking on the Appalachian Trail in western North Carolina.
The 22 miles we covered during two days near Asheville hardly seemed scoff-worthy. With long strenuous climbs through deep woods and sometimes steep, rocky and twisty terrain, in nearly six-hour stretches, stopping only briefly for water or snack breaks, it was exhilarating. We did make one indulgence though, spending both nights in hotel rooms rather than sleeping bags under the stars.
Even so, we can still claim to be among the more than 2 million people who experience some part of the trail each year. The most revered are "through-hikers," trekking the entire 2,181-mile distance nonstop over some four to six months between Georgia and Maine.
Hard-core hikers consider those who stick to day hikes, with the night spent in town rather than a tent, slackers. My friend and I -- she a marathoner, me an avid exerciser and tennis player, both in our early 50s -- beg to differ. For those without the time to spend half a year in the wilderness, day hikes are a great alternative.
Our home base was the tiny Blue Ridge mountain town of Hot Springs, near the Tennessee border. It's a 45-minute drive from Asheville, where our planes -- from Chicago and New York -- landed minutes apart. Asheville is a lively, artsy mountain city well worth a visit itself. But hiking was our goal, so after picking up our rental car and stopping for a delicious lunch of quiche and salads at Asheville's vegetarian-friendly Early Girl Eatery, we headed up curvy Route 25 to Hot Springs.
The town sits at the confluence of the French Broad River and Spring Creek, and is named after natural mineral hot springs bubbling up from those waters. Privately owned for more than two centuries, the springs site has housed a series of resort hotels promoting the water's supposed healing powers and drawing tourists year round.
The Appalachian Trail is the other big draw, and one of the region's main economic drivers.
The trail literally runs smack through Hot Springs, and the Appalachian Trail's diamond-shaped logo can be found in Hot Springs on the sidewalk that runs along Bridge Street, the main drag. The street is even marked with a couple of the trail's familiar white blazes, more commonly found on trees and rocks in the woods, at the turnoff where the trail and the street diverge.
Hot Springs an oasis
The trail ascends into the mountains on either side of town. Most through-hikers start in early spring in the south, at Springer Mountain, Ga., and make their way up to Maine's Mount Katahdin, though you can do it in either direction. The route runs across the railroad tracks in Hot Springs, over a bridge straddling a wide, inviting-looking stretch of the French Broad, and alongside the river for less than a mile before climbing up more than 1,000 feet to Lovers' Leap Rock and beyond.
Through-hikers starting in Georgia generally hit Hot Springs after about three weeks on the trail, and for many, it becomes a mini-oasis.
"There aren't that many places where they walk right through the middle of civilization," said innkeeper Pete Nagle, a member of the town's tourism association and owner the Mountain Magnolia Inn.
It was sunny and hot in early June when we hit the trail, and we were grateful to take off into the shade of the woods. Deep groves of rhododendrons as tall as trees, gloriously blooming shades of pale pink and white, punctuated the deciduous forest. Songbirds and our boots hitting the dirt were the only sounds.
We saw little wildlife other than squirrels, but the woods were so deep and silent I sometimes felt certain that bears were lurking around each bend. The only other threat I feared were thunderstorms forecast the same day we perhaps foolishly decided to hike a 12-mile stretch that included Max Patch, a 4,629-foot bald peak covered in pasture grass, with breathtaking views of the surrounding mountains, including the Great Smokies in the distance. I just knew my friend's metal hiking sticks would make us lightning magnets, but the rain held off until we got back to town.
Meeting through-hikers
We also saw surprisingly few other hikers. On the first full day, heading north out of Hot Springs, we trekked two hours before encountering other people. They were through-hikers, a married couple from Friendswood, Texas, and we listened rapt as they shared their story.
Paul Koll, 62, and his 58-year-old wife, Eva, had been on the trail for almost 300 miles and just over one month since starting April 30 in Georgia. They'd conquered the highest point on the entire trail -- Clingman's Dome in Tennessee's Great Smokies, elevation 6,643 feet, and despite countless bug bites and sore feet wrapped in moleskin, Eva, a travel nurse when she's not hiking, was almost giddy. That lofty dome "was like, lickety split, nothin'," she said.
We had booked rooms at the Iron Horse Station Inn, a charmingly renovated old brick restaurant-hotel with hardwood floors, Persian carpets, and 15 very pleasant rooms on the second story, all with private baths.
While Nagle's handsome Mountain Magnolia Inn tends to draw older backpackers seeking an upscale respite, many other hikers spend a night or two at the cheap, homey and hostel-like Sunnybank Inn, also known as Elmer's and housed in a gorgeous old white house set back from Bridge Street.
Hot Springs Resort and Spa, the current owners of the town's namesake waters, includes several private outdoor hot tubs, or mineral baths, with hourly rates starting at $12 an hour.
We left town somewhat wistfully, but refreshed, invigorated -- and vowing to slack-pack again soon on another section of the Appalachian Trail.

Albert "Bert" Ziegra passed away Thursday (July 7, 2011) after a brief illness, on his own terms, at peace with God. At the conclusion of his life on earth, Bert was under the extraordinary care of the team at The New McLean in Simsbury, who helped him pass comfortably and with dignity. Bert was born July 3, 1926 the third son of Louis R. Ziegra and Olive Wells Ziegra, in Deep River, Connecticut. Bert was predeceased by his mother, father and older brother Louis R. Ziegra, Jr., formally of Alton, New Hampshire and his nephew Sumner R. Ziegra, Jr. of Deptford, New Jersey. Bert is survived by his loving wife of 62 years, Natalie Mislick Ziegra of Simsbury; his brother Sumner R. Ziegra and his wife Marie of Washington Crossing, Pennsylvania; daughters Hope Ziegra of Canton, Connecticut and Lucia Ziegra of Simsbury, Connecticut; sons A. Wells Ziegra, Jr. of South Dartmouth, Massachusetts and Jonathan Ziegra and his wife Jennifer of Boothbay, Maine. Most important to Bert were his grandchildren of whom he was most proud. They are: Samantha Ziegra and Joshua Ziegra of South Dartmouth, Massachusetts and Carolyn Ziegra and Heidi Ziegra of Boothbay, Maine. Bert was a part of America's Greatest Generation. Within days of his graduation from Deep River High School, Bert joined his two older brothers in the Navy, proudly serving in the Pacific Theater of Operations during the latter half of World War II as a quartermaster aboard the USS Montour and post-war as a crewman on the USS Red Oak Victory. Later in his life, Bert, along with his wife Natalie, enjoyed many reunions with his war-time comrades. After the war, Bert attended Trinity College earning his Bachelor Degree followed quickly with a Master's Degree from Syracuse University. During his time at Syracuse University Bert discovered his love for teaching, ultimately relocating to Simsbury, Connecticut in 1951 where he began teaching chemistry and biology at Simsbury High School. Bert later taught at Hall High School in West Hartford, The Institute of Living in Hartford, and concluded his career teaching in the classical program at Hartford Public High School. Bert was a die-hard New York Giants and Boston Red Sox fan, instilling an almost fanatical love for both teams in his children and grandchildren. However, Bert's real joy was following his grandchildren's sports teams as well as keeping up-to-date with their performing arts and scholastic achievements. In his retirement he and Natalie travelled extensively in the U.S. and Canada. From Alaska to Florida to Maine to Hawaii and many places in between, he took time to enjoy the country he loved so much. Bert touched the lives of countless people with his wit, generosity, and maintained his trademark dry sense of humor all the way to the end.
Friends and family are invited to attend calling hours on Sunday, July 10, 2011 from 4-7 p.m. at the Vincent Funeral Home, 880 Hopmeadow Street in Simsbury.

Texto completo:   Final Word
Most of us know by now that good advice can show up in the oddest of places.
I was visiting friends on the coast of Maine the other day -- York Harbor --and I decided to take a walk along the ocean. By myself. That's the good thing about the ocean. You don't need anyone else. In fact, you don't want anyone else.
There's a quirky little path that leads from the town's tiny beach -- the Cliff Walk -- and winds its way above the ocean, taking you up and down rocks and across stretches of pebbles. When you walk it, you understand what a billy goat must feel like. I have been doing such exercises lately to exercise my bum leg that was injured in my encounter with a car last year.
The Cliff Walk is not well-worn this time of year, and it had rained the night before, so the path was overgrown, the rocks slippery. In short it wasn't the stroll along the beach I had hoped. It was work.
I had gotten quite a ways down the path when it hit me that maybe I should turn back. Call it a day, return to the beach, sit on a rock and watch the solitary surfer who was wisely dressed in a wet suit, waiting for that perfect wave.
It was then I came upon a couple walking toward me. The path is so narrow you can't avoid oncoming traffic. They stepped aside, into a bush, and waved me on.
Had I even made it to the halfway point, I wondered aloud? Should I turn around, I asked?
It was then the man spoke his wisdom.
"You can't turn back now. You've come too far."
And he was right. There are times in life we all want to turn back. Sometimes we do, only to realize later it was a mistake. We didn't forge on. We retreated.
For years I've had a quote from poet Annie Johnson Flint pinned over my desk.
For some reason it speaks to me, just as the man on the path spoke to me the other day.
Have you come to the Red Sea place in your life,
Where, in spite of all you can do,
There is no way out, there is no way back,
There is no other way but through?
Getting down that path isn't always easy. We stumble. We fall. But we get up and march on.
A couple of years ago, Brian H. Peterson came out with a moving memoir, The Smile at the Heart of Things: Essays and Life Stories. He's back with more: The Blossoming of the World. He understands life's paths.
"If there's no wanting, chances are there won't be much growing and certainly no arriving," he writes.
You can't turn back now. You've come too far.

Texto completo: ST. PAUL, Minn. With New York now gearing up for same-sex weddings, the battle lines are forming for the next skirmishes over gay marriage and the most dramatic could come in Minnesota.
Gay-marriage supporters in the Land of 10,000 Lakes will be working fervently to end a 31-state losing streak at the polls and defeat a proposed amendment on the 2012 ballot that would limit marriage to one-man, one-woman unions.
It's expected to be a closely fought campaign, attracting extensive out-of-state resources.
The other side is certainly desperate for a victory at the ballot box. We expect to be outspent, said Jason Adkins, executive director of the Minnesota Catholic Conference and a member of the coalition supporting the amendment.
If the amendment passes, in a state viewed as politically moderate, foes of gay marriage will be able to claim that the New York Legislature's vote Friday to legalize same-sex marriage did not turn the tide nationally. Their side will have extended a winning streak dating to 1998, with opponents of same-sex marriage prevailing every time it has been put to a popular vote.
If the amendment is defeated, gay-marriage supporters will be able to make a strong case that public opinion has turned in their favor.
These ballot measures are so expensive and so divisive, said Monica Meyer, executive director of OutFront Minnesota, the state's biggest gay-rights group. If we can defeat this, it sends a strong message that at some point soon these things just aren't going to be brought up at all any more.
Thirty states have passed amendments banning gay marriage, while Maine voters in 2009 overturned a bill passed by the Legislature that would have legalized the practice. Where same-sex marriage is legal in New York, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Connecticut, Iowa, Vermont and the District of Columbia it came about through court orders or legislative action, not by popular vote.
Chuck Darrell of the Minnesota Family Council, which supports the proposed amendment, said the New York vote validated the concerns of Minnesota legislators who put the ban on next year's ballot.
Our Legislature wisely decided to let the people decide the issue of marriage not politicians, Darrell said.
Ann-Kaner Roth of Project 515, a Minnesota gay-rights group, said she and her fellow activists would take lessons from what happened in New York.
They were able to build such a broad-based coalition: Republicans, independents and Democrats, the business community all coming out very strongly in support of equality, Kaner-Roth said. Minnesota is really ripe for that kind of coalition-building.
The anti-amendment coalition is sure to include Democratic Gov. Mark Dayton, who was unable to keep the measure off the ballot but has vowed to campaign against it. He has already appeared at a fundraiser held by amendment opponents and marched in the Twin Cities gay-pride parade Sunday a first for a Minnesota governor.
Gay-marriage advocate Evan Wolfson, president of Freedom to Marry, anticipates an intense struggle in Minnesota.
Any time minority rights are put up to a majority vote, in the white-hot heat of nasty political exchanges, it's a dangerous situation, he said.
Another marriage battleground next year could be North Carolina. It is the only Southeastern state that hasn't yet approved an amendment restricting marriage to one man and one woman, but the GOP-controlled Legislature may try to put such a provision on the 2012 ballot.
Republicans would need help from a few conservative Democrats to advance the measure, and would also have to keep moderate Republicans in line.
Foes of gay marriage cite surveys indicating that more than 70 percent of North Carolinians support the amendment. However, an Elon University poll in February showed more than half of the state's residents favor some form of legal recognition of same-sex couples.
Numbers have borne out that attitudes on this issue are changing, particularly among independents, said Alex Miller of the gay-rights group Equality North Carolina.
In Maryland and Rhode Island, efforts to win legislative approval of same-sex marriage failed earlier this year. The long-term prospects in Rhode Island are unclear. But gay-rights activists in Maryland have vowed to try again next year.
People are energized by what happened in New York and eager to work with our supporters in Maryland state government to make the same thing happen here, said Patrick Wojahn, chairman of the Equality Maryland Foundation's board of directors. His group issued a national fundraising appeal on Monday.
Republican state Delegate Don Dwyer, who coordinated opposition to the measure in Maryland, said gay-rights activists underestimated the depth of the public sentiment against same-sex marriage in the heavily Democratic state.
The entire country expected Maryland to roll over this past session and pass the same-sex marriage bill, and that didn't happen, Dwyer said.
In Maine, when Democrats held power in 2009, the Legislature passed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage, but it was overturned in a referendum that fall, 53 percent to 47 percent. With Republicans now controlling the Legislature, gay-marriage supporters are patiently exploring their options. In one campaign, they are trying to have 40,000 one-on-one conversations with voters in hopes of changing minds.
Three states Delaware, Illinois and Hawaii enacted civil union laws in recent months that extend broad marriage-like rights to same-sex couples.
Brian Selander, a spokesman for Delaware Gov. Jack Markell, said he doubts there will be any immediate push to go a step further and emulate New York.
Considering that just two years ago it was still legal to be fired in Delaware for being gay, the fact that civil unions passed this session here is remarkable progress, Selander said. We have not heard any plans to introduce a marriage bill.
Of all the state-level developments, perhaps the most momentous could come soon in a ruling by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on California's Proposition 8, the measure approved by voters in 2008 that bans gay marriage in the state.
If the appeals court holds Prop 8 to be unconstitutional, and the nation's most populous state joins the list allowing same-sex marriages, pressure could escalate for action by Congress or the Supreme Court.

Miriam Claire Goodrich Levy
Miriam Claire Goodrich Levy went to her heavenly home on Friday, June 10, 2011. She was born in Brownsville, Tex. to Grover and Mable Goodrich on February 15, 1916. Miriam lived a long and happy life reaching her 95th birthday. She was preceded in death by her husband of 47 years, Michel Levy, as well as her brother, James Davis Goodrich, a grandson, David Michel Greene, and a granddaughter, Mary Francis Lee.
After growing up in Houston and marrying Michel, Miriam followed Michel from Army Post to Army Post. She was an exemplary mentor for officer's wives during World War II.

Good things come in small packages: Morrill builder specializes in small houses

Texto completo: MORRILL, Maine -- When builder Jim Bahoosh constructed a home for his partner, Martha Garfield, two years ago, the average size of a new house in the northeast United States was 2,594 square feet.
Bahoosh and Garfield went in a different direction -- smaller. Much smaller.
Their classic New England-style farmhouse tucked into more than three acres of field and forest off Route 131 is just 700 square feet.
But while less than a third the size of the average new home, the house doesn't feel tiny. Instead, it's built on a human-sized scale, Bahoosh said.
"I feel like you can get everything you want in this footprint. Everything you need," he said.
And for the couple, it has been true. Tucked into those 700 square feet is a full bathroom with a deep clawfoot tub, a galley kitchen with an oversized propane range, a dining nook and a cozy sunroom. Up a wooden staircase are two bedrooms, with one now being used as a combination guestroom and office space. Built-ins like bookshelves, closets and cupboards of all sizes are carefully fit into the house's angles and spaces under the eaves.
On an unseasonably chilly, rainy June day, the house feels warm and welcoming, with heat coming from a small-sized Jotul wood stove and tunes from WERU-FM filling the air. Despite the gloom outside, light streams in through both external and internal windows, brightening the home.
"I love it," Garfield said. "I love my house. I'm very happy with it."
She said she grew up in a drafty, 16-room house in Blue Hill, where she remembered always being cold.
"I wanted a cozy, warm place to live," she said.
She's got it, thanks to the small size of the house, the walls set with thick foam insulation, the efficient wood stove and radiant heat set into the floors.
Utility bills are low, they said. The first year, propane used to heat the house and to cook cost a total of $800. Electric bills are less than $20 per month.
"It's just pure physics," Bahoosh said. "It's a smaller home. It takes less to do everything."
That fits in nicely with one of the builder's primary philosophies.
"I like utilizing what's there. I don't like waste," he said.
Realizing that set Bahoosh on the path to being a builder specializing in small houses.  It was change from his earlier business model of buying, moving into, restoring and reselling "old wrecks." He had started doing that in 1983, after the one-time college geology major realized he had no interest in working for an oil company after graduation and began to search for work that would fulfill him.
Bahoosh read about a brand-new show on public television called "This Old House," and suddenly figured it out.
"I had one of those 'a-ha!' moments," he recalled. "I thought, that's exactly what I want to do."
He started out his new line of work in New York, where he's from, then began a northward migration that ended up in Brooklin several years ago. He also began shifting from renovating old homes to building new homes that looked old.
At that time, Bahoosh and his family were living in a 256-square foot house that he had built.
"It was so sweet," he said. "You can't help but interact in a small house."
He noticed that other builders in town were working on a "monstrous" house on the water, a fifth residence for a wealthy customer.
"A lot of people are really comfortable with [building large homes]," he said. "It's good work. It's solid work."
But, he realized, it's work that just wasn't for him. He wasn't okay with the waste that can be part of larger building projects. And, he said, even when he lived in larger houses that he was renovating, he ended up creating much smaller living spaces within the homes.
"I've started progressing to building these as small as I can," he said.
Today, Bahoosh has hung a shingle on Route 131 in Morrill, advertising his services as a builder specializing in small homes. In addition to the house where Garfield lives, he also constructed a small yellow house across a nearby field on speculation. It includes two full bathrooms, a porch and two or three bedrooms in its 800 square feet -- and quickly found a buyer, he said.
His business is just getting rolling, with new ideas coming from an Incubator Without Walls class he took over the winter through the Down East Business Alliance in Ellsworth.
According to Bahoosh, the small houses cost about $140 per square foot to build.
"Where small houses really shine, cost-wise, is living in them," he said. "They're smaller to heat, easier to maintain, and they take less time."

Resumen: The Maine Attorney General's Office is dealing with a number of complaints filed against Bangor Car Care -- the used car dealer known for its "Come join the party" advertising -- even as the business expands to new locations in Bangor and Lewiston. Brenda Kielty, spokeswoman for the Attorney General's Office, said a number of customers have filed complaints against Bangor Car Care in the past year, and a portion of those are in the midst of mediation in the agency's consumer division.

Texto completo:   BANGOR, Maine -- The Maine Attorney General's Office is dealing with a number of complaints filed against Bangor Car Care -- the used car dealer known for its "Come join the party" advertising -- even as the business expands to new locations in Bangor and Lewiston.
Brenda Kielty, spokeswoman for the Attorney General's Office, said a number of customers have filed complaints against Bangor Car Care in the past year, and a portion of those are in the midst of mediation in the agency's consumer division.
"There have been 18 complaints accepted for mediation in the last 12 months," she said. "Eight are unresolved, three have been resolved and there are seven in current mediation right now."
Glenn Geiser, general manager of Bangor Car Care, said a majority of his customers -- but not all -- drive away happy.
"Our major business at Bangor Car Care is special credit -- helping people who have been knocked down in their life," he said. "When you are dealing with these people you are bound to get a percentage of negative feedback."
He added, "We're dealing with everyone and sometimes the people we deal with aren't very nice and the minute something breaks they swear, throw things and scream."
Kielty said she did not know the total number of complaints received against Bangor Car Care and added she could release only the number accepted into the consumer division's mediation program.
For a comparison, the Bangor Daily News asked Kielty to check two other large used car dealers in Maine to see how many complaints have been filed with the AG's office in the last year. She said one of them had just one complaint that needed to be resolved, while the other had none.
Paula Fleming, the Better Business Bureau's vice president of communications and marketing, said last week that customers can leave both positive and negative comments with the agency.
"In this case there are no compliments," she said of Bangor Car Care. "There are 48 complaints and they have an 'F' rating."
The number of customers who complain about their service at Bangor Car Care is "a fraction of less than one percent," said Geiser. "The statistic itself and how little problems we have, especially dealing in a difficult [economic] market, stands for itself."
The business sells about 200 cars a month and since opening nine years ago has sold more than 13,000 cars, he said.
The percentage may be low, but some customers are very vocal and have posted their comments on websites dedicated to complaints, including complaintsboard.com, scaminformer.com, and ripoffreport.com, and someone even created a Facebook page, "Bangor Car Care sucks!" that features some colorful comments.
The Bangor Daily News contacted 21 of the people who posted comments on the Facebook page and none returned emails requesting interviews.
Geiser said he has heard it all before, and that he and his 35 employees are not going to be bullied by aggressive customers who threaten them.
"I don't like extortion or manipulation," he said. "The real issues we have, we deal with."
Geiser added: "We're not going to be manipulated and taken advantage of. Sometimes people will say something or demand something and I'm not willing to write a check to stop it."
In the two years before Bangor Car Care moved to Brewer in November 2008 from Oak Street in Bangor, police in the Queen City responded to the used car business about 81 times. Brewer police have been dispatched to the Wilson Street location 112 times, police officials have said. The incident reports from both communities list civil issues, requests for the removal of people, bad checks, assaults, citizen disputes, accidents and other complaints.
Geiser said if customers have a problem, he is the one to call.
"My extension is extension 15," he said. "And It's not a secret."
The car dealership, which is owned by Geiser's mother, Marilyn Geiser, has grown by about 23 percent in the last year and recently expanded back to Washington Street in Bangor, Geiser said.
"Basically, what happened is we outgrew the property in Brewer," he said. "We had 13 mechanics and we needed about 20."
The service portion of the business, which eventually will be called Bumper 2 Bumper, moved to the Queen City in January and cars were moved over in mid-May, said Geiser, who owns Bumper 2 Bumper.
"We are still operating an all truck and SUV lot in Brewer because the lot over here wasn't big enough," he said.
A new Bumper 2 Bumper in Lewiston opened last week on Lisbon Street, Geiser said. The former Lewiston Car Care closed after what Geiser described as "staffing issues." The new business has opened at the former Rowe Mitsubishi location and will be run by general manager and partner Dan Pulkkinen, Geiser said.
"It's kind of good to be expanding and doing more," he said.

Texto completo: CASTINE The State of Maine, the training vessel for Maine Maritime Academy, is scheduled to return to its home port on Sunday, winding up its annual 60-day training cruise.
The vessel, carrying 55 crew members and 230 students, is scheduled to arrive in Castine Harbor by 8 p.m. Sunday and to be tied up to the colleges dock by 8:30 p.m.
The cruise, under the command of Capt. Leslie B. Eadie III, covered about 11,000 nautical miles and included stops in Norfolk, Va.; Valetta, Malta; Civitavecchia, Italy (near Rome); and Cobh, Ireland. This is Eadies first cruise in command of the 500-foot vessel. He took over as master of the State of Maine, replacing longtime captain Larry Wade of Bradley, who retired this year.
On Thursday, the State of Maine was headed toward Portland, the final stop on its voyage before heading home. The ship is scheduled to arrive on Sunday in Portland where families of upper-class students will board the ship and sail on the final leg of the voyage to Castine.
The training cruise provides at-sea time for MMA students seeking U.S. Coast Guard licenses. Students travel on the training vessel at the end of their freshmen and junior years. Younger students rotate through different watches learning operations on board the ship while the older students have the responsibility of operating the vessel under the supervision of the professional crew.
During the summer after their sophomore year, MMA students ship out aboard commercial merchant vessels.
Although the ship will dock on Sunday, students will continue to work on board completing cruise activities until Tuesday, June 28.

Texto completo: Noonan named to hospital Board
Patricia Noonan recently was appointed as chair of the Martin Memorial Foundation Board of Directors.
Noonan has had a distinguished career as a writer and editor, as well as an executive of not-for-profit organizations. She has served as an editor and reporter for the Voice newspaper in Louisville, Ky., and the Portland Newspapers in Portland, Maine, and as a staffer on the United Nations' Africa Recovery Magazine.
She serves as a trustee of Roger Williams University and as an overseer at Boston's Huntington Theatre. She also has sat on the boards of other philanthropic and civic organizations, including: the Sailfish Point POA; the Westchester Philharmonic; the Portland Concert Association; Greenwich World Hunger Association; the American Cancer Society, Maine chapter; The Maine Council on Economic Education; and the Louisville YMCA.
Noonan, who joined the Martin Memorial Foundation Board of Directors in 2009, will replace Eric Crawford as chair. Crawford served in the position since 2009. In Fiscal Years 2009-10, the Foundation has raised $14.4 million in gifts and pledges, and $5.3 million in unrecorded deferred gifts.
Now in its 28th year, the Martin Memorial Foundation has played a key role in helping the health system provide care for the communities it serves. Since its inception in 1983, the Foundation has raised more than $107 million.
GiftRAP sends help to Joplin, Mo.
GiftRAP Health Care Solutions, a software company based in Palm City, has sent a shipment of supplies to the National Healthcare Center (NHC), a nursing home in Joplin, Mo. NHC's sister facility, the Joplin Healthcare Center (JHC), was severely affected by the recent tornado outbreaks, and its patients have been sent to the NHC.
Our company's mission has always been to help the elderly, and we work with the Council on Aging of Martin County locally, said GiftRAP founder and president Steve Mackie. When we saw the devastation in Joplin, we reached out to see how we could help seniors in that area who were adversely affected by the storms.
GiftRAP personnel worked with the NHC to find out what supplies were needed most. Based on NHC's wish list, GiftRAP employees and their families collected linens, clothes, shampoos and detergents, personal grooming supplies and nonperishable food items. The shipment of supplies went to Joplin on June 6.
Software firm aids Boys, Girls Club
The Boys & Girls Clubs of Martin County (BGCMC) recently received a $22,176 donation in software from Microsoft through the Unlimited Potential efforts.
The gift will be used to support a Multipoint Server Environment at the Clubs' Cole-Clark Branch in Hobe Sound. Under the new Multipoint Server Environment, one computer will support multiple users at the same time, with each Club Member working independently using their own monitor, keyboard and mouse. It increases Club Members' access to the latest technology while eliminating the expense associated with maintaining and upgrading a fleet of aging laptops.
Microsoft's remarkable generosity will expand our Club Members' capacity to have everyday access to the technological tools they need as students and looking ahead to five to ten years, the future workers of America, said Anne McCormick, BGCMC's executive director. We continue to be amazed at the mastery these young people exhibit at our Clubs' technology centers.
Earlier this year, BE Aerospace's Amin Khoury, a longtime BGCMC supporter, provided the Clubs' Hobe Sound branch with funds to purchase the hardware necessary to outfit its Multipoint Server Environment: new computers, digital cameras, camcorders and other essential accessories.
Neilen helps student prepare for trip
How does a 16-year-old native Florida girl prepare herself to go on a 14-day Outward Bound Wilderness experience?
Jenna Martucci, a junior at Jensen Beach High School, is faced with that challenge before she departs July 12 for Seattle and the San Juan Islands.
Martucci was recently awarded a scholarship for the trek that includes sea kayaking in the Puget Sound, exploring the Pacific Northwest, sleeping under the stars and exploring the ocean environment. She enjoys playing soccer and runs track, but the experience will require more muscle than those sports require.
Rosalind Neilen of Rosalind's Fitness Studios stepped forward to volunteer and provide Martucci with physical training before departure.
This is not the first time I have volunteered to help the kids get in shape, Neilen said. I like to help the kids prepare for the adventure. They're not usually ready for the rigorous challenges ahead of them. They have to carry everything they need in their backpack so I work on building up her core strength.
Martucci has done some camping and hiking before and is quickly accumulating the long list of must-haves for the trip: long underwear, a Camelbak for water, full rain gear, a down jacket, water shoes, hiking boots and socks and full rain gear.
She has known other friends who have been on Outward Bound trips and has heard it is a great experience.
I hope to learn more about myself and develop leadership skills that will be useful in the years ahead, she said.
After graduating high school in 2012, Martucci plans to pursue an education degree at the University of Central Florida.
Neilen is a certified wellness coach endorsed by Wellcoaches.
Brown honored at William and Mary
Katherine Brown of Stuart was recently named to the dean's list at the College of William and Mary for the spring 2011 semester.
To achieve dean's list status, a full-time degree seeking undergraduate student must take at least 12 credit hours and earn a 3.6 quality point average during the semester.

Texto completo:   News-Leader
Mary Whitney Phelps began her life in Maine, the daughter of a sea captain.
She was orphaned, perhaps divorced, and then married a young lawyer named John S. Phelps who would someday be governor of Missouri.
The recently married couple chose Springfield as their home, bringing a "hearty spirit" to the pioneer settlement. It was 1837, and Springfield consisted of 14 families and a few log cabins. Mary had another one built while John was away on business, according to a biographical sketch in "History of Greene County, Missouri," printed in 1883, five years after her death from pneumonia.
That story reveals a determination and ingenuity that would continue to be part of Mary's life, including during the Civil War.
The Phelpses sided with the Union, but owned slaves who worked on their farm.
After the Battle of Wilson's Creek, John, a congressman at the time, enlisted as a private in the Missouri Infantry -- although he was later promoted to lieutenant colonel. He escorted several hundred citizens and sick soldiers to Rolla while Mary stayed home to feed the Union soldiers who remained in Springfield.
A building Phelps owned was used as headquarters for Gen. Nathaniel Lyon, leader of the Union troops at Wilson's Creek, where Lyon was killed. Her daughter later recalled that the night before the battle, Lyon told Mary he expected to be killed, adding, "I beg you to take care of my body."
That is what she did. Although there were stories that credited her with rescuing Lyon's body from the battlefield, she would later tell the story slightly differently.
Writing from Oregon, Mary sent a letter to the Springfield Advertiser setting the record straight. The general's body had been moved to his headquarters -- the house owned by the Phelpses -- and Mary eventually had it taken to her farm where she cleaned it and covered it until a casket was made.
While there, Gen. Sterling Price's Confederate troops came to the house, where Mary stood by the corpse until 4 a.m. when Price offered a guard. The body remained at her home until Lyon's relatives came to take it back to his native Connecticut for burial.
The Phelps home, in the meantime, became a hospital -- like many other homes. But Mary managed to move all the Confederate wounded to houses of southern sympathizers and filled hers with Union wounded.
A letter written by Mary to a nephew in New York says, "The rebels have taken our county, and especially our farm and our town property. They have ... stolen everything living, horses & cattle & grain..."
While John and daughter Mary Ann were in St. Louis, Mary stayed in Springfield, determined to "keep the Devils out of our dwelling."
Mary's determination is legend. One story has her rescuing George, one of her slaves, who had been tied to a tree in town by Confederates. She demanded that he -- and horses and a wagon -- be released, and stayed there all night until the colonel in charge let them go.
The next spring John and their son, John E., fought at the Battle of Pea Ridge in northwest Arkansas. As she did at Wilson's Creek, Mary helped care for the wounded on the battlefield.
In honor of those efforts, Mary was given a $20,000 grant from Congress. She used the money to support an orphanage for children of both sides of the conflict.
She also turned her attention to a new cause -- women's suffrage, serving next to Susan B. Anthony as a vice president of the National Woman Suffrage Convention.

Dexter Tigers' title turns team's tears into triumph

Texto completo: BREWER -- Tears of sorrow were at least temporarily replaced by tears of joy Wednesday night as the Dexter High School softball team gave its grieving town something to cheer about.
"We had to decide yesterday if we wanted to play today or Thursday, and we all decided we wanted to play today because we knew we needed something positive in our community," said senior Devyn Bell, one of Wednesday's Eastern Maine Class C championship game heroines. "Everything happening right now is just so negative, it's hard and we played in honor of the Lake family."
The Lake family refers to Amy Lake and children Coty and Monica, who were all shot to death by estranged husband and father Steven Lake on Monday before Steven Lake killed himself.
Bell went 3-for-3 with two doubles, a single, and two RBIs and her top-seeded Tigers survived a last at-bat rally by No. 3 Central of Corinth and edged the Red Devils 5-4 at Coffin Field.
The 17-2 Tigers will play West champ Telstar in a game moved from noon to 7 p.m. at Coffin Saturday so team members can attend the funeral for the Lakes.
Each member of the Tigers had some degree of personal experience, familiarity or involvement with the Lakes.
"Everyone knew the kids. Monica was a softball player herself and I coached her with her mother in rec field hockey, and my younger brother had Mrs. Lake as a teacher," said Bell. "It's really hit home to everyone on this team."
After Central took a 1-0 lead on Kayla Grindle's one-out RBI groundout in the third inning, Bell tied it with a one-out, RBI single to left. Jordyn Bell then made it 2-1 Tigers with an RBI groundout, and Harley Ponte followed with an RBI single through the left infield hole in the bottom of the fourth.
The 15-4 Devils got a run back in the fifth as Brianna Speed hit a leadoff single and scored on a one-out single to right by Roberta Trafton, but Dexter scored twice more in the bottom of the inning. Maicee Gustin reached second on a dropped ball in the outfield and scored on another Devyn Bell double to center, and Bell scored on Jordyn Bell's single over the third baseman's head.
"I think one of the big things was when we were behind 4-2 and had two outs and then made an error, and they scored two more runs. That really hurt," said Central coach Durice Washburn.
Central would threaten in the sixth and fail to score, but then put Dexter starting pitcher Libby Kain in a jam in the seventh as the first three batters reached to load the bases. After a flyout to center, two runs scored on a groundout to short and some aggressive baserunning by the appropriately named Speed and Katie Blanchard. But Chrissy Cunningham got the last out with a running catch of a shallow fly ball in right to touch off a celebration.
Libby Kain, who knew the Lakes, credited her ability to change speeds for limiting Central's potent offense to eight hits.
"That was a pretty typical game for her," said Dexter coach Galen Chapman. "She may have one or two innings where she has control trouble, but she's pretty steady."
Kain said it's the first time in days she has felt like smiling.
"My family was really good friends with them, and when I heard the news, I couldn't believe it. It just didn't seem real," Kain said. "We decided we were going to play for them and dedicate this game to them. It definitely felt good to put our minds on something else."
The two teams met before the game to exchange symbolic tokens.
"They gave us purple ribbons and we gave them flowers with little notes saying how sorry we were for the tragedy," Washburn said.
The title was the first in Class C for Dexter's program.
"I'm just so proud of the girls. They fought through this and stayed focused," Chapman said. "This is the first time we've won anything like this in Class C. We've won in Class B, but our last one was in 1984 or 1985.
"Ironically, they (Central) beat us in 2004 and that's the last time we've been this far."
The game featured several outstanding defensive plays, one of the best being a perfectly executed relay from center fielder Blanchard to shortstop Speed to catcher Roberta Trafton, who tagged out Lauren Crane at the plate in the first on an Eva Wing double.

Texto completo: PORTSMOUTH, N.H. Even as her son's image was plastered across TV and computer screens nationwide while authorities worked to identify the little boy found dead along a dirt road in Maine, his mother called his Texas school daily to report his absence.
Julianne McCrery, 42, of Irving, was ordered held without bail Thursday on second-degree murder charges in New Hampshire, where she made her initial court appearance in the death of her son, 6-year-old Camden, after waiving extradition from Massachusetts.
Information offered by authorities and friends paint a portrait of a loving but troubled mother who suffered from mood swings that sometimes culminated in road trips but she'd always come back.
This time, after one such trip to New England, she won't be returning to Texas anytime soon.
A lawyer representing McCrery at a brief hearing in Massachusetts said that judging by conversations with his client, he thinks she traveled hundreds of miles from home with the idea of taking her son's life and committing suicide.
I believe she was up here to bring both herself and her son to heaven, George Murphy said in Concord, Mass. She told me, 'I love my son very much. I know where he is. He's in heaven. I want to go there as soon as possible.'
The boy's body was found Saturday in an isolated area in South Berwick, Maine, and state police were at a loss to identify him because no one had reported him missing.
The last day the boy attended school in Texas was Friday, May 6. The next Monday, his mother called to report he was absent because he was ill. She continued to call this week, saying he was still sick.
McCrery was detained Wednesday at a highway rest stop in Chelmsford, Mass., after police got a tip about her pickup, which matched a vehicle seen near the spot where the boy's body was found covered with a blanket.

Texto completo:   An intricate network of animal lovers in Livingston County and Maine interested in helping stray, abandoned or unwanted animals has helped give a new home to a giant Schnauzer.
The giant Schnauzer, Mitzie, was flown by volunteers with Pilots N Paws to Columbus, Ohio, and then to Massachusetts, where a family who recently lost a dog wants to adopt her.
"She will live out the rest of her life loved on a farm with a family," said Kristen Carney, rescue and adoption coordinator with New England Lab Rescue in Limerick, Maine. "I'm really excited. ... That's why we do this. We just saved an animal that otherwise might have been put to sleep."
Debbie Oberle, director of Livingston County Animal Control, said Mitzie was placed at the Livingston County facility by family members of her elderly owners after one owner died and the other was unable to care for her.
New England Lab Rescue, which typically rescues Labadors or Lab mixes, saw Mitzie online and thought it could help even though she is not a Lab.
Carney said volunteers at her organization saw the description for Mitzie and the story about her owners. It read that the 10-year-old dog was a "very sweet girl, housebroken, good with cats and dogs."
The local posting also noted that Mitzie needs surgery because her eyes are glued shut with exudates and hair. While Livingston County Animal Control was able to clip her hair mats, Mitzie's eyelids are raw and she has severe entropion on both lower eyelids, which means her eyelashes grow inward.
The cost of that surgery did not deter New England Lab Rescue, which agreed to pay for the surgery, Oberle said.
"It spoke to us," Carney said about Mitzie's story. "If you think of those two elderly owners, they would have been horrified to think (Mitzie) would be put to sleep," Carney said. "No one would want her at 10, and we thought we'd give it a try. ... We posted it to our Facebook page and a couple people were immediately interested."
Among those interested was a couple who live on a farm in western Massachusetts. They recently lost their giant Schnauzer and were looking for a new one when they saw Mitzie's photograph.
A flurry of phone calls between Livingston County Animal Control and New England Lab Rescue included a third group -- Pilots N Paws, which partners pilots and plane owners willing to assist with the transportation of animals and rescue groups that place strays or unwanted animals with families.
The end result is that a Pilots N Paws pilot flew Mitzie to a foster home in Ohio on Wednesday where she spent the night with a foster mom before getting into a car with another volunteer who has a planned vacation in New England and volunteered to drive Mitzie to her new home.
"The Livingston (Animal Control) is excellent," Carney said. "They care enough to take (Mitzie) to the groomer because she was so uncomfortable with all her hair. They were willing to work with the pilot and us. Some shelters, it's nothing but trouble and pain to work with. The Livingston shelter was not that way."

Man makes Maine court appearance
AUGUSTA, Maine: A 23-year-old man charged with manslaughter in the shooting death of a friend was scheduled to make his initial court appearance in Maine.
Ryan Ouimet, of Colts Neck, was scheduled to appear Wednesday afternoon in Franklin County Superior Court in Farmington. He is charged in the death of 23-year-old Andrew Holland, of Cape Elizabeth.
Ouimet and Holland were friends who graduated last month from the University of Maine at Farmington and were working this summer as cooks at the Old Post Office Caf in nearby Mount Vernon.
The shooting took place about 10:30 p.m. May 31 when a handgun owned by Ouimet went off inside a friend's High Street apartment in Farmington, near the university.

Services held for girl killed at park
ATLANTIC CITY: An 11-year-old New Jersey girl who died after falling from a Ferris wheel has been laid to rest following a funeral service in Atlantic City. More than 350 mourners gathered Wednesday at the All Wars Memorial Building for the 30-minute Muslim service for Abiah Jones of Pleasantville.
The Press of Atlantic City reports that friends and classmates from Pleasant Tech Academy Charter School wore T-shirts with her picture and the slogan "RIP. Love You."
Jones was buried at Seaside Cemetery in Upper Township.
Authorities say she was riding alone in one of the Ferris wheel's gondolas when she plunged about 100 feet from the ride at Morey's Mariner's Landing Pier in Wildwood on Friday.

Hearings on WNET deal begin today
TRENTON: Lawmakers begin hearings today examining the state's deal with WNET that puts the New York public television station in charge of a rebranded New Jersey Network.
Though the Legislature has not yet formally received details of the deal, the Assembly Budget Committee will meet at 10 a.m. in the Statehouse Annex to solicit testimony from invited guests.
Gov. Chris Christie announced details of the WNET deal Monday. The station, through a new nonprofit governed by New Jersey citizens, will rebrand NJN as NJTV, add improved PBS programs and provide New Jersey-focused programs in conjunction with Caucus Educational Corp. It will air a nightly news show as part of a required 20 hours a week of New Jersey-focused programming.
Assemblyman Louis Greenwald, D-Camden, the budget committee chairman, said his main goal has been to continue New Jersey-centric programming and ensure a smooth transition.
"Ensuring employees received equitable and fair consideration was also vital, and I'm not convinced that's happening under this proposal," Greenwald said.
No decisions have been made about retaining NJN employees or programs, WNET president Neal Shapiro said.
Assembly Minority Leader Alex DeCroce, R-Morris, said the deal unburdens taxpayers and sustains public television in New Jersey for the long run.
Last year, NJN had $28.8 million in expenses and $17.6 million in revenues. The state provided $11.2 million to fill the gap.
A Senate committee will hold a similar hearing after the plan is submitted to the Legislature next week. Lawmakers will have until June 28 to veto the deal.
New Jersey also plans to sell its nine public radio stations for $1.926 million cash and $2.412 million in noncash contributions.

Cops: Man pointed laser at helicopter
ATLANTIC CITY: A 21-year-old southern New Jersey man faces charges of interfering with transportation for allegedly shining a laser pointer at the crew of a Coast Guard helicopter conducting rescue training off Ocean City.
Eric J. Bouda of Mantua was arrested Tuesday night by Ocean City police.
The incident occurred shortly after 9 p.m. Tuesday while a Coast Guard helicopter from the Atlantic City air station was conducting rescue training maneuvers with the crew of a commercial tow boat service.
"Educating the public on how detrimental lasers can be to our air crews is key," said Capt. Nicholas Bartolotta, commanding officer of the Coast Guard's Air Station Atlantic City.
"Pointing lasers at aircraft jeopardizes the safety of the Coast Guard and commercial airliners and needs to be stopped."

An al-lure-ing new trend

Texto completo:   BOISE, Idaho -- For a 49-year-old manager of a fly fishing shop, Jim Bernstein spends an awful lot of time on the phone with hairdressers.
They bought out his display of hackles -- the long, skinny rooster feathers fishermen use to make lures -- months ago. But the calls keep coming at Eldredge Bros. Fly Shop in Maine, and the women keep asking for more supplies as they fight to keep up with the latest hair trend: Feather extensions.
Nationwide, supplies at fly fishing shops from the coasts of Maine to landlocked Idaho are running out. Some hairdressers have gotten desperate to follow the craze that was fueled, in part, by "American Idol" judge and rocker Steven Tyler, who began wearing the feathers in his long hair.
"I've taught hairdressers over the phone how we dye the feathers so they can buy the un-dyed kind and dye them themselves," Bernstein said.
Some feathers sold online are fetching hundreds of dollars more than the usual prices.
"I'm looking around the shop thinking, 'Hmmm, what else can they put in their hair?'" Bernstein said
Fly fishermen are not happy, bemoaning the trend in online message boards and sneering at so-called "feather ladies."
"It takes years and years and years to develop these chickens to grow these feathers. And now, instead of ending up on a fly, it's going into women's hair," said Matt Brower, a guide and assistant manager at Idaho Angler in Boise.
"I think that's the reason a lot of people are a little peeved about it," he said.
The feathers are not easy to come by in the first place.
They come from roosters that are genetically bred and raised for their plumage. In most cases, the birds do not survive the plucking.
At Whiting Farms, Inc., in western Colorado, one of the world's largest producers of fly tying feathers, the roosters live about a year while their saddle feathers -- the ones on the bird's backside and the most popular for hair extensions -- grow as long as possible. Then the animal is euthanized.
As hair extensions, the feathers can be brushed, blow dried, straightened and curled once they are snapped into place. Most salons sell the feather strands for $5 to $10 a piece. The trend has become so popular a company online even sells feather extensions for dogs.
The craze has also left hairstylists scrambling to find rooster saddle feathers, as fly shops hold onto a select few for their regular customers. The businesses will now ask if the feathers are for hairdressing, said Shelley Ambroz, who owns MiraBella Salon and Spa in Boise.
"If you go in and you're a woman, they won't sell to you," said Ambroz, who started to eye her husband's fly fishing gear after stores ran out.
"He told me to stay out of his feathers," she said.
Whiting Farms is harvesting about 1,500 birds a week for their feathers and still can't keep up with its current orders, said owner and founder Tom Whiting, a poultry geneticist. The company has stopped taking on new accounts.
"I've tried to withhold some for the fly fishing world because when the fashion trend goes away, which it will, I've still got to make a living," he said.
The company was the one that told Bernstein in Maine several months ago that rooster saddle feathers had somehow become the latest coveted hair accessory. Bernstein said he scoffed at the notion that it could reach his shop along the coast of southern Maine.
"This is Maine, it's not California. We're a little behind the trends here," he said. "I screwed up. I should have said: 'Send me everything you've got.'"
Bernstein's inventory of rooster saddle feathers has long been depleted. About three weeks ago, he dusted off a rooster neck with feathers that had been set aside for fly tying classes at the shop. The neck would have normally cost $29.95, but the shop sold it for $360.
It's not uncommon to find a package of rooster saddle feathers that would have cost around $60 at a fly shop now priced from $200 to $400.
A package of the most popular fly tying hackle for hair extensions, a black and white striped feather called grizzly saddle, would normally retail anywhere from $40 to $60. It sold for $480 on eBay last month after 31 bids.
At the Boise salon, Ambroz has stowed away enough feathers to last about six months.
On a recent Tuesday evening, Emilee Rivers, 16, sifted through a pile of rooster saddle feathers looking for the perfect strands to frame her face. She picked out four and handed them to the stylist, who bonded them together with hot glue before clipping them into Rivers' blond hair.
Brandi Wheeler, 16, was next. There's only one other girl at Borah High School in Boise who has the feather extensions, the teenagers said.
Now, they were joining the select few.
"I've wanted to get them for quite a while," Rivers said.
She went to the salon with her mom, Kristi, who totally gets it.
"My dad on the other hand, he's so confused," Rivers said. "I told him what I was doing and he said: 'Why would you get feathers in your hair?'"

Half-Gallon Challenge not for half-pints

Texto completo: GARDNERS, Pa. Appalachian Trail through-hiker Alan Downs figured it would be a breeze to down a half-gallon of chocolate ice cream. He plunked his money at the Pine Grove Furnace Store, took his carton to a nearby lake and tucked in. If I can make it through this, I can make it to Maine, he told himself.
With that, Downs began the Half-Gallon Challenge.
For the past three decades, long-distance hikers arriving at the midway point of the 2,180-mile Georgia-to-Maine footpath have made it a tradition to stop at Pine Grove Furnace State Park in south-central Pennsylvania and eat an entire brick of ice cream.
The reward: bragging rights, a small commemorative wooden spoon stamped in red letters with Member of Half Gal. Club, and, quite likely, an upset stomach or a nasty case of brain freeze.
About 350 through-hikers each year successfully complete the gastronomic feat, according to Don Ray, who managed the park store for a decade. But it's not easy, even for trail-hardened hikers who can burn 4,000 to 6,000 calories a day and still lose weight while consuming vast quantities of food.
Nearly every through-hiker has heard of the challenge. Many take it seriously, racing one another and timing themselves with stopwatches. Appalachian Trail lore says that if you finish your carton, you get it for free, but that's incorrect: Everyone pays $5.95.

Half-Gallon Challenge not for half-pints

Texto completo: GARDNERS, Pa. Appalachian Trail through-hiker Alan Downs figured it would be a breeze to down a half-gallon of chocolate ice cream. He plunked his money at the Pine Grove Furnace Store, took his carton to a nearby lake and tucked in. If I can make it through this, I can make it to Maine, he told himself.
With that, Downs began the Half-Gallon Challenge.
For the past three decades, long-distance hikers arriving at the midway point of the 2,180-mile Georgia-to-Maine footpath have made it a tradition to stop at Pine Grove Furnace State Park in south-central Pennsylvania and eat an entire brick of ice cream.
The reward: bragging rights, a small commemorative wooden spoon stamped in red letters with Member of Half Gal. Club, and, quite likely, an upset stomach or a nasty case of brain freeze.
About 350 through-hikers each year successfully complete the gastronomic feat, according to Don Ray, who managed the park store for a decade. But it's not easy, even for trail-hardened hikers who can burn 4,000 to 6,000 calories a day and still lose weight while consuming vast quantities of food.
Nearly every through-hiker has heard of the challenge. Many take it seriously, racing one another and timing themselves with stopwatches. Appalachian Trail lore says that if you finish your carton, you get it for free, but that's incorrect: Everyone pays $5.95.

Texto completo:   COLTS NECK A 23-year-old Colts Neck man has been charged with manslaughter in the Farmington, Maine shooting of his 23-year-old co-worker.
Ryan Ouimet, 23, of Colts Neck, was with Andrew Holland, 23, of Cape Elizabeth, Maine and Caroline Halloran, 23, of Acton, Mass., in Halloran's Farmington apartment when a handgun went off at about 10:30 p.m. Tuesday. Holland was shot in the abdomen. He was transported by ambulance to Franklin Memorial Hospital in Farmington, where he died, according to Maine Department of Public Safety spokesman Steve McCausland.
The shooting "may not have been intentional but there's concern that with a loaded firearm going off inside an apartment and killing someone that proper firearm procedures were not followed," McCausland said.
Holland's death was ruled a homicide, according to Brandy DesRosier, a spokeswoman for the Maine Office of the Chief Medical Examiner.
Ouimet had recently purchased the gun and was legally permitted to have it, McCausland said. McCausland declined to say whether drug or alcohol use had been involved.
All three were graduates of the University of Maine at Farmington, McCausland said. Ouimet had just graduated in May with a bachelor's of fine arts degree in creative writing, according to the university. He is a graduate of Colts Neck High School.
The three also were working together for the summer at the Olde Post Office Cafe in nearby Mt. Vernon, Maine, according to the Maine Department of Public Safety.
.
Ouimet was released from Franklin County Jail on $10,000 bail. He is expected to appear June 8 in Franklin County Superior Court in Farmington.

Texto completo: CHICAGO Clint Barmes knew his team needed a lift.
He gave them a spark.
Barmes hit the first of four Houston home runs and the Astros rallied to beat the Chicago Cubs 12-7 on Monday.
Barmes' fifth-inning two-run shot brought Houston within one run, then Hunter Pence followed with a game-tying solo homer as the Astros halted a three-game losing streak.
We're just staying positive and making things happen, Barmes said.
J.R. Towles gave the Astros the lead with a leadoff home run in the sixth inning off Cubs reliever Jeff Samardzija (3-1). Jeff Keppinger added a three-run shot in the ninth inning to put things out of reach. He finished with three hits and four RBIs.
The Astros reached season-highs in runs and home runs, matching their best output this year with 16 hits. They scored 11 runs on 16 hits April 12 against the Cubs in an 11-2 victory in Houston.

Texto completo: GRAND PRAIRIE A woman charged with killing her 6-year-old son did not do it out of malice, but something snapped, and she needs help, the boy's grandmother told mourners at his funeral Saturday.
As more than 100 people gathered to remember Camden Pierce Hughes, the curly haired, blue-eyed boy who loved reading and playing the guitar, his grandmother said the family's world fell apart when he was found dead under his favorite blanket along a dirt road in Maine two weeks ago.
But she cautioned against judging her jailed daughter, Julianne McCrery.
How do we forgive ... (her) for committing this unspeakable act? I don't know, LuRae McCrery of Curtis, Neb., said during the hourlong service at Calvary Baptist Church in Grand Prairie. I know in my heart that Juli didn't do this out of malice or anger. She was a good mother.
Julianne McCrery, 42, of the Dallas suburb of Irving, is being held without bail on second-degree murder charges in New Hampshire. She is accused of killing her son in Hampton, N.H., on May 14 and dumping his body in South Berwick, Maine. Preliminary autopsy findings show he died of asphyxiation.
A lawyer who represented her at a brief hearing in Massachusetts, where she was detained following a police tip a few days after Camden's body was found, said he thinks she may have traveled hundreds of miles from home with the idea of taking her son's life and committing suicide.

But she cautioned against judging her jailed daughter, Julianne McCrery, and said the family was suffering a double loss.
How do we forgive ... (her) for committing this unspeakable act? I don't know, LuRae McCrery of Curtis, Neb., said during the hourlong service at Calvary Baptist Church in Grand Prairie. I know in my heart that Juli didn't do this out of malice or anger. She was a good mother. ... She did the best she could with what she had. On that fateful day something snapped, and I pray that she gets all the help she needs.
Julianne McCrery, 42, of the Dallas suburb of Irving, is being held without bail on second-degree murder charges in New Hampshire. She is accused of killing her son in Hampton, N.H., on May 14 and dumping his body near the state line about 20 miles away in South Berwick, Maine. Preliminary autopsy findings show he died of asphyxiation.
A lawyer who represented her at a brief hearing in Massachusetts, where she was detained following a police tip a few days after Camden's body was found, said he thinks she may have traveled hundreds of miles from home with the idea of taking her son's life and committing suicide.

Texto completo: The thing about summer in Maine is that when it finally arrives, it seems to vanish in no time at all. Summer theater is something like that, too.
If you want to attend a show, don't dawdle. Time moves fast, and oftentimes so do tickets. Here are some of the highlights of the season ahead:
* MAINE STATE MUSIC THEATRE, Brunswick: Maine State's 53rd season includes four mainstage musicals, three concerts and two children's musicals.
The mainstage opens with "The Marvelous Wonderettes" (June 8-25), which finds four high school seniors - Betty Jean, Cindy Lou, Missy and Suzy - prepping for their 1958 high school prom. They reveal their lives and loves through popular hit songs of the 1950s. After intermission, they travel forward to their 10-year reunion, and reminisce through songs of the 1960s.
The show stars Brittney Morello, Lara Seibert, Danielle Erin Rhodes and Morgan Smith. Morello stepped in last summer at Maine State to play the lead in "My Fair Lady" when the original cast member lost her voice. She has performed at North Shore Music Theatre and Speakeasy Stage Company in Massachusetts, and with Summer Theatre Meredith Village in New Hampshire.
Seibert starred as the bride-to-be in 2009's "The Drowsy Chaperone" at Maine State. Her Broadway credits include "Young Frankenstein," and she was part of the national tour of "The Producers."
Rhodes has toured in productions of "Grease" and "Oliver!" Smith has performed Off-Broadway and with multiple acclaimed regional theaters.
The rest of the mainstage season includes "Annie," June 29-July 16; "Xanadu," July 20-Aug. 6; and "The Wiz," Aug. 10-27. Special events include a concert version of the Tony Award-winning musical "Spring Awakening," the folk duo Schooner Fare and the return of Tony nominee Euan Morton.
The children's programming includes a musical version of the popular book "Click, Clack, Moo" and a new interpretation of "Beauty and the Beast."

Texto completo: A memorial service for philanthropist and former Caller-Times Publisher Edward H. Harte is scheduled for mid-June in Corpus Christi.
Harte died May 18in Maine at age 88, leaving a legacy of environmental preservation, generous giving and the $46 million endowment of the Harte Research Institute, now a leader in Gulf of Mexico studies.
A ceremony remembering Harte will be held at 4:30 p.m. June 14 at Parkway Presbyterian, 3707 Santa Fe St.
Dad always considered Corpus Christi his home even when he spent time in New York and Maine, said his son Chris Harte. This was always Mother's and Dad's home, from 1956 until the end.
Harte and his wife donated at least $70 million locally to causes including higher education, environmental research and conservation, but the extent of their philanthropy remains unknown because they gave anonymously for years.
Harte was intensely interested in environmental conservation, lobbying the government to create Mustang Island State Park and Padre Island National Seashore to better protect the fragile coastal habitats and wildlife. He and his brother also donated their 66,000-acre ranch to Big Bend National Park.
Harte, whose father co-founded the Harte-Hanks newspaper company, served as publisher of the Caller-Times for 25 years, where he was most famously known for his longtime Sunday column that provided an insight into Mexican politics and current events not available in the mainstream press. He continued the column even after his retirement in 1987.
Corpus Christi was the most important paper to Harte-Hanks' success and Dad always appreciated that, and that's why his largest gift was to establish the Harte Research Institute in Corpus Christi, Chris Harte said.
Harte is preceded in death by his wife, Janet, who died in 1999.
His ashes will be buried alongside Janet's in Thetford, Vt., in a private family ceremony this summer.

Texto completo: BANGOR, Maine Police in Maine say a man wanted for failing to pay fines accidentally helped officers find him when he repeatedly pocket dialed 911 while doing yard work.
Police say 29-year-old James Green was using a backpack leaf blower in Bangor Saturday when he kept calling 911 without realizing it.
Police Lt. Jeff Millard says officers were able to determine where the calls were coming from by triangulating the signal from Green's phone.
The Bangor Daily News says there were two active warrants for Green's arrest for failure to pay fines.

Texto completo: AUGUSTA, Maine A family friend says the body of a boy left along a dirt road in Maine is back in Texas for a funeral to be held this weekend.
Shirley Miller, a longtime friend in Texas, told The Associated Press Tuesday that the body of 6-year-old Camden Hughes is back on Texas soil. The funeral is scheduled for Saturday.
Camden's body was released Friday by the Maine medical examiner.
The boy's mother, Julianne McCrery of Irving, is being held in New Hampshire, where she's charged with killing the boy before leaving him in South Berwick, Maine.
Miller says McCrery's father, her other son and the son's father traveled to Maine to retrieve Camden's remains.

Boy's kin thankful for kind gestures Slain child's mother accused of killing him

Texto completo: CONCORD, N.H. The grandmother of the 6-year-old boy found dead along a dirt road in Maine said she's heartbroken over what happened to the bright child who liked to practice writing his letters and kick a football and soccer ball in the backyard.
Camden and I share the same birthday on March 15th, and my birthday will never be the same again, LuRae McCrery of Curtis, Neb., said in an open letter to news media. It seems like a very bad nightmare from which I will never wake up.
McCrery's daughter, Julianne McCrery, was ordered held without bail Thursday on second-degree murder charges in New Hampshire. She's accused of killing her son, 6-year-old Camden Hughes, in Hampton, N.H., on Saturday, and dumping his body in South Berwick, Maine. Preliminary autopsy findings showed he died of asphyxiation.
Julianne McCrery, 42, of Irving, Texas, was detained Wednesday at a highway rest stop in Chelmsford, Mass., after police got a tip about her pickup truck, which matched a vehicle seen near the spot where the boy's body was found. Friends have described her as a loving mother who was prone to mood swings; a lawyer who represented her at a brief hearing in Massachusetts said based on his conversations with her, he thinks she may have traveled hundreds of miles from home with the idea of taking her son's life and committing suicide.
School officials in Texas said the boy last attended kindergarten on May 6, and that his mother continued to call this week to report that he was ill. Meanwhile, the case was drawing national attention as the boy went unidentified for days.
Residents of South Berwick held a candlelight vigil in his honor.
It was very special of your city to remember someone that nobody ever knew, LuRae McCrery wrote in her letter. There are so many family and friends that are profoundly affected by this senseless loss of a little boy.

Texto completo: PORTSMOUTH, N.H. Even as her son's image was plastered across TV and computer screens nationwide while authorities worked to identify the little boy found dead along a dirt road in Maine, his mother called his Texas school daily to report his absence.
Julianne McCrery, 42, of Irving, was ordered held without bail Thursday on second-degree murder charges in New Hampshire, where she made her initial court appearance in the death of her son, 6-year-old Camden, after waiving extradition from Massachusetts.
Information offered by authorities and friends paint a portrait of a loving but troubled mother who suffered from mood swings that sometimes culminated in road trips but she'd always come back.
This time, after one such trip to New England, she won't be returning to Texas anytime soon.
A lawyer representing McCrery at a brief hearing in Massachusetts said that judging by conversations with his client, he thinks she traveled hundreds of miles from home with the idea of taking her son's life and committing suicide.
I believe she was up here to bring both herself and her son to heaven, George Murphy said in Concord, Mass. She told me, 'I love my son very much. I know where he is. He's in heaven. I want to go there as soon as possible.'
The boy's body was found Saturday in an isolated area in South Berwick, Maine, and state police were at a loss to identify him because no one had reported him missing.
The last day the boy attended school in Texas was Friday, May 6. The next Monday, his mother called to report he was absent because he was ill. She continued to call this week, saying he was still sick.
McCrery was detained Wednesday at a highway rest stop in Chelmsford, Mass., after police got a tip about her pickup, which matched a vehicle seen near the spot where the boy's body was found covered with a blanket.

Texto completo: Edward H. Harte, son of former Standard-Times publisher Houston Harte and president of the Standard-Times from 1953-56, has died at age 88.
Harte, who died Wednesday at a Maine retirement community from complications of old age, is remembered as a dry-humored man from West Texas who rubbed shoulders with the nation's elite.
Harte also was the former publisher of the Corpus Christi Caller-Times and gave more than $70 million there to causes including education, environmental research and conservation.
He was equally comfortable with the ambassador of England or a Rockefeller as he was with a cowhand in South Texas, his longtime friend Harris Kaffie said.
The bow-tied heir of a media mogul leaves a legacy of environmental preservation, including donating with his brother 66,000 acres to Big Bend National Park, and the endowment of a research institute that has become a leader on Gulf studies, garnering international attention after last year's oil spill.
But family and friends said they will remember him most as a down-to-earth man who genuinely cared about others.
He was not only a giant, he was a human being, said Andy Sansom, former executive director of Texas Parks and Wildlife and friend of Harte's.
Born in 1922 in Pilot Grove, Mo., Harte grew up in Depression-era San An
gelo, where his father ran a newspaper company that he co-founded in 1923 with a competing publisher.
The Harte-Hanks company owned 70 publications nationwide at its height.
Harte remained on the board of Harte-Hanks Communications until 1997, when the company sold off its remaining newspapers, including those in Abilene, San Angelo and Corpus Christi, to the E.W. Scripps Company for $775 million.
Houston Harte said his brother did not want to sell the newspapers and resigned his position on the board. Today, Harte-Hanks no longer operates newspapers, instead focusing on direct marketing and shopper publications.
He always thought of himself as a newsman first, said columnist Nick Jimenez, Caller-Times editorial page editor emeritus.
Though Harte inherited the newspaper business because that's what his father expected of him, he truly enjoyed it, said his brother, Houston.
He met his wife, Janet, when he was working at his first newspaper job, as a reporter at the Daily Eagle in Claremont, N.H., after he graduated from Dartmouth College.
The two gave generously to causes they supported, but the extent of their philanthropy remains unknown because they gave anonymously for years, their son Christopher said.
The Hartes were generous to many causes, particularly focusing on the arts and environment, education, health care for women, and food and shelter for the homeless.
The Hartes originally had planned to bequeath their money after their deaths, but decided against that plan in the 1990s.
It's more fun to watch what your money will do while you're still alive, Ed Harte then said.
Harte is preceded in death by his wife, Janet, who died in 1999.
He is survived by his brother, Houston; sons Christopher Harte and William Harte; daughters Elizabeth Owens and Julia Widdowson; nine grandchildren; two step-grandchildren; and one great-grandchild.

Harte, who died Wednesday at a Maine retirement community from complications of old age, is remembered as a dry-humored man from West Texas who rubbed shoulders with the nation's elite.
In 1950, Harte became editor of the Daily News in Snyder, a newspaper that he, his brother Houston H. Harte and Andrew B. Stormy Shelton had converted from a weekly to a daily.
Years later, Shelton would become the publisher of the Abilene Reporter-News.
In 1940, Shelton married Patty Hanks, the daughter of Bernard Hanks, publisher of the Abilene newspaper.
Bernard Hanks and Ed Harte's father, Houston Harte, founded Harte-Hanks Communications. The Reporter-News and other Texas newspapers in the chain were sold to Scripps Howard Newspapers in May 1997.
Harte also was the former publisher of the Corpus Christi Caller-Times and gave more than $70 million there to causes including education, environmental research and conservation.

Houston Harte said his brother did not want to sell the newspapers and resigned his position on the board. Today, Harte-Hanks no longer operates newspapers, instead focusing on direct marketing and shopper publications.
He always thought of himself as a newsman first, said columnist Nick Jimenez, Caller-Times editorial page editor emeritus.
Though Harte inherited the newspaper business because that's what his father expected of him, he truly enjoyed it, said his brother, Houston.
He met his wife, Janet, when he was working at his first newspaper job, as a reporter at the Daily Eagle in Claremont, N.H., after he graduated from Dartmouth College.
The two gave generously to causes they supported, but the extent of their philanthropy remains unknown because they gave anonymously for years, their son Christopher said.
The Hartes were generous to many causes, particularly focusing on the arts and environment, education, health care for women, and food and shelter for the homeless.
The Hartes originally had planned to bequeath their money after their deaths, but decided against that plan in the 1990s.
It's more fun to watch what your money will do while you're still alive, Ed Harte then said.
Harte is preceded in death by his wife, Janet, who died in 1999.
He is survived by his brother, Houston; sons Christopher Harte and William Harte; daughters Elizabeth Owens and Julia Widdowson; nine grandchildren; two step-grandchildren; and one great-grandchild.

Texto completo: CASTINE To the sounds of tugboat whistles and cheers from the shore, the State of Maine, Maine Maritime Academys training vessel, eased away from the dock Tuesday morning to start its annual two-month-long training cruise.
Carrying 230 students and 55 crew members, the ship left early Tuesday to catch the slack tide on the Bagaduce River, heading out to Penobscot Bay on the first leg of the journey of about 11,000 nautical miles. With a new skipper on board, Capt. Leslie B. Eadie III of Brewer, the cruise is scheduled to visit ports in Norfolk, Va.; Valletta, Malta; Civitavecchia (Rome), Italy; Cobh, Ireland; and Portland, Maine, before returning to Castine.
Eadie, himself a 1976 MMA graduate, assumed command of the training ship after the retirement of longtime master, Capt. Larry Wade. He is a seasoned, professional mariner with more than 28 years experience at sea. He joined the MMA faculty six years ago and teaches courses in terrestrial navigation, marine communications, advanced tanker operations and casualty analysis.
In the wake of the military mission that killed Osama bin Laden earlier this week, Capt. Jeff Loustaunau, MMAs vice president for enrollment management and the commandant of midshipmen, said Tuesday there will be increased security in port when they get to Norfolk.
They have beefed up security there and there will be stiffer ID checks going into the port, he said.
Weve also been in touch with the State Department and there are no threats in the Mediterranean that would prevent us from going there, Loustaunau said. Were not going in harms way. If the situation changes for any reason, we are capable of changing also.
The students on board are enthusiastic and ready to be underway, Loustaunau said.
Theres a lot of energy on board ship right now, he said. Mostly, the students are excited about getting underway and operating the ship. For the freshmen, this is the first real taste of life at sea. And thats what many of them came to the school for.
MMA deck and engineering students generally go out on the State of Maine at the end of their freshman and junior years to meet at-sea requirements for their Coast Guard licenses. In their sophomore year, they ship out on a commercial vessel around the world to add to their sea-time experience.
The students have lived on board the ship for the past several days in preparation for the cruise. Some of those students, however, were left behind as the ship eased away from the dock and, aided by tugboats, turned in the river and headed out to the bay. They are members of the colleges lacrosse team and are still competing in the conference championships.
It was very weird to watch the ship depart without them, said Geoff Gezik, a freshman from Columbia, Md. Depending on how they fare in the championships, the students will join the ship in Norfolk by Sunday at the latest.
Gezik said he is looking forward to rejoining the ship and seeing the different ports along the way. He said hes anxious to be working with his buddies on board the ship and learning from the permanent crew and from their upperclass shipmates.
The juniors have done it already; theyre pretty knowledgeable, Gezik said.
They stress mentor learning here, added Alex Hermes of Fallsington, Pa. Its an effective way of learning.
Friends and family members also were excited and a bit apprehensive as they watched the ship depart.
When we came in the fall, that ship looked really big, said Roxanne Tolman of Vinalhaven, whose son, Dana, 18, was on board for his first cruise. Today it looks really small.
Her husband Courtland, a Vinalhaven fisherman, hoped to line up the islands fishing boats to greet the State of Maine as it sailed by.
Its going to be a very good experience for him, said George Martin of Searsmont, who with his wife, Sarah, and son Tyler were on hand to see off their son Morgan, 19, who was embarking on his first cruise. It will either make him or break him. But hes always been around water, so hell be fine.
Kim Metcalf of West Baldwin, who is president of the MMA parents association, said she was excited for her daughter, Rebecca, 18, a freshman sailing on her first cruise. Metcalf said this was a unique part of her daughters education that would gain her practical experience.
They practice in port, but its not the same as when theyre underway and moving, she said. This is going to be the real thing. Shes going to take a lot of what shes learned in class and put it into practice.
The ship is scheduled to return to Castine on June 26.

Resumen: Dishes such as honey-glazed duck breast with Roman trading spices and sumac, and white asparagus with soft-scrambled farm egg, caper brown butter, herbs, and French ham seem to have sprung from the pages of a classic novel or history textbook. On a Friday in early spring there is roast fresh squid with pork confit and creamy white beans; smoked shad roe "chips and dip" with herbed potato chips; duck-fat-fried local rabbit with cauliflower and hot sauce; and chilled sweet neck oysters with apple sambal, smoked haddock, and crema.

Texto completo:   I t's a Saturday, the first warm evening of early spring. We have a dinner reservation at The Lost Kitchen, a secret spot near Penobscot Bay. We park and walk around the corner to an address that was e-mailed to us earlier in the day. The building is wedge-shaped, narrow and Gothic, taking up an entire corner. The host unlocks the unmarked door promptly at 6.
We walk inside and up 20 steep stairs to a second story high above the street. It's an apartment, a clean, airy perch of a place with polished wood floors and tall windows dressed with louvered shutters. The chef's boat builder husband banged together long communal tables out of clear fir and sawhorses. The chef made a few playlists, set the tables with linen, and forced pear branches to blossom in warm water. Just before dinner she wrote the menu on a blackboard next to the coat closet.
Tonight's meal is five courses cooked almost entirely from local and seasonal ingredients - not an easy thing to do in Maine in early April. To start there is a six-minute duck egg with bacon and buttery bread crumbs, then French lentil soup with local yogurt and mint and a toasted baguette. That is followed by a plate of spring vegetables with garlicky bagna cauda, local hangar steak with spring-dug parsnip puree, frites, and a spinach and pea shoot salad. Dessert is a semolina almond cake with cherry preserves and homemade sage ice cream. To finish there is a local cheese plate with fancy fixings and coffee service with cat tongue cookies.
The suggested donation is $40 per person, plus a tip for the server. Bring your own drink.
Sounds good, and it was. But dinner at The Lost Kitchen (twit ter.com/#!/thelostkitchen, www.facebook.com/pages/The-Lost-Kitchen/1192708381366 45?sk=info) takes a few hours and requires small talk with strangers and eating whatever is served. It is sweet and personal, but also something other than a restaurant. Sometimes you need a restaurant.
We left wishing that on any normal night we could go out, order off a menu, and have a private restaurant meal with the same personal attention to detail and renegade spirit that felt so good at The Lost Kitchen. Such places are rare but you can find them in Maine. Generally they serve seasonal food from local farms and fishermen and make everything from scratch. Usually the chef is the owner. Here are a few good ones along the coast.
BRESCA
After years of cooking in the United States (including a stint in New York at Babou, an illegal kitchen in an old shoe store with two hot plates and an oven) and France (in the pastry basement at Guy Savoy), chef Krista Kern moved back to Maine to open her little jewel box of a dream restaurant in Portland. The whole thing would fit in the back of a UPS truck and it's always full.
The menu is small and hyper-curated. Sometimes it feels almost academic (before opening Bresca, Kern was picking away at a master's degree in medieval studies). Dishes such as honey-glazed duck breast with Roman trading spices and sumac, and white asparagus with soft-scrambled farm egg, caper brown butter, herbs, and French ham seem to have sprung from the pages of a classic novel or history textbook. Don't miss the hand-rolled pasta such as spaghetti nero with sauteed calamari, chili, olive oil, and garlic.
111 Middle St., 207-772-1004, www.restaurantbresca.com, entrees $22-$26.
FRANCINE AND SHEPHERD'S PIE
For seven years, on a side street near Camden Harbor, in a building that looks like a Wild West saloon, chef Brian Hill has been inventing and reinventing his version of Maine coast cuisine. Making it up as he goes along, writing the menu every day, he mashes up Yankee ingredients (smelt, maple syrup, dry beans) with exotic flavors (fish sauce, Middle Eastern spices, preserved lemons) and elaborate technique (smoking, pickling, fermenting).
On a Friday in early spring there is roast fresh squid with pork confit and creamy white beans; smoked shad roe "chips and dip" with herbed potato chips; duck-fat-fried local rabbit with cauliflower and hot sauce; and chilled sweet neck oysters with apple sambal, smoked haddock, and crema.
For the past year Hill has been splitting his time between Francine and his new place in Rockport, Shepherd's Pie, an artisinal pub in a 100-year-old general store with a view of the harbor. At Shepherd's Pie he mostly sticks to the classics, but everything is tweaked and refined. Fried clams are served as fried clam tacos with avocado and green tomato. The cheeseburger is topped with local cheese and served on a homemade bun, and the mussels are roasted in cast iron with cedar, black butter, and lots of fresh lime juice.
Francine Bistro 55 Chestnut St., Camden, 207-230-0083, www.francinebistro.com, entrees $12-$35. Shepherd's Pie, 18 Central St., Rockport, 207-236-8500, entrees $14-$22.
RESTAURANT ROW:
LILY BISTRO, SUZUKI'S
SUSHI BAR, IN GOOD COMPANY
Three great chef-owned restaurants are all in a row on Main Street in Rockland.
Lily Bistro serves French bistro and bar food for lunch and dinner. Everything is made from scratch: the rustic pork pate, the corned hake and potatoes, the crusty sourdough bread, the nightly braises and fish specials, the hand-cut frites with or without gravy and cheese curds.
Suzuki's Sushi Bar serves traditional sushi made with local, seasonal fish. Yuki Goseki runs the kitchen. She pickles seaweed and stuffs delicate shumai dumplings with Maine shrimp. Chef-owner Keiko Suzuki Steinberger handles the sushi bar. She goes to a lot of trouble to source the creamiest sea urchins, the richest monkfish liver, and the fattiest mackerel.
In Good Company is a wine bar with tapas. Chef Melody Wolfertz is a Culinary Institute of America graduate and a Rockland native. The atmosphere - overstuffed sofas and armchairs, a window seat, lots of plants - makes the place feel more like a living room than a restaurant. The wine list is endless and the food (salt boiled potatoes with red pepper aioli, pizzettas with olives and goat cheese, chicken pot pie) all tastes like the best home cooking.

Be sure the debt is yours before you pay a collection agency

Texto completo: Dear Debt Adviser,
A collection agency says I owe it for a credit card account I have never heard of. I am confused about how I will determine if the statute of limitations has passed on the debt. What do you go by? There are so many little things on my credit report, and I'm not sure what they mean. The debt collector is taking me to court. It says I must bring my bank statement, a list of all my assets and what I owe. It said it would take my property if I can't pay. It says I owe $941. I live in Maine. Can it do what it is threatening to do? One credit report says I opened the account in 2003. Another report says 2007 but gives the most recent account status as from 2004. I'm confused.
Gerry
Dear Gerry,
If you've never heard of this account, start there. You need to be certain that the debt is really yours. Somewhere in the vicinity of 25 percent of all credit reports have errors on them. Considering the billions of pieces of data that move into and out of credit files every month, I'm surprised the error rate isn't higher. Some errors are minor and others more serious, like someone else's account being on your report.
Of course, you may have forgotten about this debt because it is so old. It might be yours. So my first suggestion is to ask the collector to provide you with verification of the debt. If you request verification, the law says the collector must prove that the debt is yours and stop collection actions until it does so. Be sure you keep records of the request you sent to the collector for debt verification.
Once you receive the information from the collector, compare it with what is appearing on your credit reports. If the collector provides proof that the debt is yours and you have the money, by far the easiest thing to do is just pay what you owe and move on with your life.
If you don't owe the money, or even if you do, I suggest you speak to a really aggressive attorney who would be willing to take your case on a contingency basis. The contingency fee would be based on suing the collector for using threats, like saying it will take your property, that appear to be in violation of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act. The FDCPA states a collector may not say he or she will take an action unless he or she is actually planning to do so. The collector may not legally seize any of your property to satisfy your debt unless the property is collateral for what you owe. There have been some big awards for violations of the FDCPA.
Either way, if this case goes to court, so should you. If you don't appear before the judge, the collector will get a judgment for the debt that can be used to garnish your wages. The statute of limitations for suing in court to collect a debt looks to be six years in the state of Maine. Typically the clock starts after the debt charges off. The definition of charge-off varies by state, but is generally 120 to 180 days from the date of your last payment.
Should the debt be uncollectible in court due to the statute of limitations, you can add yet another violation of the FDCPA to the list your attorney will be suing for. Bringing an action on a debt that is past the statute of limitations is not legal. If you go to court on your own, simply appear in court and submit documentation showing the statute of limitations has expired and the court should find in your favor. If, however, the debt is collectible in court, I recommend you determine how you will pay what you owe. Working out a repayment plan with the collector before your court date is even better.

High-level FAA managers replaced
WASHINGTON The Federal Aviation Administration on Friday replaced three high-level managers in the nation's air traffic control system following embarrassing incidents of controllers sleeping on the job and making potentially dangerous mistakes.
In a shake-up of the system, new managers were appointed to key positions that oversee the operation of airport towers and regional radar centers that handle planes flying at high altitudes as well as approaches and departures, the agency said in a statement.
Geithner to exempt certain contracts
WASHINGTON Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner has decided to let companies continue to trade certain contracts used to guard against swings in currency values outside regulators' view.
New rules require that many such trades happen more transparently, on exchanges where regulators can see them. But Geithner is exempting certain contracts used by companies to hedge currency rates.
Pennsylvania
Obama criticized at NRA convention
PITTSBURGH Republican presidential aspirant Rick Santorum told National Rifle Association members at their annual convention Friday that President Barack Obama doesn't understand America, and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich told them the administration is consistently anti-gun and anti-Second Amendment.
Santorum, a former U.S. senator from Pennsylvania, criticized remarks the president made recently when he said America not only was a better country because of social programs like Medicare and Medicaid but added, I'll go further we would not be a great country without these commitments.
Maine
Ousted official defends conduct
PORTLAND A Maine cabinet member who was forced out after offending rural residents, blacks and Native Americans all in one day said Friday that some of the comments attributed to him were misconstrued and others he didn't even say.
Two days after leaving his post as commissioner of the Department of Economic and Community Development, Philip Congdon said the allegations against him are false and that much has been made over nothing.
Indiana
Governor will sign abortion legislation
INDIANAPOLIS Republican Gov. Mitch Daniels said Friday he will sign restrictive abortion legislation and make Indiana the first state to cut off all government funding for Planned Parenthood, a move likely to boost his credentials among social conservatives as he considers whether to run for president.
Daniels said he supported the abortion restrictions from the outset and that the provision added to defund Planned Parenthood did not change his mind.

In a shake-up of the system, new managers were appointed to key positions that oversee the operation of airport towers and regional radar centers that handle planes flying at high altitudes as well as approaches and departures, the agency said in a statement.
Geithner to exempt certain contracts
WASHINGTON Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner has decided to let companies continue to trade certain contracts used to guard against swings in currency values outside regulators' view.
New rules require that many such trades happen more transparently, on exchanges where regulators can see them. But Geithner is exempting certain contracts used by companies to hedge currency rates.
Pennsylvania
Obama criticized at NRA convention
PITTSBURGH Republican presidential aspirant Rick Santorum told National Rifle Association members at their annual convention Friday that President Barack Obama doesn't understand America, and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich told them the administration is consistently anti-gun and anti-Second Amendment.
Santorum, a former U.S. senator from Pennsylvania, criticized remarks the president made recently when he said America not only was a better country because of social programs like Medicare and Medicaid but added, I'll go further we would not be a great country without these commitments.
Maine
Ousted official defends conduct
PORTLAND A Maine cabinet member who was forced out after offending rural residents, blacks and Native Americans all in one day said Friday that some of the comments attributed to him were misconstrued and others he didn't even say.
Two days after leaving his post as commissioner of the Department of Economic and Community Development, Philip Congdon said the allegations against him are false and that much has been made over nothing.
Indiana
Governor will sign abortion legislation
INDIANAPOLIS Republican Gov. Mitch Daniels said Friday he will sign restrictive abortion legislation and make Indiana the first state to cut off all government funding for Planned Parenthood, a move likely to boost his credentials among social conservatives as he considers whether to run for president.
Daniels said he supported the abortion restrictions from the outset and that the provision added to defund Planned Parenthood did not change his mind.

Couple granted divorce after 6 years
NEW YORK A feuding couple who built a wall through their house because neither husband nor wife would give it up were granted a divorce after six years and hundreds of thousands of dollars in attorneys' fees.
But the legal battles may not be over for Simon and Chana Taub.
Chana Taub is unhappy with the judge's order to sell the divided Brooklyn house, plus two others, and split the proceeds with her soon-to-be ex-husband, said her lawyer, Neil Iovino. She plans to appeal.
Maine
Memorial held for mom found in pond
BRIDGTON Family and friends of a Maine woman whose body was pulled from a New Hampshire pond days after her abandoned car was found nearby with her toddler sleeping inside it held a candlelight memorial for her Thursday night.
More than 500 people turned up to remember 20-year-old Portland resident Krista Dittmeyer, whose body was recovered by divers a day earlier near the Cranmore Mountain ski area in Conway, N.H.
The gathering was at an elementary school 25 miles from Conway in Bridgton, where Dittmeyer grew up.
Virginia
Man awarded $212M in Botox case
RICHMOND A jury in Virginia has awarded $212 million to a Fredericksburg man who claims the drug Botox left him brain-damaged and disabled.
The verdict against drugmaker Allergan Inc. came Thursday after a nearly two-week trial in federal court in Richmond.
The jury awarded 67-year-old Douglas Ray Jr. $12 million in compensatory damages and $200 million in punitive damages. Ray's attorney, Ray Chester, said he was thrilled with the verdict.
Kansas
WikiLeaks suspect joins other inmates
FORT LEAVENWORTH WikiLeaks suspect Army Pfc. Bradley Manning has passed the evaluations given to new inmates at the Kansas military prison where he was recently moved and will begin living with other medium- security inmates also awaiting trial, the prison chief said Thursday.
The new detention conditions represent a marked change for Manning, who was transferred from the Marine Corps brig in Quantico, Va., where he had been held since his arrest.

Texto completo:   University of Maine researchers want to drive the state's lobsters back to sea - with a 3-iron.
An engineer, a scientist, a student, and an alumna have teamed up to develop a biodegradable golf ball from crushed lobster shells that could be used on cruise ships.
Inexpensive to make, the ball is designed to sink and degrade within weeks, depending on the ocean's depth and temperature. The balls would degrade in a similar time frame in fresh water - and break down if lost in the woods, although that would take longer.
For years, a favorite cruise ship pastime was hitting golf balls from the decks into the sea, but the practice ended after an international treaty banned the dumping of plastic, including golf balls, at sea in about 1988. The biodegradable lobster balls could revive the activity, the researchers say.
"The whole idea is that we want to use every bit of a lobster we can," said Robert Bayer, executive director of the Lobster Institute, a research group based at the University of Maine.
Most lobster shells in the lobster canning industry end up in landfills.
The idea for a golf ball made from lobster shells was first proposed by Carin Poeschel Orr, who earned a master's degree in marine bioresources at UMaine. She was a graduate student of Bayer's 10 years ago, and the two stayed in touch. Last summer, she mentioned her idea to him.
Intrigued, Bayer began making a prototype in his basement.
"I thought it was a great idea, but the first one came out terrible," Bayer said.
Armed with his lobster-shell ball - actually half a ball made by molding a mixture of shell fragments mixed with Elmer's glue - he turned to a biological and chemical engineering associate professor, David Neivandt, who was equally intrigued.
Neivandt recruited an undergraduate bioengineering student, Alex Caddell of Winterport, Maine - an avid golfer - and the group set out design a golf ball that would do everything a traditional golf ball would do.
"That means it had to perform like a golf ball, fly like a golf ball, and sound like one when you hit it," Neivandt said. Golf ball cores also need to compress and rebound, providing another challenge. "Plus, in our case, it also had to biodegrade," he said.
Neivandt came up with what he will describe only as essentially an "off-the-shelf" material to coat the crushed lobster shells. Because the university has filed a provisional patent for the lobster-shell mixture, he declined to reveal its ingredients.
The group is not yet producing the golf balls commercially, but Caddell said in a news release that their "flight properties are amazing."
"It doesn't fly quite as far as a regular golf ball, but we're actually getting a similar distance to other biodegradable golf balls," he said.
Not only are these the first biodegradable golf balls made from lobster waste, but the team says they will be less expensive than other biodegradable balls, which usually cost just under $1 each.
The lobster golf balls are expected to retail for significantly less than $1, with the raw materials for each costing as little as 19 cents.
But golf balls are not all the team has up their sleeve.
"Next on our list is biodegradable flower pots," Bayer said.

Texto completo: Months ago, I called Treasure Coast Sailing Adventures to arrange for a photographer to come aboard the Lily, a restored cargo barge that had just arrived in Stuart to provide daily sailing tours of the St. Lucie River. Capt. Fred Newhart urged me to take a trip.
I get motion sickness very easily. As much as I love living in Florida, boating really isnt my thing.
You wont get sick on this boat, Newhart said. I guarantee it.
His word was good.
Last weekend, my husband and I took our boys and met friends and their son for the Lilys sunset tour. The boat left Riverwalk, just behind Stuart City Hall, around 6 p.m. A cool, slight breeze was blowing and the sky was blue and cloudless.
Sailing the calm river gave me a new appreciation for the bridges and buildings I drive past every day. Its a beautiful little town.
The Lily can hold up to 42 people, and most of our fellow passengers were celebrating a birthday with drinks and large platters of fruit, cheese and crackers. They let our boys snag grapes, strawberries and cookies. Even pretend pirates love chocolate chip cookies.
Just before the sun began to shimmer and sink into the horizon, Newhart and his partner, Jamie Miscoski, brought out a ukulele and a violin and serenaded us with Irish music. Both are from the area and thought the restored Lily, originally built to haul lumber from Maine to Marthas Vineyard, would be a good fit in the shallow St. Lucie River.
Capping off a perfect evening, we saw a dolphin just a few yards from the boat as we glided back up to the dock. The boys were asking to sail again before we were even on dry land, and, honestly, I couldnt blame them.
Like so many of my new Treasure Coast experiences, this one left me wondering why I hadnt done it sooner.
If you want to ride on the Lily, dont wait. Newhart and Miscoski are about to head off to Maine for the summer, but theyre sailing here until April 30. Reach them at 772-267-7076 or treasurecoastsailingadventures@gmail.com.
And if you cant make it before April ends, dont worry. The Lily is supposed to return to Stuart next fall.
South to Sunfest?
Anyone heading to Sunfest this week? The West Palm Beach music festival runs April 27 to May 1 and features dozens of performers including Jason Mraz and Styx. Im heading down Wednesday to see the Avett Brothers.
If you go, let us know what you thought. Were collecting peoples reviews at TCPalm.com/submit. Click on Sunfest Reviews.

Texto completo: CASTINE The State of Maine ship will visit Mediterranean ports as part of Maine Maritime Academys annual two-month training cruise, the college announced Tuesday.
Under the command of Capt. Leslie B. Eadie III of Brewer, the training vessel will leave Castine Harbor on May 3. The cruise itinerary includes stops in Norfolk, Va., May 6-9; Valletta, Malta, May 25-28; Civitavecchia, Italy, May 31- June 3; Cobh, Ireland, June 12-15; and Portland, Maine, June 25-26. The ship will host a family day sail on the return leg from Portland to Castine.
Interim master Eadie, a 1976 graduate of the college, recently assumed command of the vessel, after the retirement of longtime permanent master of the ship, Capt. Larry Wade of Bradley. Also a graduate of the college, Wade had served as the training ships top officer since 1996.
A seasoned professional mariner with more than 28 years at sea, Eadie has sailed in various capacities with Sun Oil Co. ARCO Marine Inc., and Sabine Transportation Co. While with Sabine, he served as captain of the largest tanker to enter Anchorage, Alaska, and Massawa Inner Harbor, Eritrea.
Eadie joined the Maine Maritime Academy faculty nearly six years ago, teaching courses in terrestrial navigation, marine communications, advanced tanker operations and casualty analysis. As a faculty member, he sailed aboard the T/S State of Maine in deck training and senior deck officer positions. Eadie holds a license as an unlimited master, and is a 1st class pilot for the waters of Alaskas Prince William Sound. He earned a bachelors degree in nautical science from Maine Maritime Academy, and a masters in business administration in 2004 from the University of Phoenix. Eadie and his wife of 35 years, Kathy, have three grown children and one grandson.
Follow the Voyage, MMAs annual online ship tracking and training cruise activities website, will be coordinated by students and staff as part of this years training activities. In its 10th year of operation, the site covers the academys annual training cruise from a variety of perspectives. In addition to an interactive tracking chart of the cruise, the site provides links devoted to teaching and educational materials for students of all ages. Once the ship is under way, the public is invited to join the voyage by visiting www.mainemaritime.edu and following the Cruise 2011 link.
Due to shipboard security, the vessel will not be open to the general public for tours while in foreign or domestic ports. Well-wishers are welcomed and encouraged to view the vessel departure and return from the Maine Maritime Academy waterfront, however shipboard visits are not permitted.
The training ship will return to Castine on Sunday, June 26.
Students pursuing an officer's license from the U.S. Coast Guard as a third mate or third assistant engineer are required to train at sea for at least 60 days in each of their first three years at the Academy. Freshmen and juniors sail aboard the MMA vessel, while sophomores are assigned to merchant ships worldwide. In recent years, MMA training cruises have taken students to Aruba, Bermuda, Brazil, Belgium, Estonia, France, Germany, Great Britain, Iceland, Ireland Italy, Poland, Russia, and Spain; as well as other European and Caribbean countries.
The 500-foot, 16,000-ton T/S State of Maine, the former USNS Tanner, originally served as a Navy oceanographic research vessel and was converted in 1997 to accommodate the training needs of the college. The fourth vessel to bear the name State of Maine, the ship is a modern, technologically advanced training vessel.
Maine Maritime Academy, founded in 1941, enrolls more than 900 students from 35 states and several foreign countries. The college awards associate, bachelors and masters degrees in 15 fields of study.

Athletes quaff no-alcohol beer as sport drink

Texto completo: PORTLAND, Maine Beer. It's not just for couch potatoes anymore.
A Bavarian brewmeister is touting its no-alcohol beer as the latest sport drink for athletes, handing it out at the finish line of sporting events and touting its regenerative benefits.
Unlike Gatorade, Erdinger Alkoholfrei is served up with a frothy head. And it comes in one color a golden hue unlike conventional sport drinks.
Several top athletes from Europe quaffed the beverage from giant mugs on the podium of the World Cup biathlons held this month in northern Maine.
The company touts the beverage as an isotonic, vitamin-rich, no-additive beverage with natural regenerative powers that help athletes recover from a workout. In other words, it's carbohydrate-loaded refreshment without the alcoholic buzz of beer or the jitters caused by some energy drinks.
It's a very healthy product, said Glenn McDonald, U.S. manager for Erdinger. Overseas, it's very popular. It's the No. 1 non-alcohol beer in Germany.
Even though it's called alcohol-free, Alkoholfrei still contains less than 0.5 percent alcohol. That makes it verboten for anyone under 21 in Maine. Other states, like California, allow minors to buy alcohol-free beer.
Promoted as a sports and fitness drink, Erdinger began targeting athletes in 2001 in Europe with an advertising campaign featuring a pair of triathletes. Its popularity quickly grew in Europe, where it's often distributed for free in the finishing area of sporting events.
Marketing beer as a sport drink for athletes is a new concept in the U.S., though McDonald points out that Alkoholfrei can be enjoyed by anyone, not just athletes.
Whether Americans couch potatoes and athletes alike are ready to embrace another no-alcohol beer is unclear. Sales of no-alcohol beer have been declining for more than a decade in United States, so any new entrant faces an uphill battle, said Benj Steinman, editor of Beer Marketers Insights.
Erdinger, which is already sold in 45 U.S. states, has identified Alkoholfrei as a priority brand as part of a larger push into North America, McDonald said.
The 125-year-old company, which makes Alkoholfrei in the same brewery outside Munich where it turns out conventional wheat beers for suds-loving Germans, promotes itself at cycling and running events in the summer. In the winter, it's one of the main sponsors of the World Cup biathlon, which combines cross-country skiing and rifle marksmanship.
At World Cup events, Erdinger banners are prominently placed in the stadium and on the course for visibility. Erdinger also is on some of the bibs worn by athletes.
Erdinger hopes to win over consumers with a great German beer flavor that others lack. It doesn't come cheap, however, at about $10 for a six-pack.
As for its health claims, a University of Maine nutritionist is skeptical.
Beer contains sodium, potassium, carbohydrates and B vitamins, all of which are good, but they're not found at the optimal levels for an athlete, said professor Mary Ellen Camire.
It will help with rehydration. Whether it's the ideal drink to have, I'm not sure, she said.

Texto completo: VERO BEACH Many of the 55 people watching the award-winning documentary The End of the Line, Sunday night said they'd re-examine their fish consumption.
The 2009 film, screened by the Social Justice committee of the Unitarian Universalist Fellowship Church of Vero Beach on Sunday evening, described how ocean fish populations, once renewable, are no longer renewable due to overfishing by commercial fisherman.
Rita Maier, whose family comes from a fishing background in Maine, said she was aware of the problem. Twenty years ago, she had family members who had to stop fishing off the coast of Maine because of the dwindling population, and, instead, fish off the coast of Canada.
The film, directed by Rupert Murray and narrated by Ted Danson, is based on the book, The End of the Line by Charles Clover.
The film chronicled the sharp decline of the bluefin tuna caused by increasing demand for sushi.
The documentary went on to highlight how regulations were not well-received by fisherman in other parts of the world, but touched on how a 250-mile commercial fishing area in Alaska is being well-received by commercial fisherman. Alaskan fisherman in the documentary said the restrictions would allow the population to grow over time allowing their catches to be more plentiful in the long term.
Nancy Stiefel, a member of the Social Justice Committee and of the church, said the film series started in 2006 when the church received a copy of the Al Gore film An Inconvenient Truth. When the church showed the film, turnout was good, so now a Social Justice Film Committee shows films once a month from September through June.
Stiefel said the next film, the documentary, For the Bible Tells Me So, is scheduled for May 1.

Lobster shells valuable for golf balls, plant pots

Texto completo: ORONO, Maine Lobsters aren't just for eating anymore.
The shells from Maine's signature seafood are being used to manufacture decorative tiles, trivets and drinking-glass coasters. Work is under way to utilize them in countertops and tabletops. And at the University of Maine, a professor has developed prototypes of biodegradable golf balls and plant pots made out of ground-up lobster shells.
Instead of dumping the shells at landfills, the idea is to add value to the product, which hopefully will funnel back into the industry, said David Neivandt, a professor of chemical and biological engineering who created a biodegradable golf ball with a core made of lobster shells.
Lobster processors dispose of tons of lobster shells that are left over after the meat is removed. Industry leaders have long wondered if there might be a way to make money from the part thrown away.
Neivandt and one of his students, Alex Caddell, together developed a golf ball using ground-up lobster shells mixed with a glue-like substance for its core. The shell is also made out of naturally derived biodegradable material, but they aren't giving specifics because they don't want to give away any secrets. The ball is the same size and weight as a standard golf ball but is intended for use on cruise ships or at driving ranges that are on lakes or the ocean.
Dumping golf balls into the sea is prohibited under international convention because they are made of plastic and don't break down, but the lobster golf ball is biodegradable and disintegrates in the water in about three weeks.
Caddell, who played golf in high school, said he and Neivandt tested numerous balls that cracked, didn't fly quite right or otherwise didn't make the cut. Finally, they came upon just the right mixture that makes the ball hit nearly like the real thing.
The first time I hit it, I was surprised it didn't shatter into a million pieces, Caddell said. And it flew straight. I usually have a pretty bad slice, so to hit it straight was amazing.
With an iron, the ball flies nearly the same distance as a standard ball. With a driver, it'll go 60 to 70 percent of the distance.
There are other biodegradable golf balls on the market, which sell for about $1 each, Neivandt said. The raw materials for the lobster golf ball cost about 19 cents per ball, which could make it competitive in the open market.
The university has filed a provisional patent for the lobster-shell mixture. Neivandt said a private company could buy the licensing rights and market the ball, or the school could spin off a company that would produce it.
While developing the golf ball, they also came up with a plant pot made out of lobster shell mixture which has a high calcium content beneficial to flowers and vegetables to place directly in the ground with flowers or vegetable plants.
Turning seafood waste products such as lobster or clam shells into products with commercial value would benefit the seafood industry, said Bob Bayer, head of The Lobster Institute Research and Education organization at the University of Maine.
Most lobster shells are dumped in the garbage or at landfills, Bayer said, with some of it going toward seafood compost used for gardens or turned into lobster meal, which is an animal feed additive. There have been failed efforts to turn the shells into other marketable products such as lobster bait over the years, so Bayer is pleased to see new products come on line.
The whole idea is to add value to our lobster, he said. The more value we can extract, the more fishermen will be paid and more jobs will be created.

Texto completo: PORTLAND, Maine Kindergarten classes are supplementing crayons, finger paints and flashcards with iPads, a development that excites supporters but that detractors worry is wasted on pupils too young to appreciate the expense.
Next fall, nearly 300 kindergartners in the central Maine city of Auburn will become the latest batch of youngsters around the country to get iPad2 touch pad tablets to learn the basics about ABCs, 1-2-3s, drawing and even music.
It's definitely an adventure, and it'll be a journey of learning for teachers and students, said Auburn kindergarten teacher Amy Heimerl, who received an iPad on Tuesday ahead of the full deployment in the fall. I'm looking forward to seeing where this can take us and our students.
But the $200,000 that Superintendent Tom Morrill is proposing to spend on iPads which retail for around $500 might be better spent on some other school program, said Sue Millard of Auburn, who has children in the fourth grade and high school. She also questions whether kindergartners are old enough to appreciate the effort.
I understand you have to keep up with technology, but I think a 5-year-old is a little too young to understand, she said.
Maine was the first state to equip students statewide with computers when it distributed Apple laptops to all seventh- and eighth-graders in 2002 and 2003. The program since has expanded, with laptops parceled out to about 50 percent of high school students.
The State Department of Education says it believes Auburn is the first school district in Maine that will give iPads to kindergartners. The school board last week unanimously approved the plan to give all kindergartners iPads next fall.
The iPad is a powerful education tool with hundreds of teaching applications, Morrill said. With its touch pad screen, it's simple to use and can bring learning to life with imagery and sounds, he said.

Texto completo: FORT PIERCE The Treasure Coast banking world underwent a major change when TD Bank took over for Riverside National Bank a year ago.
To some, the bright green from TD Bank's new marquees represents fresh capital in a Treasure Coast banking sector battered by bad loans, high unemployment and falling home prices.
But for Riverside investors and former employees, the deep blue from the former company's banners represents a long, metaphorical winter for those who lost investments and jobs when Riverside vanished.
The federal government seized Fort Pierce-based Riverside on April 16, 2010 and sold the bank's assets to a subsidiary of Toronto-Dominion Bank, the second largest bank in Canada. Riverside had been St. Lucie County's leader in deposits and reinvested into the area through many sponsorships.
Those with regular checking and savings accounts kept their money and many remained customers. But the exchange eliminated one of the Treasure Coast's largest local banks and turned privately-held Riverside stock once valued at more than $550 per share to dust.
Experts differ on why Riverside failed, but TD bank emerged from the country's banking meltdown not only with dollars to lend, but with money to expand.
The company began serving Florida customers about five years ago with hopes of expanding throughout the state. The availability of Riverside's customer base fell perfectly into TD Bank's plans for getting more Florida locations, said Kevin Gillen, the bank's regional president for Florida.
It was the equivalent of turning the clock forward almost seven or eight years, Gillen said.
Gillen said reports should show March as the company's best month on record in Florida.
The company completed its face-lift of the old Riverside signson Sept. 24, about five months after taking over the bank.
TD Bank has 15 teller locations throughout the Treasure Coast, and the company's green vans featuring marketing slogans such as Wow Zone and America's Most Convenient Bank have started to replace Riverside Bank (hearts) Con
Convenient Bank have started to replace Riverside Bank (hearts) Me bumper stickers along U.S. 1.
For many customers, the bank switch meant a trade of local connection for convenience, including extended hours on weekdays and weekends.
Fort Pierce resident Christina Garwood, 54, said she banked at Riverside for about a decade before the turnover. Garwood said TD Bank kept many of the same tellers she saw with Riverside.
The customer service is great, Garwood said. They take care of me. I go to see the same people, so it's good.
While many customers such as Garwood don't notice much of a difference, investors and former employees saw major transition.
For 25 years, some of the area's elite flocked to Riverside stock as one of the area's best investments. Shares initially selling for $10 a pop in 1982 went for more than $550 in 2008 while paying a large dividend. Those shares are now worthless.
Some Treasure Coast families had their entire life savings tied into Riverside, and when the company went under, so did those families' retirement funds.
That's very troubling for them and very troubling for anybody else associated with the bank, said Fort Pierce-based attorney Frank Speedy Fee. Fee represents Riverside National Bank's board of directors and bought shares from Riverside founder Vernon Smith in early 2007.
When bank stocks began to fall, Fee said he looked to sell his stake. But once he learned Riverside had problems, he pulled the stocks from the market.
I did not know what they were worth, and I wasn't going to sell them to somebody if I didn't think they were getting full value, Fee said.
Fee said he does not hold any ill feelings toward Smith despite the loss on the investment.
I've given him the benefit of the doubt as to what he knew or didn't know at that time because it was not until later in the year that events occurred that clearly spelled out a problem for Riverside, Fee said.
Others were not so quick to forgive.
On March 30, Indian River County residents R. William Becker and Mary Ann Becker sued Smith after he personally sold them $1 million in shares in 2008. According to the suit, Smith told the two the bank was in sound financial shape at the time of the purchase.
Smith did not return calls seeking comment, but in May, he told Scripps Treasure Coast Newspapers that bank officials were totally above board and apologized for Riverside's failure. Smith said he felt badly for investors.
Absolutely, he said. I'm one of them. Obviously this was a real bad development, the way it worked out for all of us.
And that includes some employees.
Although TD Bank retained most of Riverside's 1,100 employees, the company cut 200 spots. Some of the employees were offered jobs elsewhere in the bank. TD Bank still is hiring on the Treasure Coast and expects to grow, Gillen said.
But for employees, the stress of uncertainty and for some eventual layoffs took a toll.
St. Lucie County Commission Chairman Chris Craft's wife, Patti, served as a vice president for Riverside for about five years before being offered a choice either to take a job in New Jersey or face termination a couple months after TD Bank took over. Given her husband's position, a move was not feasible.
She has since found a job at First Bank & Trust of Indiantown, but Chris Craft said the process was difficult. Bonuses amounting to 20 percent of pay disappeared before the takeover, Craft said. Patti and Chris Craft knew many local people within the banking world.
Just even seeing some of our friends who were also working at Riverside, and the anxiousness, the uncertainty of whether or not my job is going to be there when I get there tomorrow,' obviously it weighed on all of us, Chris Craft said.
Chris Craft said he gave up his 2010 U.S. congressional bid in part because of the stress at home, but the commissioner said he did not blame the bank's board for Riverside's failure.
There was great effort put forward by those folks, and they're good people, he said.
They also were people with close ties to the community. Riverside leaders made community involvement a core aspect of the company.
The bank sponsored both major and minor local events and charities such as local chapters for the United Way and Rotary Club. When TD Bank came, some were concerned the international bank would not participate as much in sponsorships, St. Lucie County Chamber of Commerce President Linda Cox said.
I would say it's always a fear, Cox said. We always worry about it, but so far, it hasn't held true. We've done pretty well.
TD Bank will serve as the title sponsor for the chamber's annual Fishing Frenzy in May and is a sponsor for Port St. Lucie's 50th anniversary celebration later this month.
Company representatives have visited several Treasure Coast classrooms to teach about money, and several of the company's Treasure Coast branches feature educational games for children. The learning activities are part of TD Bank's marketing focus on families.
Still, Ken Thomas, a Miami-based independent bank consultant and economist, said it's easier for a bank to be involved in the community where the bank's leadership lives.
When we lost Riverside National, we lost the entire tree, including the roots, and they were replaced with branches, Thomas said. But we hope that TD Bank does keep the same level of support to different causes that Riverside did because they are replacing a very important bank. Riverside had a very important place in the community.

Texto completo: PORTLAND, Maine Kindergarten classes are supplementing crayons, finger paints and flashcards with iPads, a development that excites supporters but that detractors worry is wasted on pupils too young to appreciate the expense.
Next fall, nearly 300 kindergartners in the central Maine city of Auburn will become the latest batch of youngsters around the country to get iPad2 touch pad tablets to learn the basics about ABCs, 1-2-3s, drawing and even music.
It's definitely an adventure, and it'll be a journey of learning for teachers and students, said Auburn kindergarten teacher Amy Heimerl, who received an iPad on Tuesday ahead of the full deployment in the fall. I'm looking forward to seeing where this can take us and our students.
But the $200,000 that Superintendent Tom Morrill is proposing to spend on iPads which retail for around $500 might be better spent on some other school program, said Sue Millard of Auburn, who has children in the fourth grade and high school. She also questions whether kindergartners are old enough to appreciate the effort.
I understand you have to keep up with technology, but I think a 5-year-old is a little too young to understand, she said.
Maine was the first state to equip students statewide with computers when it distributed Apple laptops to all seventh- and eighth-graders in 2002 and 2003. The program since has expanded, with laptops parceled out to about 50 percent of high school students.
The State Department of Education says it believes Auburn is the first school district in Maine that will give iPads to kindergartners. The school board last week unanimously approved the plan to give all kindergartners iPads next fall.
The iPad is a powerful education tool with hundreds of teaching applications, Morrill said. With its touch pad screen, it's simple to use and can bring learning to life with imagery and sounds, he said.

Texto completo: VERO BEACH Many of the 55 people watching the award-winning documentary The End of the Line, Sunday night said they'd re-examine their fish consumption.
The 2009 film, screened by the Social Justice committee of the Unitarian Universalist Fellowship Church of Vero Beach on Sunday evening, described how ocean fish populations, once renewable, are no longer renewable due to overfishing by commercial fisherman.
Rita Maier, whose family comes from a fishing background in Maine, said she was aware of the problem. Twenty years ago, she had family members who had to stop fishing off the coast of Maine because of the dwindling population, and, instead, fish off the coast of Canada.
The film, directed by Rupert Murray and narrated by Ted Danson, is based on the book, The End of the Line by Charles Clover.
The film chronicled the sharp decline of the bluefin tuna caused by increasing demand for sushi.
The documentary went on to highlight how regulations were not well-received by fisherman in other parts of the world, but touched on how a 250-mile commercial fishing area in Alaska is being well-received by commercial fisherman. Alaskan fisherman in the documentary said the restrictions would allow the population to grow over time allowing their catches to be more plentiful in the long term.
Nancy Stiefel, a member of the Social Justice Committee and of the church, said the film series started in 2006 when the church received a copy of the Al Gore film An Inconvenient Truth. When the church showed the film, turnout was good, so now a Social Justice Film Committee shows films once a month from September through June.
Stiefel said the next film, the documentary, For the Bible Tells Me So, is scheduled for May 1.

The war's start? Try looking in Maine

Texto completo: Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee turned Gettysburg into the grandest Civil War site in the North by invading Union territory in an in-your-face assault on Lincoln's army. That piece of rural Pennsylvania remains an awesome historical gut punch. It is not, however, the only significant Civil War site in the North.
It could be argued that the war started in this far North college town. Here Harriet Beecher Stowe wrote "Uncle Tom's Cabin," inspired by a sermon in a church that still stands at the corner of Maine Street and Bath Road: the First Parish Church.
Though historians disagree about whether Abraham Lincoln ever actually said, "So this is the little lady who started the great war" upon greeting her at the White House, her book had a nation-bending impact. Stowe's novel about the realities of slavery helped jell abolitionist opinion leading up to the war.
Just across the street from that Brunswick church is the home of a young Bowdoin College professor who would become one of the greatest heroes of Gettysburg, repelling fierce Confederate assaults. The Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain home is now a museum (207-729-6606, community.curtislibrary.com/pejepscot.htm) at 226 Maine St. The house escaped destruction in the 1980s and now has been smartly restored.
The shock for a visitor is that you might get there and find the museum closed. Check ahead. In this year, the 150th anniversary of the war's start, the museum doesn't open until May 24. It's also closed Sundays and Mondays.
Those significant sites aside, heading south out of town, you'll see how legacies aren't always what one might hope. There stands the Uncle Tom's Market, probably not the sort of commercial establishment Mrs. Stowe would have gloried in.
Then again, it's only 10 minutes to Freeport, which is a shopper's paradise, including the huge home of L.L. Bean. No worry about the hours there: Bean is always open (800-441-5713, llbean.com/llb/shop/1000001704).

Texto completo: She would have made her father, Pabst Blue Ribbon, very proud.
Anheuser Bee performed onstage like a master pianist playing Moonlight Sonata Saturday at the Cat Fanciers Associations 20th annual cat show in Memphis.
The 8-year-old purebred Birman won over many a judges heart on the display table, and owner James Watson said he plans to hit up a few more shows before the seasons end . With enough points, Bee could land one of the coveted regional champion titles.
About 200 cats strutted their stuff in a showroom at Agricenter International, climbing scratching posts and swatting at feathers. A variety of breeds were represented, from Himalayan, Persian and Maine Coon to Cornish Rex and Siamese.
This is not really a big show, but there are some beautiful cats here, said Liz Watson, a judge and breeder. The quality at smaller shows is typically very consistent. The long-haired champions were very pretty.
Watson breeds Russian Blues and the hairless Sphynx, one of the more unusual-looking and expensive breeds. Prices for a show-quality Sphynx begin in the $2,000 range. Only one Sphynx was registered this weekend, so 21-year-old owner Olivia El-Awady bagged first place at her first show with 10-month-old Omorfosgatos Bucking Bronco.
I got one (Sphynx) as a pet, and then I got Bronco to begin breeding, said El-Awady, a neuroscience major at the University of Iowa . I like the Sphynx personality; its like part monkey, part child, part dog.
Spectators watched as judges made their rounds, taking each cat out of its cage and examining its traits.
I feel a silky fur, a sea of shaggy coat, one judge murmured while handling a Maine Coon. This cat is groomed to perfection.
But achieving that perfection takes time, said Cindy Steadham, holding her Exotic Shorthair named Beetlejuice, aka Juicy.
It took Steadham nearly two hours to give Juicy his show bath and finish his fur with a metro blow dryer. The 2-year-old brown-spotted tabby started to shake in Steadhams arms as a swarm of onlookers asked for pictures with the orange-eyed beauty.
Hes just being shy, Steadham said. But at home hes a ham, real rambunctious.
The cat show runs today from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Admission is $6 for adults, $4 for children.

Texto completo: The Texan is a big guest star with one of the busiest travel itineraries in the country, but he likes to drink from hotel room toilets.
When he arrives in Memphis for his latest guest appearance, at Agricenter International, it will be as a guest of honor with a national title wholl give admirers a chance to cuddle him.
Meet Walker, a 25-pound Maine Coon cat from Richmond, Texas, one of the main attractions when the Mid South Cat Fanciers hold their 20th annual show Saturday and Sunday.
Walker was the winner at the 2010 Meet the Breeds showcase of dogs and cats in New York, and he will be on hand to be photographed and held during the Agricenter show and competition, called Spring Fling.
Eight-year-old Walker won what amounts to a beauty contest when he was chosen by audience acclaim at the New York show, said Alvin Green, president of the Mid South Cat Fanciers. Walker beat out an American shorthair cat and an exotic shorthair cat in what was billed the Iams Cat Idol competition.
Green said the Maine Coon cat is the largest domestic cat breed, but Walker is exceptional. Most Maine Coons weigh in the teens up to about 20 pounds. They are hardly ever his size. To see a video of Walker winning his competition, go to .
His owner, orthodontic assistant Donna Hinton, has traveled to dozens of cities with Walker and said she has learned that nationally recognized show cats have quirks that set them apart as much as their breeding . Walker is able to lift split toilet seats with his nose and likes to drink from the toilet in his hotel room. He also likes to rummage through her purse for makeup sponges which he likes to bat around on the hotel room floor.
The Agricenter Show will include between 150 and 200 cats competing in adult, kitten and fixed-cat categories, Green said. In the shows long history, he said a cat has never escaped or run away. If one gets loose, we close the doors and catch them right away.
The shows are 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Saturday and 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. Sunday. Admission is $6 for adults and $4 for children.

Texto completo: Note: "Having a single code for Maine makes it so much easier to do commercial development in the state. We want the governor and legislators to know that this is a positive form of regulation because these are very achievable, measurable standards." John O'Dea, president of the Associated General Contractors of Maine
Homebuilders, engineers and contractors gathered at the State House on Tuesday to protest attempts to gut or eliminate Maine's Uniform Building and Energy Code, which was adopted last year.
Maine's code is similar to those in 40 other states. Several pieces of legislation have been drafted to repeal or weaken it, including L.D. 43, "An Act to Repeal the Maine Uniform Building and Energy Code." That bill is scheduled for a public hearing Thursday before the Legislature's Labor Committee.
The businesses that joined in Tuesday's protest called on Gov. Paul LePage and legislators to oppose any rollbacks. They said the code improves Maine's business climate, reduces energy costs and improves the quality and safety of new homes and commercial buildings.
Speakers provided copies of a letter to LePage signed by some of Maine's leading building trade associations, representing more than 1,500 businesses.
John O'Dea, president of the Associated General Contractors of Maine, said the code is good for business.
"Having a single code for Maine makes it so much easier to do commercial development in the state," he said. "We want the governor and legislators to know that this is a positive form of regulation because these are very achievable, measurable standards."
The state is training and certifying code enforcement officials and third-party inspectors who can certify compliance in towns that choose not to hire municipal code officials. Towns that did not previously have building codes have until July 2012 to choose some method of enforcement.
A new analysis of costs and benefits of the energy portion of the code was described by Ashley Richards, a builder and insulation contractor from Yarmouth. He said the incremental cost of building to the code is less than $3,000, and the code creates net savings through energy reductions starting with the first monthly payment.

Texto completo:   MACHIAS, Maine -- Former Pleasant Point Police Chief Joseph Barnes, 42, pleaded guilty Wednesday in Washington County Superior Court to felony theft charges involving more than $33,244 that he took from Passamaquoddy Tribal accounts between April 2007 and May 2008.
Assistant Attorney General Leanne Robbin said Barnes used the money to feed a gambling habit at casinos in both Connecticut and Louisiana, and avoided tribal and U.S. Department of Interior investigations for months.
His police career destroyed and his reputation shattered, Barnes sobbed through much of Wednesday's proceeding. His attorney said he was under the care of a mental health counselor and Barnes' sentencing was postponed until June 9 because of his tenuous emotional state.
Robbin explained that Barnes, who was an honored and decorated police chief, began funneling thousands of dollars into a so-called soda account, and then "frittered it all away" at Foxwoods Casino in Connecticut and another casino in Marksville, La.
Robbin said Barnes refused to answer questions when the tribe's chief financial officer discovered that thousands of dollars were suddenly being deposited in the small soda account, supported by a vending machine in the police station. Those deposits then were being withdrawn by Barnes, either through automatic teller machines at casinos, or checks written out to cash.
After being confronted in May 2009, Barnes resigned as the police chief and did not provide tribal leaders with an exit interview.
According to Robbin, in October 2007 Barnes withdrew $2,400 from an ATM at a Louisiana casino, just days after a $10,000 check from an ESPN executive was diverted from a tribal charity into the soda account. The check was intended to purchase three permits for moose hunts for the ESPN executive on tribal lands.
Other money deposited in the soda account came from the state of Maine for reimbursements for services, for a Maine Drug Enforcement Agency officer, and tribal warden funds.
Throughout the investigation, Barnes claimed the money went toward paying off confidential informants and supplying cash prizes to various charities. Robbin said Barnes could provide no documentation of that.
Robbin said most of the checks deposited were addressed to the Pleasant Point Police Department but should have been deposited in the tribal general fund as revenues. The investigation was triggered by tribal leaders and involved the U.S. Department of the Interior and the Maine Attorney General's Office.
"We discovered there was a correlation between withdrawals made by Mr. Barnes and trips he made to casinos," Robbin said. She said Barnes stopped using an ATM at one point and began writing checks to cash for $200, $500 and $750. The withdrawals stopped in May 2008, she said, "because there was no more money and the tribe was left with overdraft fees."
Wednesday's hearing took place just one day before jury selection was to begin for Barnes' trial. He pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor of misuse of entrusted funds and a felony charge of theft by unauthorized taking.
A pre-sentence investigation was requested by Barnes' attorney Jeff Davidson, who said he expects to call several witnesses at the sentencing hearing.
Justice E. Allen Hunter set June 9 as a sentencing date.
Robbin said the state will be asking for a four-year prison sentence with all but one year suspended and restitution.
Barnes, who served as a police officer for more than 20 years, was in his 20s when he was appointed police chief at Pleasant Point in 1992, the youngest on the reservation. In 2000, the Maine Criminal Justice Academy in Waterville certified Barnes as a police chief. He was the first American Indian in the state to receive such certification.
Barnes in 2006 received the Chief of Police of the Year Award from the National Native American Law Enforcement Association, the first for a Maine American Indian police chief. In 2000 Barnes, working with the Maine Drug Enforcement Agency, helped deal a blow to the prescription drug problem on the reservation when a covert operation led to the arrest of some 15 people. Three years later, the Maine Drug Enforcement Agency presented Barnes and former tribal investigator Robert Dore with the distinguished Maine Drug Task Force Service Award.

Maine's blunt-talking governor rankles voters Hardscrabble life may account for what he says

Texto completo: AUGUSTA, Maine With less than three months on the job, Gov. Paul LePage has already managed to rankle more constituencies with his bluntness than any Maine governor in recent memory.
Even before he was elected, LePage said he'd tell the president to go to hell. Two weeks after taking office, he called the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People a special interest group and told critics to kiss my butt over his decision to not attend the NAACP's annual Martin Luther King Jr. Day celebrations.
He later raised a ruckus when he dismissed the dangers of bisphenol-A, a chemical additive used in some plastic bottles, saying the worst that could happen was some women may have little beards.
Now he's ticking off labor groups and smaller constituencies such as artists and museum curators, which typically aren't on anybody's political radar screen by removing a huge mural depicting the state's labor history from the Labor Department headquarters because it wasn't in keeping with his pro-business agenda. When asked what he would do if anybody tried to block the mural's removal, he said, I'd laugh at them, the idiots.
You could draw up a pretty extensive list of various constituencies across the state that Gov. LePage has managed to offend in one way or another, said Mark Brewer, a political science professor at the University of Maine. And the fact that he's been in office for only a few months makes the size of that list all the more impressive.
Nobody expected a polished, spit-and-shine governor when LePage, a Republican, was elected in November. The oldest son in an impoverished family of 18 children in blue-collar Lewiston, he left home before he was a teenager to escape domestic violence. He shined shoes and sold newspapers while sleeping at friends' homes, in horse stables and even in an upstairs room at a strip joint.
With his tell-it-like-it-is attitude and his aim of shaking up state government, it's inevitable LePage will anger certain people. The governor speaks what's on his mind, said spokeswoman Adrienne Bennett.
It's his policies and the substance that people should be focusing on, Bennett said. Whether or not he gets style points is not high on our priority list.
You'd have to go back to James Longley, an independent who served from 1975-79, to find anything close to the spiciness coming from LePage, said Kenneth Palmer, who has written several books on Maine politics and taught at the University of Maine from 1969-2004.
Longley could be abrasive and once called some legislators pimps, but it was his ideology not his off-the-cuff remarks that most angered his critics, he said.
On the whole, Maine governors have been fairly straight-laced and moderate, Palmer said.
It's hard to say if LePage's style is hurting him politically, said MaryEllen FitzGerald, president of the Critical Insights market research firm in Portland.
LePage's brusqueness may be energizing his detractors, but it may also be invigorating his supporters, FitzGerald said.
Depending on which side of the fence you're on, you see him as being either very insensitive and careless, or you see him as being a pretty effective strategist, she said.

Texto completo:   Former S.C. Gov. Mark Sanford nearly screwed it up for the rest of us. When I told my wife that I was going hiking for a few days on the Appalachian Trial, she didn't automatically think I was headed to Argentina for a wild fling with a mistress.
She knew I was out on a date with my adoring dog, Pearl, the golden Lab. Pearl and I packed up for a southerly jaunt along the AT through the Southern Nantahala Wilderness. But we weren't alone. I wanted to see the annual migration of thru-hikers who start out about this time of year from Springer Mountain, Ga., with Maine on their minds.
In three days, Pearl and I passed about 50 folks working their way north with heavy packs and trekking poles.
Each year, more than 2 million people walk part of the Appalachian Trail, but only a die-hard few dare to hike the whole 2,179 miles from Springer up to Mount Katahdin in Maine. Last year, 1,460 thru-hikers signed in at Springer. Their numbers were whittled down to 747 by the midway point at 1,013 miles at Harpers Ferry, Va., and only 349 made it all the way to Katahdin by the season's end.
Pearl with her pack got petted by plenty of hikers we met in our journey. We would catch our breath every quarter-mile or so, talking with the next hiker about the weather or how far the next shelter and water was. They came in all ages and sizes and both sexes, from college-age guys to grizzled seniors. There were German exchange students and a New Englander given his accent, trying to head not just back toward home, but to the next shelter and the promise of a dry night ahead.
Trucking along the AT changes people, who take on trail names for the duration.
"Savage" hailed from Augusta, Ga., a polite kid despite his trail name, who had the disconcerting habit of calling me "sir." We chatted as we caught our breath atop 5,085-foot Albert Mountain with its long views east toward Franklin and Dillard, Ga.
"Crux" snuck up on me at the spring at Mooney's Gap about dusk. He had only been out for five days, which meant he was logging about 20 miles a day. "Yeah, I've been moving along," he said over his shoulder, already trucking up the trail.
A gray-haired guy with a black knee brace was climbing up the trail the next morning.
"Where you headed?"
"The next shelter," he huffed. "Maine, maybe."
"How long you been out here?"
"Don't ask. I'm a turtle," he replied.
With about 100 miles already under their cinched hip belts, many of these hikers were headed to Winding Stairs Gap to catch a free shuttle for the 11-mile ride down U.S. 64 to Franklin. Designated an Appalachian Trail Community just last year, Franklin is trying to make itself into a hiker-friendly destination, according to Bill Van Horn of the Nantahala Hiking Club.
A survey by the club and the Appalachian Trail Conservancy found that the average thru-hikers stopping off in Franklin spent $153 in town for an estimated $38,339 impact on area hotels and businesses. They may look rough and disheveled, but many thru-hikers come with higher incomes. The survey found 19 percent made between $40,000 and $60,000 annually and another 19 percent topped out above $60,000. They were also better-educated with 48 percent carrying bachelor's degrees and 12 percent with master's. It doesn't take a Ph.D. to hike the AT, but about 4 percent of the surveyed trekkers had doctorates.
In their annual migration, trekkers are spending money from Wesser to Hot Springs along North Carolina's 280 miles and at rural outposts through 13 other states along the AT. Franklin wants to join that crowd.
"We're trying to capitalize on how close we are to the trail and make sure the hikers get a good feeling for Franklin," Van Horn said. "They might want to come back with their families."
After days of camaraderie on the AT, Pearl and I had the whole four miles of the Long Ridge Trail to ourselves as we descended 2,000 feet to Standing Indian campground for a 21-mile loop.
By now, Savage might be saying "sir" to folks in Hot Springs. Turtle might be crawling through the Smokies. Crux might be closing in on Damascus, Va.
But I still didn't come across Gov. Sanford.

Charlotte MacVane
of Bainbridge Island
Dec. 6, 1929
to March 26, 2011
Charlotte MacVane, beloved wife of Tom, died peacefully at home in his arms on March 26, 2011 after a long struggle with Lyme disease.
Born Charlotte Jane Sears on December 6, 1929 in Boston to Charles and Helen Sears, she grew up in Somerville, Massachusetts. Charlotte graduated in 1951 from Wheelock College in Boston with a degree in elementary education. She taught kindergarten in Medford, Massachusetts and early childhood development at the University of Maryland.
While summering with friends in 1953, Charlotte met her future husband Tom MacVane in his hometown of Long Island, a small island off the Maine coast. They were married on March 5, 1954. Throughout their 57-year marriage, they enjoyed many happy summers in their Long Island cottage The Camp. Charlotte and Tom raised 5 children while living in Maine, New York, California, Indiana and Washington. They spent the past 36 years in their home on Bainbridge Island.
She loved reading and singing to her grandchildren, driving adventures with her husband, walking the paths of Long Island, baking goodies and chatting with family and friends. Charlotte spent many hours volunteering at church, her children's schools, the Long Island Library and was a member of P.E.O. As a new and cautious driver at age 47, her children marveled at her ability to get to her destination without making any left turns! She dedicated her life to the care of her family and they were her joy and contentment. Her love, laughter, smile and wisdom are deeply missed.
Charlotte is survived by her husband Tom, daughters Ellen Arbour (Ron), Susan Armstrong (Vince), Beth Brundige (Mike) all of Bainbridge Island; sons Todd of Bainbridge Island and Jay (Heather) of Poulsbo and grandchildren Kyle, Scott, Grace (Alex), Dane, Lance, Ty, Troy, Cole, Emma and Cara.

A private memorial will be held on Bainbridge Island and an additional service is planned this summer on Long Island. In lieu of flowers, donations are suggested to the International Lyme and Associated Diseases Society at www.ilads.org.
It is our hope that others will learn about Lyme disease, a disease easily misdiagnosed.

Patricia A. Bolling
of Port Orchard
May 24, 1931
to March 24, 2011
Patricia A. Bolling, beloved wife, devoted mother and grandmother, peacefully passed this earth on March 24, 2011 after a 5-year battle with lung cancer which she fought both bravely and with dignity.
She was born May 24, 1931 to Leslie and Ethel (Helm) Greene in Olympia, Washington, where she enjoyed a childhood filled with swimming, raising Cocker Spaniels, cheerleading and art.
She married Sam Bolling, her husband of 60 years, on July 14, 1950 in Olympia where they owned a body and fender shop. Sharing a deep love of boating, they moved to Bremerton in 1962 to open B&B Marine where she welcomed customers with a hot cup of coffee and her memorable smile.
She enjoyed downhill skiing, gardening, home improvement, boating, water skiing, dancing, painting and entertaining throughout her life and was well known for her impeccable sense of style and fashion. She was also known as a loyal friend who welcomed many to her hearth and home.
After closing the marina, she enjoyed working in retail fashion and later shared adventures with Sam delivering boats throughout the U.S. and Canada. Pat was a member of Mathis Guild, Winter Club, Kitsap Ski Bus, several dinner clubs, pursued a number of art and oil painting classes and frequently volunteered her time to care for neighbors and friends.
Animals, especially dogs and birds, were attracted to her and she was rarely seen without a beloved pet or caring for a neighborhood stray. One summer afternoon while she was gardening, a large Cocka
tiel landed on her shoulder and gave her a wolf whistle. Though she tried to find the original owner, Bob the Bird remained dedicated to Pat.
In 2003, Pat and Sam realized their life dream and built a new home in Port Orchard, completing most of the finish work and landscaping themselves. They also traveled for pleasure, including family ski trips to Whistler and Lake Tahoe, cruising the U.S. and Canadian San Juans and exploring, Mexico, Paris and the South of France. Pat was a proud and devoted mother and grandmother who took delight in spending time shopping, cooking, decorating, attending theater and traveling with her daughter, Cindy, and granddaughter, Chelsea.
She is survived by dearly loved husband, Sam Bolling at home in Port Orchard, her daughter Cindy Briggs (Jim) also of Port Orchard and granddaughter Chelsea Tomlinson (Brian) in Tacoma, Washington.
Her family wishes to thank the constant and skilled care of Dr. Ann Murphy and compassion of those from Hospice who helped her stay home until she was called. She was preceded in death by her parents and her brother, William Greene.
She enjoyed her flowers while she lived and asked that remembrances be made to Kitsap Hospice or the American Cancer Society. At her express wish, there will be no services. Friends, please remember a full life, well lived. Online memorial www.rill.com.
Roy Stanley Taylor
of Tahuya
Aug. 1, 1923
to March 26, 2011
Roy S. Taylor, Jr., 87, longtime Trustee and volunteer neighborhood security patrol of Collins Lake in Mason County, died at his home Saturday evening March 26, 2011.
Roy was born on August 1, 1923, in Boston, Massachusetts to Roy S. Sr. and Emily Taylor. He was a standout football and basketball athlete for Ashland High School in Ashland MA. Upon graduation in 1941, the school retired his football jersey number, which was 1.
After graduation, he joined the Navy. He was stationed at Whidbey Island Naval Air Station WA and in Alaska during World War II where he served as Aviation Machinist's Mate crew for ASW missions. Roy was honored with a Good Conduct Medal and the Victory Medal World War ll.
He was honorably discharged on Dec. 14 1953 and returned home to Massachusetts. Then back to Seattle, where Roy was hired by Boeing to work on airplane engines at Plant Number One.
Roy's favorite pastimes included fishing and bowling. He and his best friend would leave Seattle in the middle of the night Friday, go to Westport and launch their boat off the beach and at daylight, fish all day, camp on the beach at night and fish again on Sunday. His other love was bowling, which he did as many as three nights a week.
He met his wife, Joan Hume, of Lewiston, Idaho, at the West Seattle Bowl. They were married on Sept. 25 1968 and lived on 42nd Avenue SW in West Seattle. They bought property on Collins Lake in Tahuya, WA
in 1973 and would visit it on weekends, slowly building a cozy lake-front home. They moved there after his retirement in 1986 and lived there happily ever after.
Roy rarely missed a Seattle Mariners game on TV but always held allegiance to the Boston Red Sox.
Roy was known by everyone in his small community. He and his friend, Jack Burrows, who died in 2009, served as the unofficial Collins Lake welcoming committee and as the lake security staff.

Texto completo: Mainers living in Hancock County are the healthiest in the state, while Oxford County residents are the least healthy, according to a new county-by-county national report from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the University of Wisconsin Population Health Institute.
The second annual County Health Rankings report, released Tuesday, reports on a range of "health outcomes" reflecting the overall health of county residents, including deaths before age 75, self-reported poor mental and physical health among adults, and the percentage of babies born under a healthy weight.
The report also analyzes "health factors" that are predictive of health status, such as rates of smoking, drinking and obesity among adults, air quality, the availability of clinical care, educational attainment and the percentage of children living in poverty. By these measures, residents of Cumberland County have the best health factors, while residents of Somerset County have the worst, according to the report.
The online report allows easy access to county-specific data in every state and provides state and national benchmarks for comparison on key issues. The report does not compare health status among states.
Dr. Stephen Sears, acting director of the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said Tuesday that many public and private groups measure different aspects of health care. Despite county-to-county discrepancies, he said, Maine consistently ranks high among states in the overall health of its residents.
"The important point is that we rank in the top 10 as a state," Sears said. "But if you look at specific disease issues" - such as Maine's high rates of cancer and chronic disease - "we have a lot more work to do."
According to the report, Penobscot County ranks 11th for health outcomes. Residents of Penobscot County die prematurely at a rate of 7,268 people per 100,000 population, compared to 5,912 in top-ranked Hancock County. The statewide average is 6,575 deaths per 100,000 - higher in both counties than the national benchmark of 5,564 deaths per 100,000.
Penobscot County also has higher rates of poor physical and mental health and lower birth-weight babies than Hancock County.
Penobscot County ranks 9th for health factors. Compared to Cumberland County, which has the best score for health factors, residents of Penobscot County are more likely to smoke, be overweight, and die in car crashes.
Penobscot County has only one primary care provider for every 728 residents, whereas Cumberland County has one primary care provider for every 474 residents. The average ratio of providers to patients in Maine is 631:1 and nationally 694:1. More children live in poverty, more teens give birth, and fewer adults attend college in Penobscot County than in Cumberland County.
Sears said reports like the County Health Rankings are useful for helping policy makers recognize regional deficiencies and establish goals.
"Overall, we do well," he said. "But these variations help us focus our efforts where they can do the most good."
High on Sears' list of priorities are initiatives to improve access to health care - including both expanding health care coverage and building the health care work force in underserved areas - as well as improving the overall economic climate in Maine.
The Maine CDC is in the process of drafting "Healthy Maine 2020," a public document to establish health targets for the next 10 years. Healthy Maine 2020 is expected to be finished later this year and will help direct the work of Maine's public health, medical care, environmental and education sectors. Along with elements of national health reform and other initiatives, Sears said, he expects Maine's generally high-level performance on most health measures will be maintained and that regional health discrepancies within the state will be lessened.

CONCORD, N.H. (AP) -- Health officials say tests have detected low-levels of radioactivity from a stricken Japanese nuclear plant in snow samples in New Hampshire and air samples in Maine.
Health officials say the levels do not pose a threat to public health.
Dr. Josi Montero of the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services says the amount of radiation detected in snow in Concord is at least 25 times below the level of concern, even for infants and pregnant women.
Dr. Stephen Sears, acting director of Maine's Center for Disease Control, tells WMTW-TV that the level of radioactive iodine detected in air samples in Kittery, Augusta and Orono was much lower than naturally occurring radiation, which is found in sunlight and radon.
Vermont's expected to have test results by Tuesday.

Texto completo:   Maine's north-south divide became more demographically acute in the last decade as the state's more suburban, affluent and liberal south grew faster and aged more slowly than the poorer, rural, and more conservative northern region.
Census figures released Thursday showed that rustic, far northern Aroostook County -- the biggest county in land area in the USA east of the Mississippi River and one that looms so large in the Maine consciousness that it's known simply as "The County" -- lost 2.8% of its population. Washington County -- classic "Down East" coastal Maine, extending along the Atlantic to the Canadian border -- was down 3.2% since 2000.
York County, which extends south to New Hampshire and is a short drive from Massachusetts, gained 5.6%, compared with the state's overall 10-year population growth rate of 4.2%. Neighboring Cumberland County, which includes Maine's largest city, Portland, gained 6% and remained the most populous county.
Even they were overshadowed by growth in Waldo (6.9%) and Penobscot (6.2%) counties, which lie to the south and north, respectively, of Bangor.
Although the population in every county got older -- Maine has seen an influx of retirees from southern New England and an exodus of its own young -- northern counties got older faster. Aroostook saw its population of residents 18 and older rise to 79.3% from 76.1% -- an increase more than twice that of the one in Cumberland, whose percentage of people 18 and over increased 1.4 percentage points.
The state's non-Hispanic white population declined slightly, but Maine remained overwhelmingly white -- 94.4%, compared with 96.5% in 2000.
Portland's population rose 3% to 66,194. No. 2 Lewiston, an old mill city that has seen an influx of immigrants, grew 2.5% to 36,592.
Bangor, the third-largest city, grew 5%, to 33,039. Orono, home of the University of Maine, grew 13.7% to 9,112.
John Mahon, a University of Maine business professor, said the north-south population split reflects real regional tensions. "People in the south resent the money that goes north for social services," he said. "But when it's time to go on vacation, they like it as a recreation ground."

Texto completo: Mainers don't know how lucky they are when it comes to maple syrup. In other parts of the country, a tiny pint of the sweet, golden liquid costs a pretty penny. But in New England, maple syrup is plentiful and nowhere near as expensive.
Maine maple syrup production was around 310,000 gallons last year. Maine ranked second in production after Vermont, making about 27 percent of all U.S. syrup, according to the New England Agriculture Statistics Service.
Syrup appears on the table at diners and brunch spots. You can buy it at farm stands or the supermarket. What's more, you can actually visit the places where the syrup is made, and there's no better day to do that than on Maine Maple Sunday, this year on Sunday, March 27. Sugarhouses all across the state will open their doors, and their maple tree groves, to the general public for educational tours, tastings and children's activities. A full list of participating sugarhouses can be found at mainemapleproducers.com.
According to Eric Ellis, director of the Maine Maple Producer's Association, the season is coming along nicely and in a normal fashion.
"We're about a week into the season, and it seems to be going fairly well. Coming off last season, which was at least a full three weeks early, this year it's back to normal," said Ellis, whose sugarhouse, Maine Maple Products, is based in Madison. "The extended forecast looks favorable, and everyone's fairly optimistic."
Ellis sells a cookbook titled "Maine Maple: Beyond Pancakes," written by Elizabeth Gamage Hodgkins, which features more than 150 recipes that go far beyond breakfast. Ellis regularly has customers who ask for maple recipes, and often he directs them to Hodgkins' book.
One recipe that's featured on the Maine Maple Producers website is for Downeast Company Coleslaw, which features a tangy twist on traditional slaw that calls for whole-milk yogurt and maple syrup, instead of mayonnaise and sugar, along with apples and green pepper.
Jo-Ann Merrifield of Merrifield Farm in Gorham, a sugarhouse that also is participating in Maine Maple Sunday, shared with us some treats from her collection of cookbooks that feature maple recipes.
One of those recipes is for switchell, which originally was shared by Mitchell and Savage Maple Farm in Bowdoin. Switchell is a very old New England beverage also known as Haymaker's Punch, which was served to fieldhands in the 19th century to quench their thirst.
Though it also can be made with brown sugar or molasses, maple syrup gives it a lighter flavor. It's strong, gingery stuff, but adding berries or cut up citrus wedges can soften the powerful flavor - and it also can be a great base for a rum punch.
Bangor Daily News readers have their own favorite maple recipes as well. Deb Neuman, who is well-known to Mainers as the host of Back to Business radio at 2 p.m. Sundays on WVOM 103.9 FM in Bangor, shared with us her family recipe for Maple Mousse.
"This recipe has been a Neuman family holiday tradition for generations. It requires a little effort, resulting in melt-in-your-mouth maple magic," said Neuman. "This recipe makes enough to serve 4 to 8 people. Servings should be small, as it is very rich. Try pairing it with a scoop of French vanilla ice cream."
Maple just as easily can be a savory flavor, especially when paired with bacon. Maple and bacon seemingly go hand in hand, and making your own maple roasted bacon is easy and well worth the effort. Baked or mashed sweet potatoes with maple syrup are a common treat on dinner tables, but for a unique, decadent presentation, try twice baking them with sour cream, butter, a bit of nutmeg and paprika and, of course, maple syrup. Top with the maple roasted bacon, and you've got a maple-flavored side dish that can stand on its own.
Mom's Maple Mousse
Serves 4-8
1 1/4 cup Maine Made maple syrup
4 eggs
1 tablespoon gelatin
1 cup whipping cream
1 tsp vanilla
Optional: Kahlua, and-or chocolate shavings
In a heavy saucepan bring the maple syrup to boil for 1 minute. Keep a close eye on it as it boils fast. Beat 4 egg yolks until thick and fluffy and SLOWLY pour hot syrup into the yolks, beating constantly. Cook the mixture on top of a double boiler over hot water, stirring constantly, until thick enough to coat the back of a metal spoon (add splash of Kahlua if you wish). Soften 1 teaspoon gelatin in 3 tablespoons of cold water for 3 minutes, and add it to the hot syrup mixture stirring until gelatin is dissolved to avoid lumps (approximately 3 to 4 minutes). Remove mixture from heat and let it cool down until it is syrupy (you can place pan in fridge for a while). Once cooled, fold in 1 cup whipped heavy cream and 1 teaspoon vanilla. Pour into pretty glass serving bowl and chill for at least 2 hours. Garnish with shaved chocolate before serving (if you wish).

Downeast Company Coleslaw
6 to 8 servings
7 cups finely shredded cabbage (about half a 2-pound head)
2 large tart apples, peeled, cored and shredded
1 small green pepper, chopped fine
Dressing:
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional)
1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon cider vinegar
3 or 4 tablespoons Maine maple syrup
1/2 cup whole milk yogurt
In the bottom of a large bowl, combine the dressing ingredients in the order listed, using a wire whip to blend the mixture thoroughly. Stir in the vegetables, making sure they are evenly combined with each other and with the dressing. Cover tightly and refrigerate for at least a couple of hours, so the flavor of the dressing has time to penetrate.

Mitchell Switchell
Serves 6 to 8
1/2 cup pure Maine maple syrup
1/4 cup cider vinegar
1 tablespoon ground ginger
Mix maple syrup, cider vinegar and ginger in small amount of boiling hot water to blend. Add 2 quarts cold water. Chill and quench your thirst.

Twice-baked Maple Sweet Potatoes with Maple Roasted Bacon
Serves 4
4 medium to large sweet potatoes
1 cup sour cream
1/2 cup maple syrup
2 tablespoons butter
1/2 teaspoon nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon paprika
Salt and pepper
For bacon:
8 slices thick-cut bacon
1 or 2 tablespoons maple syrup
To make potatoes, pierce skin with fork and bake in 375 degree oven for 45 to 50 minutes, until soft. Remove from oven and let cool. While potatoes are cooling, turn the oven up to 400 and lay the bacon out on a baking pan. Bake for 15-20 minutes until mostly cooked, then remove from oven. Remove some of the excess bacon fat from the pan, but leave a small amount to keep it sizzling. Brush both sides of the bacon with syrup, then return to oven to caramelize for another five minutes. Remove from oven, cool, and crumble into small pieces.
Slice each potato in half, and then remove the flesh carefully so skins remain intact. Mash potato until creamy, then add the sour cream, butter, maple syrup, nutmeg, paprika, salt and pepper, combining thoroughly. Fill the potato skins with the mixture, place skins on a greased pan and bake for another 15 minutes. Remove from oven, add bacon to the top and bake for another 5 minutes.

Texto completo: Florida consumers would lose cash or insurance benefits worth about $60 million if Florida is allowed to opt out of a key element of health reform this year, says Citibank managed care industry analyst Carl McDonald.
In a letter to investors and industry clients, McDonald and colleague James Naklicki predict that the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services will deny Florida's recent application for a three-year waiver from what's known as the minimum medical loss ratio rule.
This rule says insurers this year must spend 80 percent of individual health insurance premiums on actual health care, as opposed to on dividends, salaries and other administrative costs. If they fail to meet that standard, the law says insurers must send rebates back to their customers.
Florida's insurance commissioner would prefer that insurers be held to a much lower standard, 65 to 70 percent, warning that the higher standard will put a few small insurers out of business, make it tough for new companies to enter the health insurance market and wipe out many insurance agents.
The argument is a weak one, the analysts write, noting that none of the six largest plans in the state will drop out if the health reform rule is enforced.
With most of the market stable, it's hard to see how giving away $60 million in premium rebates is a good thing for consumers, they said. Put a little differently, if HHS grants this waiver to Florida, it's hard to come up with a situation where a waiver request wouldn't be granted.
Ethan Rome, executive director of the consumer group Healthcare For America Now, accused Florida's insurance commissioner of putting insurers' profits ahead of consumers.
There is a huge difference between a legitimate waiver and gaming the system, Rome said. Waivers are designed to deal with real market disruption in a way that protects consumers, not to be a reflexive move by a state to boost the profits of insurance companies.
In his request for the waiver, Florida's insurance commissioner, Kevin McCarty, said that rule would cause at least one small insurance company to leave the individual insurance market, and others could follow, possibly affecting up to 52,000 people.
Worse, new insurance companies would be unable to launch, his petition argues, because startups have significantly higher administrative costs than existing companies.
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services granted its first waiver of the 80-85 rule to Maine, a state with significantly fewer insurers than Florida.
Other states including Nevada, Kentucky and New Hampshire have similar requests pending before the federal agency.
The Citibank analysts said Maine had a stronger argument for a waiver compared to Florida.
Unlike Maine, which really only has two insurers operating, Florida has a much more vibrant individual market, led by Blue Cross of Florida, UnitedHealth Group (through its Golden Rule subsidiary), Humana, Aetna, and Coventry, they wrote.
If we're wrong, and Florida does get its minimum MLR waiver granted, the earnings benefit for the plans involved would be modest. However, as we pointed out earlier, if Florida's request is approved, we think every state has a case for having its waiver granted provided they collect and submit the necessary data.

Athletes quaff no-alcohol beer as sport drink

Texto completo: PORTLAND, Maine Beer. It's not just for couch potatoes anymore.
A Bavarian brewmeister is touting its no-alcohol beer as the latest sport drink for athletes, handing it out at the finish line of sporting events and touting its regenerative benefits.
Unlike Gatorade, Erdinger Alkoholfrei is served up with a frothy head. And it comes in one color a golden hue unlike conventional sport drinks.
Several top athletes from Europe quaffed the beverage from giant mugs on the podium of the World Cup biathlons held this month in northern Maine.
The company touts the beverage as an isotonic, vitamin-rich, no-additive beverage with natural regenerative powers that help athletes recover from a workout. In other words, it's carbohydrate-loaded refreshment without the alcoholic buzz of beer or the jitters caused by some energy drinks.
It's a very healthy product, said Glenn McDonald, U.S. manager for Erdinger. Overseas, it's very popular. It's the No. 1 non-alcohol beer in Germany.
Even though it's called alcohol-free, Alkoholfrei still contains less than 0.5 percent alcohol. That makes it verboten for anyone under 21 in Maine. Other states, like California, allow minors to buy alcohol-free beer.
Promoted as a sports and fitness drink, Erdinger began targeting athletes in 2001 in Europe with an advertising campaign featuring a pair of triathletes. Its popularity quickly grew in Europe, where it's often distributed for free in the finishing area of sporting events.
Marketing beer as a sport drink for athletes is a new concept in the U.S., though McDonald points out that Alkoholfrei can be enjoyed by anyone, not just athletes.
Whether Americans couch potatoes and athletes alike are ready to embrace another no-alcohol beer is unclear. Sales of no-alcohol beer have been declining for more than a decade in United States, so any new entrant faces an uphill battle, said Benj Steinman, editor of Beer Marketers Insights.
Erdinger, which is already sold in 45 U.S. states, has identified Alkoholfrei as a priority brand as part of a larger push into North America, McDonald said.
The 125-year-old company, which makes Alkoholfrei in the same brewery outside Munich where it turns out conventional wheat beers for suds-loving Germans, promotes itself at cycling and running events in the summer. In the winter, it's one of the main sponsors of the World Cup biathlon, which combines cross-country skiing and rifle marksmanship.
At World Cup events, Erdinger banners are prominently placed in the stadium and on the course for visibility. Erdinger also is on some of the bibs worn by athletes.
Erdinger hopes to win over consumers with a great German beer flavor that others lack. It doesn't come cheap, however, at about $10 for a six-pack.
As for its health claims, a University of Maine nutritionist is skeptical.
Beer contains sodium, potassium, carbohydrates and B vitamins, all of which are good, but they're not found at the optimal levels for an athlete, said professor Mary Ellen Camire.
It will help with rehydration. Whether it's the ideal drink to have, I'm not sure, she said.

Tom Philpott: Appointment stalls TRICARE debate

Resumen: Rick Jones of NAUS charged Defense officials with conducting a public relations campaign to blame retirees for the dramatic rise in health costs over the last decade, when the true culprit has been sustained warfare. After the hearing, a Department of Defense spokeswoman, Cynthia O. Smith, reiterated that the three biggest factors contributing to health cost growth in the last decade have been introduction of the TRICARE for Life benefit for elderly retirees, higher TRICARE usage (in part because more retirees use TRICARE instead of employer health insurance) and overall health care inflation.

Texto completo:   Senior Defense officials defended their plan to mod estly raise TRICARE Prime fees for working-age retirees at a Tuesday hearing of the House armed services subcommittee on military personnel.
The next day, representatives of military associations testified. Five of them, including one who spoke on behalf of 13 other groups too, said they could accept what would be the first TRICARE fee increases in 16 years. The same groups could accept annual adjustments to these fees if the inflation index used were the same one used to set retiree cost-of-living raises.
Every beneficiary advocate at the hearing, however, rejected the Obama administration's call to adjust retiree TRICARE Prime fees based solely on medical cost inflation. Defense officials haven't picked the particular health cost index they want. But their budget savings assume fees would rise by an average of 6.2 percent a year if tied to medical inflation.
At this hearing, only the National Association of Uniformed Services said Congress should "hold the line" on any TRICARE fee increases. Rick Jones of NAUS charged Defense officials with conducting a public relations campaign to blame retirees for the dramatic rise in health costs over the last decade, when the true culprit has been sustained warfare.
After the hearing, a Department of Defense spokeswoman, Cynthia O. Smith, reiterated that the three biggest factors contributing to health cost growth in the last decade have been introduction of the TRICARE for Life benefit for elderly retirees, higher TRICARE usage (in part because more retirees use TRICARE instead of employer health insurance) and overall health care inflation.
Rep. Joe Wilson, R-S.C., subcommittee chairman, said a few months ago that he would oppose any TRICARE fee increases. He did not repeat that pledge in these hearings. Most other panel members echoed the conditional support of beneficiary groups toward the slightly higher fees and indexing.
Wilson was far more upset by the surprise appointment of John Baldacci, former governor of Maine, to lead a new comprehensive review of military health care from inside the Pentagon.
If Baldacci is interested in health care efficiencies, Wilson said at one point, he should immediately step down and save the department $200,000 -- his salary of $165,300 a year and Wilson's best guess on his expenses.
"We don't need a health care czar," Wilson said. "We have veterans' service organizations that can provide this information" about needed reforms. "And this is not the government's money. This is taxpayers money ... being diverted from the military health care system."
Baldacci was a four-term U.S. congressman before becoming governor in 2003. In January 2011 he completed his second term.
Baldacci did not serve in the military or on the armed services committee. He did establish a comprehensive health care reform system in Maine, which has been extolled by the left and criticized by the right. He also was the second governor to sign a gay marriage law, and the first to do so without a court order.
The Department of Defense made no official announcement of his appointment as director of its Military Health Care Reform Initiative. Maine reporters published the first stories on it last week. As governor, they said, Baldacci was paid $70,000 a year. His Department of Defense appointment is for one year "with an option to extend if necessary."
"This is a temporary project where he will review, evaluate, assess and make recommendations" on health reform to Clifford L. Stanley, the under secretary of defense for personnel and readiness, Smith said. "His leadership, executive and legislative experience will deeply enhance this initiative."
Wilson prefaced his first question for Stanley and his new assistant secretary for health affairs, Dr. Jonathan Woodson, with words of confidence in their capabilities. Wilson also noted their oversight responsibilities for military health care, and then said Baldacci's job was a "duplication," just like government auditors recently warned against to cut wasteful spending.
"At a time when we are all concerned about efficiency ... it just doesn't seem right," Wilson said.
He asked Stanley why Congress should even enact health care efficiencies in this year's defense budget "if this work can be overturned" by major new reform effort being led by Baldacci.
Stanley said health reforms in the new budget, which include the TRICARE Prime fee increases for working-age retirees and adjustments in pharmacy co-pays to encourage use of the TRICARE home delivery, are "not directly related to what Gov. Baldacci is going to be doing. His charge -- by me, because I asked him - is, first of all, an objective outside look ... We have not really been as open as I think we should have been" with military associations or in explaining past TRICARE fee recommendations.
Baldacci also will focus on Guard and Reserve health issues, on "a holistic viewpoint of readiness and wellness, and how we're going to do patient satisfaction. And cost was the last piece," he said.
Stanley said he had asked Woodson, his assistant secretary for health affairs, to work very closely with Baldacci.
Wilson asked Woodson to comment. The Army Reserve brigadier general and former professor of surgery said Baldacci's appointment probably results in part from the long wait, of nine months, between Woodson's nomination and his Senate confirmation. This allowed "inconsistent leadership within health affairs" and produced "a need to look at how business was conducted ... I do not see the governor's mandate as interfering with my statutory authorities and the efficiencies we need to roll out."
Rep. Chellie Pingree, D-Maine, a longtime politician whose daughter was Maine's speaker of the House during Baldacci's second term, briefly defended his appointment at Tuesday's hearing.
"Governor Baldacci has a great work ethic. He's very devoted to our military and he has worked very closely with the National Guard in our state to improve many of the practices," Pingree said. "So I look forward to him looking for some of the efficiencies that could be found."
Wilson avoided dragging the military associations into the Baldacci controversy. But he pressed for ideas on controlling health costs. Two of them said Defense Department should act on an old recommendation to consolidate the three service medical commands and save hundreds of million of dollars a year.

Texto completo: By Janet Begley
Special to Treasure Coast Newspapers
If you're yearning for the cold weather up north in Maine, make sure to mark your calendar for Sebastian River High School Drama Troupe's upcoming production of Almost, Maine a romantic comedy by playwright John Cariani.
The show debuts March 24 and 25 at 7 p.m. Both performances take place in the Theater at the school's Performing Arts Center.
Presented by the high school's drama troupe, Almost, Maine tells the story of the fictional Almost, which is nestled in snowy northern Maine.
On one snowy night, the aurora borealis shines down on the town, causing some strange happenings. One woman finds love as she pays respects to her deceased husband. A man has a condition that makes him unable to experience pain, that is until the right woman comes along, wielding an ironing board. Other scenarios are at times, shocking, icy, slippery and hard, but always thrilling, in this play that had a short run on Broadway.
The cast of 16 students makes the play fast-moving, according to drama teacher Melissa Taylor.
It's a very new play and not too many people have seen it, said Taylor. We also have a large number of students who are working behind the scenes on the technical aspects of the production.
Taylor said that students have been rehearsing for the show for several weeks.
We use class-time for rehearsals so every day is filled to the max, said Taylor.
In addition to serving as the moderator of the drama troupe, Taylor teaches at Sebastian River High School. This spring production is one of several shows produced annually by the drama troupe, according to Taylor. The fall murder mystery production of Some Show (About a Murder) by Lee Mueller was very successful and Taylor hopes this comedy will also draw large crowds.
Taylor said the audience should expect to be entertained by the romantic comedy that was released in 2006. She added that people will react differently to each of the scenes.
Men, women, young lovers, older partners will perhaps find the stories touching, corny, funny, silly or devastating depending on their own experiences in love andlife. But the only way to tell for sure is to come out on March 24 or 25.
You'll have fun, Taylor said.
Almost, Maine'
Almost, Maine will take place at Sebastian River High School's Performing Arts Center March 24 and 25 at 7 p.m. There is a $2 admission fee at the door and additional donations to the drama troupe are encouraged. Sebastian River High School is located at 9001 90th Avenue in Sebastian.

Former Battle Ground City Manager David Mercier, 61, will be Vancouver's next second-in-command.
The new assistant city manager actually was Vancouver City Manager Eric Holmes' boss when Holmes was the planning manager and assistant city manager in Battle Ground in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Holmes announced his selection to the city council and city staff March 7.
“Dave has extensive experience leading local governments in a changing environment,” Holmes said in a news release. “That experience, and his collaborative and engaging leadership style, came through in the feedback from city staff and community members involved in the selection process. I feel fortunate to have someone with Dave's experience join the city's management team.”
Mercier will report directly to Holmes and will oversee the city's Human Resources, Information Technology and General Services departments. He will also work closely with the city's senior managers on a daily basis and direct interdisciplinary teams responsible for a variety of organizational initiatives. Mercier's first day on the job will be March 31. His salary will be $135,000 annually, plus benefits.
Mercier served as the first city manager for the city of Spokane Valley, from when it incorporated in 2003 until January 2010, when he was asked to resign by a new city council.
A news report by the The Spokesman-Review said Mercier approached the council about resigning “because he knew that the new City Council was going in a new direction.” The council, in turn, expressed concern about Mercier living outside city limits and also doing consulting work on the side.
Mercier said that there was no major dispute in Spokane Valley, but his moving on was the result of “changing political winds.” City managers have an average tenure of five to seven years.
“I had seven wonderful years working with an energetic and engaged city council,” he said. “In the way that is this career field, the city manager serves at pleasure of the city council. There were no negative words spoken; they simply wanted to have someone new.”
Mercier was also Battle Ground's first city manager, serving from 1997 to 2001.
“I think this is a great opportunity to work with a very talented staff as they meet the challenges of today and work to position the future,” Mercier said by phone.
He said he lives within Vancouver's urban growth area and his consulting work with cities will “dwindle down to maybe just a little bit,” and will in no way conflict with his time or city interests.
He was pulled from a pool of four finalists, including Elizabeth Gotelli, Vancouver's Human Resources director; Mark Hoppen, a consultant and former Puyallup Public Works director and former Gig Harbor city manager; and Jennifer Phillips, a consultant and former assistant city manager of Santa Monica, Calif.
Unlike several other high-profile jobs, Vancouver did not hire an outside consultant to conduct this job search, as it did with the recent hire of former Vancouver Assistant Fire Chief Joe Molina to take the fire chief position, and in its hiring of Holmes as city manager. Vancouver is still in the process of hiring a public information officer and a volunteer coordinator.
Prior to coming to Southwest Washington, Mercier spent six years as town manager in Fairfield, Maine, and another six years as town manager in Baileyville, Maine. He also was assistant town manager in Houlton, Maine, for 1 years.
He holds a master's degree in educational administration from the University of Maine. He and his wife, Jane, have three grown sons.

Texto completo: A new online publication with a familiar name is about to start covering Maine.
The New Maine Times, which will be based in Bath, will publish its first edition April 15.
Gina Hamilton, former editor of the Coastal Journal, a weekly newspaper based in Bath, is owner and editor of the New Maine Times, which will also be published weekly.
The publication has filed paperwork to be registered as a nonprofit, which would allow it to apply for grant money it would not otherwise qualify for, Hamilton said.
Hamilton is seeking funding through foundation grants, corporate underwriting and reader contributions - readers may be asked to subscribe online for an annual subscription fee of $35.
"We've had a lot of support so far for someone who hasn't even written a story yet," Hamilton said.
Hamilton has already assembled her staff, consisting of four reporters, a photographer and a graphic designer.
Editorial offices will be located at her Willow Street home in a converted study. It will be a virtual newsroom with most stories filed remotely. One of her reporters will be based in New York City for the time being.
"I see this as being an online venture for now," said Hamilton, who had been at the Coastal Journal, now owned by MaineToday Media, since 2005. "The cost of maintaining a print presence is just too much."
Hamilton said her online newspaper is "sort of the heir" to the Maine Times, an alternative statewide weekly that was co-founded in 1968 by Peter Cox and John Cole.
A Portland Press Herald editorial, published in November 2004, said the former Maine Times "set a standard of journalism that influenced the way news was covered by others in the Maine media for a couple of decades."
"We hope that wherever John Cole is he will be pleased with what we are doing," Hamilton said.
Hamilton said there is currently too much emphasis in Maine media on reporting local bake sales and fundraisers.
"We want to look at the state as a whole. The issues we write about could develop into national or international issues," she said.
Cox sold the former Maine Times, known for coverage of cultural, environmental and political issues, in 1985. It ceased publication in 2002, although it emerged briefly after that as a monthly magazine.
Cole died in 2003, Cox in 2004.

Texto completo: PORTLAND, Maine Beer. It's not just for couch potatoes anymore.
A Bavarian brewmeister is touting its no-alcohol beer as the latest sport drink for athletes, handing it out at the finish line of sporting events and touting its regenerative benefits.
Unlike Gatorade, Erdinger Alkoholfrei is served up with a frothy head. And it comes in one color a golden hue unlike conventional sport drinks.
Several top athletes from Europe quaffed the beverage from giant mugs on the podium of the World Cup biathlons held this month in northern Maine.
The company touts the beverage as an isotonic, vitamin-rich, no-additive beverage with natural regenerative powers that help athletes recover from a workout. In other words, it's carbohydrate-loaded refreshment without the alcoholic buzz of beer or the jitters caused by some energy drinks.
It's a very healthy product, said Glenn McDonald, U.S. manager for Erdinger. Overseas, it's very popular. It's the No. 1 non-alcohol beer in Germany.
Even though it's called alcohol-free, Alkoholfrei still contains less than 0.5 percent alcohol. That makes it verboten for anyone under 21 in Maine. Other states, like California, allow minors to buy alcohol-free beer.
Promoted as a sports and fitness drink, Erdinger began targeting athletes in 2001 in Europe with an advertising campaign featuring a pair of triathletes. Its popularity quickly grew in Europe, where it's often distributed for free in the finishing area of sporting events.
Marketing beer as a sport drink for athletes is a new concept in the U.S., though McDonald points out that Alkoholfrei can be enjoyed by anyone, not just athletes.
Whether Americans couch potatoes and athletes alike are ready to embrace another no-alcohol beer is unclear. Sales of no-alcohol beer have been declining for more than a decade in United States, so any new entrant faces an uphill battle, said Benj Steinman, editor of Beer Marketers Insights.
Erdinger, which is already sold in 45 U.S. states, has identified Alkoholfrei as a priority brand as part of a larger push into North America, McDonald said.
The 125-year-old company, which makes Alkoholfrei in the same brewery outside Munich where it turns out conventional wheat beers for suds-loving Germans, promotes itself at cycling and running events in the summer. In the winter, it's one of the main sponsors of the World Cup biathlon, which combines cross-country skiing and rifle marksmanship.
At World Cup events, Erdinger banners are prominently placed in the stadium and on the course for visibility. Erdinger also is on some of the bibs worn by athletes.
Erdinger hopes to win over consumers with a great German beer flavor that others lack. It doesn't come cheap, however, at about $10 for a six-pack.
As for its health claims, a University of Maine nutritionist is skeptical.
Beer contains sodium, potassium, carbohydrates and B vitamins, all of which are good, but they're not found at the optimal levels for an athlete, said professor Mary Ellen Camire.
It will help with rehydration. Whether it's the ideal drink to have, I'm not sure, she said.

Texto completo: Is household garbage a renewable resource?
Should Mainers pay extra on their electric bills to recognize the value of burning trash for power?
These questions are being considered now by state lawmakers and the administration of Gov. Paul LePage, as part of an examination of financial incentives for the state's four waste-to-energy plants. These plants handle three-quarters of Maine's municipal solid waste. They also generate electricity, selling the power at market rates into the regional grid. Together they have a capacity of 71 megawatts and sold 389,400 megawatt-hours last year.
Plant owners could earn more money, however, if the state classified their power as a renewable resource. That's what a bill that received a public hearing recently before a legislative committee would do.
This proposal has plenty of opposition.
Central Maine Power Co. says it would force customers to buy expensive electricity from the plants, a burden that first sprung from government policies in the 1980s. Environmental groups, meanwhile, don't want to encourage trash burning to the detriment of recycling.
But this proposed law is about more than electric rates. Although not mentioned in the bill, it's also about property taxes. That's because the money that trash plants earn from power sales helps offset the tipping fees that towns - and their residents - pay for disposal.
"Our communities can't afford an increase in tipping fees," said Kevin Roche, general manager of the waste-to-energy plant in Portland, Ecomaine.
The Portland plant is owned by 21 regional communities and serves 38 communities from York to Franklin counties. It takes in 165,000 tons of trash a year and pulls out 37,000 tons of recyclables. It also sells 85,000 megawatt-hours of power.
Roche testified in favor of the bill and spoke on behalf of the other three plants - Maine Energy Recovery Co. in Biddeford, Penobscot Energy Recovery Co. in Orrington and Mid-Maine Waste Action Corp. in Auburn.
Ecomaine has an annual budget of $25 million. It had been earning $7 million on power sales, but the drop in wholesale electric rates cut revenue by $3 million in the current contract, Roche said.
"Somehow, we're going to make that up," he said.
One way would be to increase recycling volume, and the money that comes from selling the separated materials. But plant operators also see an opportunity based on a conflict between state policies - one that favors waste-to-energy over landfills, and another that offers premium prices for electricity generated from methane gas trapped in landfills.
The details of this conflict are complicated, because of the classifications and rules for different forms of renewable generation. But in general, supporters want to add waste-to-energy plants to a new class that makes them a renewable resource, and require power suppliers to get 3.5 percent of their supply from this source.
This designation would make the power considerably more valuable, because of the premium available to plants that displace fossil fuels in New England. At Ecomaine, for instance, it could be worth $850,000 a year, based on estimates.
Towns see potential benefits, too, and are warning about the consequences of not gaining the renewable stamp of approval.
Greg Lounder is executive director of Municipal Review Committee Inc., a nonprofit group that represents 187 towns from Wiscasset to Aroostook County that take trash to the PERC plant in Orrington. He testified at the public hearing, explaining how a restructured power-contract deal with Bangor Hydro Electric Co. will require disposal rates to rise by 50 percent over the next seven years.
"The largest uncertainty we face in our post-2018 planning process is the manner in which energy policy will impact the value of our electrical power output," he told the legislative committee.
But Lounder didn't get any sympathy from David Allen, who represents CMP. Waste plant owners shouldn't get "special treatment," he said, at the expense of electric ratepayers.
Allen chronicled how past state policies aimed at stimulating demand for renewable generation have cost customers, when CMP was forced to sign - and later buy out - power contracts that were way above market rates. For instance: Maine Energy in Biddeford has received nearly $1 billion for energy and termination payments. Mid-Maine got nearly $20 million for energy and a restructured contract, and Ecomaine had received $88 million through 2000, when CMP bought out the power contract for $3.8 million.
"If waste-to-energy plants in Maine need even more subsidies than they've already received from our customers, they should seek them from some other source," Allen said.
The proposal also was criticized by the Natural Resources Council of Maine, which called a ratepayer subsidy for waste incineration "a perverse incentive" that conflicts with the state's top management strategies: Reduce, reuse and recycle. Waste-to-energy plants are cleaner than in the past, said Dylan Voorhees, the group's clean energy director, but they don't deserve a subsidy.
The bill also came under fire from long-standing opponents of waste-to-energy plants. They included Biddeford's mayor, Joanne Twomey, a former legislator who has been trying for years to close Maine Energy, in her city's downtown.
But the state's focus clearly isn't on closing the plants; it's on examining how they can remain viable into the future.
Part of that answer may be found in a study of the renewable energy issue, done last year at the request of the Legislature by John Kerry, the state's energy director. A draft report currently is awaiting review at LePage's office.
Kerry testified at the public hearing that waste-to-energy is recognized as a renewable resource in other states and countries. Maine's four plants enhance the state's energy security and economic viability, Kerry said, and his office supports the bill's concept.
But that support is qualified. Maine plants also burn trash from out of state, and Kerry said he opposes incentives that increase imported trash. He also opposes a special rate that would raise electricity costs for customers.
Kerry said he recognizes that waste plant revenue has been hurt by today's low natural gas prices, which set the rates for wholesale power in the region.
"These plants are having an economic pinch and they want to gain every conceivable advantage in the marketplace," Kerry said after the hearing. "The question is, do we put this burden on ratepayers?"

Texto completo: Maine hospitals are fighting back against what they see as insinuations that they are somehow at fault for a disjointed payment system that caused Commissioner Mary Mayhew of the state Department of Health and Human Services on Thursday to announce $66 million in over-budget Medicaid payments to the hospitals.
"The department overspent their budget," said Jeff Austin, spokesman for the Maine Hospital Association. "It makes zero sense to blame Maine hospitals."
Mayhew announced the over-budget payments on Thursday, saying the previous administration failed to make needed changes in the way hospitals have traditionally been paid when a new system was implemented last September. As a result, she said, hospitals have been receiving for several months both the traditional monthly prospective payments as well as diagnosis-related payments processed by the new system. The inadvertent double-dipping has resulted in the state's $66 million budget over-extension to date and would result in $119 million by the end of the fiscal year if not corrected.
Austin said media reports and some state lawmakers have implied that hospitals should have caught and reported the redundant payments. But he says hospitals legitimately assumed the state was minding its own budget.
"Apparently the state didn't have the budgeted resources to make these payments," he said, "and now we expect the state is going to do something to stay within their budget."
In a letter sent to Maine hospitals on Thursday, Stefani Nadeau, acting director of MaineCare, the state's medicaid program, said hospitals will see reductions in both prospective and diagnosis-related payments between now and the end of the year to offset the extra payments. If those reductions don't balance the books, any remaining excess may be deducted from the settlement of long-overdue Medicaid payments dating back to 2007 that hospitals expect to receive later this month, she said.
At Eastern Maine Healthcare Systems in Brewer, Chief Financial Officer Daniel Coffey said the state likely will be recouping about $22 million from the seven hospitals in the system. That's approximately the value of the debt stilled owed the EMHS hospitals from the unpaid Medicaid debt dating back to 2007, he said.
Mayhew could not be reached for comment Friday.

Texto completo: Springlike weather today should be ideal for the traditional San Angelo rodeo parade at 10 a.m. in downtown San Angelo. The weather and a record number of entries is expected to bring a crowd of spectators, said Toni Kirkham, chairman of the parade committee.
Meanwhile, back at the Fairgrounds, Junior Shorthorn Show and Junior Simmental/Simbrah shows in the Cattle Barn get under way at 8 a.m. The Junior All-Breed Heifer Futurity Show starts at 1 p.m., and the Junior Maine Anjou/Maine-Tainer shows will start at 6 p.m.
Across the midway, the wool and mohair fleece show will be at 4 p.m. in the SureFed Feed Livestock Pavilion. Also, the Wildlife/Meat Judging Contests start at 9 a.m. and winners receive awards at 2 p.m.
The San Angelo Restaurant Association Inaugural Championship Cook-off is one of the newest features to the 2011 schedule. This morning 12 entries will be outdoors on the south end of the 1st Community Credit Union Spur Arena.
We are really excited about the cook-off and look for it to really grow, said Justin Jonas, San Angelo Stock Show & Rodeo executive director. We had to limit the entries this year but feel it will grow in the future.
Bernay Sheffield told me he has watched this kind of event grow at other stock shows across the state. In Austin, the cook-off event takes up 10 acres and lasts a whole week, he said.
Bernay and wife Betty Zentner-Sheffield are co-owners of Zentner's Daughter Steak House. He is vice president of the Texas Restaurant Association.
Teams consist of a head chef and up to four assistants. Proceeds will benefit the San Angelo Stock Show & Rodeo Association Foundation. Each year the foundation awards more than 30 scholarships to deserving youths.
Bernay said the teams set up their camps Friday and attended a welcome reception.
They will be judged today and awarded prizes for chicken, pork spare ribs, brisket and showmanship. The public is welcome to stop by during the cook-off and receive samples.
The first of four calf scramble contests, sponsored by H-E-B, will be run at the 1:30 p.m. matinee rodeo performance today in the Coliseum. There are three regular calf scrambles this afternoon, the 3 p.m. matinee Sunday and 7:30 p.m. Wednesday where 20 kids will race the clock and the calves. The first 10 participants to each catch a calf, halter it and lead it across the finish line will receive a certificate to use toward their animal projects.
The four fastest in each of the regular performances will advance to the Final Calf Scramble run at 7:30 p.m. Thursday. This scramble also is known as the Scholarship Scramble because each of the first five exhibitors to catch a calf will receive a scholarship. The last seven will receive a bonus to their previously awarded certificates.
Elsewhere on the Fairgrounds, 50 E. 43rd St., the fourth of nine rodeo performances starts at 7:30 tonight in the Coliseum.
Entertainment on the midway, including the carnival, opens at noon and ends at 11 p.m.

Texto completo: PORTLAND, Maine Beer. It's not just for couch potatoes anymore.
A Bavarian brewmeister is touting its no-alcohol beer as the latest sport drink for athletes, handing it out at the finish line of sporting events and touting its regenerative benefits.
Unlike Gatorade, Erdinger Alkoholfrei is served up with a frothy head. And it comes in one color a golden hue unlike conventional sport drinks.
Several top athletes from Europe quaffed the beverage from giant mugs on the podium of the World Cup biathlons held this month in northern Maine.
The company touts the beverage as an isotonic, vitamin-rich, no-additive beverage with natural regenerative powers that help athletes recover from a workout. In other words, it's carbohydrate-loaded refreshment without the alcoholic buzz of beer or the jitters caused by some energy drinks.
It's a very healthy product, said Glenn McDonald, U.S. manager for Erdinger. Overseas, it's very popular. It's the No. 1 non-alcohol beer in Germany.
Even though it's called alcohol-free, Alkoholfrei still contains less than 0.5 percent alcohol. That makes it verboten for anyone under 21 in Maine. Other states, like California, allow minors to buy alcohol-free beer.
Promoted as a sports and fitness drink, Erdinger began targeting athletes in 2001 in Europe with an advertising campaign featuring a pair of triathletes. Its popularity quickly grew in Europe, where it's often distributed for free in the finishing area of sporting events.
Marketing beer as a sport drink for athletes is a new concept in the U.S., though McDonald points out that Alkoholfrei can be enjoyed by anyone, not just athletes.
Whether Americans couch potatoes and athletes alike are ready to embrace another no-alcohol beer is unclear. Sales of no-alcohol beer have been declining for more than a decade in United States, so any new entrant faces an uphill battle, said Benj Steinman, editor of Beer Marketers Insights.
Erdinger, which is already sold in 45 U.S. states, has identified Alkoholfrei as a priority brand as part of a larger push into North America, McDonald said.
The 125-year-old company, which makes Alkoholfrei in the same brewery outside Munich where it turns out conventional wheat beers for suds-loving Germans, promotes itself at cycling and running events in the summer. In the winter, it's one of the main sponsors of the World Cup biathlon, which combines cross-country skiing and rifle marksmanship.
At World Cup events, Erdinger banners are prominently placed in the stadium and on the course for visibility. Erdinger also is on some of the bibs worn by athletes.
Erdinger hopes to win over consumers with a great German beer flavor that others lack. It doesn't come cheap, however, at about $10 for a six-pack.
As for its health claims, a University of Maine nutritionist is skeptical.
Beer contains sodium, potassium, carbohydrates and B vitamins, all of which are good, but they're not found at the optimal levels for an athlete, said professor Mary Ellen Camire.
It will help with rehydration. Whether it's the ideal drink to have, I'm not sure, she said.

Rogers raises issue with health-care reform

Texto completo:   U.S. Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Brighton, believes the Obama administration's decision to grant about 1,040 waivers mainly to Fortune 500 companies from requirements of the health-care reform law should be extended to small businesses and individuals.
"We think it's about fairness," the Brighton Republican said in a teleconference call Thursday. "If it's good enough for Fortune 500s, it's good enough for the average American. ... It impacts every single American being negatively impacted" by the health-care bill.
Rogers said his recently introduced HB 984 Health Care Waiver Fairness Act would expand the waiver process to everyone.
The Department of Health and Human Services announced in September that it would grant waivers to employers to prevent some workers from losing their benefits if the insurer could not meet the new health-care law's requirements on annual limits.
By the end of 2010, the number of waivers grew from zero to 222 and Rogers said he expects that number to grow to 1,050 in "a few short weeks."
Rogers said the Obama administration recently granted that three-year waiver to the state of Maine, where a company that has 37 percent of the market announced that it would leave the state if they had to meet certain provisions in the health-care law.
"They said we will pull out and 37 percent will lose health care, so (the Obama administration) gave the entire state of Maine a waiver," Rogers said. "There are other states in the same boat. This strikes at the heart of what is going wrong today with the bill."

Resumen: Home to Maine's first T-bar and chairlift both installed in the early 1950s, the slopes were also part of the freestyle skiing movement in the mid-1970s that launched several careers, including that of 1992 Canadian Olympic mogul skier Lee Lee Morrison-Henry and ski movie maker Greg Stump, the man behind the 1988 extreme classic "Blizzard of Aahhh's." According to Homer, during vacation weeks, holidays and weekends about 60 percent of skiers and riders are from outside Maine with approximately half from the Bay State.

Texto completo:   BRIDGTON, Maine - The views are big league from the 1,900-foot summit.
Choose a trail and be treated to a frozen Moose Pond bisected by Route 302 below in Maine's Lakes Region and rippling western landmarks including New Hampshire's Mount Washington and Presidential Range.
"When I ski, I think I'm in a pretty cool place," says Shawnee Peak owner Chet Homer. "I don't think of myself as owning the mountain, but basically being a steward of the mountain and the people."
The blue-jean wearing Homer, 60, bought Shawnee in 1994 while many of New England's resorts were being gobbled up during a merger fever between S-K-I and Les Otten. Former executive vice president and director of Tom's of Maine, Ocean National Bank chairman and co-owner of the AHL Portland Pirates from 1996 to 1998, the sports-loving skier played hockey in his youth at Belmont Hill School and Dartmouth (class of '73). He holds an MBA from Northeastern and is a University System of New Hampshire Trustee.
"I decided I just wanted to be my own boss and thought it would be interesting to own a sport and recreation type of business," he said.
Originally called Pleasant Mountain, the area opened with a rope tow in 1938. In some 73 years of operation, the mountain with a 1,300-foot vertical drop has survived ownership changes, financial hurdles, bad winters, a name change, and a base lodge fire. Home to Maine's first T-bar and chairlift both installed in the early 1950s, the slopes were also part of the freestyle skiing movement in the mid-1970s that launched several careers, including that of 1992 Canadian Olympic mogul skier Lee Lee Morrison-Henry and ski movie maker Greg Stump, the man behind the 1988 extreme classic "Blizzard of Aahhh's."
About 2 1/2 hours north of Boston via 95, less than an hour from Portland, Maine, and maybe a half-hour from North Conway, N.H., Shawnee ($56 weekend adult lift tickets and a menu of discounts) largely attracts families from Maine, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire.
According to Homer, during vacation weeks, holidays and weekends about 60 percent of skiers and riders are from outside Maine with approximately half from the Bay State.
A night skiing venue, the mountain augments the midweek morning doldrums by catering to afternoon school racing programs and weekly adult recreational race leagues under the lights. Shawnee is folksy and unpretentious like a plaid woolen shirt. With two modest base lodges, the 40 trails served by four fixed grip lifts and a moving carpet progress from a benign and secluded beginner area to large doses of intermediate runs.
There are wide open slopes like Jack Spratt, The Horn and The Main and off-the-beaten paths like Exit 48, Beeline and T-Line, where the T-bar used to run. Glade pockets and a handful of steeps mix it up. Sunset Boulevard, a higher end beginner trail off the summit, opened two years ago and is a pathway to piecing together runs for varying abilities. Freestylers hit the easy-to-spot terrain park outside the base lodge deck and spirited Blizzard's Pub.
The unhurried Sunnyside Triple serves the under-the-radar East side with its diversity of trails such as Yee Haw, Upper Appalachian, Wizard and Tycoon, and like the main area contains flattish connector trails - snowboarders take note - for traversing.
"The East still has that feeling of being a little more isolated, of having that different feel," says Ed Rock, Shawnee's general manager since 1982 and one of several long-timers with more than 25 years at the mountain. "People start to gravitate to it at certain times. When we first starting making snow here, everything was centered [around the main area]. Now we like to have the East area open by Christmas."
Homer invested millions during his tenure - three fixed grip lifts were replaced, several trails cut, condos and chalets started to appear in 2006, and a surface carpet lift was added in 2005 with another planned next winter. He's proud of the charity Moonlight Challenge started in 1995 that's raised more than $500,000 for children with life-threatening illnesses at Camp Sunshine.
Though mundane annual capital expenditures aren't that exciting to the average skier, frequent little steps over time account for Shawnee's advancement in snowmaking and grooming.
In December, the ribbon was cut on a new Summit Triple Chair, part of a million dollar investment including more snowmaking.
The lift replaces a slow-moving chair from 1984 that frustrated many skiers and snowboarders. The new ride features a conveyor loading system (another Maine first) where skiers slide onto a moving belt before sitting in the chair. The lift shaves about three minutes off the formerly 11 1/2-minute ride.
Still, it's no high-speed detachable. Homer says it doesn't make economic sense to spend $4.5 million on a detachable lift and many season pass-holders told him it would change the character of the mountain.
Like retired actuary Mike McSally of Greenland, N.H., who skis Shawnee with his family, including two children ages 10 and 13. He's been skiing there longer than Homer's owned it.
"It's just not practical for a mountain this size," he said.
Shawnee also doesn't have snow tubing, a popular ski area sideshow at many family-centric places.
"We don't have a large space with a flat run-off at the base of the mountain," he said. "Some areas build a snow ramp but we've chosen not to worry about that liability."
Last week a yurt - a circular nomadic-style tent - went up outside the base lodge, drawing attention to a few upcoming on-mountain yurts scheduled to open Memorial Day with basic furnishings for overnights by hikers and next winter including skiers and snowshoers.
"I think Shawnee is positioned well," said Homer. "I think we're overlooked by many people but once they get here it's a better experience than they thought."
Spoken like a steward.

Texto completo: Former Battle Ground City Manager David Mercier, 61, will be Vancouver's next second-in-command.
The new assistant city manager actually was Vancouver City Manager Eric Holmes' boss when Holmes was the planning manager and assistant city manager in Battle Ground in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Holmes announced his selection to the city council and city staff Monday afternoon.
“Dave has extensive experience leading local governments in a changing environment,” Holmes said in a news release. “That experience, and his collaborative and engaging leadership style, came through in the feedback from city staff and community members involved in the selection process. I feel fortunate to have someone with Dave's experience join the city's management team.”
Mercier will report directly to Holmes and will oversee the city's Human Resources, Information Technology and General Services departments. He will also work closely with the city's senior managers on a daily basis and direct interdisciplinary teams responsible for a variety of organizational initiatives. Mercier's first day on the job will be March 31. His salary will be $135,000 annually, plus benefits.
Mercier served as the first city manager for the city of Spokane Valley, from when it incorporated in 2003 until January 2010, when he was asked to resign by a new city council.
A news report by the The Spokesman-Review said Mercier approached the council about resigning “because he knew that the new City Council was going in a new direction.” The council, in turn, expressed concern about Mercier living outside city limits and also doing consulting work on the side.
Mercier said Monday that there was no major dispute in Spokane Valley, but his moving on was the result of “changing political winds.” City managers have an average tenure of five to seven years.
“I had seven wonderful years working with an energetic and engaged city council,” he said. “In the way that is this career field, the city manager serves at pleasure of the city council. There were no negative words spoken; they simply wanted to have someone new.”
Mercier was also Battle Ground's first city manager, serving from 1997 to 2001.
“I think this is a great opportunity to work with a very talented staff as they meet the challenges of today and work to position the future,” Mercier said by phone Monday.
He said he lives within Vancouver's urban growth area and his consulting work with cities will “dwindle down to maybe just a little bit,” and will in no way conflict with his time or city interests.
He was pulled from a pool of four finalists, including Elizabeth Gotelli, Vancouver's Human Resources director; Mark Hoppen, a consultant and former Puyallup Public Works director and former Gig Harbor city manager; and Jennifer Phillips, a consultant and former assistant city manager of Santa Monica, Calif.
Unlike several other high-profile jobs, Vancouver did not hire an outside consultant to conduct this job search, as it did with the recent hire of former Vancouver Assistant Fire Chief Joe Molina to take the fire chief position, and in its hiring of Holmes as city manager. Vancouver is still in the process of hiring a public information officer and a volunteer coordinator.
Prior to coming to Southwest Washington, Mercier spent six years as town manager in Fairfield, Maine, and another six years as town manager in Baileyville, Maine. He also was assistant town manager in Houlton, Maine, for 1 years.
He holds a master's degree in educational administration from the University of Maine. He and his wife, Jane, have three grown sons.
Mercier fills a position left vacant by Holmes, who was appointed city manager Nov. 1. Holmes' salary in that position was $122,868. Before that, Betsy Williams was the assistant city manager until her retirement in 2010.

Maine's green future debated

Resumen: In New Jersey, to similar outrage from environmentalists, Governor Chris Christie previously introduced many of the same proposals put forth by LePage: establishing a fast track to approval for development proposals, shifting authority from environmental boards to administrative judges, and prohibiting state standards that are stricter than federal regulations.

Texto completo:   Paul LePage, Maine's Republican governor, has attracted national attention in his first two months in office, not for his policy proposals, but for inflammatory public statements. He has sparred with the NAACP, inviting its leaders to "kiss my butt," and scoffed at laws banning the chemical known as BPA. The worst side effect of exposure to it, he asserted at a press conference, might be women growing "little beards."
Now, though, the new governor has offered up a more substantive cause for controversy: a plan to streamline state environmental protections, eliminating or reducing more than 60 regulations on pollution and development.
Supporters of the controversial measure, including members of the state's Tea Party movement, say the changes are needed to cut through red tape and revitalize a stagnant economy. Opponents, including environmental groups that are rallying money and manpower against it, say the move would strike at the heart of Maine's appeal and an engine of its economy - its rambling, rocky coastline and northern wilderness.
"It's a wholesale retreat from the values Maine people hold dear," Mike Belliveau, executive director of the Environmental Health Strategy Center, a statewide public health organization, said of LePage's proposal. "Everyone knows the essence of Maine is the quality of its environment. It resonates deeply in the psyche of Maine people, and it's the backbone of the economy, drawing tourists from all over the world."
The fate of the plan rests with the Legislature, where Republicans gained control in the last election. Lawmakers have filed dozens of related bills, some going even further than LePage's plan, according to environmental groups. A repeal of Maine's bottle bill and the elimination of the planning board for Maine's north woods are among the proposals, they said.
Like other conservative candidates with Tea Party support, LePage talked more about regulatory reform than environmental issues on the campaign trail. But his focus on reducing government and reining in state spending, like that of other, like-minded governors, has raised the possibility that state environmental safeguards, some of them in place for decades, could be rapidly, dramatically scaled back.
In New Jersey, to similar outrage from environmentalists, Governor Chris Christie previously introduced many of the same proposals put forth by LePage: establishing a fast track to approval for development proposals, shifting authority from environmental boards to administrative judges, and prohibiting state standards that are stricter than federal regulations.
Florida's new governor, Rick Scott, used his recent budget recommendations to eliminate funding for the state's land conservation program, Florida Forever, and to drastically downsize the state agency in charge of managing sprawl, the Department of Community Affairs, by slashing its budget from $779 million to $110 million, according to Sarah Bucci, a field associate with the advocacy group Environment Florida.
In Maine, a less developed and less populated state, the deregulation effort is expected to collide with a well-funded network of environmentalists, who will use LePage's plan to raise money for their cause.
A spokesman for LePage, Dan Demeritt, said the Maine initiative has been miscast by critics and is not meant as an assault on natural resources. It evolved, he said, from a series of public meetings held around the state in which hundreds of citizens offered ideas on how to make Maine more business-friendly.
"The governor is not suggesting we turn our backs on what makes Maine great," said Demeritt. "It's about finding middle ground and the right protections, and why it takes a million dollars to get a project approved."
The proposal that has received the most attention would suspend the Kid-Safe Products Act, a law overwhelmingly approved by legislators in 2008. The law, which has yet to take effect, would ban the sale of baby bottles and other products containing bisphenol A, or BPA, a chemical compound linked to health concerns in animal studies. Supporters of the law say LePage is catering to out-of-state corporations who helped fund his campaign. Demeritt said the governor simply wants "sound science" to be the standard for state regulations, and with BPA, "the science is not there."
Speaking to reporters last month, LePage went further, appearing to mock the health concern with his "little beards" remark. His spokesman described the comment as a "joke gone awry." But it sparked fresh criticism of the governor, whose run-in with the NAACP had already inspired the creation of a "61 percent" bumper sticker, a reference to the percentage of Maine voters who cast ballots for other candidates last November.
Belliveau said LePage's antics work against him.
"In a perverse way, it helps raise the profile of the issue and makes the governor politically toxic," he said. "Moderate Republicans are the swing voters who control the outcome, and they don't take well to extreme agendas or outrageous comments."
State Senator Peter Mills, who ran against LePage in a seven-way Republican primary last year, said the governor's deregulation plan contains important, necessary changes at its core, some of which are likely to be approved. But he criticized LePage for taking a "slash and burn" approach instead of focusing strategically on key reforms.
"You need to get people used to your perspective, instead of throwing everything against the wall," said Mills. "It creates huge resistance and doesn't get it done. . . . All he did was get environmentalists fired up."
In private, even some Tea Party members admit they have tired of LePage's headline-grabbing public statements, said Andrew Ian Dodge, the Tea Party's former Maine coordinator, who recently announced his plan to run against US Senator Olympia Snowe in 2012.
"But if he delivers the goods, they will put up with it," Dodge said. "The reason the environment is at the core of the Maine economy is because other industry has been driven out by taxation and regulation. . . . Something radical has to be tried."

Texto completo:   Maine is the backdrop for countless books beloved by children and adults, and the home or stomping ground of writers from Henry David Thoreau to Stephen King. Traveling from along the Canadian border south to Kittery and west into the woods, here follows an admittedly incomplete literary guide to the Pine Tree State.
VAN BUREN Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's epic poem "Evangeline: A Tale of Acadie" (1847) is fictionalized history, but its heroine became a mythic figure, particularly in Nova Scotia (Acadie) and Louisiana, where the story unfolds. In northern Aroostook County, Acadian Village is a reconstructed 1700s museum village in Van Buren. Anne Roy, director, said the marble statue of Evangeline honors all her displaced forebears, explaining, "When Acadians expelled from Acadie didn't want to talk about their past, they would always refer to Longfellow's poem." Acadian Village, Route 1, guided tours June to September, 207-868-5042, www.connectmaine

BAXTER STATE PARK Thoreau made three hiking trips up Mount Katahdin and across the Penobscot, Kennebec, and St. John watershed region. In 1864, two years after his death, Thoreau's observations were collected in "The Maine Woods," which still reflects the wild beauty of the park, the state's finest jewel. Note: GPS units are notoriously inaccurate here. Baxter State Park. 207-723-5140, www.baxter
stateparkauthority.com
OLD TOWN "Mail," Mameve Medwed's witty 1997 debut novel about starting over, begins with Katinka's mother nagging her by phone from this town north of Bangor.
RANGELY Louise Dickinson Rich's family lived in a backwoods western settlement called Middle Dam, near Rangeley, in the 1930s. Her best known work, "We Took to the Woods" (1942), is a window into that life.
BANGOR King's characters inhabit at least 30 places statewide, real and imaginary, including Sanford ("The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon"), and Castle Rock, a fictional town northwest of Lewiston, where King, who owns a house in Bangor, set the series that ran from "Different Seasons" (1982) to "Needful Things" (1991). Novelist Tabitha King, Stephen's wife, invented another small town for her Nodd's Ridge, Maine, series.
WATERVILLE This mill town may have inspired Richard Russo's 2002 Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, "Empire Falls," but a pizza parlor in Skowhegan became the Empire Grill, a vintage diner, for the HBO movie starring Paul Newman. The cafe closed last year.
ISLE AU HAUT "The Hungry Ocean," Linda Greenlaw's account of life as the nation's only woman swordfish captain, is among several books she has written about her offshore community on this tiny, rugged island in Acadia National Park. 207-288-3338, www.nps.gov/acad/parkmgmt/isle-au-haut

NORTH BROOKLIN When E.B. White moved here from Manhattan, he discovered his voice and endless subjects for his New Yorker magazine columns and essay collections, including "One Man's Meat" (1942). Charmed by the barnyard animals on his saltwater farm, he penned the children's classics "Stuart Little" and "Charlotte's Web."
CAMDEN Did the steamy novel "Peyton Place" (1956) accurately depict what happens behind doors in this home to sea captains and sailors? The movie starring Lana Turner based on Grace Metalious's bestseller was shot here, but the original story was set in New Hampshire.
ROCKPORT Lew Dietz based the children's favorite "A Seal Called Andre" on the true story of a harbor seal pup adopted in 1961 by the Rockport harbor master and his family. The real Andre learned tricks, revealing himself as a natural entertainer. There is a granite statue in Andre's honor in Rockport Marine Park.
BRUNSWICK In February 1851, while at communion service in the Bowdoin College church, Harriet Beecher Stowe envisioned the death of Uncle Tom. Swept by emotion, she hurried home afterward to begin writing "Uncle Tom's Cabin." According to her son and biographer, Charles Edward Stowe, the abolitionist-writer based several characters on her interviews with fugitive slaves in Ohio and Kentucky, where she previously lived. "She took pen and paper and wrote out the vision which had been as it were blown into her mind as by the rushing of a mighty wind," he wrote. Often credited with sparking the Civil War, the novel introduced many Americans to the realities of slavery. Only the Bible sold more copies. Stowe's home at 63 Federal St., a National Historic Landmark, is owned by Bowdoin and not open to the public. www.nps

BOOTHBAY The Bibby and Harold Alfond Children's Garden celebrates many children's books with plantings and sculpture evoking the likes of Portland native Chris Van Dusen's "Down to the Sea with Mr. Magee"; Blue Hill resident Robert McCloskey's "Make Way for Ducklings" and "Blueberries for Sal"; and "Miss Rumphius" by Barbara Cooney of Damariscotta.

HARPSWELL "Olive Kitteridge," Elizabeth Strout's Pulitzer Prize-winning (2009) collection of 13 linked short stories, captures the ordinary lives of true Mainers in an imagined coastal town like Harpswell, where Strout grew up.
NORTH PARSONSFIELD Carolyn Chute's four novels, including "The Beans of Egypt, Maine" (1985), bluntly portray rural poverty in an imagined town near her home here in western Maine.
PORTLAND Three generations of Longfellow's family lived in the home where he was raised. Now a Maine Historical Society property, it is furnished almost entirely with items owned by the poet's relatives.

HOLLIS Around 1900, when girls were expected to be little ladies, the spirited 10-year-old heroine of "Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm" (1903) won the hearts of her two stern aunts and everyone in fictional Riverboro. The classic children's book and its adaptation for Broadway were written by Kate Douglas Wiggins, whose town of Hollis beside the Saco River might have been Rebecca's.
SOUTH BERWICK As a girl, Sarah Orne Jewett accompanied her physician father on house calls. The independent women they met reappear as characters in "Country of the Pointed Firs" (1896), set in fictional Dunner's Landing, loosely based on Tenants Harbor. Historic New England maintains Jewett's longtime home here. 5 Portland St., hourly tours, June 1-Oct. 15, 207-384-2454, www.historicnewengland

WELLS Ecologist Rachel Carson's landmark nonfiction work, "Silent Spring" (1962), led to a federal ban on use of the pesticide DDT and launched the environmental movement.

YORK One of May Sarton's best-known books, "The House by the Sea," was written when she lived here on Maine's southern coast. Along with her "Journal of a Solitude," its deeply personal nature gave women a role model for independence and creativity.
ISLES OF SHOALS In novelist Anita's Shreve's first bestseller, "The Weight of Water" (1997), a photographer comes to Appledore Island, 9 miles off the coast of Kittery, to shoot a photo essay about two unsolved murders a century earlier. Two women were actually murdered here in 1873. Both were known to poet Celia Thaxter, whose family-owned hotel on Appledore is where she created Maine's first literary salon. Guests included such literati as Longfellow and Ralph Waldo Emerson, and Impressionist painter Childe Hassam, who illustrated Thaxter's beloved journal, "An Island Garden." In summer on the rugged island, tours of Thaxter's restored garden welcome those 18 and older who are steady on their feet. Reservations required. 603-430-5220, www

Texto completo: The planning and development of three major wind energy projects in Maine has created an average of 240 jobs per year since 2003, and resulted in nearly $223 million in local spending, a new report done for the industry concludes.
The study, by University of Southern Maine economist Charles Colgan, is the first attempt to measure the economic impact of wind power projects using post-construction data, Colgan said. It was presented Thursday at the State House during the industry's second annual Maine Wind Day, an event aimed at publicizing the benefits of wind energy and influencing lawmakers and the LePage administration.
Wind-power supporters from around the state attended, including businesses involved in the industry, economic development officials, legislators and clean-air advocates. They were joined by wind-industry workers and students being trained for those jobs. Their presence aimed to send a clear message that wind has wide-ranging geographic support that spills over into many sectors.
The industry is trying to assert the value of commercial wind energy in the face of growing criticism from vocal, well-organized opponents. The jump in petroleum prices is providing new talking points for advocates, and Colgan stressed the need for Maine to shift to a renewable energy economy to blunt the impact of $100-a-barrel oil.
But that argument, and the economic benefits Colgan cited, overlook the high cost to taxpayers and electric ratepayers, according to Chris O'Neil, a spokesman for Friends of Maine's Mountains.
Wind energy is expensive today, O'Neil noted, and is greatly subsidized by government tax and energy policies. Colgan's study ignores the burden of high-cost electricity on the economy, O'Neil said, and its relatively low contribution to the grid.
"We could put turbines on every mountain in Maine, and still have little impact on electricity production," he said.
Colgan's study, done for First Wind Inc. and TransCanada Maine Wind Development, examined the employment impacts of three projects: Mars Hill in Aroostook County, Stetson Mountain in Washington County and Kibby Mountain in Franklin County.
He found that construction spending totaled $197.8 million, professional and technical services accounted for $23.7 million, and food and lodging brought in $1.3 million.
A major employment benefit was wages paid in Maine, estimated at roughly $46.8 million. The average wage for construction jobs, including benefits, was $29 an hour, according to Reed & Reed, a lead contractor on the projects.
The three projects also involved more than 300 Maine vendors and contractors in every county but Knox. They helped prop up rural Maine during the recession, according to Chris Gardner, a Washington County commissioner who also heads Eastport's Port Authority. Unloading turbine blades that arrived by ship provided work at the pier while a local pulp mill was shut down, he said.
Looking ahead, participants held up the potential for wind - both on land and off the coast - as a bright spot for Maine's future economy.
The co-chair of the legislative committee that handles energy issues, Rep. Stacey Fitts, R-Pittsfield, said wind power components can be manufactured in Maine and become an export product.
To underscore the industry's potential, two students enrolled in the wind power technology program at Northern Maine Community College in Presque Isle participated in the event.

Texto completo: Chris Steineger, a state senator in Kansas, has a plan to cut back government. It starts with his job.
Looking to slash expenses in a time of fiscal straits, Mr. Steineger last month introduced a bill that would reduce the state's legislature to 30 senators from 40 and to 90 representatives from 125.
"Every legislator thinks he or she is so important that we could not possibly get by with fewer of us," said Mr. Steineger, a Republican. "You just simply don't need this many people to make the decisions we make."
Mr. Steineger isn't alone. With states facing big budget deficits and governors proposing deep cuts to education and state medical care, legislators around the country are suggesting they share the pain by reducing their ranks.
In Pennsylvania, state Sen. Elder Vogel, a Republican, introduced a bill that would reduce the state Senate to 30 seats from 50; the state House would fall to 121 representatives from 203. Maine's legislature also would shrink if the state adopts a law introduced by Portland Democratic Rep. Jon Hinck. Minnesota lawmakers have introduced a proposal to shrink their legislature.
Lawmakers offer several arguments for smaller government. In many states, the number of legislators was set in an era before email or even the interstate highway system, which have both made it much easier to see constituents and learn their opinions on state issues. And while legislators' salaries and benefits are a relatively small budget item -- the Maine proposal would shave no more than $2.5 million from the state's $6 billion annual budget -- getting rid of a few senators and representatives is an important symbolic gesture when states are cutting back on everything from road work to public schools.
"I would like people to understand that we are prepared to take cuts as well as dish them out, and I'm fairly confident we can do that without harming representative democracy in Maine," said Mr. Hinck.
In the recent past, such measures have rarely made it beyond the desks of the legislators who float them. In many cases -- such as Maine -- shrinking the legislature requires a constitutional amendment that needs backing from a supermajority of lawmakers. A flurry of cuts went through in the 1960s and 1970s, but since 1990 only four states -- Idaho, North Dakota, Rhode Island and Wyoming -- have decreased the size of their legislatures, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.
Legislators and political observers, though, say the latest wave of proposals is more likely to gain traction, given states' looming debt troubles and the desire of both parties to show their willingness to shrink government.
A precedent exists for shrinking the legislature during times of financial stress: To save money during the Great Depression, Nebraska jettisoned its second legislative chamber and has had a unicameral Legislature since 1937.
Also, with the 2010 Census recently completed, states are getting ready to redraw Congressional districts. In many states, lawmakers revise state legislative districts around the same time.
"If it's going to occur, it's going to occur now when [states are] looking at redistricting and reapportionment," said Brenda Erickson, a senior research analyst at the National Conference of State Legislatures.
Proposals to shrink state legislatures still face significant opposition. In Connecticut, state Rep. Linda Schofield, a Democrat, recently got a chilly reception to her proposed legislation to cut in half the state's 36-member Senate as well as its 151-member House.
Connecticut has 187 legislators -- 67 more than California, the nation's largest state, according to research from her office. Even that level is a reduction: Over the past few decades, Connecticut has twice reduced the size of its General Assembly, from 330 in 1960. Ms. Schofield's bill would also increase state legislators' terms from the current two years to four years, saving an estimated $20.5 million in public election dollars every two years.
State Rep. Russ Morin, a Democrat who is co-chairman of the committee that must consider the bill before it moves to a broader vote, said Ms. Schofield's proposal won't be going anywhere this year. "There just was not any support at all from either side of the aisle to move forward with it," he said.
Connecticut's part-time lawmakers earn $28,000 annually and also work day jobs. Mr. Morin, who serves as a staff representative for a public-employee union, said he doesn't think legislators could handle more responsibility.
"If I had double the constituents I had now, there's no way I could work another job," he said.

Texto completo: PRESQUE ISLE - A federal announcement that Maine seed potato producers now can ship their potatoes to Thailand likely won't have a big impact on the industry, Maine Potato Board officials said Wednesday.
Don Flannery, executive director of the Maine Potato Board, said that he doesn't believe that many people in the industry will take advantage of the new ruling because of the logistics involved.
"It would be too costly and time-consuming to ship to Thailand," said Flannery. "So it likely won't really affect the industry in Maine."
Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack announced Tuesday that U.S. seed potato producers from 10 new states would be eligible to ship their potatoes to Thailand. The newly eligible states are Colorado, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, New York, North Dakota, Wisconsin and Wyoming. In 2009, Thailand announced it would accept seed potatoes from California, Idaho, Oregon and Washington.
"This is a promising development for U.S. seed potato producers who will now be able to compete in Thailand, the largest potato growing country in Southeast Asia," Vilsack said in a written statement. "Southeast Asia is one of the fastest growing markets for U.S. agricultural products, and exports there are expected to grow by more than 25 percent this year. This action by the government of Thailand will provide buyers with additional supplies of high-quality seed potatoes."
The United States exported more than $10 million in seed potatoes worldwide in 2010. Initial estimates from USDA are that sales of U.S. seed potatoes to Thailand may reach $500,000 during the first year, with potential for additional growth in the future. Thailand imported nearly $5 million worth of seed potatoes in 2010, largely from the United Kingdom and Canada. Seed potatoes are produced to be used for planting new crops of potatoes and, once planted, grow into table-stock potatoes.
Flannery said that any increased opportunities for potato growers and producers is good for the industry, but he said that Maine growers likely will continue to take advantage of opportunities to sell their product closer to home.
The market opening for U.S. seed potatoes in Thailand follows months of negotiations between Thailand and the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and a review of U.S. seed certification procedures, seed cultivation practices and phytosanitary mitigation measures.

Texto completo: Maine could save $1 billion a year by streamlining its government and cutting spending to levels closer to those of comparable states.
That was the message delivered Wednesday by Envision Maine President Alan Caron, who spoke to about 200 businesspeople at a breakfast hosted by the Portland Regional Chamber.
Caron, who outlined the findings of "Reinventing Maine Government," a report published by his group late last year, said Maine's economy is hindered by excessive state spending.
He said Maine's state payroll exceeds the national average by 36 percent, and Medicaid and welfare spending is 69 percent higher. Health care spending in Maine is 80 percent higher than the average for rural states, and legislative spending is 68 percent higher.
Footing the bill are taxpayers, whose contribution to government is 13 percent more than the national average, Caron said. He said in a phone interview that much of his data came from Philip Trostel, an economics professor at the University of Maine.
Caron called Trostel's method unique because it compares Maine with five states - Vermont, Wyoming, Mississippi, Montana and South Dakota - that have a similar percentage of residents in rural areas. It is an "innovative" approach, Caron said, "a heck of a better way to compare things."
"I don't think we have ever seen this kind of direct comparison" in these categories, he said.
Caron said he started working on "Reinventing Maine Government," which was released in November, after he read the Brookings Institution's 2006 report "Charting Maine's Future," which suggested that Maine "scrutinize its state and local government system to locate cost savings."
Caron estimates that government reforms and spending cuts could save the state $1 billion a year, money that could be invested in business tax incentives, for improvements in transportation and for higher education - the one category in which Maine spends less than the national average.
Savings could also allow a cut in the state income tax to 5.5 percent.
Caron's message hit home, said Amber Baxter, who attended Wednesday's Eggs & Issues breakfast and is sales manager at the Portland Regency Hotel & Spa.
"He brought up some very good points. Some of the numbers were really surprising, such as our spending compared to the national level," she said.
But Baxter wished Caron had discussed a clear path to reform.
"I would have liked more perspective (about) where we start to address the problems," she said.
Caron said substantive changes could take a decade and will require Mainers of both political parties to work together.
But, he said, the goal is simple.
"We have to be average. It's not that complicated," he said.
One attendee, Peter Murray, a lawyer with Murray, Plumb & Murray in Portland, said he thinks many Mainers can get behind Caron's message.
"There are things about our government ... that people from wide political beliefs believe need to be changed," Murray said. "There seems to be a foolish misuse of resources."
Caron said he thinks Gov. Paul LePage understands the problem but may not have taken the right tack.
The "substantive rollbacks" in the governor's regulatory reform proposal have stirred "a deep opposition that could harm all of us," he said.
Kenneth Bowden, CEO of First Atlantic Healthcare, said he is eager to see whether LePage can pull Maine out of a "rabbit hole" of overspending and inefficiency.
"We are wondering where we will find the next inspired leader, and we hope we have him now," said Bowden as he left the event.

Laying Claim to a Treat, And Hearing, 'Not So Fast'

Texto completo: The whoopie pie consists of two round pieces of chocolate cake, icing and, of late, controversy.
Lancaster County, Pa., and Maine are fighting a whoopie pie war, battling over who can lay claim to a confection that both places say is a regional delicacy.
The first salvo was fired in January, when a bill to make the whoopie pie Maine's official state dessert was filed in the Legislature. After all, the state was home last summer to a whoopie pie festival, and a former governor declared the fourth Saturday in June Whoopie Pie Day.
"It's sold all over Maine, in every corner of the state," said Amos Orcutt, president of the Maine Whoopie Pies Association and the University of Maine Foundation. "A lot of alumni I've spoken with said, 'I remember these whoopie pies.' These are people who are 80, 90 years old eating whoopie pies when they were young."
Labadie's Bakery in Lewiston, Me., claims on its Web site that it has been making "The original (not a copy) Maine Whoopie Pie since 1925!"
But the treat, whose name is of uncertain origin, has long been an Amish country staple, and Pennsylvania is not eager to hand over such bragging rights. The Pennsylvania Dutch Convention and Visitors Bureau has created a Web site where readers are urged to "Save our Whoopie!" It claims Maine is trying to "steal our treat" in an "act of confectionary larceny."
One group staged a rally last month in Lancaster. It was "making note of the fact that Lancaster County is most notably the home of the whoopie pie," said John Smucker, owner of the Bird-in-Hand Family Restaurant and Smorgasbord in Bird-in-Hand, Pa.
Back in Maine, where the legislation is scheduled to be voted on in the next few weeks, there is dissent in the whoopie pie ranks.
Donald Pilon, a state representative from Saco, objects to honoring the whoopie pie, believing that a dessert made from large amounts of shortening and sugar should not be heralded when a third of Maine children are obese.
"Whoopie pie, it's not even a pie," Mr. Pilon said. "It's two pieces of cake with frosting in the middle."
The legislation was recently amended, he said, to call the whoopie pie the state treat, rather than dessert, in light of his objections.
Mr. Orcutt thinks the bill will prevail and the dispute will rage on.
"They're really having a meltdown," he said of the detractors in Pennsylvania, "and they're somewhat deprived because they don't have lobsters and they don't have the wild Maine blueberry, so they're clinging on to this whoopie pie."

Texto completo: VERO BEACH Spring training is under way at Vero Beach Sports Village.
More than 70 college, high school and club baseball teams from 24 states, as well as some from Canada, will be experiencing spring training like big-leaguers over the next couple of months, as VBSV is hosting teams for games and practices through March 26 for college teams and April 23 for high school.
Teams began arriving Thursday at the former spring home of the Los Angeles Dodgers, and games are set to begin Friday.
This marks the inaugural VBSV spring training, as Russmat Baseball ran a similar event at the Vero Beach facility last year.
We are very pleased with the number of schools that will be traveling to Vero Beach this spring, VBSV director of athletics and marketing Jeff Biddle said. Given that this is a first-year program, we see tremendous growth potential. We believe that once teams experience the outstanding Vero Beach Sports Village facilities and our beautiful Indian River County, they will make a trip to Vero Beach an annual event.
Teams will have access to all the amenities of VBSV, including five full fields, eight indoor, lighted batting and pitching tunnels equipped for live pitching or with pitching machines, four outdoor batting tunnels with pitching machines and 32 mounds for pitchers with home plates matching up with each for catchers.
Practice and game schedules have been arranged for each participating team during their one-to-two-week stay. While some teams will be staying in local area hotels, many of them will be housed on-site in the 89 villas with a meal package included.

Texto completo: The growing debate over whether Central Maine Power Co. customers should be allowed to opt out of the company's smart meter installation program will enter a new phase today, with parties set to meet privately to negotiate a possible settlement.
At issue is whether it's technically and financially possible for CMP to offer alternatives, and who would pay the extra costs associated with them.
This matter is formally being examined by the Maine Public Utilities Commission, which last year approved CMP's plan to replace 620,000 mechanical meters with wireless, digital devices.
With encouragement from the PUC staff, CMP has agreed to meet with complainants and key intervenors in the case to seek common ground outside of the official process. As in a court case, the idea is to find solutions that can avert costly legal action.
CMP has installed 135,000 smart meters so far. About 3,300 customers - 2 percent - have asked not to have the meters at their homes and businesses. CMP insists that it must switch out all meters for the system to achieve maximum benefits, but it's honoring opt-out requests for the time being.
Two-way communication between smart meters and CMP will enable the utility to respond more quickly to outages and manage energy demand. The meters also will let customers track hourly power use and, eventually, run appliances when prices are lowest.
But some residents worry about health effects from the radio frequency waves that the meters emit and other issues, including privacy and security.
The PUC voted earlier this winter to investigate whether CMP's policy of not letting customers opt out of the program is unreasonable or discriminatory. The probe is narrow by design; it's not meant to determine whether smart meters present a health or security risk.
CMP has said the issues being raised in Maine, and the potential solutions, are relevant across the country, where more than 40 million smart meters are being installed. "How Maine addresses these questions is being closely watched," said John Carroll, a CMP spokesman.
The health question is being pressed in a separate complaint, filed with the PUC last week by 10 customers who say they have had or are having adverse effects from smart meters installed at their homes or in their neighborhoods. They want the PUC to investigate whether it's reasonable to set up "smart meter-free areas" around homes of people who have physical problems linked to the wireless devices.
CMP has yet to respond to the formal complaint, and the PUC has taken no action.
Today's settlement talks at PUC headquarters in Hallowell will be closed to the public. CMP is expected to discuss options it has evaluated at the request of the PUC.
One idea is to install a digital meter but not hook it up to a wireless network. A worker would visit six times a year and download data into a hand-held reader. That option would cost $124 for installation and $9.95 a month, CMP estimates.
A major question for today's discussion is who would pay that cost.
"Our position is that we don't want to add costs for the rest of our customers," Carroll said.
The overall price could depend on what standards the PUC sets for customers to opt out. If all ratepayers had to cover the total cost, tens of thousands of customers might make that choice, Carroll said, which could create big gaps in the wireless network and make it harder for CMP to restore power after outages.
Most people who are disturbed by wireless signals simply want to have a choice, said Elisa Boxer-Cook of Scarborough, a leading opponent of smart meters who initiated the case that will be negotiated today. They would be willing to pay for an alternative if the price isn't prohibitive, she said.
Today's talks are just the start of an effort to identify the best options and agree on the costs, said Eric Bryant, a staff attorney in the state Public Advocate's Office. Technical options appear to exist, Bryant said, and if the costs are acceptable and customers are willing to pay them, his office would support their right to opt out of the smart meter program.
If settlement talks fail, the case will proceed through the formal PUC process, which would include legal briefs and hearings. A new settlement could be proposed at any time.
In earlier testimony, CMP argued that suggested alternatives to wireless meters, namely letting customers keep their mechanical meters or installing smart meters with dedicated phone lines, would cost too much money. It also said those options would fail to meet the state's policy objectives and may threaten $96 million in federal funds for the two-year project.

Texto completo: PORTLAND, Maine Beer. It's not just for couch potatoes anymore.
A Bavarian brewmeister is touting its no-alcohol beer as the latest sport drink for athletes, handing it out at the finish line of sporting events and touting its regenerative benefits.
Unlike Gatorade, Erdinger Alkoholfrei is served up with a frothy head. And it comes in one color a golden hue unlike conventional sport drinks.
Several top athletes from Europe quaffed the beverage from giant mugs on the podium of the World Cup biathlons held this month in northern Maine.
The company touts the beverage as an isotonic, vitamin-rich, no-additive beverage with natural regenerative powers that help athletes recover from a workout. In other words, it's carbohydrate-loaded refreshment without the alcoholic buzz of beer or the jitters caused by some energy drinks.
It's a very healthy product, said Glenn McDonald, U.S. manager for Erdinger. Overseas, it's very popular. It's the No. 1 non-alcohol beer in Germany.
Even though it's called alcohol-free, Alkoholfrei still contains less than 0.5 percent alcohol. That makes it verboten for anyone under 21 in Maine. Other states, like California, allow minors to buy alcohol-free beer.
Promoted as a sports and fitness drink, Erdinger began targeting athletes in 2001 in Europe with an advertising campaign featuring a pair of triathletes. Its popularity quickly grew in Europe, where it's often distributed for free in the finishing area of sporting events.
Whether Americans couch potatoes and athletes alike are ready to embrace another no-alcohol beer is unclear. Sales of no-alcohol beer have been declining for more than a decade in United States, so any new entrant faces an uphill battle, said Benj Steinman, editor of Beer Marketers Insights.

Texto completo: Note: "The big effect is to drain money out of the United States and Maine economies that would otherwise circulate and support other activities." Charles Colgan Economist at the University of Southern Maine
Last week's surge in petroleum markets has intensified a five-month assault on the typical Maine household's energy budget, boosting prices in an oil-heated home with two cars by $1,417 a year since early September.
Overall, those hikes have increased the annual statewide cost of fuel oil and gasoline by roughly $653 million, figures show.
Most of this money leaves the state, much of it going to other countries.
These estimates are drawn from figures compiled by the Maine Sunday Telegram to illustrate the impact of rising petroleum prices on residents and the economy. They were reviewed by economists and AAA Northern New England.
The estimates were calculated as unrest in the Middle East was sparking a sudden surge in petroleum prices. Speculation about how the situation might influence worldwide supplies helped push a barrel of crude oil last week to $100, the highest level since the sharp spikes of 2008. Crude oil in the $100 price range translates to heating oil and gasoline at roughly $4 a gallon.
Rising wholesale prices now are causing daily jumps at the retail level. Regular gasoline shot up 6 cents a gallon from Thursday to Friday, to $3.33.
Compared to prices early last September, the typical two-vehicle household is paying $825 more per year at the pump. Assuming the number of homes with two vehicles that have average fuel economy and annual travel, the price change has totaled $412.5 million annually.
A prolonged period of $4-a-gallon gasoline and heating oil would drain hundreds of millions of dollars from Maine's economy, which is especially dependent on petroleum. More than seven in 10 Maine homes burn oil for heat, and 77 percent of workers commute alone by car, according to the latest U.S. Census survey.
An example of the potential impact: If gasoline averaged $4 a gallon for a year, a typical, two-car household using 1,250 gallons would spend $5,000 a year to fill up.
CHANGE 'ENERGY CULTURE'
Energy prices change daily, but state officials and experts say Mainers should begin preparing now for the likelihood of a year of high energy costs.
Take the opportunity to change your family's "energy culture," suggested John Kerry, the state's energy director. Drive less and share rides. Weatherize and boost efficiency. Plan now for the next heating season.
"This has become a year-round sport, if you will," Kerry said.
Maine burns roughly 1.6 billion gallons of petroleum a year, most of it in the form of gasoline and diesel fuel.
The statewide average for regular gasoline was $2.67 a gallon in early September, according to AAA. It climbed to $3.33 last Friday.
Diesel fuel already is flirting with the $4-a-gallon mark. The average diesel price last Friday was nearly a dollar higher than a year ago, at $3.85 a gallon, a distressing sign for truckers.
But few Maine motorists are likely escape $4-a-gallon gasoline this summer, AAA Northern New England predicts. Gasoline prices typically see a "spring rally" as driving increases. Except for 2010, summer pump prices have increased from their winter lows by at least 56 cents a gallon each year since 2006, records show.
DRAIN ON THE ECONOMY
Beyond gasoline, heating oil accounts for the largest petroleum demand in Maine, more than 300 million gallons a year.
Fuel oil prices were relatively low when the heating season began last September. The statewide average stood at $2.56 a gallon, according to the weekly energy office survey. By last week, the average price had risen to $3.37. Compared with early last September, the average oil-heated home and business have seen average annual costs rise by at least $592 from the start of the heating season. Based on the number of Maine homes with oil and average consumption, that price change totals $240.6 million a year.
Another hike is expected this week, when the next statewide survey is released.
These price hikes probably aren't severe enough to derail the fragile economic recovery, according to Charles Colgan, a University of Southern Maine economist and forecaster, but they could slow job growth and consumer spending.
"The big effect is to drain money out of the United States and Maine economies that would otherwise circulate and support other activities," Colgan said. "With the economy as weak as it is, this is not welcome news."
One brighter spot for the household energy budget is the price of electricity. Depressed natural gas prices for power plants, and a scheduled drop in distribution costs, are actually lowering total electric rates. A typical Central Maine Power Co. home customer paying $81 a month will see that bill ease to around $78 in July, when distribution rates change.
But electricity generally is the smallest piece of the energy budget in a typical Maine household. Heat and transportation have far larger impacts, which are magnified in homes with lower incomes.
HOUSEHOLDS TAKE A HIT
The financial hit from rising heating oil prices on poor Mainers was highlighted in a recent white paper report circulated by William Strauss, president of FutureMetrics, a renewable energy consulting firm in Albany Township.
Strauss is a founder of a business that sells wood-pellet boilers, and is involved with promoting wood fuel. Using the most-recent Census data, Strauss showed heating oil costs as a percentage of income, if oil reaches $4.50 a gallon.
The analysis found that the poorest Mainers, roughly one in 10 residents, would spend half their gross income on heating oil. The largest group of residents, roughly six in 10, would spend 13 percent of their income on heating oil.
This estimate omits the impact of gasoline. Combining gasoline and heating oil with each priced at $4 to $4.50 a gallon, and including electricity, would put a severe strain on a family's total budget, according to calculations in a study this month on offshore wind power for the University of Maine.
The median household income in Maine is roughly $45,000. If the projected prices of fuel hold true this year, a family could spend up to $10,000 on energy - more than 20 percent of its gross annual earnings.

Texto completo:   The founder of a national home repair franchise charged with felony securities fraud agreed Wednesday to pay investors $2 million in return for the state of Maine dropping criminal charges against him.
USA TODAY described allegations against Portland, Maine-based Rent-A-Husband and its founder, former television personality Kaile Warren, in October 2009. They included telling investors his company was worth millions of dollars and failing to inform them that he and his company were virtually broke.
Warren was indicted two months later on three felony charges including securities fraud and theft by deception. He was slated to go to trial March 14.
Leanne Robbin, a Maine assistant attorney general, says her office agreed to settle the case as a civil matter because of information it recently obtained about the legal advice Warren was receiving.
To win their case, prosecutors would have had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Warren "intentionally and knowingly failed to disclose material information" to investors. Given the legal advice he received, Robbin says there "was some question" whether they could do that.
Warren's lawyer, Daniel Lilley, said Wednesday that he planned to sue two law firms that provided legal advice to Warren, as well as Ace Hardware -- which Warren says backed out of a partnership deal with him -- to recover money for investors. Lilley did not return a call for comment.
Ace Hardware did not respond to a request for comment.
Under terms of the settlement, any money Warren recoups from lawsuits -- after his own legal fees -- would have to go to the state to distribute to investors. Warren did not admit to or deny the charges in the consent agreement.
Robbin says if Warren doesn't prevail against the other firms, the state would get a "reasonable percentage" of any money he earned until the money was paid back.
According to the legal complaint against Warren, he raised more than $2 million by selling more than 70 promissory notes for Rent-A-Husband from 2002 until mid-2009.
USA TODAY reported two of the investors stood to lose their homes and others were facing other financial hardship because of the money they gave Warren, which he typically promised to pay back at a high rate of interest.
The notes Warren sold violated Maine securities law because they didn't fully disclose the financial condition of Rent-A-Husband and included company valuation figures that didn't explain what they meant, the complaint said.

Texto completo: Dr. Dora Anne Mills, who headed up the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention for the past 14 years, was fired Wednesday from her new post as the medical director at MaineCare, the state's Medicaid program for low-income and disabled residents.
The statement Wednesday from the Maine Department of Health and Human Services was terse: "As DHHS continues to assemble its new leadership team, Dr. Dora Anne Mills has been relieved of her duties as Medical Director at the Office of MaineCare Services (OMS) effective immediately. DHHS will continue to assess and evaluate the administrative responsibilities at OMS. We wish Dr. Mills the best in future endeavors."
Reached on Wednesday, Mills declined to comment on her ouster.
Mills is widely respected in the public health community and is credited with a number of public health successes in Maine during her tenure. They include initiatives to drive down the rates of tobacco use and teen pregnancy, reduce childhood obesity and respond to last winter's H1N1 influenza outbreak. In 2007, the American Medical Association recognized her work in improving Maine's public health system, awarding her the Dr. Nathan Davis Award for Outstanding Government Service.
Mills, a pediatrician by training, left the Maine CDC in December after the election of Gov. Paul LePage and a Republican Legislature, citing the need for a change. She was hired at MaineCare by former MaineCare Director Tony Marple, who has since been replaced with an acting director. Another acting director, former state epidemiologist Dr. Stephen Sears, also is serving as the head of the Maine CDC.
News of Mills' dismissal surprised the public health community.
"I am shocked," said Tina Pettingill, executive director of the Maine Public Health Association. "Though I was sad to see her leave the CDC, I was thrilled that she was going over to MaineCare."
Pettingill said Mills' public health perspective would have been invaluable at MaineCare, providing a strong emphasis on disease prevention and improving the management of chronic disease.
Mills not only is committed to public health and good medicine, she said, but also has been successful in using available funding to obtain matching public health dollars from public and private sources. In addition, she said, Mills has actively sought out partnerships with hospitals, schools and local agencies to expand public health campaigns. The most visible of these efforts resulted in the statewide Healthy Maine Partnerships program, which provides programming and resources at the community level throughout the state.
Shawn Yardley, director of the Bangor Department of Public Health, said Mills has been "the face of public health in Maine" for many years. Her success in establishing an eight-region statewide public health system paves the way for continued improvement and the equitable distribution of scarce funds, he said. Mills also has moved the state closer to an important accreditation that will make Maine more competitive in applying for grant funding, Yardley said.
At the Maine Medical Association, Executive Vice President Gordon Smith said news of Mills' termination is "a surprise and a disappointment." As a pediatrician, he said, "she was really committed to kids, to immunizations, to the eradication of youth smoking - all the right things."
In addition, Smith said Mills effectively communicated the importance of public health initiatives to physicians, policy-makers and the general public, and he said those same skills are as important in the MaineCare office as they are at the Maine CDC.
"She could have done a lot [at MaineCare]," he said. But given Mills' professional ideals and energy, he said, "I'm sure she'll find another place to make her contributions."

Texto completo: PORTLAND, Maine A memorable Seinfeld episode features Kramer and Newman taking thousands of cans and bottles to Michigan so they can get a nickel more per container than they would in New York, but beverage distributors say there's nothing funny when it happens for real.
In Maine, which has a more expansive bottle-redemption law than neighboring states, three people have been accused of illegally cashing in more than 100,000 out-of-state bottles and cans for deposits, the first time criminal charges have been filed in the state over bottle-refund fraud, a prosecutor said.
Thomas and Megan Woodard, who run Green Bee Redemption in Kittery, face the more serious charge of allegedly passing off more than 100,000 out-of-state containers with a value of more than $10,000 as if they had been purchased in Maine.
In the 1996 Seinfeld episode, Kramer and Newman hatch a plan to drive a truckload of cans and bottles to Michigan, because the redemption fee there was 10 cents, double New York's nickel deposit.
Kramer laments it can't be done. You overload your inventory and you blow your margins on gasoline, he says at one point. But Newman offers up free space in a mail truck he has to drive to Michigan before Mother's Day the mother of all mail days, he calls it and the pair head off. (They end up aborting the trip.)

Texto completo: PORTLAND, Maine A memorable Seinfeld episode features Kramer and Newman taking thousands of cans and bottles to Michigan so they can get a nickel more per container than they would in New York, but beverage distributors say there's nothing funny when it happens for real.
In Maine, which has a more expansive bottle-redemption law than neighboring states, three people have been accused of illegally cashing in more than 100,000 out-of-state bottles and cans for deposits, the first time criminal charges have been filed in the state over bottle-refund fraud, a prosecutor said.
A couple that runs a Maine redemption center and a Massachusetts man were indicted this week for allegedly redeeming beverage containers in Maine that were bought in other states.
Thomas and Megan Woodard, who run Green Bee Redemption in Kittery, face the more serious charge of allegedly passing off more than 100,000 out-of-state containers with a value of more than $10,000 as if they had been purchased in Maine.
In the 1996 Seinfeld
episode, Kramer and Newman hatch a plan to drive a truckload of cans and bottles to Michigan, because the redemption fee there was 10 cents, double New York's nickel deposit.
Kramer laments it can't be done. You overload your inventory and you blow your margins on gasoline, he says at one point. But Newman offers up free space in a mail truck he has to drive to Michigan before Mother's Day the mother of all mail days, he calls it and the pair head off. (They end up aborting the trip while chasing down Jerry's stolen Saab.)
That was a very funny episode, Augur recalls. But this is not a laughing matter.
Officials estimate that up to 1 billion beverage containers are sold in Maine each year Containers sold in other states, however, carry the Maine deposit stamp because it's not cost-effective to change labeling for each state.
The redemption rate and the instances of fraud have gone up with the poor economy, Augur said.
In all, 10 states have redemption laws, but Maine is susceptible to fraud because it has expanded its 1978 bottle-deposit law through the years beyond soda, beer and other carbonated beverages.

Texto completo:   Special to the News-Record & Sentinel
A local hiker was recently named Appalachian Trail Conservancy Volunteer of the month for February.
Little Sandy Mush resident Charles Lee - known to friends and neighbors as "Charly" -- started hiking the Appalachian Trail in North Georgia in the 1960s, on a Boy Scout trip.
All these years later, he is has made it to Bennington, Vermont, taking the trip in sections. At first he just did a handful of three- and four-day weekends, but after he retired from his position as an electrical engineer Ohio Electric Motors in Barnardsville, and a brief stint in accounting with Stacie's Personal Care Services, Lee started making his section hikes longer in both duration and distance.
He has two more months of hiking left before he makes it to the end of the trail in Maine, a little over 500 miles. He plans to do one month next summer, and another month in 2012.
In addition, he's been volunteering at the Appalachian Trail conservancy in Asheville.
And this winter he took on a new project - he adopted a portion of the trail in Madison County from Lemon Gap (which is near Max Patch) to Garenflo Gap.
As a steward he will make sure the trail is clean and free of trash and fallen trees.
At the end of January, Lee and his wife, Dorothy Lee, hiked a portion of this part of the trail together.
But it was difficult to pick up trash. There was still a foot of snow on the high elevations out past Max Patch.
And there were a few problems. The privy (or outhouse) at a shelter on the route seemed to have taken flight on a windy day and came off of its foundation.
Later he had to hike back up to the shelter on this stretch of the trail - the roof of the shelter had blown off on another windy day.
Some other parts of the trail in Madison County also need stewards. For more information contact the Appalachian Trail Conservancy's regional office on Zillicoa Street in Asheville at 828-254-3708.

Texto completo: Giant wind turbine installations floating more than 10 miles off the Maine coast could be able to generate electricity at rates competitive with conventional sources in 2020, according to a report being released today by the University of Maine.
University researchers say it seems possible to hit a target of 8-10 cents a kilowatt hour for energy delivered to the grid, which is on par with current costs.
Building floating platforms on land and towing them to their deepwater locations will be much cheaper than erecting turbine towers on the sea floor, researchers say. Seabed turbines are common in Europe and are the preferred design for proposed wind farms in shallow waters off the East Coast of the United States.
These projections are part of an exhaustive study of the feasibility of offshore wind in Maine that's aimed at energy developers around the world. The $1 million study, paid for by the federal Department of Energy, is meant to answer many questions that developers will have about whether it makes sense to invest in the Gulf of Maine.
Some of those questions will be addressed today during an interactive webcast and informational meetings being held at the university's Orono campus.
The session comes two months before the deadline for developers to respond to a request for proposals from the Maine Public Utilities Commission for a landmark pilot project. This demonstration, with a total capacity of 25 megawatts, will be too small and experimental to produce market rate power, according to Habib Dagher, the UMaine professor overseeing the effort. But it will offer a chance for a developer to explore the potential of a commercial-scale project off the Maine coast around 2020.
Dagher and his associates are in touch with roughly four dozen companies around the world involved in offshore wind. The study, Dagher said, will save a prospective bidder years of research and millions of dollars. He is hopeful that the study's detailed data will entice at least a couple of qualified developers to consider Maine over other locations where the potential for deepwater wind energy is being considered. "This will give Maine a major leg up," he said.
Maine has created a phased-in approach to floating offshore wind. It is starting with a proposed test model off Monhegan Island in 2012, a 25-megawatt pilot by 2016, and a commercial-scale wind farm with a capacity of up to 1,000 megawatts by 2020. Additional wind farms are contemplated by 2030, leading to a $20 billion investment in the state and supporting industries to manufacture, install and service hundreds of units.
But this scenario depends on researchers being able to drive down the cost of producing power 20 miles offshore, and plugging the underwater cables into coastal substations that connect to the regional electric grid.
The study has found that to be possible, Dagher said. Making floating platforms in coastal dry docks and towing them offshore will cut the energy cost of deepwater wind enough to hit 8 to 10 cents/kwh.
That's still above today's depressed natural gas prices, but should be very attractive in 2020, Dagher said, when overall energy prices are likely to rise. Including rates for transmission and distribution, consumers would pay 13 to 16 cents/kwh, he estimated, which is on par with today's overall rates in Maine.
Beyond energy costs, the study focuses closely on hundreds of details that developers would need to know to win permit approvals for the demonstration project.
"It really is a comprehensive overview of all the environmental, geographic and permitting issues that a developer would want to consider before responding to the request for proposals," said Jeff Thaler, an attorney who represents the DeepCwind Consortium, a group of companies working on offshore wind.
The study represents four years of data collection on everything from where right whales migrate to what piers can handle heavy construction equipment. It identifies broad "areas of interest" at least 10 miles offshore - one off the Wiscasset region and another off Vinalhaven. It pinpoints grid interconnections and lists facilities suitable for the needs of heavy industry, including those in Eastport, Searsport, Brewer and Bath.
Other states have put out similar requests for proposals and conducted resource assessments, Thaler said, but all have been focused on development on the Continental Shelf.
"What's unique about Maine's study is we're talking about deepwater," Thaler said.
Developer bids for the demonstration project are due at the PUC on May 1. So it will still be a while before Dagher knows what impact the study and today's presentations have on the process. "If we got two good proposals I would be satisfied," he said. "We only need one good developer."

Texto completo: EDMUNDS, Me. -- Perched on the rocky coast of far eastern Maine, the farm owned by Aaron Bell and Carly DelSignore is stunning, both in its views of Cobscook Bay and in the distance that the milk they sell must travel to get on the shelves.
Their farm is a six-hour drive from most potential customers -- so far that their longtime processor, HP Hood, gave up on them in 2009, convinced that no one would never make a profit hauling milk such a vast distance.
But the married couple, part of the eighth generation to farm on Mr. Bell's family's land, is determined to keep dairy a viable industry here in Washington County. They are of a small, farmer-run outfit called Maine's Own Organic Milk -- MOO Milk for short -- which hopes to persuade New England foodies to pick up a carton of MOO's organic, local, slow-pasteurized milk instead of reaching for familiar national brands like Horizon Organic or Organic Valley.
So far, success has been elusive. Ever since its milk began hitting shelves in January 2010, the company has barely managed to stay afloat, relying on a mix of investor money, grants, charitable donations and the kindness of neighbors buying half-gallons in solidarity.
"Our boat is made of duct tape and we've almost sunk a few times, but we're paddling along," said Mr. Bell, 33.
MOO Milk's journey is a cautionary tale: true grit, a laudable philosophy and a hot trend aren't enough to create a viable business.
"There are folks who support what we do, but there's not enough of them up here," said David Bright, a former newspaper reporter and the organization's treasurer. "So far, I haven't been able to find 6,000 people who will buy a gallon of our milk each week."
Organic milk sales are expected to grow by 10 percent this year, according to the Organic Trade Association. But the competition is cutthroat, and small players tend to struggle.
"Milk sells for a very, very small margin" of profit, said Nancy Hirshberg, vice president for natural resources at Stonyfield Farm, a leading maker of organic dairy products. "It's about high volume."
MOO Milk got a lifeline in December, when 14 Whole Foods supermarkets in Massachusetts agreed to sell its milk. But it may not be enough to save it.
"The bankers don't really have the sense of urgency about what we're doing and that you have to feed these animals," Mr. Bright said. "We're going to bleed out on the emergency room floor."
Mr. Bell is trying to stay optimistic. He can't afford to give up yet -- he and his wife are expecting their fourth child in May, and they are still paying back a $250,000 loan they took out to start the organic operation. Plus, there are few alternative job prospects in Washington County, which has an unemployment rate of 10.3 percent.
"The stage is set," Mr. Bell said while driving a tractor on a frigid Sunday afternoon in January. "We're a marketable brand. Our milk is good. We have a good, honest story. We have distribution and should be able to sell all of our milk in Maine, New Hampshire and Boston."
Most of the farmers in MOO Milk got into the organic dairy business in 2005, when Hood approached them to help it meet the booming demand for all things organic. But when the economic downturn hit in 2008, consumers cut back on purchases of organic milk, which typically costs about $4 for a half-gallon, or double the cost of nonorganic milk.
Hood, which was processing the milk in Oneida, N.Y., ended the contracts. "The demand for organic milk had decreased, therefore our need for organic milk had softened," said Lynne Bohan, a spokeswoman for Hood. In addition, distance was a factor. "There are certainly efficiencies in procuring milk from farmers who are closer to our plant," she said.
Nine of the farmers decided to go it alone and set up MOO Milk.
The organization started on donations, including $50,000 from Stonyfield. MOO worked out a deal with a local milk truck driver to haul the product, and Smiling Hill Farm, a Maine dairy, lets MOO use its processing facility two days a week. MOO also uses a different pasteurization system than most other dairies. Rather than flash-pasteurize, it slowly heats the milk, resulting in what its farmers say is a creamier product.
But the company has little money for advertising, and it has struggled to persuade customers to choose MOO milk over its rivals.
"If you go to the milk cooler in your store and you walk up to it, all you see is a wall of white with little gobs of color on it. Your mind focuses on the label that's in your refrigerator," Mr. Bright said.
On a dreary Wednesday at the end of January, the organization's chief executive, Bill Eldridge, was trying one time-honored tool in the food marketer's arsenal: free samples.
"Would you like to try some milk?" Mr. Eldridge, dressed in a white fisherman's sweater and jeans, asked shoppers at a Whole Foods next to Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston.
Dozens of people stopped at the table, picking up a small paper cup of milk and grabbing a cookie. One woman told Mr. Eldridge the milk tasted like what she used to drink as a child, and another put back the milk she had in her cart and purchased MOO instead.
"Our product does do the talking for us," Mr. Eldridge said. "It's a not particularly hard sell. Just let people taste our milk."
Since MOO Milk began, three farmers dropped out of the co-op. The six who remain are still waiting for a few months' worth of paychecks and are lagging far behind on their bills.
"It would be nice," Ms. DelSignore said, "to be putting money in our pockets for the amount of work we do."
In addition to the Whole Foods deal, MOO is hoping to get a boost from outside investors. The company is in talks with Coastal Enterprises Inc., a nonprofit organization, to invest $150,000. But under the proposed terms, MOO must first find other investors, Mr. Eldridge said.
Ronald L. Phillips, president of C.E.I., would not provide details of the negotiations with MOO but he said he viewed the co-op as a way to support local agriculture.
"We're talking economic development here for lower-income communities, for rural areas, not just the product itself," Mr. Phillips said. Heather McCready, a spokeswoman for Whole Foods, declined to give sales numbers for MOO milk, and she said it was up to individual dairy managers to decide whether to stock it.
"Whole Foods Market seeks to support small, struggling New England organic dairy farmers," Ms. McCready said in an e-mail message. "We believe in the goals of this cooperative. MOO Milk produces a product that meets our quality standards.
While the mood at MOO seems to change by the day, all involved said they wouldn't be making such sacrifices if they were not convinced that it would survive and that more people would become interested in supporting local, sustainable agriculture.
"If we can hold everything together, I really think that we're going to make it," said Herb McPhail, one of the MOO Milk farmers.

Texto completo:   The whoopie pie war is on.
Pennsylvania residents are planning to hold a rally Saturday to protect their heritage and claim the whoopie pie as their own. The event is being organized by Nick Martin, a Lancaster resident, in response to recent events in Maine, where lawmakers are seeking to designate the whoopie pie as the official treat of Maine.
About 80 residents are planning to attend and support the cakey treat stuffed with a creamy filling, according to a new Facebook group "Rally to Save Our Whoopie!"
"I feel like I've got whoopie pies running through my veins," Martin said in a phone interview yesterday. "We're trying to send a message to the general public and the state of Maine that this is something we claim as our heritage."
Amos Orcutt, president of the Maine Whoopie Pie Association, said he was surprised to hear about the rally and offered his apologies for starting an interstate squabble.
"I'm sorry I've upset the whole state of Pennsylvania," Orcutt said. "The Maine Whoopie Pie Association is really a very peaceful group, and we mean no harm."
Orcutt also suggested a compromise, given that the Downeasters call the confections "whoopies," and some Pennsylvania residents describe them as "gobs."
"I propose we have a negotiated settlement. Pennsylvania can have the gobs and we can have the whoopie pies," Orcutt said.
Lancaster's local paper recently urged Pennsylvania's new governor to take the whoopie pie up as one of his first causes.
The whoopie pie has also divided Mainers. Lawmakers initially proposed a bill to anoint the baked good as the state's official dessert. But some residents and legislators raised concerns over glorifying such an indulgence, given the high rate of obesity in Maine. Others felt wild blueberry pie would make a healthier alternative, while staying true to Maine's roots as a top grower of wild blueberries.
A compromise emerged from the State and Local Government Committee on Monday, when lawmakers approved an amendment to make the whoopie pie the state's official treat, rather than the state's official dessert. Next, the whoopie pie will have to face a vote before the full Legislature.

Sen. Snowe isn't the first centrist from Maine to put people before party

Texto completo:   When the history of Olympia Snowe's time on the political stage is written, it's a good bet that she will be seen as the linear successor to Margaret Chase Smith, not Mike Castle.
Castle, the nine-term moderate Republican congressman, was defeated by Christine O'Donnell last year in his bid for Delaware's GOP Senate nomination. O'Donnell was backed by the Tea Party movement, which pilloried Castle for his willingness to work with congressional Democrats to win passage of legislation. O'Donnell was soundly beaten by Democrat Chris Coons in the general election.
Snowe, a moderate GOP senator from Maine, also has tried to bring some sanity to the political divide between congressional Democrats and Republicans during her three terms in the Senate. For her efforts she, too, has drawn the wrath of the Tea Party, an uncompromising fringe of the GOP's right wing.
Now, Andrew Ian Dodge, the head of Maine's Tea Party organization, says he'll challenge Snowe in the Republican primary. That's a mistake because Maine's voters have a long history of backing candidates who look out for them rather than kowtowing to others.
Like Smith, who was the first woman from Maine to serve in the Senate, Snowe refuses to be a GOP pawn in its ideological tug of war with Democrats. When Republicans and Democrats were locked in a standoff over the health care bill, Snowe joined the Gang of Six (a group of centrist and moderate Republicans and Democrats) and tried to produce a compromise. She's also a leader of the Centrist Coalition, moderate members of the two parties who seek compromise on issues which too often reduce the Senate to a squabbling, ineffective chamber.
The Tea Party treats compromise as political heresy, and Snowe thinks the Tea Party is a destructive force within the Republican Party.
"What works in South Carolina and Delaware may not work in Maine," Snowe said last year of the group's ideological litmus test, according to CNN. "We all have different views. We're independent. I can't go back to the people of my state and say, 'Excuse me, I have to be 100% ideologically pure because someone has dictated that from another state.' It just wouldn't wash."
That's the kind of independent streak that Smith showed when she became the first member of the Senate to speak out against the abuses of Sen. Joseph McCarthy's anti-communist crusade.
"I speak as a Republican, I speak as a woman. I speak as a United States senator. I speak as an American," Smith said in her 1950 "Declaration of Conscience" speech in which she criticized the lack of backbone of Republicans and Democrats. "The United States Senate has long enjoyed worldwide respect as the greatest deliberative body in the world. But recently that deliberative character has too often been debased to the level of a forum of hate and character assassination," she complained.
Snowe was equally courageous in bucking Republican leaders by working for compromise in the Senate. Just as Smith put the nation before party in 1950, Snowe now does the same when she joins with moderate Democrats to search for common ground.
I think Maine's GOP voters will reward Snowe for her brand of New England Republicanism, just as they did Smith, who first won election to the Senate in 1948 and was re-elected three times. Her last victory came two years after she challenged conservative icon Barry Goldwater for the GOP presidential nomination in 1964.
I don't think they'll repeat the mistake that was made in Delaware.

Maine lobster moving out of the pot, into new dishes

Texto completo: Thirty-eight Casco Bay lobstermen are working to divert more Maine lobsters from their conventional fate: a pot of boiling water followed by a bath in lemon and butter.
They hope to redirect the state's signature seafood into the mouths of gastronomes in the form of gourmet pies, pizzas and bisques.
The lobstermen have just launched the Calendar Islands Maine Lobster Co., based on the Portland Fish Pier, teaming up with renowned chefs Jonathan King and Jim Stott, owners of Stonewall Kitchen in York.
Their venture is on the cutting edge of the Maine lobster industry's push to become a player in the global food scene.
"We want to put Maine lobster where it isn't," said John Jordan of Yarmouth, a lobsterman and president of the company.
The new company reflects a shift in the way Maine's traditional lobster fishery operates as it struggles to adapt to a changing world and a changing economy.
Last year, Maine's 6,000 licensed lobstermen hauled in what is expected to be a record 100 million pounds of lobster. Only about 20 million pounds of it will be sold in New England. The goal is to keep the price of lobster up despite an increasing supply.
"So we have to find places to bring that harvest to get a good value," said Dane Somers, executive director of the Maine Lobster Promotion Council.
The Calendar Islands Maine Lobster Co. has its roots in another company, Dropping Springs LLC - named for one of the many springs that bubble up on Chebeague Island. The venture was started eight years ago by nine island lobstermen looking for a way to pool their resources in order to beat the rising cost of fuel and bait and get a better price from the lobster dealer.
"A few of us were motivated by frustrations over our options to sell our lobsters," said Jordan.
They were up against one of the intentional roadblocks of Maine's highly regulated lobster fishery, which is set up to operate inefficiently to prevent overfishing.
In Maine, lobstermen are allowed to own only one boat each. In other fisheries, such as groundfishing, individuals may amass entire fleets.
To keep their profits up, Maine lobstermen must maximize their fishing time, spending 14 hours a day hauling traps. That leaves them little or no time to sell their product, so they have largely relegated the job to lobster dealers, who pay lobstermen at the wharf and then find retailers, restaurants and other markets.
Although most fishermen remain fiercely independent, some - 20 percent by some estimates - have formed companies and cooperatives like Dropping Springs in recent years.
Dropping Springs quickly grew to 38 members from Yarmouth, Freeport and other communities. It operates a float and a holding vessel off Chebeague, and a bait business on the Portland Fish Pier.
After the recession hit, Dropping Springs' members decided they had to take the business a step further to survive the rock-bottom prices they were getting from dealers as suddenly cost-conscious Americans lost their appetites for the high-end catch.
"The money is made on the dock," said Ernie Burgess of Chebeague, a company member who is in his 57th year of lobster fishing.
So Burgess, Jordan and other members formed a strategy group, tapping some of the Chebeague summer residents' talent and business expertise, and came up with the idea of keeping control of their product from the trap to the freezer.
They decided not to sell live lobsters - which presents huge logistical challenges on a global scale - and got into prepared foods instead.
"This is a salty version of farm to table," said Jordan.
While the lobstermen knew how to catch lobsters, they didn't know much about food. In Stonewall Kitchen's King and Stott, they found partners who could step into that part of the business.
"Jim and I were impressed with the concept of the company mission, especially the fact that the lobstermen were owners in the company, not just supplying us lobsters," King said.
They have developed eight gourmet Maine lobster dishes, which they introduced last month at a seafood show in San Francisco.
Last week, they launched their Internet store at www.mainelobstergourmet .com. Jordan said their products should show up on the shelves of Hannaford Supermarkets soon, and they are working on other accounts.
The line includes lobster bisque, stew, pizza, pot pie, cakes, corn chowder, macaroni and cheese, and frozen tails. The suggested retail prices range from $10.95 for 20 ounces of bisque to $19.95 for an 18.5-ounce pizza. Prices online are higher.
The lobsters, caught by the company's 38 members and a dozen independent lobstermen, are flash-frozen by Shucks Maine Lobster, a processor in Richmond.
They are then processed by Jeanie Marshal Foods in Bangor. The entire operation is overseen by Calendar Islands.
"It is unique in its scope of vertical integration," said Somers, of the lobster promotion council.
Linda Bean's Perfect Maine Lobster in St. George's Port Clyde village buys its lobsters from independent lobstermen before turning them into frozen claw packs, lobster bisque and other prepared foods that are now in development.
Hancock Gourmet Lobster Co. in Cundy's Harbor has developed a line of gourmet prepared lobster and other seafood.
It is involved solely in the production end of the business.
Jordan considers neither company a competitor. Collectively, he said, they have more power to market Maine lobster as a recognized brand.
Somers said people outside of New England tend to eat lobster for special occasions at restaurants, and wouldn't know what to do with a live lobster.
Offering cooked, prepared lobster that they can eat at home makes sense, he said.
Also, it is easier to ship prepared foods than live lobsters to Japan, China and other Asian markets, which the Maine industry is trying to crack.
Next month, Calendar Islands will be among a half-dozen Maine companies at the Boston International Seafood Show, the largest seafood show in North America.
"We can't wait for our market to come to us in the summer, like the bake sale model," said Jordan. "We are trying to move beyond that."

Resumen: [...] by addressing public water use concerns, partnering with town officials and monitoring aquifer health, Nestle officials say the Poland Spring brand has grown responsibly, investing millions of dollars in Maine's economy and hiring hundreds of skilled workers.

Business people in Maine frequently criticize the state's regulations as overly complex and difficult to navigate.
But executives at Nestle, which owns the Poland Spring brand, say the strict state and federal rules they follow ensure healthy water supplies.
Nestle has good reason to point to the regs - the company faces vocal opposition from environmentalists and other activists.
But by addressing public water use concerns, partnering with town officials and monitoring aquifer health, Nestle officials say the Poland Spring brand has grown responsibly, investing millions of dollars in Maine's economy and hiring hundreds of skilled workers.
"We don't mind regulations," said natural resource manager Tom Brennan Tuesday at Poland Spring's Hollis bottling plant. "We have to be absolutely focused on the stewardship of our resource. Our business would shut down instantly if those springs stopped springing."
Poland Spring traces its history to the 1790s, when immigrants founded an inn at Poland Spring. The inn grew into a spa, and the owners began bottling spring water in 1845.
Perrier Group of America bought Poland Spring in 1980, when the company had only 25 staff and was near bankrupt, said William Maples, Nestle's director of supply chain for the Northeast.
Perrier was later acquired by Nestle Waters North America, a Stamford, Conn., division of the Swiss company. About 800 people work at Poland Spring in Maine.
Officials would not discuss Poland Spring's revenue, but Nestle Waters' website said bottled water sales - including all of the division's roughly 60 brands - totaled $4.2 billion in 2009.
And demand for bottled water is expected to grow in 2011, according to Gary Hemphill of Beverage Marketing Corporation. He estimates the segment was up 3.5 percent in 2010, after declining in 2008 and 2009.
Poland Spring bottles groundwater taken from nine sites throughout the state, including Fryeburg, St. Albans, Denmark, Pierce Pond, Dallas Plantation, Hollis, Kingfield and Poland.
Brennan said 13,000 years ago much of Maine was covered by a glacier, which, as it melted, deposited a layer of sand and gravel.
Those deposits function like a bathtub, holding rainwater and runoff. But the excess doesn't trickle over the side, it bubbles from the ground at springs, he said.
Nestle gets water in Hollis through five bore holes, which are connected to the spring and housed inside a "bore hole building." They look like rustic, one-room mountain cabins, but are tidy and locked electronically.
From the bore holes, water moves to an "intermediate pump station," or IPS, where it is blended and sent about a mile to the Hollis bottling plant.
Between 345 and 425 employees work at the Hollis site, overseeing an array of computers and a lightning-quick production line.
Maples said the 838,000 square-foot facility is the largest bottled water plant in the world, turning out about 80 million cases of water every year. Some of the machines at Hollis can fill 1,200 bottles per minute.
"It's huge. And we are here in the back woods," he said during a tour last week.
The entire Poland Spring brand ships 135 million cases each year.
Hollis doesn't just fill bottles, it also makes them, injecting hot resin into molds to create two- to five-inch long plastic test tube-shapes called "preforms."
Another machine heats and blasts the preforms into actual bottles, which are filled, capped and labeled. The machines whirl at dizzying speeds and conveyors carry bottles too fast to count.
The Hollis plant runs all day and night, seven days a week and the company ships water throughout the Northeast.
Poland Spring water isn't clean in the eyes of opponents, who they say the multinational corporation should not profit from community resources.
"Water should be recognized as a fundamental right for people in nature. Not a right conferred by people. It's an inherent right," said Ruth Caplan, a Washington, D.C.-based national coordinator for the Alliance for Democracy's water program.
Caplan has protested outside Nestle Waters' Connecticut headquarters.
She and others also fear Poland Spring will take too much water from Maine, damaging the aquifers. And they say Poland Spring contributes to the waste stream by shipping water - which flows virtually free to nearly every home - in plastic bottles.
In recent years, Caplan's group and advocates like Denise Penttila, a Kennebunk resident and member of Save Our Water, and Jim Wilfong of H2O for ME, have tried to block Poland Spring's expansions.
There was success in Wells, where the water district decided in 2009 not to sell water to Poland Spring following community opposition.
But the company has expanded in towns like Fryeburg and Kingfield.
Brennan, the natural resource manager, thinks much of the criticism is unfounded. He said the company conducts extensive research on Maine's aquifers and the surrounding environment, and he personally meets with officials and concerned citizens in the towns Poland Spring operates.
And Brennan said a host of state and federal agencies regulate the company, including the Maine's Department of Environmental Protection, Department of Conservation, the fisheries service, the Land Use Regulatory Commission, the Bureau of Parks and Land and the Maine Geological Survey.
Brennan said Poland Spring sends water data regularly to the DEP, which can "make us turn off the pumps."
Also, he said Poland Spring uses a fraction of water withdrawn in Maine. A 2007 DEP report found that bottled water accounted for less than 1 percent of water used.
Maples, the supply chain head, said Poland Spring has reduced its use of plastic. Bottles once made with 14.5 grams of plastic now use 9.1 grams, he said.
Maples added that Poland Spring's customers buy bottled water partly for convenience. If water was unavailable, they might buy soda or any number of competing drinks.
"If you are going to buy a convenience beverage, why not buy water?" he said.
Since 2000, Maples said, the company invested about $500 million in their operations in Maine and donated millions to charities and schools.
Hollis selectman Irving Ben Severance said the local plant has provided quality local jobs.
"The people I know there have excelled. The corporate mentality seems to be to take rising stars and help them in the future."
Though Nestle has helped fund road improvements, Severance said truck traffic frustrates some residents.
And he said a half-dozen people are dedicated to forcing Poland Spring out of town.
"They resent the fact that it's a foreign-owned company," he said. "I point out that ... it's a global economy. Water is a precious resource. Why not market it, just as we did pine trees for paper mills?"
Others agree.
"We shouldn't be villains in the state of Maine," said Jim Milligan, part owner of Carrabassett Spring Water, which employs 10 people. "I think Poland is trying to be a good neighbor, and boy, we could use manufacturers in the state of Maine."
There are other detractors.
N. Bryan Pullen, president of Summit Spring Water in Harrison, calls Poland Spring's branding misleading.
"They use a bore hole, which is a well. How do you call well water spring water?" he said, adding that his bottled water bubbles to the surface naturally.
Law allows bore hole water be called spring water, but Pullen described differences.
"The final step, where water percolates to the surface, pulls away particulates. You end up with a purity that is exceptional," he said.
Pullen said he can't compete with Poland Spring.
"I could receive a premium price if I could delineate my water from theirs," he said.
Brennan said in an e-mail that FDA rules require that bore hole water "match the chemistry of the water from the spring."

POLAND SPRING, A NESTLE BRAND
HEADQUARTERS: Nestle Waters North America, part of Swiss company Nestle, calls Stamford, Conn., home. The Poland Spring brand, which has no Maine headquarters, pulls water from nine sites in Maine and operates bottling plants in Kingfield, Poland and Hollis.
HISTORY: Poland Spring traces its history to the 1790s, when immigrants founded an inn at Poland Spring. The inn grew into a spa, and the owners began bottling spring water in 1845. In 1980, Poland Spring was bought by Perrier Group of America, which was later acquired by Nestle.
NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES: Roughly 800
EXECUTIVES: Two top Nestle executives in Maine are natural resource manager Tom Brennan and William Maples, director of supply chain for the Northeast. Brennan, a geologist, monitors the wells and the environment; Maples oversees production.
WORTH NOTING: Poland Spring's equipment in Hollis can fill 1,200 bottles per minute; other machines can make 61,600 bottles per hour. The plant has tight security; guests, even reporters, must sign a disclaimer. Visitors must provide the make and model of their car and license plate number.
FINANCIALS: Executives declined to discuss Poland Spring revenue, but Nestle Waters North America - which owns some 60 bottled water brands - reported sales of $4.2 billion in 2009. Industry observers expect the bottled water industry to grow in 2011.

Texto completo: In the wood yard, a crane feeds tree-length birch and maple into a machine that strips away bark. The logs pass through a chipper, which sprays streams of wood particles into a mound.
In the factory, chips are dried and hammered into fiber, then formed into pellets that fill 40-pound bags. By day's end, 22 tons of hardwood pellets are in a truck headed for a Lowe's Home Improvement store in North Attleboro, Mass.
This is the pace of production now at Geneva Wood Fuels: A maple tree growing in Franklin County on Monday can be heating a house in Massachusetts by Friday.
Despite appearances, however, Geneva is running at less than half capacity. Other pellet plants are, too. But for the first time in two years, there's optimism.
Rising oil prices and a recovering economy have New Englanders thinking again about alternative heat. The prospect that oil will stay high this year has Maine's wood pellet plants gearing up. Geneva has a dozen people on the job, four of them hired in the past month. It also brought on a regional sales manager to expand sales. Any job matters in this rural village, up the Sandy River from Farmington.
Less obvious, but welcome, are the 100 or so jobs tied to the plant's operation, including up to 50 loggers in Franklin and Oxford counties. Making pellets here contributes $1.5 million a year to the economy, according to an estimate by the Finance Authority of Maine.
All of that could vanish in an instant.
Three years ago, manufacturers at Maine's four pellet plants couldn't churn out enough fuel. It seemed everyone wanted a pellet stove, after oil hit record-high prices. Then oil collapsed during the recession. Stove sales plummeted, and oil heat got a reprieve. Pellet makers suddenly had too much capacity and too few customers.
As the industry recovers, plant owners are hoping that early signs of measured growth can be sustained.
"We're seeing a renewed interest in the market," said George Soffron, president of the Maine Pellet Fuels Association. "A lot of people are thinking about next heating season."
Soffron, chief executive officer at Corinth Wood Pellets, said his company has started an advertising campaign to promote pellet heat. He's also thinking about diversifying, to sell stoves and boilers.
Corinth has 27 employees working two shifts. The plant could make 75,000 tons per year, but it's running at half capacity. Soffron will get a better sense of the potential for growth this summer. That's when pellet plants typically ramp up production, to supply retailers for the next heating season.
Inquiries are up from people who want to buy pellet boilers, according to Dutch Dresser, managing director at Maine Energy Systems in Bethel. The company sells a European-designed boiler and delivers pellets by the truckload.
The upfront price of a pellet boiler - roughly $6,000 more than a modern oil unit - remains an obstacle, Dresser said. But buyers are banking that oil remains high. The company delivers pellets in bulk for $235 a ton. That translates to a heat equivalent of oil at $1.96 a gallon. By comparison, the average statewide price of heating oil last week in Maine was $3.35 a gallon.
"We're planning for what we expect to be a burgeoning need," Dresser said. "I'm quite optimistic about this year."
That's good news in Strong, where sawdust is a sign of prosperity.
Maine entrepreneur Charles Forster created an industry around here during the late 19th century, using the area's white birch to make the wooden toothpicks he invented. Strong became known as the "toothpick capital of the world," a slogan emblazoned on its fire truck. Hundreds of people - often local friends and family - labored to make 3 million toothpicks a day in Forster's factory, as well as ice cream sticks and clothespins.
Imports eventually killed western Maine's toothpick factories. The Forster Manufacturing Co. plant - the last holdout - closed in 2003.
So there was great excitement in 2007, when Jonathan Kahn, a Bowdoin College graduate and Chicago-based investor, announced plans to turn the shuttered factory into a pellet manufacturing facility. It went online in 2009.
Five months later, another blow. A dryer explosion rocked the $17 million plant, making its future uncertain. But Kahn and the other investors chose to rebuild, and operations resumed last spring.
The plant has three pellet mills capable of making 100,000 tons per year.
The process is simple, but the trick is creating a pellet that's consistently high in heat and low in ash and dust.
Wood chips are dumped into a bark-fueled dryer that bakes the moisture content to 10 percent. Hammer mills pulverize the chips into a fiber meal, which is blown into the pellet mills. Heat and pressure extrude the fiber into slim, dowel-shaped rods that are cut into pellets.
Roughly 80 percent of the output is sold in bags, which are filled on a conveyor. Fifty bags are piled onto a pallet, then covered and wrapped in plastic to stay dry. Forklift drivers scoot back and forth to load the one-ton pallets.
In stores, consumers notice the green and tan bags of Maine's Choice premium wood pellets. The bags feature a whimsical image of Ma and Pa Moose, sitting around a pellet stove on a winter day.
But filling bags with pellets is costly and cumbersome. Maine's manufacturers want to sell pellets in bulk by the truckload, as European plants do.
American consumers have been slow to embrace bulk delivery, but there are some encouraging signs. Phillips-based School Administrative District 58, for instance, buys 600 tons of pellets a year from Geneva Wood Fuels to heat its school buildings. A giant pellet boiler being installed at the Jackson Laboratory in Bar Harbor will burn 60 tons a day, some of it from here.
Outside, a new metal silo that can hold 300 tons of pellets stands next to the plant. That's the future, Maine pellet makers hope.
But for now, workers here are happy to fill bags, roughly 40,000 in a week. Off they go, to retailers across New England, from the Maine town once known for toothpicks and someday, perhaps, as "the wood pellet capital of the world."

Resumen: Members of Maine's beverage industry cited indictments handed down in York County this week to suggest the current bottle-deposit law is prone to costly fraud and inefficient as a recycling tool. A York County grand jury Thursday indicted Thomas and Megan Woodard of Green Bee Redemption in Kittery on charges of stealing more than $10,000 by collecting deposits and fees on out-of-state bottles and cans as if they were purchased in Maine with the five-cent deposit.

Texto completo: Members of Maine's beverage industry cited indictments handed down in York County this week to suggest the current bottle-deposit law is prone to costly fraud and inefficient as a recycling tool.
A York County grand jury Thursday indicted Thomas and Megan Woodard of Green Bee Redemption in Kittery on charges of stealing more than $10,000 by collecting deposits and fees on out-of-state bottles and cans as if they were purchased in Maine with the five-cent deposit. A Gloucester, Mass., lobsterman, Peter Prybot, was indicted for allegedly stealing a lesser amount.
"Unfortunately, Maine's returnable container law is very susceptible to this kind of fraud," Bob Bates, state director for Pepsi Beverages Co. in Auburn, said at a news conference Friday. "People may think we're just talking about nickels and dimes here, but the cost of this illegal activity to bottlers and distributors runs into the millions of dollars each year - a cost that ultimately gets passed on to the consumers."
Supporters of the state's deposit law say it is important to address fraud, but also important to avoid using that as an excuse to weaken an effective program.
The recycling rate for containers in nondeposit states averages 24 percent compared with 70 percent in deposit states, said Susan Collins, executive director of the California-based Container Recycling Institute. "The performance of deposit programs is unmatched," she said.
Maine has among the broadest returnable laws, covering water and juice containers as well as beer and soft-drink bottles and cans. The state estimates about 1 billion deposit containers are sold each year in Maine, and the state return rate is 90 percent.
But the beverage industry suspects that not all of those returnables come from Maine. As much as 10 percent might come from New Hampshire, which has no bottle bill; or Massachusetts, which covers only carbonated beverages, the industry says.
That would suggest that 90 million containers might be smuggled into the state each year, and returned at unscrupulous redemption centers that mix them in with legitimate recyclables, Newell Augur, executive director of the Maine Beverage Association, said at a news conference Friday at Coca-Cola's facility in South Portland.
Companies such as Coca-Cola, Pepsi and National Distributors, which sells Budweiser and other beers in Maine, pay redemption centers for the containers they collect from consumers. For each container, the companies pay the 5-cent deposit - 15 cents for wine and hard-liquor containers - plus a processing fee of 3.5 to 4 cents.
The companies also have to pay for the trucks and drivers collecting the containers and processing them for bulk sale. Recycled aluminum cans are worth about two cents each when sold in bulk as raw material.
Fraud could add as much as $7.75 million to the cost of handling returnables, Augur said, but the companies can't be sure, because it would be far too costly to inspect each container. The companies collect truckloads each day.
The industry can conduct spot checks at redemption centers and vendors to determine whether a sample contains any containers that shouldn't be there, but they generally depend on the redemption centers to check incoming bottles and cans for the Maine deposit symbol.
Even that isn't foolproof - many cans sold in no-deposit New Hampshire have the Maine deposit symbol.
It is expensive to print separate containers and store stock in separate warehouses, the industry says.
That's why the prosecution of the Woodards and Prybot is so important to the industry.
"We hope the indictment and prosecution of these individuals sends a strong message that the state of Maine takes this crime seriously," Dave Dumont, director of operations for Coca-Cola Maine, said at the South Portland news conference.
Augur said the association does not favor repeal of the bottle bill, but supports legislation to study it for possible changes. The industry would favor a system that has deposit bottles and cans returned to the municipal recycling stream where they could support a more robust recycling program. Aluminum and PET plastic bottles are the most valuable components of the recycling stream, so removing them deprives municipal programs of a major commodity that could help support the recycling of other products, Dumont said.
Collins, of the Container Recycling Institute, said only about half of all beverages are purchased for home use, so even successful curbside recycling programs don't collect beverages bought at restaurants or workplaces.
Craig Thorne, who runs Pack Man's redemption in Windham, says the industry could do more on its own to fight fraud. The industry should not sell cans that bear Maine's returnable symbol in other states.
That's just asking for them to be brought back to Maine for redemption, he said. He complimented Poland Spring, which now places a red stripe on bottles for sale outside the state.
Another problem is education, Thorne said. A lot of people believe any returnable can or bottle has a five-cent deposit value in Maine, no matter where it was purchased, he said. They don't realize that value exists only if it was purchased in Maine.
Augur said previous analyses have suggested that about half the deposit fraud is intentional, half incidental.
The association wants a change in the law so a civil action could be filed against anyone trying to redeem 48 or more containers not purchased in Maine.
"We appreciate the state's response to this crime, but given Maine's limited resources and many other priorities, we feel that now may be a good time to strengthen the existing law, and also explore alternatives," Augur said.

Federal law limits LePage's cuts to MaineCare

Resumen: Deeper MaineCare cuts would have created more uninsured Mainers and cost the state in lost federal funding, said Christopher St. John, executive director of the Maine Economic Policy Center.

Texto completo: Gov. Paul LePage is proposing about $50 million worth of MaineCare savings over the next two years.
But he wishes he could have cut more.
LePage and administration officials said Maine is being punished by the federal Affordable Care Act, which says states that have already expanded access to Medicaid health coverage cannot scale it back now.
"Our hands were greatly tied," said Mary Mayhew, commissioner of the Department of Health and Human Services.
Democrats say the averted MaineCare cuts are another example of how the controversial federal law is helping Mainers.
"I don't think we're being punished at all," said Rep. Emily Cain, the House minority leader from Orono. "The Affordable Care Act is an effort to bring the nation to where Maine has been."
MaineCare is Maine's version of Medicaid, a national program that provides subsidized health insurance to poor children, the disabled and elderly and other qualified adults. The state pays about one-third of the costs and the federal government pays about two-thirds.
Overall, LePage's budget proposal would increase state spending on Maine-Care by more than $200 million over the next two years. The net increase would cover rising costs and a reduction in federal reimbursements, among other things.
The proposed two-year general fund budget includes a total of $1.3 billion for MaineCare, which amounts to about 21 percent of LePage's budget.
The proposal would eliminate Maine-Care eligibility for non-citizen immigrants, require more cost-sharing by recipients and cut off enrollment of parents who earn more than 133 percent of the poverty level. The current limit is 200 percent.
The proposal also would cut about $50 million from the MaineCare budget.
LePage made clear in his budget address Thursday that he wished he could have gone further but was not allowed to roll back Maine's MaineCare eligibility standards.
Maine currently goes beyond many states' programs by providing Maine-Care access to childless adults and parents of enrolled children.
The Affordable Care Act will require all states to offer similar access starting in 2014. In the meantime, the law says, states that already meet the future eligibility standards have to keep them in place or face a penalty.
"The federal government says, if you're going to (reduce eligibility), you will jeopardize all of your federal funding," Mayhew said.
Mayhew said the fact that the administration's hands were tied on MaineCare meant it had to go elsewhere for savings. The budget includes laying off 10 people and eliminating some programs within the Fund for a Healthy Maine, a popular collection of public health programs created with tobacco settlement proceeds.
Mayhew said the fund would lose $18 million to help cover MaineCare expenses.
While Maine is one of the states fighting to overturn the Affordable Care Act in court, the administration has to comply with the law in the meantime, said Tarren Bragdon, director of the Maine Heritage Policy Center and a former member of LePage's budget team.
"Everyone is frozen in time by Obamacare," he said.
Deeper MaineCare cuts would have created more uninsured Mainers and cost the state in lost federal funding, said Christopher St. John, executive director of the Maine Economic Policy Center. "That's two-thirds federal dollars."
Even the proposal to freeze future MaineCare eligibility for some parents is a step backward, he said.
"This is precisely the working poor. They are not on welfare," he said. "This is exactly the kind of person we should be" helping.

Texto completo: The Maine Turnpike Authority would have to steer at least 3 percent of its annual operating revenue and any surpluses to the state Department of Transportation under a bill that's taking shape in the Legislature.
The proposal also would increase the authority's contribution to the Zoom bus, which now runs between Portland and Biddeford, so the commuter service could expand to Lewiston-Auburn and Augusta.
Those measures could help pay for statewide highway improvements and transportation alternatives during a budget crisis, supporters say. They also reflect a view that the turnpike authority, an independent agency financed through tolls and revenue bonds, is flush with cash and could do more to share the wealth.
"Yes, they have the money," said Rep. Bradley Moulton, R-York, a lead sponsor of the pending legislation.
Moulton, a lawyer who has a background in transportation planning, said he would like to see more integration of the turnpike authority and the Department of Transportation.
Many people in his hometown are fighting the authority's plan to build a new toll plaza there. His bill, initiated by conservation and anti-highway activists, taps into a simmering resentment of the turnpike authority.
On Wednesday, the Maine Heritage Policy Center held a news conference to call attention to what it says are skyrocketing payroll costs for the authority over the past 12 years.
And on Friday, a legislative hearing is scheduled on a recent report by the state's Office of Program Evaluation and Government Accountability, which found examples of staff charges for limousines and costly hotel rooms. Those were isolated incidents tied to national travel, but the findings made headlines and portrayed turnpike management as living large when many Mainers are strapped for cash.
"We're a popular target whenever there's a revenue shortfall," said Scott Tompkins, a spokesman for the turnpike authority. "There's a perception that we're flush with cash."
He noted that the authority already makes substantial contributions to the state.
The accountability office found, for instance, that the turnpike authority has transferred $75 million to the state since 1994. The biggest portion, $34 million, was given to the Department of Transportation in 1996. The authority continues to pay off bonds for that money.
The authority also pays for state police patrols on the 106-mile toll road, and has shared costs with the state for various interchanges, intersections and projects, including the train station in Wells and the service plaza in West Gardiner.
Most recently, the authority agreed to pay $3 million a year for the next 30 years to help replace and repair the bridges connecting Kittery and Portsmouth, N.H. That contribution could help offset the estimated $506 million cost. The deteriorating bridges are a major concern in York County, and some residents and officials have called for the turnpike authority to lend a hand.
"I think there's a misperception," Tompkins said. "What we do for the Maine DOT isn't widely known."
One reason is the way cost sharing has evolved.
A referendum in 1991 required the turnpike authority to give the state any annual operating surplus - the money left after operating expenses, bonds and reserves are accounted for. Those annual transfers, ranging from $4.7 million to $17.4 million, were made until the $34 million bond was issued in 1996.
Since then, the authority has not transferred any operating surplus to the MDOT. It maintains that it has no operating surplus, and notes that it now has $400 million in outstanding bond obligations.
The accountability office tried to sort out the matter, but found the law's language imprecise. The issue of the operating surplus is expected to be revisited this year by the Legislature.
"The money trail is very complicated to follow," said Jane West, a staff attorney for the Conservation Law Foundation.
West is associated with the Maine Alliance for Sustainable Transportation, which wants to reduce traffic congestion and the need for highway expansion in the Portland area. It produced a report in the fall that called for the turnpike authority to contribute $7 million a year to expand Zoom bus service. Moulton's bill captures those goals and lays out a timetable for routes and trip frequencies.
The authority already gives $115,000 a year to Zoom, but disputes the perceived level of demand for new and expanded service. Both sides have offered competing statistics on ridership, amid speculation about whether rising gas prices can force enough commuters out of their cars to make the added subsidy cost-effective.
Those questions will have to be sorted out by lawmakers, who also will want to consider how the turnpike authority's proposed 3 percent contribution would help roads in their districts.
The authority had operating revenue of $106 million in 2009, mostly from tolls. A 3 percent share would produce $3.2 million to spread around the state for highway projects.
But the equation isn't so simple, Tompkins said. The turnpike authority also spent more than $87 million on operations, maintenance, interest payments and other expenses.
As Moulton's bill gets drafted, it is attracting a diverse mix of co-sponsors. Moulton said they include members of the Legislature's Transportation Committee: Sen. Ronald Collins, R-York, a committee co-chair; Rep. George Hogan, D-Old Orchard Beach; and Rep. Ann Peoples, D-Westbrook. Other supporters are Rep. Ben Chipman, a Portland independent, and Rep. Brian Bolduc, D-Auburn.
Support, so far, appears to be coming largely from lawmakers who live in communities along the turnpike. It remains to be seen whether the prospect of additional highway funds and new bus service appeals to lawmakers from northern Maine, and to the administration of Gov. Paul LePage.
"It's critical," West said, "to get those folks on board."

Ethics panel urged to drop ads complaint

Texto completo: The staff of Maine's ethics commission is recommending that the panel drop a complaint against The Portland Press Herald for not reporting the donation of advertising space used to promote last fall's effort to have an elected mayor in Portland.
The advice against further investigation into the matter will be taken up Feb. 17 by the Maine Commission on Governmental Ethics and Election Practices. The five-member panel is expected to hear additional testimony before deciding whether to accept the staff advice or seek more information in the case.
"Staff is recommending taking no action based on an application of the statute to the facts," Jonathan Wayne, executive director of the commission, said Wednesday. "The commissioners will take an independent look at the issue."
The 44-page staff report is the product of a preliminary investigation and was posted late Tuesday on the commission's website: www.maine.gov/ethics/meetings/2011/20110217.htm.
Wayne said the staff concluded there was no clear evidence that the newspaper donated the ads with the purpose of influencing the election.
MaineToday Media Inc., the newspaper's publisher, donated the advertising space at the request of the Portland Regional Chamber, which ran a series of full-page ads advocating for a "yes" vote in the Nov. 2 election. The newspaper's donation - valued at $46,500 - was noted on post-election campaign finance reports filed by the political action committee that led the vote "yes" campaign.
Thomas Valleau, a former member of the Portland Charter Commission, complained to the ethics commission that the newspaper violated campaign finance laws by not registering with the city and disclosing the ads as gifts to the campaign. Valleau argued that voters had a right to know the role played by the newspaper in the weeks before a close election.
The elected mayor question passed 12,963 to 11,825. The newspaper had endorsed the elected mayor proposal on the editorial page.
Representatives of the chamber and the newspaper told the commission's staff that the donation was an extension of their ongoing business relationship, which included regular, smaller donations of advertising space, sometimes in exchange for sponsor status.
The staff report said the newspaper knew the chamber would use the ads to promote the referendum question and that donating six full-page ads leading up to the vote "could be consistent" with an attempt to sway public opinion.
But, in large part because of the newspaper's ongoing relationship with the chamber and the fact it had no input into creating the ads, there was no clear evidence that it made the donation with the purpose of influencing the election, the report says.
"The way the election law is written, the duty to register and file financial reports really hinges on what was the purpose of the Press Herald in providing the advertising space to the Portland Regional Chamber," Wayne said. "There's a lack of clarity about the newspaper's purpose."
The staff report also says the public ultimately was informed about the donated ads because the gift was noted on a Dec. 14, 2010, finance report filed by "Elect Our Mayor, Yes on 1!."
The political action committee listed an in-kind contribution from the chamber in the amount of $46,507.74 with the description "advertising in the Portland Press Herald" and a note: "The Portland Press Herald did not charge the Portland Regional Chamber for the ad space."
And, the staff report says, the newspaper may have reasonably expected the chamber or the PAC to report the donation.
Richard Connor, the editor and publisher of MaineToday Media, said Wednesday he was pleased that the report agreed with the newspaper's position.
"Hopefully the commission will agree ... that it shouldn't be pursued," Connor said. "Our purpose was not to support or to be against the (referendum) proposal in those ads, it was to provide them to the chamber as part of our relationship with them."
Connor said he knew the chamber would use the donated ads to support the change to an elected mayor, "but it just didn't matter to me. If the chamber had taken a position different from the one it took, if they had been against the ballot proposal, we would have still given them the space."
Connor said he also maintains the newspaper's donation was protected by the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. The ethics commission staff report, however, said giving away free advertising to one side in an electoral campaign is different from other protected functions of the press.
Valleau said he hopes to persuade commission members to reject the staff's advice and make clear that public disclosure is required in such cases.
"In reading the report of the staff, they seem to affirm the elements of my complaint and then they conclude let's dismiss the case anyway," he said.
"If the Girl Scouts of America had made this mistake, I would cut them some slack. But the newspaper plays a very important and special role around election time," he said. "I'm not thinking about last November's election, I'm thinking about next November's election."

Texto completo: HOUSTON A U.S. Customs and Border Protection agent appeared in a Maine courtroom on Tuesday to hear charges alleging he lied to investigators over his role in a 2005 incident along Texas' border with Mexico in which a would-be illegal immigrant drowned.
James Peters, 41, was arrested Tuesday in Houlton, Maine, where he is now stationed. He made an initial appearance in a Bangor, Maine, courtroom on a federal indictment charging him with four counts of making false statements to an investigator. A judge allowed Peters to be released on his own recognizance and set his next court date for Feb. 15 in Houston, where he will be tried.
A Houston grand jury handed up the indictment last month, but the indictment wasn't unsealed until Tuesday, after Peters' arrest.
Prosecutors accuse Peters of lying about what led up to the Dec. 14, 2005, drowning death of Carlos Delgadillo Martinez, a Mexican national who was trying to illegally cross into the U.S. with another person on inner tubes near the international bridge in Laredo.
Prosecutors contend that Peters deliberately flew his helicopter too close to the pair in an attempt to force them back to Mexico using the turbulence from his chopper. They say Delgadillo lost contact with the inner tube he was holding, and that he drowned.
A federal public defender who represented Peters at his court appearance Tuesday did not immediately return a call seeking comment.
If convicted, Peters faces up to five years in prison. He has worked for Homeland Security since 1997, becoming a helicopter pilot in 2003.
A spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorneys' Office in Houston did not immediately return a call on why prosecutors charged him with making false statements, as opposed to a more serious charge.
According to the indictment, Border Patrol agents saw the helicopter hover at a low altitude over the individuals, coming close to the bridge.
Internal radio transmissions indicate Peters told an agent he was going to try to make the individuals go back, according to the indictment.
A Border Patrol agent told investigators the force of the air turbulence from the low flying helicopter's rotor made Delgadillo lose his grip on the flotation device. The body of the Mexican citizen was found later that day near the bridge.
When questioned about the incident, Peters told an agent investigating the drowning death that he hadn't come across any illegal immigrants near the bridge, that he never hovered over the immigrants at a low altitude and he had never brought his helicopter to the level of the bridge or below it because of dangers associated with flying at such a low altitude in that area.
But a video from a Border Patrol pole camera as well as the helicopter's internal records showed Peters' aircraft was hovering over the river near the bridge at the time the two individuals were in the river, according to the indictment.

Texto completo: BINGHAM, Me. -- The orange signs posted throughout Chet Hibbard's pharmacy here relay a blunt warning: We Do Not Stock OxyContin.
Mr. Hibbard stopped dispensing the highly addictive painkiller last July, after two robbers in ski goggles demanded it at knifepoint one afternoon as shocked customers looked on. It was one in a rash of armed robberies at Maine drugstores last year, a sharp increase that has rattled pharmacists and put the police on high alert.
"I want people to know before they even get in the door that we don't have it," Mr. Hibbard said of OxyContin, which the authorities say is the most common target of pharmacy robberies here. "Outside hiring an armed guard to be in here 24/7, I don't know what else to do."
Maine's problem is especially stark, but it is hardly the only state dealing with pharmacy robberies, one of the more jarring effects of the prescription drug abuse epidemic that has left drugstores borrowing heist-prevention tactics from the more traditional targets, banks. In at least one case, a tiny tracking device affixed to a bottle let the police easily track a thief after a robbery.
More than 1,800 pharmacy robberies have taken place nationally over the last three years, typically conducted by young men seeking opioid painkillers and other drugs to sell or feed their own addictions. The most common targets are oxycodone (the main ingredient in OxyContin), hydrocodone (the main ingredient in Vicodin) and Xanax.
The robbers are brazen and desperate. In Rockland, Me., one wielded a machete as he leapt over a pharmacy counter to snatch the painkiller oxycodone, gulping some before he fled. In Satellite Beach, Fla., a robber threatened a pharmacist with a cordless drill last week, and in North Highlands, Calif., a holdup last summer led to a shootout that left a pharmacy worker dead.
The crime wave has spurred pharmacists to tighten security measures and add ones they may never have imagined. Many have upgraded their surveillance cameras; some have installed bulletproof glass and counters high enough to keep would-be robbers from jumping them, giving these pharmacies the aesthetic of an urban liquor store. In Tulsa, Okla., where there was a steep increase in drugstore robberies last year, at least one pharmacist now requires customers to be buzzed in the door.
Meanwhile, the police are quietly experimenting with new tools. In Lewiston, Me., last fall, a Rite Aid pharmacist handed a robber who threatened to shoot her five bottles of OxyContin, including one that contained a tracking device.
According to court records, the device led the police to the suspect's home on a rural road shortly after he fled the store. They gathered evidence there, arrested the suspect a few days later and indicted him last month.
The Drug Enforcement Administration does not routinely investigate reports of pharmacy robberies, and therefore "it cannot be determined what factors are contributing to these types of thefts," a spokeswoman said.
But some local law enforcement officials have been overwhelmed enough by the incidents to seek help. Thomas Delahanty II, the United States attorney in Maine, announced recently that the federal authorities would help investigate the heists from now on and prosecute some of the cases.
Federal charges could bring more prison time, Mr. Delahanty said, describing the surge in such robberies as "staggering numbers that can't be ignored." There were 21 in Maine last year, according to the D.E.A., up from two in 2008 and seven in 2009.
In Biddeford, Me., a city of 21,000 that has had seven pharmacy robberies since December 2009, Roger Beaupre, the police chief, said he was urging the stores to require customers to remove hoods and sunglasses before entering and to consider caging in their pharmacy counters.
Police officers there got free training in how to investigate pharmacy heists last month from Purdue Pharma, the maker of OxyContin. The company also trains pharmacists on how to prevent robberies and what to do should they fall victim to one, said Rick Zenuch, its director of law enforcement liaison and education.
"The very first tip we give them is comply, comply, comply," Mr. Zenuch said. "Do exactly what the suspect wants, to end the encounter as soon as possible."
In Washington State, where more than 100 pharmacy robberies have taken place over the last three years, law enforcement officials say the penalty for second-degree robbery, when the pharmacist may be threatened but no weapon is shown, is too weak. Dan Satterberg, the King County prosecutor, said he had submitted a bill to the Legislature to increase the minimum jail time to three years from three months.
"Word travels fast on the street about what an easy target the pharmacies are and how much profit can be made and what small punishment is attached," Mr. Satterberg said.
OxyContin goes for $1 a milligram on the street, Mr. Satterberg and other law enforcement officials said, and the most popular pill is 80 milligrams.
Many pharmacies in Washington have deterred would-be robbers by putting time-release locks on the safes where they store narcotics and staggering their inventory, Mr. Satterberg said. Perhaps as a result, the number of armed robberies at pharmacies there dropped to 23 in 2010 from 49 in 2008, according to the D.E.A.
Still, Mr. Satterberg said, the threat of robbery has made it difficult for retail chains in the state to recruit enough pharmacists in recent years.
"They feel very vulnerable when so many people are so desperate to get what they keep behind those counters," he said.
In sheer numbers, Florida, Indiana, California, Ohio and Washington have had the most armed robberies of pharmacies since January 2008, according to the D.E.A. But Maine, Oklahoma and Oregon had the sharpest increases last year.
All but a handful of the Maine robberies took place at Rite Aid and CVS stores, some of which were hit multiple times.
In Tulsa, Okla., where pharmacy robberies last year far outpaced bank robberies, the police said the crimes were now more often committed by gangs who want to sell the drugs than addicts in search of a fix. Robbers there often demand Xanax, an anti-anxiety drug, along with opioids, said Sgt. Dave Walker, who runs the robbery unit of the Tulsa Police Department.
In Bingham, a remote town of about 1,000, the men who robbed Mr. Hibbard's pharmacy, E.W. Moore & Son, were caught and sent to prison, as was another robber who held up the store at gunpoint in 2006. But despite that comforting fact and the store's nine surveillance cameras and high-tech alarm system, Mr. Hibbard and his employees still jump when the place is quiet and they hear footsteps coming up the ramp, they said.
"I stood right between him and his knife," said Lori Pratt, a pharmacy technician, referring to one of the robbers. "I was all ready to go on the Internet after it happened and get a Taser gun."
Unlike Mr. Hibbard, Rite Aid has chosen to keep stocking the drugs that are popular with robbers, said Eric Harkreader, a spokesman. But the company now limits the amount of certain drugs in stores at any given time.
"If they are going for lots of quantity at once, we don't want to help them out," he said. "But we certainly want to have the prescription available for all its legitimate purposes."
In Biddeford, a Rite Aid that was robbed twice last year was struck again last week. The suspect, who demanded OxyContin and fled into the night, remains at large.

Texto completo: CHICAGO A mammoth winter storm left dangerously slick roads and frigid Midwestern temperatures in its frozen footprint Thursday, a day after crushing snow-laden buildings in the Northeast.
Three people were killed when the pickup truck they were in drove off a snow-covered Oklahoma interstate and plunged 80 feet into an icy river. Wind chills dipped to nearly 30 below in parts of the nation's midsection as the region began dealing with the storm's aftermath.
Chicago Mayor Richard Daley spoke publicly for the first time to defend his city's handling of the storm, which stranded hundreds of motorists in whiteout conditions on the famous Lake Shore Drive. In a city known for punishing politicians for winter weakness, the retiring Daley said when pressed that he wouldn't have handled anything differently and that workers responded well.
Yes, they did ... They did a very, very good job, Daley said. Lake Shore reopened before dawn Thursday.
Criticism of the city's response to a 1979 blizzard played a major role in Mayor Michael Bilandic's defeat.
The sprawling system unloaded as much as 2 feet of snow across its 2,000-mile path, crippling airports and stranding drivers from Texas to South Dakota, where authorities rescued some motorists from more than 150 vehicles that had become trapped overnight after high winds sent fallen snow drifting onto an interstate in the northeast part of the state. Icy roads were blamed for a 15-vehicle chain-reaction crash in southeastern Louisiana that resulted in a few minor injuries.
Even the sunny Southwest wasn't spared: Freezing temperatures delayed Thursday's opening round of the Phoenix Open in Scottsdale, Ariz., and led to school closures in parts of New Mexico.
A two-man crew looking for trouble spots along New Mexico's snowpacked U.S. 54 rescued a family of four who had been stranded in their upside down car for up to an hour in a 30-foot ravine.
Authorities in northeast Oklahoma said the pickup truck that drove into the Spring River on Thursday jumped a guard rail on Interstate 44 shortly before dawn while carrying eight people.
The vehicle became partially submerged, and harsh weather made rescue attempts difficult.
The ground temperature was 11 degrees below zero, so it would take only a second to become hypothermic in this water and ice, said Lt. George Brown, a spokesman for the Oklahoma Highway Department.
The week's storm had rendered the interstate impassable earlier in the week and the lane in which the pickup was driving had not reopened until late Wednesday. Brown declined to speculate about whether the highway was re-opened prematurely.
In the Northeast, officials had warned homeowners and businesses for days of the dangers of leaving snow piled up on rooftops. As the storm cloaked the region in ice and added inches to the piles of snow already spread across the landscape, the predictions came true. No one was seriously injured, however.
In Middletown, Conn., the entire third floor of a building failed, littering the street with bricks and snapping two trees. A gas station canopy on New York's Long Island collapsed, as did an airplane hangar near Boston, damaging aircraft. Roof cave-ins also were reported in Rhode Island.
Some places in the Northeast that have gotten more snow than they usually get all season are running out of places to put it. In Portland, Maine, the downtown snow-storage area was expected to reach capacity after this week's storm the first time in three years that has happened.
Snow totals in the Northeast hit their peak at several inches in New England, a far cry from the foot or more the region has come to expect with each passing storm in a season full of them. Meanwhile, the Midwest was reeling from the storm's wallop as the system swept eastward.
Chicago's 20.2 inches of snow was the city's third-largest amount on record.
The system was blamed for more than a dozen deaths before Thursday, including a homeless man who burned to death on Long Island as he tried to light cans of cooking fuel and a woman in Oklahoma City who was killed while being pulled behind a truck on a sled that hit a guard rail.
Airport operations slowed to a crawl nationwide, though Chicago aviation officials said operations had resumed Thursday at both the city's major airports. Although there were no initial delays, some cancellations continued. O'Hare Airport reported about 1,000 canceled flights and Midway more than 30.

CHICAGO A mammoth winter storm left dangerously slick roads and frigid Midwestern temperatures in its frozen footprint Thursday, a day after crushing snow-laden buildings in the Northeast.
Three people were killed when the pickup truck they were in drove off a snow-covered Oklahoma interstate and plunged 80 feet into an icy river. Wind chills dipped to nearly 30 below in parts of the nation's midsection as the region began dealing with the storm's aftermath.
Chicago Mayor Richard Daley spoke publicly for the first time to defend his city's handling of the storm, which stranded hundreds of motorists in whiteout conditions on the famous Lake Shore Drive. In a city known for punishing politicians for winter weakness, the retiring Daley said when pressed that he wouldn't have handled anything differently and that workers responded well.
Yes, they did ... They did a very, very good job, Daley said. Lake Shore reopened before dawn Thursday.
Criticism of the city's response to a 1979 blizzard played a major role in Mayor Michael Bilandic's defeat.
The sprawling system unloaded as much as 2 feet of snow across its 2,000-mile path, crippling airports and stranding drivers from Texas to South Dakota, where authorities rescued some motorists from more than 150 vehicles that had become trapped overnight after high winds sent fallen snow drifting onto an interstate in the northeast part of the state. Icy roads were blamed for a 15-vehicle chain-reaction crash in southeastern Louisiana that resulted in a few minor injuries.
Even the sunny Southwest wasn't spared: Freezing temperatures delayed Thursday's opening round of the Phoenix Open in Scottsdale, Ariz., and led to school closures in parts of New Mexico.
A two-man crew looking for trouble spots along New Mexico's snowpacked U.S. 54 rescued a family of four who had been stranded in their upside down car for up to an hour in a 30-foot ravine.
Authorities in northeast Oklahoma said the pickup truck that drove into the Spring River on Thursday jumped a guard rail on Interstate 44 shortly before dawn while carrying eight people.
The vehicle became partially submerged, and harsh weather made rescue attempts difficult.
The ground temperature was 11 degrees below zero, so it would take only a second to become hypothermic in this water and ice, said Lt. George Brown, a spokesman for the Oklahoma Highway Department.
The week's storm had rendered the interstate impassable earlier in the week and the lane in which the pickup was driving had not reopened until late Wednesday. Brown declined to speculate about whether the highway was re-opened prematurely.
In the Northeast, officials had warned homeowners and businesses for days of the dangers of leaving snow piled up on rooftops. As the storm cloaked the region in ice and added inches to the piles of snow already spread across the landscape, the predictions came true. No one was seriously injured, however.
In Middletown, Conn., the entire third floor of a building failed, littering the street with bricks and snapping two trees. A gas station canopy on New York's Long Island collapsed, as did an airplane hangar near Boston, damaging aircraft. Roof cave-ins also were reported in Rhode Island.
Some places in the Northeast that have gotten more snow than they usually get all season are running out of places to put it. In Portland, Maine, the downtown snow-storage area was expected to reach capacity after this week's storm the first time in three years that has happened.
Snow totals in the Northeast hit their peak at several inches in New England, a far cry from the foot or more the region has come to expect with each passing storm in a season full of them. Meanwhile, the Midwest was reeling from the storm's wallop as the system swept eastward.
Chicago's 20.2 inches of snow was the city's third-largest amount on record.
The system was blamed for more than a dozen deaths before Thursday, including a homeless man who burned to death on Long Island as he tried to light cans of cooking fuel and a woman in Oklahoma City who was killed while being pulled behind a truck on a sled that hit a guard rail.
Airport operations slowed to a crawl nationwide, though Chicago aviation officials said operations had resumed Thursday at both the city's major airports. Although there were no initial delays, some cancellations continued. O'Hare Airport reported about 1,000 canceled flights and Midway more than 30.

Texto completo: A CenturyLink customer service representative in Wisconsin recently told a Memphis caller he was surprised that her call came to him. Calls from the South usually go to a call center in the South, he said.
A spokesman for the Internet and cable TV supplier headquartered in Monroe, La., said CenturyLink tries to route callers to centers in their own part of the country so that customers can talk to representatives who speak their own dialects.
It was acknowledgement that 235 years since the Declaration of Independence, Americans from region to region still hold on to their dialects.
A caller from Tennessee may live out in the boondocks, but if he lives in Maine he might be from out in the willywags. If hes from California, he might admit to being out in the tules.
Linguists and customer-service experts said the differences are enough to justify a Dictionary of American Regional English, compiled at the University of Wisconsin. It was published in 1985 and will be updated again this year to help preserve the words that make the South the South or New England New England.
Routing calls to call centers based on area codes is a smart thing, says Bill Ferris, a former head of the Center for the Study of Southern Culture at the University of Mississippi.
People feel more comfortable with another person who shares their dialect. Its kind of like an old pair of shoes that fit well, says Ferris, who became director of the National Endowment for Humanities and now teaches history and folklore at the University of North Carolina. As head of the NEH, Ferris helped fund the Dictionary of American Regional English, a project at the University of Wisconsin.
The dictionarys chief editor, Dr. Joan Hall, says regionalized call centers probably are a good public relations move, because, People feel at home with people who speak the way they do. Hall cites dictionary examples of terms that would be unfamiliar to most outside their own regions.
Some have no definitive origins, like willywags for rural areas in Maine, she says. Others are very specific, like out in the tules.
A tule (pronounced tull-ee) is a reed or rush that grows in wet areas in rural parts of California, she says. So if youre in the tules you are in the boondocks.
People long ago predicted regional English was destined for a kind of homogenized oneness. People from Maine to Mississippi would watch talk-show host Johnny Carson on TV, and everyone would end up talking like someone from Iowa or Nebraska.
It didnt happen. When a Boston company designed an automatic voice response system for Bell South, it programmed the machine with a soothing female voice designed to respond to yes or no answers, including variations from uh-huh to yeah to sure. When it tried the system in the South, the system had to be reprogrammed. The machine didnt recognize the responses yes maam and no maam.
Those regionalisms are just the tip of the iceberg, says Memphis voice and speech coach Michael Hall, who has trained call-center workers, including workers at FedEx. Hall says other factors, such as tonality and hospitality, also play a role in customer service. If you call somebody in New York, those people may seem ruder than all get-out. The Southern callers would seem more hospitable, engaging and polite.
At FedEx, spokeswoman Sally Davenport says the company does not attempt to route calls based on dialects, but it does have customer representatives for those who speak foreign languages. Otherwise, Davenport says, customers tell the company their priority is a rapid response no matter what dialect a person may speak.
At Zappos, another company highly rated for customer service, spokesmen say all customer service calls are handled through a single call center in Las Vegas. Zappos customer loyalty team member Donna Hengen says directing calls based on area codes could involve extra waiting time.
Most of the time when we get a customer who even asks about that, theyre saying theyre just glad to speak to someone who speaks English.
Memphis author Emily Yellin says the concern about accents and dialects is a sign that companies are showing greater sensitivity to customers. Yellin, who wrote the 2009 book Your Call Is (not that) Important to Us, says another response has been a trend to shifting call centers from India to the Philippines.
The way they (Filipinos) speak English and their accent is more aligned with the way Americans speak English because they were occupied by the United States, says Yellin.
Call centers in Latin America and Canada also are growing, she says, as American companies respond to complaints about accents they often cant understand.

Texto completo: He's been called the "master dealmaker" and the "king of cable" - a risk-taking Colorado billionaire who has had a major hand in the way Americans have watched, and paid for, television in recent decades.
Now, thanks to his purchase of about 1 million acres of Maine forestland, John Malone is vying for a new title: the nation's largest individual landowner.
On Tuesday, a company set up by Malone, BBC Land LLC, closed on the sale of about 1 million acres of commercial timberland in far western and far eastern Maine and an additional 23,000 acres in neighboring New Hampshire.
Parties involved in the deal said Mainers will notice little to no change as a result of the massive transaction. Timber harvesting will continue on the land - in fact, likely using the same contractors - and the public will still have free access for recreation.
"John has good plans for it," David Soule, a Wiscasset attorney who handled the sale, said Wednesday. "It's pretty much business as usual and we are going to continue to manage it as good stewards."
So who, exactly, is Maine's newest mega-landowner? And why was he interested in vast swaths of Maine's commercial forests?
While Malone and his wife, Leslie, have owned several properties in Maine for well over a decade, the Colorado businessman is largely a mystery in the Pine Tree State.
Malone grants few interview requests on his business dealings and even fewer on his personal interests. And he has remained tight-lipped about his reasons for the Maine purchase, releasing only a two-line statement after the anticipated sale became public.
"My interest in land conservation is well known and this pending land purchase in Maine will further enhance these efforts," Malone said last week. "I intend to continue the forestry operations consistent with prior practices."
'Do well by doing good'
Malone, 69, definitely fits the label of "media mogul."
A Connecticut native, Malone got involved in cable television in the early 1970s when the industry was still largely in its infancy.
He served as president and CEO of Tele-Communications Inc. from 1973 to 1996, helping TCI grow from a small western outfit to the nation's largest cable company. TCI merged with AT&T in 1999 in a deal valued at more than $40 billion.
Today, Malone serves as chairman of Liberty Media Corp., a company that in many ways epitomizes the diversity of the modern media industry. A partial listing of Liberty Media's interests include: cable channels QVC and Starz, popular websites Expedia.com and Evite.com, the satellite radio subscription service Sirius XM and the Atlanta Braves professional baseball team.
Forbes Magazine ranked Malone No. 110 on the magazine's most recent annual listing of America's 400 richest people, with a personal wealth valued at $3 billion.
In recent years, Malone has invested that wealth in land - and lots of it.
Before the completion of the Maine deal, Malone owned an estimated 1.2 million acres nationwide. That was enough to earn him the No. 5 spot on a list of the largest private landowners in the United States last year, according to The Land Report, a magazine focused on land ownership and management issues.
Most of that acreage was in Colorado and Wyoming, where the Malones have demonstrated an affinity for purchasing - and restoring - historic cattle ranches.
But the Colorado businessman's latest acquisition in Maine could send Malone past another media mogul, Ted Turner, as the nation's top land baron.
"The odds are, when the tabulations are done and this transaction closes, Mr. Malone definitely will be America's largest landowner," Eric O'Keefe, editor of The Land Report, recently told The New York Times.
It's unknown whether the title of U.S. "land king" would matter to Turner and Malone - two friends who actually own neighboring land in New Mexico. But in a rare interview with Bloomberg, Malone said Turner taught him a valuable financial lesson: buy land.
"He has done very well in his land investments," Malone said in the July 2010 interview. "He loves the land. It is sort of a lasting economic asset and if you are charitably minded and you like conservation you sort of can do well by doing good.
Colorado conservationist
In Colorado, Malone was the linchpin in what some describe as one of the most significant land conservation deals in that state's recent history.
Conservationists had been watching with dismay for decades as the suburban sprawl of Denver and Colorado Springs steadily crept closer to one another along the roughly 70-mile stretch of Interstate 25 separating the two cities.
The "jewel" within that corridor was Greenland Ranch: 21,000 acres of undeveloped prairie (except for a historic ranch) and prime wildlife habitat that stretched for eight miles on either side of the interstate.
Groups as well as Colorado Gov. Roy Romer had been working for years to permanently protect Greenland Ranch from the encroaching suburbs. But it was not until Malone paid more than $50 million to purchase 17,000 acres that the goal became a reality.
"The Greenland Ranch acquisition as well as others in that area have effectively prevented Denver and Colorado Springs from growing together," said Sydney Macy, director of The Conservation Fund in Colorado, who was heavily involved in the project. "We clearly would have never gotten it done without John."
Colorado does not have the same tradition of public access on private lands, so the Greenland Ranch property was not open to the public for recreation before or after Malone's purchase, Macy said. Instead, the land is valuable as a "scenic respite" amidst the development for drivers on I-25 as well as for wildlife habitat.
The Malones also have maintained it as a working cattle ranch.
John Swartout, executive director with the Colorado Coalition of Land Trusts, said the Greenland Ranch project is known statewide as one of the biggest conservation successes since the establishment of two national parks. And Malone was a key player.
"He didn't take a lot of credit for what he did," Swartout said. "He did it quietly."
In a 2006 interview with the Denver Post, Malone said he and his wife regard "open land" - and particularly scenic, open near metropolitan areas - as important to a region's heritage.
"I think it's very important that land be preserved, especially for future generations. Once that land gets developed, you can never go back," he said.
As for the couple's decision to maintain their western lands as active cattle ranches, Malone added: "What we didn't want to do is buy a lot of land and unemploy a lot of people."
Land as a business
There are no cattle ranches or open prairies on the 900,000-plus acres of Maine timberland that is now part of Malone's portfolio. Instead, Malone bought expanses of commercial timberland interspersed with lakes and streams, hills and mountains.
But the tracts - located largely in the east in Washington and Hancock counties and in the west in the Rangeley region - support Maine's two top industries: forestry and tourism.
Mike Tetrault, state director of The Nature Conservancy in Maine, said he believes Malone will bring stability and a longer-term management strategy to the land, whose previous owner was the financial investment firm GMO Renewable Resources.
"He is unknown to most of Maine ... but I would say people should be really pleased," Tetrault said. "If you care about public access [for recreation], you should feel good. If you care about ecological management, you should feel good. And if you care about timber supply, you should feel good."
The man who helped broker the deal, Bangor's John Cashwell, retired several years ago after a long career with the forest management firm Seven Islands Land Co. Cashwell could not be reached for comment after the sale, but last week he said Malone's purchase would protect jobs in the woods, in the mills and in tourism.
"It is good for Maine," Cashwell said. "They will be good neighbors and will honor the commitments they have."
Malone is no stranger to Maine, even if his name is new to most Mainers.
He and his wife own several hundred acres in Boothbay, a shipyard in nearby Southport as well as an island in Penobscot Bay. But Malone's interests in Maine became public news more than a decade ago when he purchased all of the land around Spencer Lake outside of Jackman.
Then, in 2002, Malone purchased more than 53,000 acres of the so-called Frontier Forest, commercial timberland located between Jackman and the Quebec border. Those purchases sparked concerns that Malone was gobbling up "kingdom lots" - vast expanses of land that some feared would be closed to the public.
But Malone kept the land open to recreational users and has continued to manage the Frontier Forest for timber.
Peace amid uncertainty
Malone's most recent purchase places him alongside the Irving family as Maine's largest landowners.
Land sales in the order of a million acres would typically prompt a robust discussion about the future of Maine's North Woods and the traditional tug-of-war between advocates for the timber industry and environmentalists.
The uncertainty surrounding Malone and his purchase has created a buzz. Yet Malone seems to have somehow appeased all sides - at least for now.
News that the Colorado businessman bought the land from GMO - and, most importantly, planned to keep the status quo - was welcomed by the Maine Forest Products Council, the Forest Society of Maine, sportsmen and others.
Michael Beardsley, executive director of the Professional Logging Contractors of Maine, said his organization is encouraged by Malone's statement that he intends to "continue the forestry operations consistent with prior practices."
"To be clear, those practices have always involved active harvesting operations," Beardsley wrote in an e-mail on Wednesday. "As long as Mr. Malone is true to his word, this purchase serves to continue the tradition of large landowners whose land is in active forest operations."
Matt Dunlap, interim executive director of the Sportsman's Alliance of Maine, said he and other SAM leaders have yet to speak with Malone's representatives. But Dunlap said Malone's approach to land management in Maine and elsewhere as well as his interest in protecting from development - a major concern for sportsmen - are positive indications.
"His record has been quite good in terms of other projects he has been involved in, and he doesn't appear to be a cut-and-run investor," Dunlap said. The big issues for SAM will be that he maintains access and protects wildlife habitat, he said.
Jonathan Carter, a well-known environmentalist who helped lead the debate over clear-cutting in the 1990s, said he would love for Malone to get together with the likes of conservationist Roxanne Quimby to permanently protect some of his land.
But unlike Quimby, Malone has said he would maintain the land as a working forest. Regardless, Carter said he hopes the Malones are thinking about the "what sort of legacy they want to leave."
"I think, on balance, the evidence suggests that, yes, Malone is a businessman," Carter said. "But he also has a significant affection for Maine and the North Woods and he is going to be a good steward of the land."

Texto completo: A federally funded energy education program that's being phased out amid controversy spent nearly half of its money on salaries, records show.
The Maine Green Energy Alliance used $163,220 to support nine full-time and four part-time employees, as well as an executive director with an annual salary of $80,000.
About half of the staff served as organizers and outreach workers to encourage residents in eight targeted communities to weatherize their homes. Others offered telephone support for residents who were trying to finance and carry out home energy audits or insulation jobs.
Altogether, the alliance spent $355,836 from August through the end of 2010 to schedule 200 energy audits and help complete 50 home retrofits. Facing mounting criticism for the slow progress, the group's board of directors voted last week to finish ongoing work and close by early March.
The alliance had a one-year budget of $1.1 million from the federal Department of Energy. It will turn over its balance - projected to be at least $500,000 after January's expenses are tallied - to Efficiency Maine Trust, a quasi-state agency that oversees the state's weatherization efforts. The alliance also will forfeit an additional $2 million that could have been made available over the next two years.
The alliance's money will fortify a popular and successful program that gives homeowners rebates to offset the cost of insulating their homes. The program has paid out $5.5 million to weatherize 1,700 homes, but the rebate money is nearly exhausted.
As the alliance winds down, the group's executive director and officials with Efficiency Maine Trust are defending what it set out to do.
The alliance was just ramping up, they say, for what was expected to be a long-term education effort to boost the number of weatherized homes in Maine. When it became clear that the effort was slower and more labor-intensive than planned, officials said they acted responsibly to end the program and redirect money to the rebates for homeowners.
"This was intended to be a three-year program," said Seth Murray, the alliance's executive director. "We were trying to learn what was effective."
The Maine Green Energy Alliance operated under a contract with Efficiency Maine Trust. The trust, created by the Legislature, is overseen by an independent board. That arrangement will prompt lawmakers to examine the trust's operations and the spending record of the alliance, said Rep. Stacey Fitts, R-Pittsfield, who co-chairs the committee that handles energy issues.
The role of the alliance came under scrutiny early this week, after an article was published by the Maine Center for Public Interest Reporting. Among other things, it called into question the group's origins and the influence of the Democratic administration of former Gov. John Baldacci.
Fitts said he's less interested in rehashing the politics and history than understanding how the money was spent. A larger issue, he said, is whether Maine lawmakers should have more scrutiny over the trust, which generally is funded through federal grants and utility surcharges and is operating under a three-year plan approved by the Legislature.
"My specific concern is how free people are with federal money, and how easy it is for that money to be lost in the shuffle," Fitts said.
This hard winter and rising petroleum prices are underscoring Maine's vulnerability to high energy costs. Most of the state's homes are poorly insulated, and seven out of 10 heat with oil.
The nonprofit Maine Green Energy Alliance was set up as a new approach to tackling the problem. The idea was to partner with municipal leaders, civic groups and concerned citizens to upgrade energy efficiency, town by town.
The alliance began work in August. It focused on communities that had adopted a new funding mechanism for energy improvements, Property Assessed Clean Energy, in which loans are paid back through property taxes. The first six communities to sign on are Old Town, Hampden, Yarmouth, Scarborough, Cumberland and Belfast. Topsham and Buckfield are set to consider PACE at town meetings.
To drum up interest, alliance workers held community meetings in town halls and libraries. They canvassed door-to-door and did surveys. They helped organize "warm neighbor parties," at which residents who had their homes insulated could invite family members and friends to see the work and learn about the benefits.
The outreach workers earned $30,000 to $40,000 a year, plus benefits. Homeowner coaches, who worked the phones, were paid $15 an hour.
Aside from salaries, the alliance spent $81,688 on outreach expenses, such as mailers, advertising and travel, according to a summary of invoices provided by Murray, the executive director. It spent $72,768 on consulting, accounting and legal expenses.
Most of the $47,635 in legal expenses went to the Hallowell law firm of Tom Federle, a former legal counsel for Baldacci who founded the alliance and orchestrated PACE's enabling legislation. The rest of the money, $35,340, went for office expenses.
The alliance had an eight-month plan to see which community efforts were successful in encouraging residents to retrofit their homes. The most effective formulas were to be rolled out in dozens of towns.
But as the alliance worked to gain momentum, the homeowner rebate program run by Efficiency Maine Trust was experiencing intense demand and running out of money. The money earmarked for the alliance already had caused resentment among the staff of Efficiency Maine Trust. Under the contract, the trust could have given the alliance another $2 million to operate for two more years.
But it had become clear that the alliance wasn't making sufficient progress to justify that support, said Michael Stoddard, the trust's executive director. It also was apparent that his board would have to announce, after a meeting that had been set for Wednesday, that the rebate money was almost gone. That put pressure on the alliance to pull the plug at its own board meeting last week.
Despite the internal tension, Stoddard said he feels the alliance acted responsibly. Its mission was to educate people about the benefits of insulating their homes, after the federally funded rebate money is gone.
The experience is raising questions about whether Mainers really need government-funded organizers to encourage them to weatherize their homes. "At this stage, clearly, there are enough people who don't," Stoddard said.
Efficiency Maine Trust was envisioned to help maintain a consistent effort to cut the state's dependence on oil over time. But the trust was formed and funded under a Democratic-controlled administration and Legislature. Gov. Paul LePage and the Legislature's new Republican majority aren't expected to be as supportive of the agency, and the Maine Green Energy Alliance episode won't help.
Adam Lee, the businessman who chairs Efficiency Maine Trust's board, said he expects that he and Stoddard will be called before Fitts and the Legislature's energy committee for an explanation. But Lee insisted that a close examination of events will show the agency's intentions were good and its actions were proper.
"I would not blame them for asking questions, but this is an example of people trying to do the right thing," Lee said. "We tried it for five months, then we made the right decisions."

Texto completo:   PORTLAND, Maine - In Europe, countries are consumed by debt. In Washington, the health care debate rages on. And in Maine, the whoopie pie is under attack.
Efforts to anoint the traditional Maine sweet as the official state dessert have divided Down Easters and raised ire among the nutrition-conscious, who say that the state is beset with obesity as it is without venerating two mounds of chocolate cake bound by a sugary, creamy filling. And now another renowned Maine treat - the blueberry pie - has been dragged into the fray.
The kitchen kerfuffle comes as a surprise to whoopie pie makers, who handed out dozens of the cakey treats to lawmakers at a legislative hearing on the matter this week and testified to the virtue of the confection as a local economic engine and beloved part of Maine's heritage for decades.
But the whoopie pie's swift ascension to the official Maine dessert hit a snag when state Representative Donald Pilon withheld support and derided the confection as a "frosting delivery vehicle."
"At a time when 31.3 percent of Maine's children are considered overweight or obese, do we want to glorify a dessert that lists lard as its primary ingredient?" Pilon asked his fellow lawmakers at the hearing on Monday.
Instead, Pilon suggested what he sees as a healthier alternative: wild blueberry pie.
Fourth graders from a Maine elementary school are also challenging whoopie pies on several grounds. In a letter to the legislative committee, they maintained that the whoopie is a snack, not a dessert. They also recommended using Maine's native blueberries (a $250 million industry) in an official state dessert because they are more nutritious.
Suddenly, the Wild Blueberry Commission of Maine finds itself in a food fight. David Bell, executive director of the blueberry commission, has tried to strike a compromise: appoint blueberry pie the official state pie.
"We're very happy to be the state berry, a designation we've had for 20 years. We're not asking to be the state dessert. We weren't interested in creating a food fight," Bell said. "But if lawmakers want to recognize us, we'd gladly accept the honor of wild blueberry pie being the state pie."
Amos Orcutt, president of the Maine Whoopie Pie Association, which represents about 60 local whoopie pie makers who sell the confections in gas stations, supermarkets, bakeries, and farm stands, noted that the crust of a wild blueberry pie is not exactly nutritious. He also pointed out that whoopie pies come in blueberry flavor for those who want their antioxidants.
Nonetheless, Orcutt feels it is urgent to move ahead on the whoopie pie bill in order to fend off a possible bid by Pennsylvania to take ownership of the whoopie pie. (There are some who say the Amish created the confection.) The designation as official dessert has a certain cachet, the association says, and offers unique marketing opportunities to draw more tourists to Maine.
"I want to make sure we claim our rightful heritage," said Orcutt, who traces the state's whoopie pies to Labadie's Bakery in Lewiston, a third-generation bakery that has been making them since 1925. "Pennsylvania feels threatened."
Indeed, the editorial board of the Patriot-News in Central Pennsylvania recently urged the state's new governor, Tom Corbett, to take up the issue as one of his first causes.
"Few foods are considered more Pennsylvania-centric than whoopie pies and yet Maine is moving forward with plans to make our cakey, sugary treat the official state dessert," the Patriot-News said. "This makes no sense since [Maine] already has the market cornered on lobster pie and blueberry pie."
Maine whoopie pie aficionados are standing their ground. Not only do they lay claim to invention of the treat; some bakers, like Carol Ford of Cranberry Island Kitchen, are even taking credit for increasing the popularity of the gourmet whoopie nationwide. Ford and her business partner Karen Haase say they have raised the whoopie's profile with their clam- and mussel-shaped pies, made with Maine butter and pure Maine spring water.
The coastal bakery has received accolades from Martha Stewart, scored a major contract with merchant Williams-Sonoma, and recently beat Food Network star Bobby Flay in a Whoopie Pie Throwdown.
"Whoopie pies have become part of why people come to Maine. The ocean is definitely a bigger draw, but whoopie pies are definitely a little economic engine," Ford said. "And Maine can use every economic engine it can get."
Without an immediate resolution in sight, Maine lawmakers agreed to resume debate Wednesday at the state capital in Augusta, and a vote may take place. Pilon, the vocal dissenter, said friends around the country, including constituents in Maine, have applauded his opposition to the whoopie. He plans to spend the days before the hearing researching another technicality which may disqualify the whoopie - how the concoction is taxed.
"If they are taxing it as a snack, then it's not even a dessert," Pilon said. "Then the whole issue is moot and the blueberry pie wins."

Texto completo: CHICAGO A winter weather colossus roared into the nation's heartland Tuesday, laying down a paralyzing punch of dangerous ice and whiteout snow that served notice from Texas to Maine that the storm billed as the worst in decades could live up to the hype.
Ice-covered streets were deserted in Super Bowl host city Dallas. Whiteouts shut down Oklahoma City and Tulsa. And more was on the way. Chicago expected 2 feet of snow, Indianapolis an inch of ice, and the Northeast still more ice and snow in what's shaping up to be a record winter for the region.
The system that stretched more than 2,000 miles across a third of the country promised to leave in its aftermath a chilly cloak of teeth-chattering cold, with temperatures in the single digits or lower.
Winds topped 60 mph in Texas. The newspaper in Tulsa, Okla., canceled its print edition for the first time in more than a century. In Chicago, public schools called a snow day for the first time in 12 years, and both major airports gave up on flying until at least Wednesday afternoon.
The high winds also had Chicago officials contemplating steps they haven't taken in years starting with closing the city's busy and iconic Lake Shore Drive because of the threat that high winds could produce 25-foot waves in nearby Lake Michigan.
Everyone should brace for a storm that will be remembered for a long time, said Jose Santiago, executive director of the city's office of emergency management.
Advice to stay home was followed widely. Thousands of office workers in Chicago's famous downtown Loop district left early to avoid any transit troubles. Pete Donaghue, a 49-year-old commodity trader, missed an early train before catching a 2:35 p.m. ride to suburban Wilmette.
Big mistake, he said. I'd be home right now, with my feet up, clicker in hand.
At the city's elegant apartment buildings closest to Lake Michigan, employees weren't fazed by the storm, but they kept an eye on the lakefront nonetheless. The wind was strong enough outside one building's lobby to send the heavy revolving door spinning by itself.
In Missouri, more than a foot of snow had fallen by midday, with no end in sight. For the first time in history, the state of Missouri shut down Interstate 70 between St. Louis and Kansas City due to a winter storm.
The roads are just pure white. There's no traffic. Nothing, said Kristi Strait, who was working at Clinton Discount Building Materials in Clinton, Mo.
Meteorologist Jeff Johnson of the National Weather Service in Des Moines said the storm was sure to cripple transportation for a couple of days. The snow and the wind were a dangerous combination, even in areas where not that much snow was expected.
You don't want to get caught out in the rural areas in your vehicle in this storm. It's a good night to stay home, he said.
The storm was so bad in Polk County, 200 miles west of St. Louis, that emergency officials requested help from the National Guard because local officials did not have enough vehicles to get the elderly and shut-ins to shelter if the power went out.
In state capitols across the Midwest and East, lawmakers cut short their workweek because of the storm. Normally bustling downtown streets were quiet, too. And many stores were closed, with signs on the windows blaming the weather.
Others didn't let the weather keep them from work. The bakery Chez Monet in downtown Jefferson City was open, adding hot oatmeal for chilled customers. Owner Joan Fairfax said she drove to work without trouble. She wasn't sure about her ride home, but said she could walk if necessary.
I have never missed a day of work because of weather in 20 years, said Fairfax, 54.
The leading edge of the storm slammed first into Texas and Oklahoma after moving out of the Rockies. The blizzard halted production of the print edition of Wednesday's Tulsa World, marking the first time in the paper's nearly 106-year history that is has not published an edition.
Both of Oklahoma's major airports were closed. Outside Tulsa, at the Hard Rock Casino, the snow caused the partial collapse of a roof, but no injuries were reported.
In Texas, thousands of people lost electricity during the frigid conditions. Utility company Oncor reported nearly 27,000 customers without power statewide, with nearly half of the outages in the Dallas-Fort Worth area.
St. Louis-based AmerenUE had 1,100 linemen on standby, some borrowed from companies in other states. Six trailers stocked with wire, replacement lines and other supplies were dispatched to possible trouble spots.
Few immediate outages were reported. But Chip Webb, Ameren's superintendent of reliability support services, expected that to change.
There is ice on the lines, and it could be there for days, Webb said.
For those who insisted on braving the elements, the risks were many. If you don't have enough fuel in your vehicle, you can run out, the heat goes out and people can even freeze to death, said Greg Cohen, executive director of the Roadway Safety Foundation.
The storm was expected to roll into the Northeast on Wednesday, bringing still more snow to a winter-weary region. Towns that have been hit by several blizzards since December feared they wouldn't have anywhere to put more snow.
Ice-coated roads were nearly empty in Dallas, where the few motorists who braved the unfamiliar terrain slowed to a crawl as they passed jack-knifed tractor-trailers on slick highways. The NFL managed to stick to its Super Bowl schedule, holding media activities at Cowboys Stadium in suburban Arlington as planned.
Green Bay Packers fans Dieter Sturm and Mark Madson postponed plans to drive from Wisconsin to the Super Bowl in a Cadillac convertible, but said they planned to leave Wednesday morning if possible.
We love driving in the snow, said Sturm, who works making snow for movies and commercials. We love having the snow fall on top of us. We're from Wisconsin. We can handle that without a problem. The icy roads are another story.
The pair said they have personal heating systems, including clothes dryer hoses laced inside their jackets that rest beneath their chins to keep their faces from freezing solid, Sturm said.
In Ryan Stratton's house in the northern Oklahoma town of Bartlesville, nine children and nine adults crowded together to play video games, at least as long as the electricity stayed on.
The area tends to lose electricity in storms, Stratton said, and that's one reason he invited two other families to join him while waiting for this one to pass. They prepared by stocking up on propane and food, but a power outage would cut out some of the fun.
We've got Rock Band, a PlayStation 3 in one room, a Wii in another, an old PS2 in another, Stratton said. And we've got cable. ... It's a good chaos today.

Winds topped 60 mph in Texas. The newspaper in Tulsa, Okla., canceled its print edition for the first time in more than a century. In Chicago, public schools called a snow day for the first time in 12 years, and both major airports gave up on flying until at least Wednesday afternoon.
The high winds also had Chicago officials contemplating steps they haven't taken in years starting with closing the city's busy and iconic Lake Shore Drive because of the threat that high winds could produce 25-foot waves in nearby Lake Michigan.
Everyone should brace for a storm that will be remembered for a long time, said Jose Santiago, executive director of the city's office of emergency management.
Advice to stay home was followed widely. Thousands of office workers in Chicago's famous downtown Loop district left early to avoid any transit troubles. Pete Donaghue, a 49-year-old commodity trader, missed an early train before catching a 2:35 p.m. ride to suburban Wilmette.
Big mistake, he said. I'd be home right now, with my feet up, clicker in hand.
At the city's elegant apartment buildings closest to Lake Michigan, employees weren't fazed by the storm, but they kept an eye on the lakefront nonetheless. The wind was strong enough outside one building's lobby to send the heavy revolving door spinning by itself.
In Missouri, more than a foot of snow had fallen by midday, with no end in sight. For the first time in history, the state of Missouri shut down Interstate 70 between St. Louis and Kansas City due to a winter storm.
The roads are just pure white. There's no traffic. Nothing, said Kristi Strait, who was working at Clinton Discount Building Materials in Clinton, Mo.
Meteorologist Jeff Johnson of the National Weather Service in Des Moines said the storm was sure to cripple transportation for a couple of days. The snow and the wind were a dangerous combination, even in areas where not that much snow was expected.
You don't want to get caught out in the rural areas in your vehicle in this storm. It's a good night to stay home, he said.
The storm was so bad in Polk County, 200 miles west of St. Louis, that emergency officials requested help from the National Guard because local officials did not have enough vehicles to get the elderly and shut-ins to shelter if the power went out.
In state capitols across the Midwest and East, lawmakers cut short their workweek because of the storm. Normally bustling downtown streets were quiet, too. And many stores were closed, with signs on the windows blaming the weather.
Others didn't let the weather keep them from work. The bakery Chez Monet in downtown Jefferson City was open, adding hot oatmeal for chilled customers. Owner Joan Fairfax said she drove to work without trouble. She wasn't sure about her ride home, but said she could walk if necessary.
I have never missed a day of work because of weather in 20 years, said Fairfax, 54.
The leading edge of the storm slammed first into Texas and Oklahoma after moving out of the Rockies. The blizzard halted production of the print edition of Wednesday's Tulsa World, marking the first time in the paper's nearly 106-year history that is has not published an edition.
Both of Oklahoma's major airports were closed. Outside Tulsa, at the Hard Rock Casino, the snow caused the partial collapse of a roof, but no injuries were reported.
In Texas, thousands of people lost electricity during the frigid conditions. Utility company Oncor reported nearly 27,000 customers without power statewide, with nearly half of the outages in the Dallas-Fort Worth area.
St. Louis-based AmerenUE had 1,100 linemen on standby, some borrowed from companies in other states. Six trailers stocked with wire, replacement lines and other supplies were dispatched to possible trouble spots.
Few immediate outages were reported. But Chip Webb, Ameren's superintendent of reliability support services, expected that to change.
There is ice on the lines, and it could be there for days, Webb said.
For those who insisted on braving the elements, the risks were many. If you don't have enough fuel in your vehicle, you can run out, the heat goes out and people can even freeze to death, said Greg Cohen, executive director of the Roadway Safety Foundation.
The storm was expected to roll into the Northeast on Wednesday, bringing still more snow to a winter-weary region. Towns that have been hit by several blizzards since December feared they wouldn't have anywhere to put more snow.
Ice-coated roads were nearly empty in Dallas, where the few motorists who braved the unfamiliar terrain slowed to a crawl as they passed jack-knifed tractor-trailers on slick highways. The NFL managed to stick to its Super Bowl schedule, holding media activities at Cowboys Stadium in suburban Arlington as planned.
Green Bay Packers fans Dieter Sturm and Mark Madson postponed plans to drive from Wisconsin to the Super Bowl in a Cadillac convertible, but said they planned to leave Wednesday morning if possible.
We love driving in the snow, said Sturm, who works making snow for movies and commercials. We love having the snow fall on top of us. We're from Wisconsin. We can handle that without a problem. The icy roads are another story.
The pair said they have personal heating systems, including clothes dryer hoses laced inside their jackets that rest beneath their chins to keep their faces from freezing solid, Sturm said.
In Ryan Stratton's house in the northern Oklahoma town of Bartlesville, nine children and nine adults crowded together to play video games, at least as long as the electricity stayed on.
The area tends to lose electricity in storms, Stratton said, and that's one reason he invited two other families to join him while waiting for this one to pass. They prepared by stocking up on propane and food, but a power outage would cut out some of the fun.
We've got Rock Band, a PlayStation 3 in one room, a Wii in another, an old PS2 in another, Stratton said. And we've got cable. ... It's a good chaos today.

Texto completo: HOUSTON A U.S. Customs and Border Protection agent appeared in a Maine courtroom on Tuesday to hear charges alleging he lied to investigators over his role in a 2005 incident along Texas' border with Mexico in which a would-be illegal immigrant drowned.
James Peters, 41, was arrested Tuesday in Houlton, Maine, where he is now stationed. He made an initial appearance in a Bangor, Maine, courtroom on a federal indictment charging him with four counts of making false statements to an investigator. A judge allowed Peters to be released on his own recognizance and set his next court date for Feb. 15 in Houston, where he will be tried.
A Houston grand jury handed up the indictment last month, but the indictment wasn't unsealed until Tuesday, after Peters' arrest.
Prosecutors accuse Peters of lying about what led up to the Dec. 14, 2005, drowning death of Carlos Delgadillo Martinez, a Mexican national who was trying to illegally cross into the U.S. with another person on inner tubes near the international bridge in Laredo.
Prosecutors contend that Peters deliberately flew his helicopter too close to the pair in an attempt to force them back to Mexico using the turbulence from his chopper. They say Delgadillo lost contact with the inner tube he was holding, and that he drowned.
A federal public defender who represented Peters at his court appearance Tuesday did not immediately return a call seeking comment.
If convicted, Peters faces up to five years in prison. He has worked for Homeland Security since 1997, becoming a helicopter pilot in 2003.
A spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorneys' Office in Houston did not immediately return a call on why prosecutors charged him with making false statements, as opposed to a more serious charge.
According to the indictment, Border Patrol agents saw the helicopter hover at a low altitude over the individuals, coming close to the bridge.
Internal radio transmissions indicate Peters told an agent he was going to try to make the individuals go back, according to the indictment.
A Border Patrol agent told investigators the force of the air turbulence from the low flying helicopter's rotor made Delgadillo lose his grip on the flotation device. The body of the Mexican citizen was found later that day near the bridge.
When questioned about the incident, Peters told an agent investigating the drowning death that he hadn't come across any illegal immigrants near the bridge, that he never hovered over the immigrants at a low altitude and he had never brought his helicopter to the level of the bridge or below it because of dangers associated with flying at such a low altitude in that area.
But a video from a Border Patrol pole camera as well as the helicopter's internal records showed Peters' aircraft was hovering over the river near the bridge at the time the two individuals were in the river, according to the indictment.

Texto completo: Some have called it evil, onerous, a builder's nightmare, while others have praised the state's new Uniform Building and Energy Code for bringing consistency to building regulations in the state.
LD 2257, which was enacted by the Legislature a few years ago with a delayed implementation, was designed to streamline code administration, to bring more consistency to builders, developers and towns and to improve energy conservation in the housing stock, according to Dick Dolby, acting director of the state's Building Codes and Standards in the Department of Public Safety.
"We're losing on an average 20 percent of the heat of our houses through unheated foundations," Dolby said recently. Under the new code, all foundations must be insulated.
Improvements such as this that are outlined in the code will cost more upfront but will provide savings over the long term, he said. "A lot of people don't want to hear that."
Under the law, communities with more than 2,000 residents that have a building code had to start enforcing the new state code on Dec. 1. The state building code requires builders to hire certified third-party inspectors to conduct inspections unless a municipality voluntarily has chosen to have a certified municipal building inspector do the work.
Smaller communities with fewer than 2,000 residents that don't have a building code have until July 1, 2012, to enforce the code, according to Dolby. There is no mandatory enforcement for the new code in the 330 towns with fewer than 2,000 people, but the code is law and remains in effect for all, he said.
That is, unless one of several pieces of proposed legislation is adopted. Sen. Mike Thibodeau, R-Winterport, has proposed a bill that would repeal the law adopting the code. Another piece of proposed legislation would exempt seasonally restricted cottages from the code, and still another being proposed by Rep. Paul Davis, R-Sangerville, would relax the code.
"I struggle with telling people how they have to build their homes, particularly in rural Maine," Thibodeau said Friday. "That's a decision that has or hasn't been made by our rural communities for a long time, and many communities aren't comfortable with that."
Thibodeau said many residents, builders and municipal officials in Waldo County - the area he represents - are "pretty upset" with the "onerous" new bill and urged him to take some action.
Milo's Jeff Gahagan said changes are needed in the law, which he called "pure evil." The town manager said small towns exist with part-time code enforcement officers and planning boards that don't have a lot of experience or funds for planning.
"It is a hardship for towns," Gahagan said recently. "The thing that frustrates me is whoever puts in for a building permit now has the added expense of hiring a third party inspector" to ensure the building is compliant with the code. He believes that residents, many of whom do their own home improvement work, will find it cumbersome and too costly under the new code. That work will be abandoned, leaving more blighted properties in the community, he believes.
Dan Wellington, Bangor's code enforcement officer, believes people want more sustainable buildings. "We've been a model code community for 40 years, and it has had a significant impact on the reduction of fire, structural failure and sustainability. It's gone a long ways to making Bangor a livable community," he said.
Wellington said city officials have vowed to build buildings that are sustainable.
While he praised former Gov. John Baldacci's committee that developed the new code, Wellington suggested the implementation of the new code was a little rushed.
Thibodeau also believed the state rushed to adopt the codes since fewer than 60 people in the state are qualified to do the inspections.
Keith Doore of Dover-Foxcroft, a builder and a code enforcement officer for three communities who intends to take the inspection training, said Saturday he supported the new code.
"Anyone doing their job the way they should be won't have any issue," he said. "The consumer will get a better product, but it will cost more money."
Probably the largest effect of the code change is going to be for the residential building, Dolby said.
That's what bothers Gagahan.
"I think that the code as it is right now has gone a bit too far, and they need to try to make it more reasonable," he said. "I understand the whole idea of the code, but it's a bit too stringent."
Thibodeau agrees. "There's nothing wrong with having a model code, but not a mandatory code," he said.

Texto completo: The inability of two southern Maine oil dealers to serve their customers during the recent cold snap isn't tied to larger industry issues, the treasurer of the Maine Energy Marketers Association said Friday.
Rather, the closure of Thibeault Energy in Brunswick and delivery backlogs at Yorkie Oil in Scarborough seem tied to specific business problems, said John Peters, president of Downeast Energy in Brunswick.
"There's no shortage of propane or fuel oil," he said.
The industry's health is important because oil helps warm seven out of 10 homes in Maine. Peters' comments came following a week in which snow and unusually cold weather have been testing the ability of oil dealers to keep up with demand, and as rising prices have been taxing the ability of customers to pay for fuel.
The average statewide price for heating oil has hit $3.23 a gallon, up a nickel from a week ago and up 29 cents since late December.
These market conditions were further complicated over the past week with the closing of Thibeault Energy, a family-run oil dealer.
Media reports indicated that the 84-year-old company had been struggling financially, and a message on the company's answering machine confirmed the company was closing.
"We appreciate the customer support. ... The reason we are closing is beyond our control," said a woman on the recording.
In recent days, some Yorkie Oil customers complained of delivery delays and others said promised deliveries never arrived, sparking concerns that another Maine oil company might fold.
Yorkie Oil owner Mike Maietta told local media Thursday that the delays were due to high oil demand and the recent string of snowstorms, as well as staffing problems.
Both companies are members of the Maine Energy Marketers Association, which represents roughly 300 dealers in the state.
News coverage has led some customers to worry about their oil contracts, and to speculate that rising prices may be behind the problems at Thibeault and Yorkie. Peters dismissed that speculation.
State law requires oil dealers to secure at least 75 percent of the fuel oil or propane supply they sell to customers in a pre-buy contract.
That means they must either buy the fuel and store it, or purchase futures contracts on the New York Mercantile Exchange that lock in fuel at a specific price.
Consumers can help protect themselves by making sure their contracts with oil dealers state that they have access to the oil, Peters said. At Downeast, he said, the company's policy is to buy fuel before selling it, and disclosing in its contract with customers that it has the product.
Peters stressed that he hasn't spoken to Thibeault's owners, but said it was his understanding that the company lost bank financing and the working capital to run the business.
Downeast, one of the state's largest dealers, found itself involved in the Thibeault closure when Thibeault customers who couldn't get fuel in subzero temperatures began calling other companies for help.
Working capital is always an issue for oil dealers in the winter. While some have the resources to get their oil supplies on credit, most smaller companies pay cash at the terminals. They then need to get the money from consumers, and when the economy is bad and people are late on payments, it creates a credit squeeze for oil dealers.
At the same time, a broken truck or a sick driver can reduce a small dealer's ability to perform during a delivery crunch, Peters said.
"You have to have the capacity when the weather's cold to serve the customer," Peters said.

Texto completo: MONTPELIER, Vt. Train equipment froze, cars sputtered, schools canceled classes and cold-weather enthusiasts opted to stay inside Monday as a bitter blast of below-zero temperatures gripped the Northeast.
The gasp-inducing cold temperatures reached into the minus-30s with wind chill factors even colder tested the mettle even of New Englanders, who pride themselves on winter hardiness.
Snot-freezing cold, was how Kelly Walsh, 28, described it, walking home from an auto-parts store in Vermont's capital after buying a new battery for her car, which wouldn't start Monday morning.
It was minus 21 there at 7 a.m.
I usually really like it, she said. Today is a bit of nuisance.
Schools in western and northeastern Pennsylvania, across upstate New York and in parts of Vermont and New Hampshire closed their doors or delayed openings.
Amtrak suspended service between Albany and New York City, saying the extreme cold affected signals and switches.
It hoped to resume service today the same day the cold was expected to ease but begin to give way to a potentially huge snowstorm.
It takes your breath away if you're not ready for it, said Dan Giroux, shop tech at Northern Outfitters snowmobile rentals in Greenville, Maine, where the fleet was mostly idle because it was too cold for most folks.
In New York, the city doubled the number of outreach vans it sends out looking for homeless people in such cold, checking on street people every two hours.
Our priority is to make sure they're safe and warm, said Seth Diamond, commissioner of the New York City's Department of Homeless Services.
In Providence, R.I., it dipped to minus 1 early Monday, the first below-zero reading there in six years, the National Weather Service said.
Even hat-shy teenagers were taking precautions.
It's hard to get teenagers to bundle up, but even they're putting on their hats this morning, said Tim Scott, director of development at Fryeburg Academy, in Fryeburg, Maine, where it hit minus 28.
In Lebanon, N.H., a homeowner thawing frozen pipes with a torch in the basement set an 11-unit apartment building on fire. It was minus 20 Monday morning when the torch set the fire, which spread quickly.
No injuries were reported, but several pets were missing.
Further south in Massachusetts, Cape Cod and neighboring islands were the warmest areas, at 17 degrees, National Weather Service meteorologist Eleanor Vallier-Talbot said.
Skiers said no thanks at some resorts. At Maine's Sugarloaf, where a ski lift recently failed in windy weather and sent some riders to the hospital, the combination of cold and wind caused operators to shut down lifts to the summit.
Four lower lifts were still running, however.
Others took it in stride.
It's a winter day in Maine, said Maude Gardner, of Allagash, in the northern part of the state, shrugging off a minus-24 reading Monday.
After all, it was nothing compared to a minus-46 reading in January 2009.

Texto completo:   As we embark upon a New Year and recover from our third snowstorm this winter, we're asking North Carolinians to make a resolution that could save their lives: resolve to be ready for disasters.
It only takes a few simple steps and it starts with making a family emergency communications plan. How would you get in touch with your loved ones if you had to evacuate in an emergency? What should you have in your disaster kit?
Why are these questions so important? There were 19 named storms during the 2010 hurricane season, including 12 hurricanes. Two of those storms affected North Carolina. In early September, Hurricane Earl threatened to pound the East Coast from North Carolina to Maine, presenting one of the most dangerous hurricane threats to the region in years. One month later, 15 counties in eastern North Carolina endured severe flooding as the remnants of Tropical Storm Nicole moved up the East Coast.
In both incidents FEMA deployed food, water and personnel days in advance to work with our state partners and ensure they had the support they needed. After the flooding, North Carolina Emergency Management and FEMA worked with flood survivors throughout the fall to help them recover and rebuild their lives.
But it's not just hurricanes that threaten North Carolina. As we've seen in the past month, snow and ice storms can be just as treacherous. Lightning, thunderstorms and tornadoes are very real dangers in our state, as well. Just ask the hundreds of families and business owners that were affected by tornadoes that swept through Catawba, Davidson, Guilford, Hoke and Lincoln counties in 2010.
We can all be thankful we didn't experience more damage than we did last year. But that is no guarantee that 2011 will be as lucky.
What can you do? It's important for the public, not just the North Carolina Division of Emergency Management and FEMA, to be prepared for any type of hazard. When a disaster first strikes, it's going to be neighbors helping neighbors. You are our nation's most valuable resource in a disaster, and being able to sustain yourself and your family during the first 72 hours after a disaster will help us focus our responders and critical resources on vulnerable populations that truly need assistance.
Whether it is being ready to sustain your family following power outages from an ice storm, or prepared to evacuate to escape a hurricane, we are counting on you to do your part. So, if you haven't yet taken the steps to be prepared for emergencies, please take some time this month and visit www.ready.gov or www.listo.gov (with information available in 13 languages) and resolve to be ready for disasters in 2011.

Texto completo: VERO BEACH While the frogs are taking over Fellsmere on Sunday, lobster will be the crustacean of choice at the Treasure Coast Rotary Club's inaugural Lobster Classic.
The event takes place from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. Sunday on Ocean Drive, in front of Humiston Park in Vero Beach.
According to Michelle Riordan, the lobster festival includes food, fun and entertainment for the entire family.
The Rotary Club was looking for a fundraising opportunity and decided to think big, Riordan said. There was an opening in the market for this type of festival and the club thought this would be a good way to raise money for its charities.
A $35 ticket to the event includes a full lobster dinner cooked by chef David Rodriquez, formerly from Costa d' Este Resort, and includes a 1-pound Maine lobster, corn on the cob, coleslaw, red potatoes, bread and a soda. Beer and wine also will be sold.
A lobster bisque cook-off between chefs also will take place during the day, with proceeds benefiting local charities. Six bisques will be available for sampling for a $10 fee, and a People's Choice favorite will be announced at the end of the festival.
Local chef Claudette Hebert of Vero Beach has been preparing her bisque for days, even creating the lobster stock from scratch.
It's basically a four-day process, said Hebert, who is originally from Maine. I'm following a recipe I found in the Julia Child cookbook and it takes a long time. It's not something you can throw in a pan and it's done.
Hebert said she attended the Culinary Institute of America in Hyde Park and has worked as a personal chef.
I'm really excited about the cook-off, she said. I was so happy that the Rotary Club asked me to participate, but I told them the only way I would do participate would be if I could make the bisque from scratch.
Most restaurants buy the soup base already made, but I've made mine right from lobsters.
Riordan said she hopes the weather will be beautiful for a stroll along Ocean Drive. The quality will be high and it will be a great way to spend a Sunday.

Texto completo:   By Mike McWilliams
take5 correspondent
ASHEVILLE -- There are only a few states where Aaron "Woody" Wood hasn't played in his more than two-decade music career.
And with his first solo, full-length album due out this spring, guitarist and singer Wood hopes to finally play shows in the Dakotas, Maine, Hawaii and Alaska, and beyond.
"I want to play in all the states in America and every European country that I can possibly visit, and places like Japan, India and China," Wood said. "I want to make music to play all over the world, and the trick is not whether you make that happen, but that that is your impetus and that's what feeds you."
Wood, 37, an Iredell County native, is one of most well-known and revered players on the local music scene today. Although he spends a lot of time playing on the road, he's settled into a house gig at the Lexington Avenue Brewery, where he plays every Wednesday night.
The LAB gig, which Wood's been doing since last March, is something he looks forward to when coming home.
"It is basically the only restaurant where I've played a weekly gig ... where they're like, 'dude, do your thing,'" Wood said. "So I appreciate that. I'm really glad to have it, and it's been basically my only Asheville gig."
Besides touring, Wood has been keeping busy at Asheville's renowned Echo Mountain Recording Studio, where he cut an album. The record, which Wood thinks he might call "Night and Day," will feature 11 tracks, with some local talent lending a hand, including Artimus Pyle, Ryan Burns, Tony Black and Mike Rhodes.
"Obviously, it ain't the best album in the world, and obviously, I'm not the best singer/songwriter or guitar player in the world, but I actually enjoy listening to it," Wood said. "That's not me patting myself on the back; it's like wow, these people came in and not only pulled their weight, but really shined on this album."
At the urging of his manager, Jessica Tomasin, Wood used the Kickstarter fundraising website to help cover recording and production costs for the album. The site raised more than $9,000 in pledges from folks all over the United States and overseas.
"The way people went to bat and the way lots of fans spread the word and talked about it, it's really remarkable," Wood said. "I wouldn't be sitting here talking about an album if not for Kickstarter and all the other people who helped out."
"Night and Day," refers to recent changes in Wood's personal life. The overall tone of the album, he said, is dark and brooding.
"When I started writing some of the songs that are going to be on the album, my life in a lot of personal ways is completely different now," Wood said. "I was living this one way and for reasons I see, but don't quite understand, my life is heading another way. I thought about calling it "Night and Day" because everything is very well balanced out."
With the new album, Wood hopes it affords him opportunities to spend as much time as he wants playing in other cities, without cutting his home ties to Asheville.
"I just feel like for any musician, whether it be me or anyone, you have to get out in the world," Wood said. "I want to put out the music that I want to in a way that pleases me. If you do otherwise, you will fall on your face."
Sean Lallouz caught Wood's show at the LAB earlier this month. He said he appreciates Wood's soulfulness and musical sensibility.
"He's one of the guys I root for the most. I think he's super-talented, and I really hope he gets to show that talent on a larger stage," Lallouz said. "Although I don't want to lose him from our scene, I just feel he's a really great example of what Asheville has to offer as far as soul and grace and beauty, without superficiality."

Texto completo:   The Appalachian Mountain Club's Maine Woods lodge-to-lodge ski trail network is growing, with Gorman Chairback Lodge and Cabins set to open Jan. 27 in the Moosehead Lakes region.
The off-the-grid solar-powered lodge that was once a Maine sporting camp built in 1867 sits on Long Pond in the 100-Mile Wilderness and becomes the fourth AMC lodge along a rolling network of groomed but untracked trails through the forest and by lakes and mountains.
"At Gorman Chairback there is the lodge-to-lodge ski trail but there is also a stacked loop trail system where you can ski and snowshoe to get out and explore," said AMC spokesman Rob Burbank.
Burbank said there's a mixture of routes, with some on existing roads that had been used for logging and others on newly cut trails. Located in about 66,000 acres of conservation land outside Greenville, there are approximately 70 miles of hiking trails and skiing routes.
Skiers can trek among the remote full-service backcountry lodges: Medawisla, West Branch Pond Camps, Little Lyford, and now Gorman Chairback. The four-lodge ski is approximately 37 miles long, but could be as long as 43 miles depending on the route. There is more information at www.outdoors.org.
Options include having gear shuttled from lodge-to-lodge and traveling among the camps by dogsled. The area is popular with mushers and hosts the 100-Mile Wilderness Sled Dog Race Feb. 5.
"We feel that is significant since we're helping to keep the Maine sporting camp tradition alive and protecting public access to a wonderful piece of the Maine Woods," said Burbank.
Jacobellis milestone
Lindsey Jacobellis of Stratton, Vt., won her third World Snowboard Championship gold medal in snowboardcross Tuesday in La Molina, Spain. The victory ties her with the late Karine Ruby of France for the most World Championship wins.
"It's definitely a great accomplishment to be marked there with Karine," Jacobellis said. "She was definitely someone known in the sport of snowboarding, so it's good to give her that recognition as well."
Maine's Seth Wescott rode to silver on the men's side, followed by US teammate Nate Holland. Australian Alex Pullin was the victor. Jonathan Cheever of Saugus finished a respectable eighth. For the fourth time the US won half of the snowboardcross medals at the championships.
Yesterday, Austria's Benjamin Karl and Russia's Alena Zavarzina were awarded the parallel giant slalom crowns. The halfpipe finals are today.
Scholarships available
Seven snowboarders will receive a total of $11,500 in scholarship funds from the Kelly Clark Foundation to attend mountain schools in pursuit of a snowboarding career.
"Our goal is to break down some of the financial barriers in the expensive sport of snowboarding," said Clark.
Beneficiaries attend Okemo Mountain School, Stratton Mountain School, Mount Snow Academy, Carrabassett Valley Academy, and Steamboat Ski and Snowboard School. Information is available at www.kellyclarkfoundation.org.
The way to go?
Southern New Hampshire's Pats Peak has Saturday bus service from Boston to the Henniker ski area.
There are morning and afternoon options to the ski hill, which has night skiing.
The morning bus picks up between 6:30 and 7:30 from Braintree's South Shore Plaza, Commonwealth Avenue's Warren Towers, and the Ruggles T Station Roundabout.
The afternoon bus departs from the same locations between 11:30 a.m. and 12:30 p.m. Buses leave Pats Peak at 4:30 p.m. and 10:30 p.m. Cost including lift ticket is $59 (www.patspeak.com).
Pair one of a kind
Trapp Family Lodge hosts a pair of unique Nordic races in Vermont this weekend, with a discounted entry for skiers who participate in both events. The XCriterium Freestyle Saturday will feature men's and women's heats that will last approximately 40 minutes each, with two internal sprints announced by a bell at 20 minutes and 30 minutes into the race. Laps will be approximately 1.2 kilometers, and racers will be pulled from the course if they are lapped by the field. Sunday's 3-mile race to local landmark Slayton Pasture Cabin will be followed by a barbecue. Registration starts at 8 a.m. and each day's race goes off at 10 a.m. It's $35 to enter individual races or $50 for both.
Try your luck
It's quite possibly the country's only snow sports championship that could be won by racers with very little experience in the discipline, and the Jan. 28 deadline is looming for the 2011 National Toboggan Championships at Camden Snow Bowl in Maine. The Feb. 11-13 competition at Maine's only toboggan run will feature teams from 2-4 people competing in contests of both speed and creativity, and past events have lured overflow crowds. Register at www.camdensnowbowl.com.
Positively primitive
Wood-frame snowshoes and muzzle-loaded muskets will be blazing at the Smugglers' Notch Primitive Biathlon Jan. 29-30 at Sterling Ridge Inn in Jeffersonville, Vt.
In a throwback test of back-country athletics, racers (some dressed in historic garb) combine trail racing and target shooting over a 2-mile wooded course using old-fashioned equipment and firearms.
Newcomers are invited to participate or watch. Go to www.primitivebiathlon.com for details.
Eating this up
An uphill/downhill evening ski tour combined with a social dinner will be a new addition to this year's Hannes Schneider Meister Cup Race, a weekend-long benefit at Cranmore Mountain Resort for New England Ski Museum. The inaugural Nachtspektakel ("night spectacle") March 11 begins with a 5 p.m. un-timed climb to the summit using Alpine touring or telemark gear. After skiing back down to the base, participants will be greeted with a Tyrolean dinner buffet. Cost is $75, and entrants must have their own skis, skins, and headlamp.
Runs through `River'
Sunday River has "Go50" midweek specials and programs this Monday-Friday aimed at skiers over 50 . . . At Whaleback this Tuesday, seniors (60 and up) get free afternoon lift tickets . . . If you print a Jiminy Peak e-coupon, you can get a $30 twilight or 8-hour ticket this Monday-Thursday . . . Shawnee Peak has a telemark demo day Jan. 29 . . . Tuesdays and Thursdays in January at Okemo mean half-price skiing for US military veterans, fire, police, and ambulance personnel with ID.

Texto completo: BALTIMORE, MD - The NAACP, NAACP New England State Conference and the NAACP Maine Chapter issued the following statement today in response to Maine Governor Paul LePage's inflammatory remarks yesterday:
"Governor LePage's decision to inflame racial tension on the eve of the King Holiday denigrates his office," stated NAACP President and CEO Benjamin Todd Jealous.
"His words are a reminder of the worst aspects of Maine's history and out of touch with our nation's deep yearning for increased civility and racial healing. The NAACP Chapter at the Maine State Prison is a testament to our success in fostering racial healing. If the governor truly looks, he will see it is the largest civic group in the prison with a membership and a leadership that are half black and half white. The NAACP is not a 'special interest group' as Governor LePage assumed, in fact, we are a public interest group and our goal for over 100 years has been to build One America, and One Maine."
"During more than 100 years of struggle for equality, social justice and fairness, the NAACP has faced many obstacles in its proud history of helping to move our great country closer to its' guiding principle of equality and freedom for all," stated Juan M. Cofield, president of the NAACP New England Area Conference.
"It has faced obstinate federal, state and local officials and recalcitrant state and local government entities. So the utterance of Paul LePage, the Maine State Governor, publicly telling the NAACP to "kiss his but" is nothing new for the NAACR It is a throwback to decades ago - and we all had hoped that those attitudes by public officials were behind us. Just a few days ago, President Obama asked that all citizens and public officials become more civil as we engage each other over ideas. The Governor's attitude reflects poorly upon his constituents. We trust that Governor LePage will reflect upon his crude and intolerant language. The citizens of the state of Maine deserve much better. I can promise that the NAACP will continue a determined and assertive struggle in the state of Maine in our quest for equality, social justice and fairness."
"The tone Governor Paul LePage has set just after ten days in office should be an offense to all Mainers and the office he has been entrusted to lead with civility, honesty, and decorum fitting of our highest elected official," stated Rachel Talbot Ross, NAACP Maine State Director.
"The Maine NAACP is very concerned that after several attempts to meet with the Governor, over a period of eight months, coupled with a policy decision that will severely impact our immigrant brothers and sisters made on his very first day in office, that a pattern may be being established of failing to reach out and engage the diverse communities of Maine. The NAACP has taken seriously the commitment Governor Paul LePage made during his inaugural address when he said, 'I am willing to listen and work constructively with anyone committed to honest solutions that benefit all Maine people.' We want to be part of this process and continue to ask for a meeting to begin working in a respectful and transparent manner for the betterment of our state."

Texto completo: MONTPELIER, Vt. An East Coast storm bringing sleet and freezing rain spread into northern New England on Tuesday, sending cars skidding off roads, knocking out power and making ski area managers cross their fingers that snow wouldn't turn to ice at higher elevations.
The storm, which iced over roads all the way down to Delaware and delayed flights for tens of thousands of weather-weary travelers, was expected to drop up to 10 inches of snow before moving out early today.
Up to 6 inches of snow fell across much of New Hampshire before turning to freezing rain late Tuesday afternoon, just in time for the evening commute.
In Maine, the storm brought a mix of snow, sleet and freezing rain. Inland areas could see up to 8 inches of snow before the storm ends, National Weather Service meteorologist Steve Capriola said.
The prospect of rain sent crews in some municipalities rushing to clear snow and ice from storm drains to avoid street flooding followed by freezing.
Ski areas prayed the snow would only add to a strong base on the mountains that's allowing for the opening of tree skiing.
It's really coming around, Killington resort spokesman Tom Horrocks said of the season.
Residents in northern Maine were eager to get the snow to open more cross-country skiing and snowmobile trails.
Utilities were braced for ice: A spokesman for Unitil said the company had 60 crews ready to respond to any downed power lines in New Hampshire and had made arrangements for 50 more backup crews if necessary.
By early evening, the state's largest utility, Public Service Company of New Hampshire, was reporting only about 50 customers without power, all in Bedford.
The storm came less than a week after 2 feet of snow fell in parts of New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and elsewhere along the East Coast.

Resumen: When the reporter asked Mr. LePage to respond to the suggestion that he had a pattern of slighting the N.A.A.C.P., he replied, "Tell them to kiss my butt," adding, "If they want to play the race card, come to dinner; my son will talk to them."

Texto completo: Gov. Paul LePage of Maine directed a graphic insult at the state's N.A.A.C.P. leaders on Friday after they questioned his decision to pass on attending Martin Luther King Birthday events in Bangor and Portland.
Mr. LePage made the remark after The Portland Press Herald reported on Friday that the organization felt slighted by the governor, a Republican who was elected in November.
Leaders of the group's Maine chapters told the newspaper that Mr. LePage had declined several invitations from them in recent months, and they questioned whether he would look out for their interests.
Asked to respond, Mr. LePage, who had a reputation for combativeness on the campaign trail, said he had scheduling conflicts on Monday, when the federal holiday in honor of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. is to be observed. He also said the N.A.A.C.P. officials should "look at my family picture," pointing out that he has an adopted son who is black.
"My son happens to be black, so they can do whatever they'd like about it," he told a reporter for WGME-TV. "The fact of the matter is there's only so many hours in a day, so many hours in a week, and so much that you can do."
When the reporter asked Mr. LePage to respond to the suggestion that he had a pattern of slighting the N.A.A.C.P., he replied, "Tell them to kiss my butt," adding, "If they want to play the race card, come to dinner; my son will talk to them."
Mr. LePage's spokesman, Dan Demeritt, later released a statement reiterating that the governor's decision about the events was not about race. "This is about a special interest group taking issue with the governor for not making time for them," the statement said, "and the governor dismissing their complaints in the direct manner people have come to expect from Paul LePage."
Mr. Demeritt also released the text of a prerecorded radio address, scheduled to air on Saturday, in which Mr. LePage praises Dr. King as someone who "spent and ultimately gave his life making sure that people got a fair shake regardless of race."
During the campaign, Mr. LePage made news when he told a group of fishermen that if elected he would tell President Obama "to go to hell."

On the adjacent Ryder course for age groups 60-64 through 90-older, Fred Gibson of Orlando was low with 65 on eight birdies and a bogey. He was followed at 66 by Jerry Tucker of Stuart, six birdies, and Denny Ford of Indianapolis, seven birdies and a bogey.

Texto completo: NEW YORK Words like unity and shared sacrifice are in. Dire predictions are leavened with a sense of optimism. And residents are called to live up to the legacy of their states' heroes like Connecticut's Eli Whitney, inventor of the cotton gin; the astronauts who blasted into space from Florida; and the pioneers who settled California.
Confronting high unemployment and record deficits, governors are using their inaugural speeches to pledge fiscal austerity, job creation and a broad effort to rebuild public trust in state government.
Thirty-seven governors 23 Republicans, 13 Democrats and one independent were elected or re-elected in November. Most are being sworn in in January and are using the high-profile platform of the inaugural address to describe the perilous fiscal environment they face.
To those who sincerely believe the state budget can be balanced with no tax increase, I say: If you can do so without destroying our schools, hospitals, and public safety, please send me your bill and I will sign it immediately, Minnesota Gov. Mark Dayton, a Democrat, said Monday.
Together, state budget shortfalls are expected to total nearly $140 billion in fiscal year 2012, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a Washington think tank. And while the national unemployment rate is 9.8 percent, many states are faring even worse Nevada's rate is 14.3 percent, Michigan and California are at 12.4 percent, and Rhode Island is stuck at 11.6 percent.
Such dire circumstances will force hard choices on governors, nearly all of whom are required to balance state budgets.
In his inaugural speech, Jerry Brown, a Democrat, referred to Californians' intrepid spirit as he outlined the monumental task ahead: closing a budget deficit estimated at $28 billion over 18 months.
From the native peoples who survived the total transformation of their way of life, to the most recent arrival, stories of courage abound. And it's not over, Brown said.
In Florida, Republican Rick Scott struck a heroic note as well, saying: We have always been the destination of dreamers, the place where someone with a big new idea could give it a try. Railroads in the wilderness, a magic kingdom, a trip to the moon, freedom from a foreign tyrant, better health, life without winter.
Some governors are urging that politics be set aside for the greater good.
Maine's Paul LePage, a Republican popular with tea party activists, noted in his speech that the Maine Constitution never mentions the word politics. And Connecticut's Dannel P. Malloy, a Democrat, said in his address: We will need to solve our problems together by pursuing with great urgency not Republican ideas or Democratic ideas, but good ideas that know no political master or agenda.
To be sure, other governors are setting a more partisan tone.
Republican Sean Parnell of Alaska, whose state receives more assistance from Washington than any other, used his inaugural address last month to decry a federal government bent on expanding its regulatory reach at the cost of freedom and prosperity. He added, Alaskans are hardworking, smart, and we possess something in short supply in Washington common sense.
Arizona Republican Jan Brewer accused President Barack Obama and her Democratic predecessor, current Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano, of causing Arizona's problems.
I took the helm of a marvelous state that had been poorly commanded ... and dead in the water, Brewer said Monday. And a federal government whose unfunded mandates and sweetheart deals were stealing Arizona's freedom and threatening to bankrupt our state.
While some governors hinted they may have no choice but to raise taxes, several others restated their opposition to increases.
After he was sworn in Saturday, Democratic New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo declared: This state has no future if it is going to be the tax capital of the nation. Florida's Scott, a truck driver's son who made his fortune in the health care industry and spent more than $60 million of his own money to get elected, vowed to cut taxes to spur job creation. Taxation, regulation and litigation. Together those three form the axis of unemployment, he said.
In Rhode Island, independent Gov. Lincoln Chafee embraced gay marriage in his inaugural speech a sharp departure from most other governors, who have steered clear of social issues in these tough times.
Most governors tried to strike an upbeat tone as they described the daunting challenges to come.
Republican Gov. Brian Sandoval called himself proudly optimistic as he took the oath Monday in Nevada, which has the highest unemployment rate of any state and leads the nation in home foreclosures.
Costas Panagopoulos, a political scientist at New York's Fordham University, said what while governors are trying to manage people's expectations about what government can do in tough economic times, it is essential for them to start their terms on a high note.
Talking about how great their states are, how wonderful their people are, plays an important psychological function, Panagopoulos said. They're trying to remind people there's a silver lining and they shouldn't lose sight of that even in tough times.
Associated Press Writers Glenn Adams in Augusta, Maine, Brendan Farrington in Tallahassee, Fla., Susan Haigh in Hartford, Conn., Juliet Williams in Sacramento, Calif., and Michelle R. Smith in Providence, R.I., contributed to this report.

Arizona Republican Jan Brewer accused President Barack Obama and her Democratic predecessor, current Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano, of causing Arizona's problems.
I took the helm of a marvelous state that had been poorly commanded ... and dead in the water, Brewer said Monday. And a federal government whose unfunded mandates and sweetheart deals were stealing Arizona's freedom and threatening to bankrupt our state.
While some governors hinted they may have no choice but to raise taxes, several others restated their opposition to increases.
After he was sworn in Saturday, Democratic New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo declared: This state has no future if it is going to be the tax capital of the nation. Florida's Scott, a truck driver's son who made his fortune in the health care industry and spent more than $60 million of his own money to get elected, vowed to cut taxes to spur job creation. Taxation, regulation and litigation. Together those three form the axis of unemployment, he said.
In Rhode Island, independent Gov. Lincoln Chafee embraced gay marriage in his inaugural speech a sharp departure from most other governors, who have steered clear of social issues in these tough times.
Most governors tried to strike an upbeat tone as they described the daunting challenges to come.
Republican Gov. Brian Sandoval called himself proudly optimistic as he took the oath Monday in Nevada, which has the highest unemployment rate of any state and leads the nation in home foreclosures.
Costas Panagopoulos, a political scientist at New York's Fordham University, said what while governors are trying to manage people's expectations about what government can do in tough economic times, it is essential for them to start their terms on a high note.
Talking about how great their states are, how wonderful their people are, plays an important psychological function, Panagopoulos said. They're trying to remind people there's a silver lining and they shouldn't lose sight of that even in tough times.

Texto completo: Runners who register online for the Spring Training Classic 10K set for Sunday, March 6, in Jupiter, also can purchase reduced-price tickets to the spring training game between the Florida Marlins and St. Louis Cardinals later that day.
Online registration is now open for the second annual Spring Training Classic 10K (www.springtraining10k.com), which begins and ends at Roger Dean Stadium spring training home of the Marlins and Cardinals.
The 6.2-mile race begins at 7:30 a.m. adjacent to the stadium and winds through the streets of seven different Abacoa neighborhoods before taking runners on a victory lap around the outfield and ending at home plate.
A course map and description of the route, plus a link to online registration, can be found on the race's website.
Also, a Cops n Kids Fun Run will take place at the stadium at 6 p.m. along with a Health Expo from 4-8 p.m on Saturday, March. 5. Proceeds from the race will benefit the Cardinals/Marlins Fund and the DMSE Children's Foundation.
Runners who register for the race online will have the opportunity to purchase either one or two tickets to the ballgame on race day at $10 a ticket, while supplies last. The race entry fee is $30 in advance online and $35 at the Expo on Saturday and Sunday. Race organizers are including the special game-day package to support runners who want to stay for the game.
This is kind of a neat opportunity for runners to take part in the race in the morning, finishing at home plate inside the stadium, and then stick around to relax and enjoy the ballgame. Now that sounds like a good day, said race director Dave McGillivray of DMSE Sports, who also directs the BAA Boston Marathon, TD Bank Beach to Beacon 10K in Maine and a number of other road race events around the country.
Sponsors of the Spring Training 10K include the Marlins, the Cardinals, Roger Dean Stadium, DMSE Sports, Inc. (www.dmsesports.com) and GoRun.org (www.gorun.org).
The Cardinals/Marlins Fund supports the development of programs for disadvantaged youth in South Florida.
In affiliation with Community Foundations of Palm Beach and Martin counties, the Cardinals/Marlins Fund has contributed more than $173,000 to area youth groups since its inception in 1988, including Boynton Beach Police Athletic League, Children's Golf Foundation, Junior Achievement, JTAA, Palm Beach Police Athletic League and Urban Youth Impact.
The Cardinals/ Marlins Fund will be hosting a silent auction during the game in the concourse. For more information, visit www.RogerDeanStadium.com/community/fund.
The race will also benefit a new program for public school students provided by the DMSE Children's Fitness Foundation, founded in 2003 by McGillivray. Running in Places (RIP) combines the benefits of physical activity with visits to educational destinations such as college campuses, museums, sports facilities and national parks.
The DMSE Foundation covers the costs of student transportation, lunch and admission fees for all RIP events. For more information on RIP, contact the DMSE Foundation at 978-689-0957 or visit online at www.dmsefoundation.org
Founded by McGillivray in 1981, DMSE Sports, Inc. is a leader in sports event management, specializing in creating, marketing and producing mass participatory athletic events throughout the U.S. and abroad. McGillivray has produced or consulted on more than 900 mass-participatory athletic events throughout the world, including 23 Boston Marathons; the TD Bank Beach to Beacon 10K in Maine; the 2004 and 2008 USA Women's Olympic Marathon Trials, the 1990 Triathlon World Championship, the 1998 Goodwill Games Triathlon, and the 1996 Atlanta Olympic Games.

Texto completo: DOVER-FOXCROFT - The hazardous waste cleanup of two Dover-Foxcroft mill properties is pegged to cost more than $1 million.
Only a couple of residents attended a public hearing held by Dover-Foxcroft selectmen Wednesday to hear details of the planned hazardous waste abatement at the former Moosehead Manufacturing Co. plant and the former Maine Leathers property.
Final plans for the projects will be decided after the public comment period ends Jan. 24.
Since the federal Environmental Protection Agency is involved in both projects, a historic review of the properties must be conducted under the National Historic Preservation Act. The act requires the EPA to identify any historic properties that may be affected by operations and to take those historic properties into consideration during permitting.
Ransom Environmental Consultants Inc. of Portland conducted an assessment of the contaminants on both properties. Its work was funded by a grant obtained through the Piscataquis County Economic Development Council.
"That's kind of how we got to the point of being able to identify these sites, what's there, and what needs to be done," Dover-Foxcroft Town Manager Jack Clukey said Wednesday.
The assessment revealed asbestos, lead-based paint, universal waste and mold-contaminated building materials at the former Moosehead plant. The plant, which was tax-acquired and was deeded by the town to Pine Crest Development Corp., is being considered for multiuse development by a Kansas firm.
Maine Department of Environmental Protection officials believe the best option for the former Moosehead plant is the full abatement of asbestos, universal waste and the mold, and a partial abatement of the lead-based paint. Because the lead is in good condition in some areas of the mill, it has been recommended that those areas be encapsulated. The estimated project cost is $520,000, which requires a 20 percent local match.
Clukey said the town was awarded two $200,000 brownfields grants for the Moosehead project. The match will be provided through a Community Development Block Grant, so no local property tax dollars will be needed, according to Clukey.
Bids for the Moosehead work will be solicited in the spring, and the work will begin in the next construction season.
At the former Maine Leathers plant, a former woolen mill and tannery, consultants and previous studies found metals in sludge in and around pits and lagoons on the eastern portion of the property along the Piscataquis River. The property where the hazardous materials are located formerly was owned by Charles MacArthur and is now town-owned.
"We've assessed it pretty well," Hank Andolsek, a DEP environmental hydrogeologist, said Wednesday.
Tests have indicated that the lead, the contaminant of concern, has not migrated from the sludge to the groundwater and toward the river, but the DEP believes the material should be removed. Department officials and the consultants believe the most cost-effective option is to dig up the contaminated material and move it to pits farther back on the property, outside of the 100-year flood plain. The material then will be covered so the property can be used by the town. The actual construction on the 3- to 5-acre parcel will take up to three months.
"We just cover it and move on," Andolsek said.
Former property owner MacArthur, who attended the meeting and who believed bioremediation would be better for the site, said, "I hope you're right."
"I believe we are. ... It's an effective measure," Andolsek replied of the preferred option.
The project is expected to cost about $500,000. The town has been awarded $600,000 in brownfields grants for the project. The town will provide the fill materials as the local match, Clukey said.

Texto completo: SOUTHWEST HARBOR - An official with The Hinckley Co. confirmed Tuesday morning that the yacht manufacturer has been sold, but declined to release any further details.
"The company has in fact been sold," Phil Bennett, the company's vice president for sales, told the Bangor Daily News. "It's something we're excited about."
Bennett declined to provide any additional information about the sale, however. He said the company is expected to issue a press release about the sale on Wednesday, Jan. 5.
Hinckley was founded in Southwest Harbor in 1928, according to information posted on the company's website at www.hinckleyyachts.com. In the years since, the company expanded to include offices in Florida, Georgia, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey and Rhode Island.
In 1998, it opened a new manufacturing facility off Route 3 in Trenton. Over the past two years, the sagging economy has prompted the firm to lay off approximately 90 people at its Trenton plant, but company officials said in October 2009 they intended to rehire between 30 and 40 craftspeople in Trenton.
In 2002, the company employed more than 700 people, approximately 500 of whom worked in Maine. Between 200 and 300 people are believed to have worked at the Trenton facility in the early 2000s. The firm now is believed to employ roughly 200 people in Maine.
Known for building both luxury power and sailing yachts, Hinckley is in the process of beginning production of a new power yacht model, the Talaria 48.

Texto completo: NEW YORK (AP) An arctic blast from Canada is responsible for some of the frigid temperatures in the northern U.S. and some of the coldest air to hit the Northeast in two years.
Temperatures were projected to fall well below zero across New England on Sunday night as a high-pressure area builds over the
region.
The coldest spots will dip to less than 30 degrees below zero, with the wind chill expected to drop to 51 below zero in some places.
"This is the coldest air we've had in about two years," said Michael Hill, a weather service meteorologist in Caribou, Maine.
Emergency management agencies are urging residents to bundle up and heat their homes safely during the cold snap.
Shelters are preparing for an increase in the number of people wanting to get out of the cold, and authorities in Maine and Pennsylvania waived restrictions on heating oil delivery.
Northern New England is used to cold winters; a remote site in northern Maine recorded a minus 50 reading on Jan. 16, 2009, that tied a 1933 record set in Vermont for the coldest temperature recorded in New England.
But last year's relatively warm winter provided a respite from the dangerously cold temperatures that are being forecast for early this week. Temperatures are
expected to rise some-
what Tuesday before reaching seasonable levels Wednesday.
Though a high of 24 degrees was forecast for New York's Central Park on Sunday, wind chills made daytime temperatures feel more like 3 to 7 degrees above zero.
The National Weather Service predicted a high of 19 today, meteorologist Joe Pollina said.
That's the coldest it's been in New York City since Jan. 16, 2009, when the high was 16.
In Philadelphia, the city extended an alert issued Thursday that gives officials the power to go out onto the streets and bring in homeless people to shelters because the weather conditions pose a threat of serious harm or death.
About 90 miles northwest of Philadelphia, a man died after spending the night in his car in frigid temperatures in Lansford, and his wife found him Saturday morning.
